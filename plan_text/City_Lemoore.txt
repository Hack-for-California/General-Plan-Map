Chapter 1.                        Introduction
  A. Planning Context
Kings County is located within the agriculturally rich San Joaquin Valley, with Fresno County to the
north and west, Tulare County to the east, and Kern County to the south. Created in 1893, Kings County
was carved from the western portion of Tulare County and later added another 100 square miles from
Fresno County. The Kings River, from which the County derives its name, runs along the northern edges
and flows south towards the center of the County. Historically, this river flowed farther south to what was
once Tulare Lake. Now referred to as the Tulare Lake Basin, this area is extensively used for agricultural
crop production.
Kings County is comprised of four cities (Avenal, Corcoran, Hanford, and Lemoore), four unincorporated
community service areas (Armona, Home Garden, Kettleman City, and Stratford), and a few other smaller
community pockets. According to the California Department of Finance, approximately 150,000 people
lived in Kings County as of January 2015, with approximately 13,500 of those housed within the three
state prison facilities. The Lemoore Naval Air Station houses approximately 4,900 naval personnel and
dependents in approximately 1,630 housing units, while the Santa Rosa Rancheria is home to about 500
Tachi Yokut Indians on 1,535 acres of tribal land.
Access through the County and to other major outside destinations is provided by a network of highways
and railroads. While Interstate 5 and State Route 99 provide routes to the Los Angeles and San Francisco
Bay metropolitan areas, State Route 41 connects the valley with the Central Coast and Yosemite National
Park. State Route 198 provides access to Sequoia National Park. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe
Railroad connects Kings County to Sacramento and Bakersfield while the San Joaquin Valley Railroad
connects to Huron to the west and Visalia and Porterville to the east. The County’s transportation network
has played a key role in its economic development. Agriculture remains the predominant landscape of
Kings County, with approximately 84% of its land area used for agriculture. While dairy products are the
County’s leading commodity, the agricultural industry is diversified with cotton, cattle, field crops, seeds,
fruit & nuts, vegetables, apiary products, livestock & poultry, and other related products also having a
significant presence.
As Kings County begins the 2016-2024 planning period, California is in its fourth consecutive year of
drought conditions and water supply is expected to continue to be a serious challenge for both urban and
agricultural users.

  B. Methodology
1.       Purpose and Statutory Authority
The Housing Element is mandated by §§65580-65589 of the California Government Code. State Housing
Element law requires that each city and county identify and analyze existing and projected housing needs
within their jurisdiction and prepare goals, policies, programs and quantified objectives to further the
development, improvement, and preservation of housing. To that end, state law requires that the housing
element:
         •      Identify adequate sites to facilitate and encourage the development, maintenance and
                improvement of housing for households of all economic levels, including persons with
                special needs;
         •      Remove, as legally feasible and appropriate, governmental constraints to the production,
                maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons of all income levels;
         •      Assist in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs of low- and moderate-
                income households;
         •      Conserve and improve the condition of housing and neighborhoods, including existing
                affordable housing;
         •      Promote equal housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race, religion, sex,
                marital status, ancestry, national origin, color, familial status, or disability; and
         •      Preserve lower-income publicly-assisted housing developments within each community.
The Housing Element is organized into the following major sections:
         •      Analysis of the demographic, housing, and special needs characteristics and trends in Kings
                County jurisdictions (Chapter 2).
         •      Analysis of land, financial, and organizational resources available to address the housing
                goals in Kings County (Chapter 3).
         •      Review of potential market, governmental, and environmental constraints that affect Kings
                County jurisdictions’ ability to address their housing needs (Chapter 4).
         •      The Housing Plan to address identified housing needs, including housing goals, policies
                and programs (Chapter 5).
         •      Evaluation of each jurisdiction’s accomplishments toward meeting the goals and objectives
                set forth in the previous Housing Element (Appendix A).
         •      A detailed land inventory of suitable sites for housing development (Appendix B).
2.       Framework for the Joint Kings County Housing Element
In California, it is typical for each city or county to prepare and maintain its own General Plan and
housing element. However, in Kings County the four cities and the County have chosen to collectively
Kings County and Cities of                             1-3                                               2016-2024
Avenal, Corcoran, Hanford and Lemoore                                                               Housing Element

Chapter 1. Introduction
prepare a joint Countywide housing element with administrative support from the Kings County
Community Development Agency. While unusual, this collaborative approach to the housing element has
a number of advantages, including the following:
         •      Over the past several decades, the trend in dealing with complex public policy issues has
                been toward a regional approach to problem-solving. Existing housing element law
                embodies this principle through the regional housing needs allocation (RHNA) process.
                Perhaps the most recent and far-reaching example of this regional approach is Senate Bill
                375, the landmark global warming legislation. SB 375 establishes a framework for regional
                planning and “Sustainable Communities Strategies” intended to reduce greenhouse gas
                emissions through land use, housing and transportation policies.
         •      Housing markets are regional in nature and do not stop at jurisdictional boundaries.
                Coordinated regional strategies offer the potential to be more effective in addressing
                housing needs than when each jurisdiction operates individually.
         •      In difficult economic times such as these, economies of scale accruing from shared
                resources can result in significant cost savings to jurisdictions that jointly prepare housing
                elements.
3.       Data Sources
In preparing the Housing Element, various sources of information were consulted. The 2010 decennial
Census and the annual American Community Survey updates were used as the primary sources of
demographic information. However, other sources supplemented the Census data where available and
relevant, including the following:
         •      Housing conditions surveys conducted by the jurisdictions;
         •      Population and housing data from the California Department of Finance (DOF);
         •      Employment data from the California Employment Development Department (EDD);
         •      Local economic data from the Kings County Economic Development Corporation;
         •      Housing market data from the Kings County Board of Realtors;
         •      Population and housing characteristics from Naval Air Station Lemoore;
         •      Point-in-time homeless data provided by Kings/Tulare Continuum of Care;
         •      Land use data based on the General Plans and zoning ordinances of each jurisdiction; and
         •      Regional housing needs information prepared by the Kings County Association of
                Governments.
4.       Relationship to the General Plans
State law requires that the Housing Element be consistent with other elements of jurisdictions’ General
Plans. Policies and programs set forth in this Housing Element are consistent with policies and programs
in other elements of the respective General Plans. However, if during the implementation of this Housing
Element any inconsistencies with other portions of the General Plans are identified, appropriate
amendments to maintain internal consistency will be proposed. For example, Government Code Sec.
2016-2024                                             1-4                               Kings County and Cities of
Housing Element                                                             Avenal, Corcoran, Hanford and Lemoore

                                                                            C.    Community Involvement
65302.1 requires jurisdictions within the San Joaquin Valley to include in appropriate elements of the
General Plan analysis, policies and feasible implementation measures to improve air quality. This
Housing Element supports this provision of state law through its identification of sites for development of
a variety of housing types in appropriate locations consistent with the regional growth forecast, regional
housing needs plan, and regional transportation plans.
Government Code Sec. 65302 requires amendments to the Safety and Conservation elements to include
analysis and policies regarding flood hazard and management information upon the next revision of the
Housing Element after January 1, 2009. Sec. 65302.10 also requires each jurisdiction to amend the Land
Use Element to identify unincorporated island, fringe, or legacy communities inside or near its boundaries
upon each revision of the Housing Element. If necessary, amendments to those elements will be
processed in order to maintain consistency between elements.
  C. Community Involvement
State law requires local governments to make a diligent effort to achieve public participation of all
economic segments of the community in the development of the housing element. To that end, each
jurisdiction has provided opportunities for residents, interested parties, and local officials to participate in
the update process and offer recommendations regarding housing needs and strategies to address those
needs.
The public participation process for this Housing Element involved four major stages:
       1.    Public workshops and meetings in each of the four cities and the unincorporated County during
             the preparation of the Draft Housing Element;
       2.    Publication of the Draft Housing Element and subsequent review by the California Department
             of Housing and Community Development (HCD);
       3.    Revisions to the Housing Element to address comments from HCD and publication of a revised
             Draft Housing Element;
       4.    Public hearings before the Planning Commission and City Council of each city and the Planning
             Commission and Board of Supervisors of Kings County prior to adoption of the final Housing
             Element.

Chapter 2.                         Housing Needs Assessment
The availability of decent and affordable housing for residents
is an important housing goal. To accomplish this goal, a
comprehensive assessment of housing needs provides the basis
for developing responsive policies and programs. This chapter
presents and analyzes demographic, economic, and housing
characteristics and their impact upon housing needs in the
cities of Avenal, Corcoran, Hanford, and Lemoore and
unincorporated Kings County. The Housing Plan (Chapter 5)
provides the policies and strategies to address identified
housing needs.
  A. Population and Household Characteristics
Housing needs in Kings County are largely determined by population and employment growth, coupled
with various demographic variables. Characteristics such as age, household size, occupation, and income
combine to influence the type of housing needed and its affordability.
1.       Population Trends
Kings County is comprised of

During the past 25 years, Hanford has seen the largest population increase with about 57% of Kings
County’s total growth. Lemoore also experienced substantial growth during this period, with a population
increase of 86%. Avenal and Corcoran saw population increases of about 65% and 52%, respectively,
during the 1990-2015 time period. The unincorporated county has experienced a small decline in
population since 1990.

Chapter 2. Housing Needs Assessment
According to DOF 1, Kings County’s household population (i.e., excluding group quarters) is projected to
reach approximately 167,000 by the year 2030, a gain of about 25% over 2015 levels.
2.       Age Characteristics
Although population growth strongly affects total demand for new housing, housing needs are also
influenced by age characteristics. Typically, different age groups have distinct lifestyles, family
characteristics, incomes, and housing preferences. As people move through each stage of life, their
housing needs and preferences also change. Age characteristics are therefore important in planning for the
changing housing needs of residents.
Coupled with housing prices, the homeownership rate is related to householder age. Homeownership rates
tend to increase with the age and income of the householder.
Housing needs often differ by age group. For instance, most young adults (under 34) are single or starting
families. Housing needs for younger adults are addressed through apartments or first-time
homeownership opportunities. Middle-aged residents (34-64) may already be homeowners, are usually in
their prime earning years and have dependents living at home, and thus tend to seek larger homes. Seniors
often own a home but, due to limited income or disabilities, may need assistance to remain in their homes.
As life expectancies increase, the 65+ age group is projected to be the fastest-growing population
segment, resulting in increasing need for assisted living and care facilities.
As shown in Table 2-2, Corcoran has the lowest percentage of children while Hanford has the highest
percentage of seniors age 65+.

4.        Household Type and Overcrowding
A household refers to the people occupying a home, such as a family, a single person, or unrelated
persons living together. Families often prefer single-family homes or condominiums to accommodate
children, while single persons generally occupy smaller apartments or condominiums. Single-person
households often include seniors or young adults.
Table 2-4 displays household composition by community as reported by the Census ACS. Families
comprised approximately 77% of all households within Kings County. Countywide, the proportion of
single households was approximately 18%. However, the percentage of single households varied by
location. The cities of Hanford (20.5%) and Lemoore (19.5%) had the highest percentage of single-person
households.
As noted earlier, Kings County has a significant population of people living in group quarters who are not
counted as households. Avenal and Corcoran State Prisons are counted in the total population figures, but
are not counted as households. The same is true for persons living on-base at Naval Air Station Lemoore.

Chapter 2. Housing Needs Assessment
Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The U.S. Census
Bureau considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than one person per room, excluding
bathrooms and kitchens; and to be severely overcrowded when there are more than 1.5 occupants per
room. Overcrowded households are usually a reflection of the lack of adequate income for housing.
Table 2-5 details the percentage of households that live in overcrowded situations. Overcrowding is more
prevalent among renters than owners. Avenal showed the highest rate of overcrowding, with over 23% of
renters and 8% of owners reporting more than one person per room. About 18% of Corcoran renters
reported overcrowding or severe overcrowding.

5.       Household Income and Overpayment
Along with housing prices and rents, household
income is the most important factor affecting                 Table 2-6

The median household income for the entire
County was reported as $48,133. Hanford and Lemoore had the highest median household incomes at
approximately $52,600 and $53,700, respectively. This is likely due to the larger proportion of these
cities’ workforces with “white-collar” jobs.

                                                                A.     Population and Household Characteristics
Avenal and Corcoran had median households below the County average, at $28,794 and $32,914,
respectively. In both communities, a larger proportion of the workforce held “blue-collar” jobs such as
farming, construction, extraction, manufacturing, production, transportation, and material moving.
Although median household income is a common benchmark for comparison, the distribution of
household income also provides a useful measure of housing needs in a community. In housing analysis,
households are typically grouped into categories, expressed relative to the Area Median Income (AMI)
and adjusted for family size. Using State of California income thresholds, the income groups analyzed
were as follows:
         •      Extremely low income: Up to 30% of AMI
         •      Very low income: 31-50% of AMI
         •      Low income: 51-80% of AMI
         •      Moderate income: 81-120% of AMI
         •      Upper income: Above 120% of AMI
Table 2-7 estimates the number of households within each income category in each jurisdiction as
reported in HUD Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data based on the 2007-2011
Census ACS. In comparison to other cities, Avenal and Corcoran had the highest percentage of
extremely-low-, very-low- and low-income households. Countywide, 43% of all households had
extremely-low, very-low and low incomes. Hanford and Lemoore had the highest proportion of residents
with moderate and above-moderate incomes.
Extremely Low Income Households
In 2006 state law was amended (Assembly Bill 2634) to add the Extremely-Low-Income (ELI) category
(up to 30% AMI) to the required analysis of household characteristics and housing growth needs. Due to
their limited incomes, these households have the greatest difficulty finding suitable housing at an
affordable price. Further discussion of housing costs and affordability, as well as housing growth needs
by income category is provided later in this chapter.

Chapter 2. Housing Needs Assessment
Housing Overpayment
State and federal housing law defines overpayment as a household paying more than 30% of gross income
for housing expenses, including utilities. Housing overpayment is especially problematic for lower-
income households that have limited resources for other living expenses.
As shown in Table 2-8, a significant portion of lower-income households in each community overpaid for
housing according to HUD CHAS data (special tabulations based on the Census ACS). However, the
overpayment rate varied by tenure and income level. More than half of all very-low- and extremely-low-
income households in all jurisdictions, both owners and renters, were reported to be overpaying. In most
communities, however, more renter households than owner households were overpaying. Few households
with incomes above the median faced overpayment – often less than 10% of households.

  B. Employment Trends
Kings County’s economy has an important impact on housing needs. Employment growth typically
results in increased housing demand in areas that serve as regional employment centers. Moreover, the
type of occupation and income levels for new employment also affects housing demand. This section
describes the economic and employment patterns in Kings County and how these patterns influence
housing needs.
1.       Employment by Industry
Kings County supports a diversified economy as shown in Figure 2. Government represents the largest
sector (due in large part to state prisons) and provided 33% of all jobs in the County as of 2013.
Agriculture represented 15% of jobs, while Education & Health and Transportation & Public Utilities
each provided 13% of employment.

In August 2014, the Kings County’s civilian labor force was approximately 59,500, with an
unemployment rate of 10.6% (not seasonally adjusted). In reviewing the annual data for 2013, Kings
County had 60,000 people in its labor force and an unemployment rate of 13.5%. In comparing the
County unemployment rate to California, the August 2014 rate was 7.4% and 8.9% for the annual average
for 2013. Historically, agriculture and government have dominated Kings County’s economy.
Agriculturally-oriented counties tend to have higher unemployment rates and greater seasonal variations
in unemployment. Kings County is ranked 8th among California counties in agricultural production.
According to the Kings County 2013 Annual Agricultural Crop Report, milk remains the county’s leading
commodity, followed by cotton (second) and cattle (third). With the entire state in a severe drought, it is
uncertain to what extent future water supplies will affect agricultural employment.

2.        Occupations Held by Residents
Occupations held by residents determine the income earned by a household and their corresponding
ability to afford housing. Higher paying jobs provide broader housing opportunities for residents, while
lower-paying jobs limit housing options. Understanding employment and occupation patterns can thus
provide insight into present housing needs. Table 2-14 describes the number and type of jobs held by
residents in each community based on recent Census estimates.

Chapter 2. Housing Needs Assessment
In Hanford and Lemoore, a higher proportion of residents held managerial, business or financial related
employment. These types of “white-collar” jobs typically pay higher salaries and thus allow residents to
afford a greater choice of housing opportunities. However, service occupations, sales/office positions, and
“blue-collar” positions typically pay relatively lower wages. Residents in these occupations have more
limited ability to afford housing and, in some cases, are in the greatest need of affordable housing and
assistance.
3.       Jobs-Housing Balance and Commute Patterns
Commuting patterns in Kings County have an important implication for housing needs. Larger employers
in the County (e.g., three state prisons, Naval Air Station Lemoore, and agricultural industries) generate a
significant number of jobs. However, the workforce employed at these institutions or in the agricultural
industries may live in other communities for a variety of reasons, including preferences, the availability of
suitable housing, or other reasons.
Commuting patterns show the relationship between where people live and where they work. Long
commuting distances increase traffic congestion that strains the existing overcrowded road and highways
infrastructure systems that are often in need of maintenance. Long commuting distances also contributes
to poor air quality, increases expenses to the commuting workforce, and has been shown to have negative
consequences on personal health. One of the aims of the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA)
Plan is to direct new housing growth to employment centers in order to balance the jobs-housing ratio and
decrease commuting distances.
The table below details the workforce that resides within the Kings County region. Roughly 80% of the
approximate 54,000-person workforce stays within the Kings County area for employment. The
remaining workforce is employed outside the County, with less than 1% working outside the State (see
Table 2-15).

When considering the work locations of city residents within the Kings County region as illustrated in
Table 2-16, the City of Hanford has the largest concentration of workers at 45.5% that live and work
within their jurisdictional limits. As the largest jurisdiction in the Kings County region, the City of
Hanford has the lowest proportion of residents at 54.4% who commute to jobs elsewhere in Kings
County. The City of Avenal has the largest proportion of residents who commute to jobs outside of their
home city at 76.6%, followed closely by the City of Lemoore at 69.6%. According to recent Census
estimates, 38% of residents work in their city of residence, with 62% commuting to other work locations
in Kings County. Interestingly, this is a shift from the 2000 Census data, where 48% of residents worked
in their home city and 36% commuted to work elsewhere in Kings County.
When considering work locations of residents in Kings County, the jobs-housing balance can be explored.
The jobs-housing balance refers to the approximate distribution of employment opportunities and
workforce population in respect to a geographic area. Research has shown that a jobs-housing balanced
area is less likely to have residents who commute long distances in a vehicle. Residents may also be more

likely to walk, cycle, or use public transportation when there is a balanced jobs-housing ratio. There is a
general consensus that a balance of jobs to housing within an area can contribute to more sustainable
travel in the form of shorter work trip distances. In looking at job locations and travel patterns in the
Kings County region, the City of Hanford has the most balanced jobs-housing ratio or the most
opportunities for residents to live near their place of employment.

  C. Housing Characteristics
This section describes the housing characteristics and
conditions that affect housing needs in Kings County.
Important housing stock characteristics include housing type,
tenure, vacancy rates, age, condition, cost and affordability.
1.       Housing Type
The California Department of Finance (DOF) provides annual
estimates of the number of housing units by type for each
jurisdiction based on reported building and demolition permits.
DOF estimated that Kings County had a total of 44,888
housing units in 2015, representing a growth of 1,021 new
units (2%) countywide since 2010. As is typical in small towns
and rural areas, the majority of housing stock in all jurisdictions is comprised of single-family detached
houses. Single-family attached (condominium) units represent just 4.9% of all units countywide.
Approximately 18% of the county’s housing stock consisted of multi-family projects, such as apartments
and townhomes. The remaining 4.4% of housing units in Kings County were mobile and manufactured
homes. As shown in Table 2-17, Avenal had the highest total percentage of multi-family units while
Lemoore had the highest proportion of larger multi-family developments with five or more units.
Unincorporated areas had the highest percentage of mobile homes.

2.       Housing Tenure and Vacancy Rates
Housing tenure (owner vs. renter) influences several aspects of the local housing market. Residential
mobility is influenced by tenure, with ownership housing evidencing a lower turnover rate than rental
housing. The vacancy rate also indicates the match between the demand and supply of housing. Table 2-
18 details housing tenure and vacancies in Kings County and incorporated communities according to the
2010 Census. Vacancy rates of 5% to 6% for rental housing and 1.5% to 2.0% for ownership housing are
generally considered to be optimum. A higher vacancy rate may indicate an excess supply of units, a
softer market, and result in lower housing prices. A lower vacancy rate may indicate a shortage of
housing and high competition for available housing, which generally leads to higher housing prices and
diminished affordability.

          According to the Census, the housing vacancy rate in Kings County totaled 2.0% among for-sale units
          and 5.3% for rental units. However, the vacancy rate varied among communities. Corcoran had the
          highest rental vacancy rate at 11.8% yet the lowest vacancy rate among for-sale units at 1.7%. Avenal had
          the highest vacancy rates among for-sale units (2.9%). Hanford and Lemoore had the highest
          homeownership rates, at 55% and 50% respectively.
          3.         Housing Conditions
          Housing conditions are an important indicator of quality of life in Kings County communities. Like any
          asset, housing ages and deteriorates over time. If not regularly maintained, structures can deteriorate and
          discourage reinvestment, depress neighborhood property values, and even become health hazards. Thus
          maintaining and improving housing quality is an important goal for communities.
          Housing age can be an indicator of the need for housing rehabilitation. As shown in Table 2-19, recent
          Census estimates reported that over half of all housing in Kings County has been built since 1980,
          reflecting the significant housing growth in recent decades. Approximately 49% of the homes
          Countywide exceeded 35 years of age.
          Most homes require increased maintenance after 30 years. Common repairs include a new roof, painting,
          plumbing, appliances and fixtures. Homes older than 50 years often require more substantial repairs (e.g.,
          new siding, plumbing, or upgrades to electrical systems) in order to maintain the useful life and quality of
          the structure. Moreover, lead-based paint hazards are also more common in homes built before 1978 and
          particularly for homes built more than 50 years ago.

          As part of the 2010 Housing Element update process, each jurisdiction in Kings County conducted a
          comprehensive survey of housing conditions within their community. The surveys were based upon
          criteria developed by the California Department of Housing and Community Development. Housing was
          classified according to five categories – sound, minor repair, moderate repair, substantial repair, or
          dilapidated. Table 2-20 summarizes the results of these housing conditions surveys. Housing conditions
          do not appear to have changed significantly since those surveys were conducted.

Lemoore found the fewest problems, with 82% of the housing stock reported in sound condition. This is
not surprising since Lemoore also has the newest housing stock. Hanford reported about three-quarters of
its housing stock in sound condition. Avenal and Corcoran reported the highest proportions of structures
with problems. In Avenal, 42% were in need of repair (minor, moderate or substantial) and 9% were
considered dilapidated. In Corcoran, 55% of homes required repairs and 8% were dilapidated.
The housing plans for each of the jurisdictions include programs to improve housing conditions by
providing grants or loans to assist low- and moderate-income households with housing repairs and
rehabilitation. However, because funding for these programs has been reduced due to the statewide
dissolution of redevelopment agencies, other funding sources must be found.

4.         Housing Affordability
State law establishes five income categories for purposes of housing programs based on the area (i.e.,
County) median income (“AMI”): extremely-low (30% or less of AMI), very-low (31-50% of AMI), low
(51-80% of AMI), moderate (81-120% of AMI) and above-moderate (over 120% of AMI). Housing
affordability is based on the relationship between household income and housing expenses. According to
HUD and the California Department of Housing and Community Development 2, housing is considered
“affordable” if the monthly housing cost (including utilities) is no more than 30% of a household’s gross
income.
Table 2-21 shows current (2015) affordable rent levels and estimated affordable purchase prices for
jurisdictions in Kings County by income category. Based on state-adopted standards, the maximum
affordable monthly rent for extremely-low-income households is $606, while the maximum affordable
rent for very-low-income households is $724. The maximum affordable rent for low-income households
is $1,158, while the maximum for moderate-income households is $1,738. Maximum purchase prices are
more difficult to determine due to variations in mortgage interest rates and qualifying procedures, down
payments, special tax assessments, homeowner association fees, property insurance rates, etc. With this
caveat, the maximum home purchase prices by income category shown in Table 2-21 have been estimated
based on typical conditions in Kings County.

           a.       Housing Prices
Recent             new            home
developments in Kings County
(Table 2-22) had sales prices
ranging          from        $190,000
$350,000. Comparing these
new home sales prices with the
affordability categories shown
in Table 2-21 above shows that
most         new        single-family
detached homes were priced
within the moderate-income
range, although some new
homes were within the low-
income affordability range.

single-family homes (Table 2-                                                Copper Valley - Hanford
23) show that most asking
prices are in the lower-income range in Avenal, Corcoran and the unincorporated areas of the County and
in the moderate and above-moderate categories in Hanford and Lemoore.

A relatively small but important component of the housing market is represented by mobile homes. As of
2015, Kings County had approximately 2,000 mobile homes, located primarily in unincorporated, rural
areas. Typical sales prices for new mobile homes range from approximately $24,000 for a small (600 to
800 square feet) single-wide economy model to $72,000 or more for a large (1,800 to 1,900 square feet)
double/triple wide model 3, and represent an affordable homeownership option for many households.

         b.        Rental Market
For many lower-income households, rental housing is
an affordable option. Shown below in Table 2-24,
nearly all recently-built apartments in Kings County
are affordable to lower-income households, including
both income-restricted and new market-rate units with
extensive amenities (such as The Grove in Lemoore).
Income-restricted projects also include units
affordable at the very-low- and extremely-low-income
level.
                                                                El Palmar Apartments - Avenal
                                                    In addition to the newer market-rate apartment
                                                    projects shown here, Kings County has a substantial
                                                    number of assisted multi-family projects that were
                                                    built prior to the last planning period. As discussed
                                                    later in this chapter, Kings County has
                                                    approximately 25 multi-family projects financed
                                                    with a variety of local, state, and federal funds.
                                                    These projects provide approximately 1,500 units of
                                                    affordable housing to extremely-low-, very-low- and

  D. Special Needs Groups
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to special circumstances.
Special circumstances may be related to one’s income, family characteristics, and disability status among
others. In Kings County, persons and households with special needs include seniors, families with
children (large households and single-parents with children) military personnel, agricultural employees,
persons with disabilities, and the homeless. This section analyzes these special needs groups and
identifies resources and programs designed to address these needs.
1.        Seniors
According to recent Census estimates, Kings County had
approximately 5,023 owner-occupied households and 1,971
renter-occupied households that were headed by seniors age
65 years and older (Table 2-25). In all jurisdictions, the
majority of seniors were homeowners.
Senior households have special housing needs primarily due
to three concerns – physical disabilities or limitations, limited
income, and higher medical costs. Lemoore had the lowest

Seniors require a variety of housing options, depending on their life circumstance. While over 70% of
seniors were homeowners, a variety of factors such as fixed retirement incomes, rising health care costs
and physical disabilities can result in deferred home maintenance. Each jurisdiction’s housing plan
includes grant or loan programs to help seniors with repairs. Seniors with mobility disabilities may also
require home modifications to improve accessibility and facilitate independent living. All jurisdictions
have programs to ensure reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities.
Senior renters, while facing similar income and mobility limitations as homeowners, are often at greater
risk due to rising housing costs. To address these needs, the Housing Authority administers Section 8 rent
subsidy vouchers for extremely-low- and very-low-income seniors. In addition, subsidized rental projects
provide affordable housing options for many seniors.
The Kings/Tulare Area Agency on Aging and the Kings County Commission on Aging provide
leadership at the local level in developing systems for home- and community-based services that maintain
seniors in the least restrictive environment for as long as possible. Each jurisdiction also provides other
types of supportive services for seniors. However, at some point in time, seniors may require a more
supportive living environment. Congregate care facilities, residential care facilities, and skilled nursing
facilities provide a wide range of housing, supportive, and medical services for seniors requiring
additional care. The majority of independent and supportive residential environments are located in the
most urbanized portions of the County in Hanford and Lemoore.
2.         Female-Headed Households
Female-headed households have special housing needs including affordable housing, accessible daycare,
health care, and other supportive services. Female-headed households comprised about 15% of all
households in Kings County. State law recognizes that these households face challenges due to a
combination of income levels, child care expenses, and housing availability. As shown in Table 2-26, the
proportion of female-headed households ranged from about 13% in the unincorporated area to over 20%

3.        Large Families
Large families represented approximately 20% of all owner households and about 21% of all renter
households in Kings County (Table 2-27). Large households are most prevalent in Avenal (37% of
owners and 31% of renters) while Hanford and Lemoore have the lowest proportions of large households.
Large families may have difficulty finding housing units that are large enough to accommodate their
needs while still being affordable. The Housing Authority helps address the needs of these families by
providing rental assistance in the form of Section 8 vouchers for extremely-low- and very-low-income
households. Vouchers provide the difference between the market rent charged for the unit and the amount
of rent that can be afforded by the household, typically no more than 30% of household income.

Whereas providing rental assistance helps meet the needs of extremely-low- and very-low-income
households, the underlying need for affordable housing units must also be addressed. As discussed in
Table 2-33, Assisted Housing Units (page 2-38), Kings County has a total of over 2,500 units of subsidized
affordable housing. The majority of these projects are located in Hanford and Lemoore. The Housing Plan
(Chapter 5) sets forth programs to encourage the construction of additional affordable rental and
ownership housing.
4.        Military Personnel and Veterans
The U.S. Navy plays a critical role in Kings County economy and its housing market. Lemoore is home to
the Naval Air Station Lemoore (NASL). Commissioned in 1961, NASL serves as the master training
center for carrier-based fighter squadrons for the United States Pacific Fleet. According to NASL,
military personnel at the base totaled approximately 7,500 enlistees and officers in 2009. Of those,
approximately 40% were single and 60% had families.
There are currently (2015) 1,630 residential units on base, plus
additional quarters for approximately 2,400 single personnel. On-
base housing does not fully satisfy the total housing need for base
personnel and their families. In addition to Navy personnel,
approximately 2,700 civilians are employed on-base. Because of
the housing shortfall, military personnel and civilians must find
accommodations in nearby communities.
The basic housing allowance provided to Navy personnel ranges
from $837 to $1,422 for single individuals and from $1,035 to
$1,692 for families. Single-service members, grade E-1 through

In addition to active personnel, military veterans comprised a significant need group. According to recent
Census estimates, approximately 10,600 military veterans lived within Kings County.

Farmworkers have special housing needs due to
their relatively low wages. According to
California          Employment             Development
Department 4, wages for farmworkers in the San
Joaquin Valley ranged from $12 to 14/hour, which
is equivalent to approximately $25,000/year for
full-time work. As a result, farmworkers often
overpay for housing (in relation to their income)
and/or live in overcrowded and substandard living
situations.

The nature of agricultural work also affects the specific housing needs of farmworkers. For instance,
farmworkers employed on a year-round basis generally live with their families and need permanent
affordable housing much like other lower-income households. Migrant farmworkers who follow seasonal
harvests generally need temporary housing only for the workers themselves.
California has a statewide shortage of farmworker housing projects. For instance, the number of
agricultural employee housing facilities registered with the State of California Department of Housing
and Community Development (HCD) has dramatically declined since the 1950s. Between 1955 and 1982,
grower-registered facilities declined from 9,000 to 1,414 camps. By 1998, only 500 camps were
registered with HCD, none of which were in Kings County. According to growers, the dramatic decline in
labor camps is due to the high cost of maintaining housing and the climate of litigation facing growers
who maintain camps. Additionally, most farm owners/managers hire the majority of their workers
through temporary agencies for planting, picking, pruning, or other specific tasks, so that providing full-
time housing for workers is not practical.
Although no farmworker camps exist in Kings County, the County does have a significant number of
government-subsidized housing projects (e.g., Section 515 and public housing) that house farmworkers
and their families. Many farmworkers live in mobile homes on the farming site. A new farmworker
housing project was completed in Hanford during the 2003-2008 planning period. That project involved
the renovation of an existing former motel into temporary and/or long-term, permanent agricultural
employee housing. The project included 24 units plus parking, courtyard, children’s play areas and open
space.
The Kings County Housing Authority reports that it provides approximately 1,090 Section 8 Housing
Choice Vouchers to households within the county and its four cities, of which 45 are specifically farm
labor residences. Families with farm labor income are given a preference over other families for
occupancy of these homes.
The Constraints analysis (Chapter 4) contains a discussion of each jurisdiction’s land use and zoning
policies and regulations regarding farmworker housing. In communities with large farmworker
populations, farmworker housing needs are met through homeownership assistance and rehabilitation
loans. The majority of loans under both types of programs are issued to people working in the agricultural
industry. Moreover, the majority of occupants of Section 515 projects and other subsidized projects also
are employed in the farming industry. In Lemoore the farmworker population is significantly smaller,
although many farmworkers also access standard homeownership and/or rehabilitation loans. The
Housing Plan (Chapter 5) includes programs to address the housing and supportive services needs of
farmworkers.
6.       Persons with Disabilities
Because of the multitude of possible functional limitations that may present as disabilities, and in the
absence of information on external factors that influence disability, surveys like the Census Bureau’s
ACS are limited to capturing difficulty with only selected activities. As such, people identified by the
ACS as having a disability are, in fact, those who exhibit difficulty with specific functions and may, in the
absence of accommodation, have a disability. In an attempt to capture a variety of characteristics that

Chapter 2. Housing Needs Assessment
encompass the definition of disability, the ACS identifies serious difficulty with four basic areas of
functioning – hearing, vision, cognition, and ambulation. 5
Disabilities are most common among senior citizens. According to recent Census estimates, the
proportion of people 65 years of age and over reporting some type of physical disability ranged from 39%
in the unincorporated area to 52% in Avenal. The incidence of disabilities affecting the working age
population was considerably less, ranging from about 8% in the unincorporated county to 13% in
Corcoran (see Table 2-31).
Developmental Disabilities
As defined by federal law, “developmental disability” means a severe, chronic disability of an individual
that:
    •    Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical
         impairments;
    •    Is manifested before the individual attains age 18;
    •    Is likely to continue indefinitely;
    •    Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major life
         activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-
         direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic self-sufficiency;
    •    Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or
         generic services, individualized supports or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong or
         extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated.
The Census Bureau does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S. Administration on
Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage of the population that can be defined
as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work
independently within a conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a
group living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may
require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because
developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the
developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate
level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-based services to
approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families through a statewide
system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. Kings
County is served by the Central Valley Regional Center 6 (CVRC) which is based in Fresno. During 2014,
CVRC served approximately 16,200 clients, of which about 900 to 1,000 lived in Kings County (Table 2-
30). CVRC provides diagnosis, evaluation, and case management services. The Center also operates
approximately 20 small group homes for mentally disabled clients and placement services to help clients
find affordable, independent housing (typically Section 8 units). The Kings County Rehabilitation Center

   Census.)

State and federal law mandate minimum accessibility standards for housing. For example, local
governments that use federal housing funds must meet federal accessibility guidelines for new construction
and substantial rehabilitation. At least 5% of the units must be accessible to persons with mobility
impairments, and an additional 2% must be accessible to persons with sensory impairments. New multi-
family housing must be built so that: 1) the public and common use portions of such units are readily
accessible to and usable by disabled persons; 2) the doors allowing passage into and within such units can
accommodate wheelchairs; and 3) all units contain adaptive design features. In addition, state law requires
all jurisdictions to provide reasonable accommodation in the application of housing policies and regulations
(see Chapter 4. Constraints for additional discussion).
7.       Homeless
Homelessness is often the result of multiple factors that             Table 2-32
converge in a person’s life. The combination of loss of               Homeless Persons
employment, inability to find a job because of the need for
retraining, and high housing costs lead to some individuals and                                      Estimated
families losing their housing. For others, the loss of housing is     Jurisdiction                   Homeless

homeless population is difficult because many individuals are         Source: Kings/Tulare County Continuum of Care

hotels/motels       or     shelters,  and    other      temporary     *City estimate
accommodations. In an attempt to address the needs of
homeless people in Kings County, the Kings/Tulare County Continuum of Care Coordinating Group
conducted a Point-in-Time (“PIT”) survey of homeless people in these two counties in January 2015 (Table
2-32). The study used HUD’s definition of homelessness, which is defined as people who reside in
emergency shelters, transitional housing, or places not meant for human habitation such as cars, parks,
sidewalks, and abandoned buildings.
Based on the 2015 survey, the following portrait of homeless people
emerged.
         •      40% are chronic homeless
         •      33% have a chronic health condition
         •      41% suffer from mental illness
         •      23% are victims of domestic violence
         •      31% have a physical disability
         •      23% have a substance abuse problem
         •      7% are veterans
         •      9% are unaccompanied children or young adults
                under age 25
As of 2015, 49% of the homeless population was housed in temporary living arrangements. Of this total,
30% lived in transitional housing and 19% were in emergency shelters. Just over half were living on the
streets or in a car. (Note: Avenal and Lemoore were not included in the PIT survey, therefore the estimates
of homeless persons for those cities are based on the observations of police officers or other city staff.)

The 2015 PIT survey identified an inventory of 237 emergency shelter beds, 340 transitional housing beds
and 307 permanent supportive housing beds in Kings County (see Figure 3). The unmet need was estimated
to be 75 emergency shelter beds, 22 transitional housing beds and 80 permanent supportive housing beds.7
Additional emergency assistance is provided by the Salvation Army in Hanford, which provides short-term
assistance in the form of food, financial assistance for rent and utility bills, motel vouchers and bus or plane
tickets. Corcoran Christian Aid provides food, vouchers and other types of emergency financial assistance
within Corcoran.
Despite these services, a significant shortage in emergency shelters and transitional housing remains. In
2007 the State Legislature passed Senate Bill (SB) 2, which strengthened the planning and zoning
requirements for emergency shelters and transitional/supportive housing. SB2 requires that all jurisdictions
adopt zoning regulations that allow emergency shelters by-right in at least one zone, subject to objective
development standards, or as an alternative, the jurisdiction may meet the need through a multi-
jurisdictional agreement with up to three adjacent jurisdictions. As noted in the Constraints section, all of
the jurisdictions in Kings County have adopted zoning regulations for emergency shelters and
transitional/supportive housing in response to SB 2.
  E. Analysis of At Risk Housing
State law requires that housing elements include an
analysis of assisted housing projects that are eligible to
change from low-income housing to market rate housing
during the next ten years due to termination of subsidy
contracts, mortgage prepayment, or expiration of
affordability        restrictions.          Assisted         housing
developments include multi-family rental housing that
receives assistance under certain federal and state
programs, as well as local programs (e.g., in-lieu fees,
inclusionary and/or density bonus programs).
Kings County and its four incorporated cities have 44
projects providing over 2,400 affordable rental units
subsidized through local, state, and federal programs.
Covenants and deed restrictions are used to maintain the affordability of publicly assisted housing as
affordable to low- and moderate-income households. Over time, however, these covenants and use
restrictions expire and must be renewed or renegotiated to ensure continued affordability of housing. Table
2-33 shows the assisted rental projects in Kings County for which affordability controls are currently in
place. All of these projects have affordability covenants that extend at least 10 years and, therefore, none is
considered to be at risk of conversion to market rate.

  The PIT survey did not include all jurisdictions in Kings County, therefore a breakdown of unmet need for each jurisdiction is not
    available.

  F. Housing Growth Needs
1.       Overview of the Regional Housing Needs Allocation
The Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) is a key tool for local governments to plan for
anticipated growth. The RHNA quantifies the anticipated need for housing within each jurisdiction for the
10-year period from January 1, 2014 through January 31, 2024. Communities then determine how they
will address this need through the process of updating the Housing Elements of their General Plans.
In determining the housing allocation for the five jurisdictions within Kings County, the Kings County
Association of Governments (KCAG) developed an allocation methodology with the assistance of the
Kings Regional Housing Technical Advisory Committee (KRHTAC). This methodology takes into
account local growth assumptions and considers certain criteria as specified in Government Code
§65584(a). The criteria used in this methodology include an analysis of available data on local housing,
population, economic, and other growth factors. One growth assumption deemed relevant to housing
growth and demand within Kings County is the housing needs of Naval Air Station Lemoore personnel.
Although the housing unit allocations in the RHNA are not required to take into account the military base,
the Indian reservation, or prison populations, the Naval Air Station Lemoore is identified as a relevant
factor. Using the assumptions and methodology detailed within the RHNA plan, KCAG in coordination
with the KRHTAC derived the distribution of each jurisdiction’s share of the regional housing need and
allocated the units according to the four income categories for housing affordability.
The goal of the RHNA Plan is to promote a fair distribution of attainable housing among the four cities
and the unincorporated County in a way that also helps meet the state’s housing goals. Attainable housing
is defined as housing that is both sufficient in supply and affordably priced. The total housing units
specified in the RHNA plan for each jurisdiction are not to be construed as quotas for development. The
RHNA Plan only determines the number and affordability of housing units that jurisdictions need to plan
for through land use policies, regulations, infrastructure plans, and other housing assistance programs.
Construction and development of these allocations is not a requirement of the RHNA plan.

Chapter 3.                        Resources and Opportunities
This chapter analyzes the resources available for the development, rehabilitation, and preservation of
housing in Kings County and the cities of Avenal, Corcoran, Hanford, and Lemoore. This includes an
evaluation of the extent to which vacant or underutilized land compares to the regional housing needs
allocation, and the financial and administrative resources available to support housing activities and
implement the housing programs described in Chapter 5.
  A. Land Resources
California law (Government Code §65584) requires that each city and county, when preparing its state-
mandated housing element, develop local housing programs designed to address housing needs for all
income groups in their community. This concept seeks to ensure that each jurisdiction, to the extent
feasible and appropriate, plans for a variety of housing for population growth expected in the region as
well as people who might reasonably be expected to reside within the jurisdiction if a variety of housing
accommodations appropriate to their needs were available. This section analyzes the capacity for
residential development in each jurisdiction and how that capacity compares to the regional housing needs
allocation (RHNA) identified in the previous chapter.
The current RHNA covers the period January 1, 2014 through January 31, 2024. Housing units built
during 2014-15 are credited in the new planning period. Jurisdictions must demonstrate that there is
adequate capacity to achieve the remainder of their RHNA for all income categories during the planning
period based on an analysis of realistic development potential on vacant or underutilized sites.
It is important to recognize that the RHNA is a planning target, not a construction mandate. Since local
governments do not build housing, their responsibilities are to create opportunities for residential
development for all income levels through appropriate land use plans and regulations, and through
implementation of programs designed to facilitate housing development. The focus of these
responsibilities is on the provision of housing for lower-income households and persons with special
needs since these groups have the greatest difficulty in obtaining adequate and affordable housing.
To fully address RHNA requirements, jurisdictions must demonstrate that there are adequate sites with
appropriate zoning and development standards to accommodate their remaining housing need at all
affordability levels. To that end, a parcel-specific inventory was prepared by each jurisdiction. The
resulting inventory consists of vacant sites or underutilized sites with potential for additional development
or redevelopment. Chapter 4 provides an analysis of the appropriateness of zoning regulations and
development standards for each jurisdiction to facilitate housing development at all income levels. The
detailed parcel listings and identification of potential development constraints for each jurisdiction are
provided in Appendix B. Sites with Farmland Security Zone or Williamson Act contracts were eliminated
from the analysis. The land inventory analyses for each jurisdiction are summarized in Table 3-1 below.
This analysis demonstrates that the land inventory in each jurisdiction is adequate to accommodate the
RHNA in all income categories.

  B. Financial and Administrative Resources
Kings County jurisdictions have access to a variety of local, state, federal, and private resources to assist
in the production of affordable housing for extremely-low, very-low, low- and moderate-income
households. In addition, various nonprofit and for-profit agencies may have the administrative capacity to
help the jurisdictions further their housing goals. The following section describes the most significant
funding sources currently used by cities and the County, and the agencies that can help achieve the
housing goals described in Chapter 5.
1.        Financial Resources
Home Investment Partnership (HOME): The federal HOME Program offers funding for local
jurisdictions to improve and/or expand the supply of affordable housing opportunities for lower-income
households. All projects and programs funded with HOME funds must be targeted to very-low- and low-
income households and may have requirements for matching funds from non-federal resources equal to
25% of the requested funds. All of the jurisdictions in Kings County must apply to state HCD for HOME
funds annually on a competitive basis. Recently, the cities of Avenal and Hanford received HOME grants
for first-time homebuyer loans and housing rehabilitation loans. Lemoore received first-time homebuyer
grant funds while Kings County and Hanford received Rental New Construction grant funding.
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): The federal CDBG program is designed to maintain
viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by
expanding economic opportunities, especially for persons of low- and moderate-income. CDBG funds can
be used for a variety of activities, including housing acquisition, housing rehabilitation, new construction,
public works, and community facilities. Each year, jurisdictions may apply for up to $800,000 under both
the General Allocation and Economic Development components of the CDBG programs. The maximum
amount per application is $500,000. In addition, grants of up to $70,000 per year from the General
Planning and Technical Assistance allocation and $70,000 per year for the Economic Development
Planning and Technical Assistance are awarded and do not count toward the $800,000 cap.
Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program (AHSC): The AHSC Program furthers
the purposes of AB 32 and SB 375 by investing in projects that reduce GHG emissions by supporting
more compact, infill development patterns, encouraging active transportation and transit usage, and
protecting agricultural land from sprawl development. Funding for the AHSC Program is provided from
the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), an account established to receive Cap-and-Trade auction
proceeds. The AHSC Program is administered by the Strategic Growth Council (SGC). HCD will
implement the transportation, housing and infrastructure component of the AHSC Program. Funds are
allocated through a competitive process, based on the merits of applications submitted and the proposed
use of funds. The threshold requirements and application selection criteria focus on the extent to which
developments realize the AHSC Program’s objectives of reducing GHG emissions, benefiting
Disadvantaged Communities, providing affordable housing, demonstrating project readiness, and meeting
other policy considerations.
2.        Administrative Resources
Described below are the major public and non-profit agencies that have been involved in housing
activities or are interested in housing activities in Kings County. These agencies play important roles in
meeting the housing needs of the community. In particular, they are involved in the improvement of the

housing stock, provision of affordable housing, homeownership assistance, and rental assistance to
households in need.
Self Help Enterprises: Incorporated in 1965, Self-Help Enterprises of Visalia is a non-profit housing
developer that assists low-income residents of rural areas with housing and related services. “Self-help”
housing refers to housing built in part by the future occupants of the home by allowing families to use
their "sweat equity" as the down payment on the new home they might otherwise not be able to afford.
Self-Help Enterprises is actively involved in helping farm laborers and other low-income families in
becoming homeowners through both training and supervision as self-help builders, and assembling public
and private funds in support of new construction. Self-Help Enterprises also develops multi-family
housing and administers housing programs for all jurisdictions in Kings County on a contract basis.
Housing Authority of Kings County (HAKC): The Housing Authority’s mission is to promote decent,
safe, and affordable housing and economic opportunity to low-income families throughout Kings County
and its four incorporated cities. The Housing Authority operates three public housing projects providing
268 units of affordable housing and 32 state housing apartments. The Housing Authority also provides

foster youth.
  C. Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Avenal
The City of Avenal is developing a partnership with Pacific Gas & Electric to provide homeowners and
renters with energy audits and to provide them with resources to obtain low energy products such as lights
and insulation. The partnership should be in place in 2016.
Corcoran
The City of Corcoran provides expedited permit processing for residential solar energy equipment
installations. The City’s Rehabilitation Program also encourages energy-efficient improvements when
equipment or construction will involve items eligible for such upgrades. The City is also working with
ARRA funds to install electrical retrofits on City-owned buildings/equipment, and entered into a Lease
Agreement for a Solar Farm. In addition, the Housing Plan includes Program 2.16 to refer lower-income
households to the Kings Community Action Organization and other community services agencies that
provide financial assistance to offset the cost of home weatherization, heating (including solar
photovoltaic water heater systems) and cooling.
Hanford
The City of Hanford will be incorporating the policies and requirements of recent amendments to state
law (AB32 and SB375). In addition, the City requires or encourages the following in residential
developments:
    •    Street trees which reduce heat generated from pavement
    •    Landscaping in new development to shade parking lots
    •    Solar photovoltaic panels as options

    •    Require developers to exceed Title 24 Standards (Heat & Energy) by 10%
    •    Increased residential densities
    •    High Albedo (light-colored roofs are often required)
Lemoore
The Community Design Element of the City’s General Plan incorporates several policies and
implementation actions that support energy conservation and green development. These include:
    •    Requiring new development to incorporate passive heating and natural lighting where feasible
    •    Incorporate green building standards into the Zoning Ordinance and Building Code to ensure a
         high level of energy efficiency in new development, including requiring the use of Energy Star
         appliances in new development and substantial renovations, requiring all new development to
         qualify for the equivalent of “LEED Silver” rating or better, requiring all new residential
         development to be pre-wired for optional photovoltaic energy systems and/or solar water heating,
         and requiring all new projects that will use more than 40,000 kilowatt-hours per year of electricity
         to install photovoltaic energy systems.
Kings County
The Community Development Agency provides expedited plan check and permit processing for
residential projects designed to comply with the voluntary residential requirements of the California
Green Building Standards Code. Expedited plan check/permit processing is also given to photovoltaic
systems that provide energy for residential uses.
In addition, lower-income households are referred to the Kings Community Action Organization and
other community services agencies that provide financial assistance to offset the cost of home
weatherization, heating (including solar photovoltaic water heater systems) and cooling.

Chapter 4.                        Constraints
The Kings County jurisdictions recognize that adequate and affordable housing for all income groups
strengthens the community. Government policies and regulations can impact the price and availability of
housing and, in particular, the provision of affordable housing. Likewise, non-governmental constraints
such as land and construction costs, and environmental and infrastructure constraints can also affect
housing cost and availability.
This chapter of the Housing Element discusses potential governmental and non-governmental constraints
focusing primarily on those constraint areas that may be mitigated through the policies and programs
discussed in Chapter 5.
  A. Governmental Constraints
Local policies and regulations can impact the price and availability of housing and, in particular, the
provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, residential development standards, and permit
processing procedures may present constraints to the maintenance, development, and improvement of
housing.
1.       Land Use Plans and Regulations
The jurisdictions’ General Plan Land Use Elements contain the primary policies that guide residential
development. These policies are implemented through several types of ordinances, including the Zoning
and Subdivision ordinances. Zoning regulations establish the amount and distribution of different land
uses within the jurisdictions, while subdivision regulations establish requirements for the division and
improvement of land.
         a.        General Plan Land Use Designations
Each city and county in California must prepare a comprehensive, long-term General Plan to guide its
future. The land use element of the General Plan establishes the basic land uses and density of
development within each jurisdiction. Under state law, the General Plan elements must be internally
consistent, and each jurisdiction’s zoning must be consistent with its General Plan. Thus, the land use
plan must provide suitable locations and densities to implement the policies of the Housing Element.
During the previous planning period General Plan updates were adopted in Corcoran (2014) and Kings
County (2010), and updates are currently underway in Avenal and Hanford.
Table 4-1 shows the residential General Plan land use categories for the Kings County jurisdictions. The
land use designations support a variety of housing types, ranging from very low density development,
which generally includes single-family homes on large lots to high-density development, which includes
multi-family development ranging from 14 to 29 units per acre.

         b.        Zoning Designations and Housing Opportunities
Each jurisdiction in Kings County regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential
development through local zoning ordinances. The zoning regulations serve to implement each
jurisdiction’s General Plan and are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare
of residents. Housing Element law requires that jurisdictions facilitate and encourage a range in types and
prices of housing for all economic and social groups in the community. This includes single-family and
multi-family housing, manufactured housing, residential care facilities, emergency shelters, transitional
housing, and other housing.
A summary of the residential development permitted by each King County jurisdiction is provided in
Table 4-2 through Table 4-6.

Chapter 4. Constraints
As shown in Table 4-2 through Table 4-6 above, Kings County jurisdictions allow for a wide variety of
housing types, including single-family and multi-family residences at a variety of densities that facilitate
market rate and affordable housing projects. Mixed use is also allowed in designated areas of all
jurisdictions.
All jurisdictions allow for the development of manufactured housing and mobile homes, providing a
valuable source of affordable housing for seniors, families, and farmworkers. In accordance with state
law, all jurisdictions allow second units as a permitted use in all single-family zones. Low-income
housing can be accommodated in all districts permitting residential use in Kings County jurisdictions
including mixed-use districts.
          c.       Special Needs Housing
To further fair housing opportunities, Kings County jurisdictions provide for a range of housing
opportunities for persons with special needs, including those in residential care facilities, persons with
disabilities, the elderly, farmworkers, persons needing emergency shelter or transitional living
arrangements, and single-room-occupancy units. Many of these groups also fall under the category of
extremely-low-income households. Table 4-2 through Table 4-6 above show the zoning requirements for
each jurisdiction with respect to permitted and conditionally permitted special needs housing types. Each
jurisdiction’s provisions for these housing types are discussed further below.
Extremely-Low-Income Households
Many of the persons and households discussed in this section under the topic of special needs fall within
the extremely-low-income category, which is defined as 30% or less of area median income, or up to
$24,250 per year for a 4-person household in Kings County (2015).
A variety of policies and programs described in Chapter 5 address the needs of extremely-low-income
households, including persons with disabilities and those in need of residential care facilities. Such
programs include housing rehabilitation, preservation of existing affordable units, Section 8 vouchers,
provision of adequate sites for new multi-family housing, administrative, regulatory and financial
assistance to affordable projects, zoning to encourage and facilitate farmworker housing, emergency
shelters, transitional and supportive housing, single room occupancy (SROs) and second units. However,
it must be recognized that the development of new housing for the lowest income groups typically
requires large public subsidies, and the level of need is greater than can be met due to funding limitations,
especially after the dissolution of redevelopment agencies.
Residential Care Facilities
Residential care facilities refer to any family home, group home, or rehabilitation facility that provides
non-medical care to persons in need of personal services, protection, supervision, assistance, guidance, or
training essential for daily living. Health and Safety Code §§1267.8, 1566.3, and 1568.08 require local
governments to treat licensed group homes and residential care facilities with six or fewer residents no
differently than other single-family residential uses. “Six or fewer persons” does not include the operator, the
operator’s family, or persons employed as staff. Local agencies must allow these licensed residential care
facilities in any area zoned for residential use, and may not require licensed residential care facilities for six or
fewer clients to obtain conditional use permits or variances that are not required of other single-family
dwellings.
For all Kings County jurisdictions the development standards for licensed residential care facilities for six
or fewer persons are no different than for other residential uses in the same zone. A conditional use permit
is required in some jurisdictions for larger residential care facilities for more than six persons. A deviation

                                                                            A.    Governmental Constraints
in site planning requirements and reduction in parking may be granted through the conditional use
process. A discussion of each jurisdiction’s regulations for residential care facilities is provided below:
         •      Avenal –Residential care facilities that serve six or fewer persons are a permitted use in all
                residential zones. Facilities serving more than six persons are conditionally permitted in all
                residential zones. These requirements are consistent with state law and do not pose a
                constraint on the establishment of such facilities.
         •      Corcoran – Residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons are permitted by-right
                in all residential zones as well as the Professional Office (PO) zone. Larger care facilities
                for more than six persons are permitted by CUP in all residential zones and the PO zone
                and by administrative permit in CN, CC, CH, CD and CS zones. These requirements are
                consistent with state law and do not pose a constraint on the establishment of care facilities.
         •      Hanford – Residential care facilities that serve six or fewer persons are a permitted use in
                all residential zones and the OR zone. Larger state- or county-licensed care facilities that
                provide housing on a temporary basis and that do not require personal supervision or
                rehabilitation services are conditionally permitted in all residential zones and the OR zone.
                These regulations are consistent with state law and do not pose a significant constraint on
                the establishment of residential care facilities.
         •      Lemoore –Residential care facilities that serve six or fewer persons are permitted by-right
                in all residential and mixed-use zones subject to the same regulations as other residential
                uses. Residential care facilities serving more than six persons are permitted by-right in the
                RHD zone and by CUP in the RLMD, RMD, MU and NC zones. These regulations are
                consistent with state law.
         •      Kings County – Under current zoning regulations, community care facilities that serve six
                or fewer persons are a permitted use all residential, mixed use and agricultural zones.
                Community care facilities for seven or more persons are conditionally permitted in all
                residential zones and most agricultural zones. In the PF zone, community care facilities
                serving up to 30 persons are permitted by site plan review and larger facilities are permitted
                by conditional use permit. These regulations are consistent with state law and do not pose a
                significant constraint on the establishment of residential care facilities.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Both the federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act impose an
affirmative duty on local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e., modifications or
exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such accommodations may be
necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. Additionally,
§65008 of the Government Code requires localities to analyze potential and actual constraints, and
include programs to accommodate housing for disabled persons.
Building codes adopted by all Kings County jurisdictions incorporate accessibility standards contained in
Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. Compliance with building codes and the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) may increase the cost of housing production and can also impact the viability of
rehabilitation of older properties required to be brought up to current code standards. However, these
regulations provide minimum standards that must be complied with in order to ensure the development of
safe and accessible housing.
Because many homes in Kings County jurisdictions were built before modern accessibility standards, an
important housing issue facing people with disabilities is retrofitting existing homes to improve access.

Chapter 4. Constraints
For retrofitting homes, all jurisdictions administratively permit unenclosed ramps to protrude into
required setbacks without a variance. Each jurisdiction allows a property owner to build a ramp to allow
people with disabilities access into a single-family home upon securing a building permit and payment of
local building permit and inspection fees. Each jurisdiction also administers a Housing Rehabilitation
Program that provides federally funded loans to eligible homeowners or rental property owners to make
accessibility improvements.
Key planning requirements for each jurisdiction related to housing persons with disabilities are described
below:
      Avenal
                •      Definition of “family” – The Avenal Zoning Code defines family as: “One or more
                       persons related or unrelated, living together as a single nonprofit housekeeping
                       unit, as distinguished from a group occupying a boarding or lodging house, hotel,
                       club, or similar dwelling for group use. A family shall include domestic servants
                       employed by the family but shall not include a fraternal, religious, social, or
                       business group.” This definition is consistent with current housing law.
                •      Separation requirements – The City’s Zoning Code does not impose any separation
                       requirements between group homes or residential care facilities.
                •      Site planning requirements – The site planning requirements for residential care
                       facilities are no different than for other residential uses in the same zone. Required
                       parking is 1 space per 4 beds.
                •      Reasonable accommodation – Chapter 9.16 of the City’s Zoning Code establishes
                       administrative procedures for reviewing and approving requests for modifications
                       to building or zoning requirements in order to ensure reasonable accommodation

                       share common living, sleeping, cooking and eating facilities. Family members need
                       not be related by blood but are distinguished from a group occupying a boarding
                       or lodging house, hotel or club suitable for group use.” This definition is
                       consistent with current law.
                •      Separation requirements – The City’s Zoning Code does not impose any separation
                       requirements between group homes or residential care facilities.

Farmworker Housing
Housing for agricultural employees occurs in two types of settings: housing accommodations located on
farmland that is exclusively for farmworkers; or traditional housing that is intended for lower-income
households but is not restricted to farmworkers.
It is estimated that approximately 8,300 farm laborers in Kings County are permanent non-migrant and
seasonal laborers. The housing needs of these farmworkers are primarily addressed through the provision
of permanent affordable housing, such as apartments, lower-cost single-family homes, and mobile homes.
The remaining farm laborers are migrant farmworkers who are not permanent residents of Kings County.
The California Employee Housing Act 8 regulates farmworker housing and generally requires that no
conditional use permit, zoning variance, or other zoning clearance shall be required of state-permitted
employee housing that serves six or fewer employees that is not required of a family dwelling of the same
type in the same zone (Health and Safety Code §17021.5). In addition, state-permitted employee housing
facilities with no more than 36 beds in group quarters or 12 units must be treated as an agricultural land
use that is not required to obtain any conditional use permit or other approval that is not required of other
agricultural uses in the same zone (Health and Safety Code §17021.6).
Each jurisdiction’s regulations regarding farmworker housing are described below.
          •      Avenal – Farmworker housing is permitted in conformance with Employee Housing Act
                 requirements. Since Avenal has some of the lowest housing prices and apartment rents in
                 California, the need for farmworker housing is largely met by traditional housing. The City
                 of Avenal actively assists farmworker housing needs: the majority of homeownership loans
                 are made to farmworkers, and a majority of units in assisted multi-family projects are
                 occupied by farmworkers.
          •      Corcoran – Farmworker housing is permitted in conformance with Employee Housing Act
                 requirements. Corcoran has some of the lowest housing prices and apartment rents in
                 California and can meet its needs for farmworker housing through traditional housing. The
                 City actively assists farmworker housing needs: farmworkers receive the majority of
                 homeownership and home rehabilitation loans each year and occupy a larger share of units
                 in assisted multi-family projects.
          •      Hanford – Farmworker housing is permitted in conformance with Employee Housing Act
                 requirements. As the most urbanized city in Kings County, Hanford has only a very small
                 amount of agricultural land.

          •     Lemoore – Farmworker housing for up to six employees is permitted in all residential
                zones except RVH, therefore a Code amendment is needed to ensure conformance with
                Employee Housing Act requirements (see Program 4.11 in the Housing Plan). Farmworker
                housing complexes with up to 12 units or 36 beds are permitted in any zone where
                agriculture is a permitted use, in conformance with state law. As a more urbanized
                community, the City of Lemoore has relatively little farmland within its boundaries and
                only one small area at the western edge of the city with agricultural zoning. The City’s
                overall efforts to provide and maintain affordable housing opportunities will help to
                support the few permanent non-migrant and seasonal laborers who may choose to reside in
                Lemoore.
          •     Kings County – The Kings County Development Code permits farmworker housing with
                up to four dwelling units in all agricultural zones subject to Site Plan Review. The Housing
                Plan includes Program 5.10 to process an amendment in conformance with the Employee
                Housing Act.
Emergency Shelters, Transitional and Supportive Housing
An emergency shelter is a year-round facility that provides shelter to homeless families and/or individuals
on a limited short-term basis. Transitional housing is temporary (often six months to two years) housing
for a homeless individual or family who is transitioning to permanent housing. Supportive housing
includes supportive services (e.g., job training, rehabilitation counseling) to allow individuals to gain
necessary life skills in support of independent living.
The passage of SB2 in 2007 amended the requirements for local government regulations regarding
emergency shelters and transitional/supportive housing. Unless a city has sufficient existing shelter
facilities to accommodate its need, land use regulations must identify at least one zoning district where
shelters are a permitted use (i.e., do not require a conditional use permit or other discretionary review).
Additionally SB2 requires that transitional and supportive housing be treated as a residential use subject
to only those requirements that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone.
Each jurisdiction’s policies regarding emergency shelters, transitional and supportive housing are
described below.
          •     Avenal - Emergency shelters are permitted by-right without discretionary review in the R-3
                zone and by conditional use permit in the PF zone. Required standards include:
                o          Maximum of 25 persons per night
                o          Off-street parking at one space per five beds plus one space for each staff person
                           on duty
                o          Management and security plan
                o          Minimum separation of 300 feet between emergency shelters
                o          On-site waiting and intake areas screened from the public right-of-way
                The R-3 zone is located near transit and commercial services, and provides adequate vacant
                or underutilized sites to accommodate the City’s need for additional shelter facilities.
                Transitional and supportive housing are treated as residential uses subject only to those
                requirements that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone, in
                conformance with state law.
          •     Corcoran - Emergency shelters are permitted by right without discretionary review in the
                Service Commercial (CS) zone and by conditional use permit in the Light Industrial (IL)
                and Heavy Industrial (IH) zones. Required standards include only those that apply to other

                uses in the same zone. Parcels within the CS zone encompass approximately 50 acres, are
                located near transit and commercial services. There are currently about 13 vacant CS
                parcels encompassing approximately 22 acres which provide adequate vacant or
                underutilized sites to accommodate the City’s need for shelter facilities.
                Transitional and supportive housing are permitted in all residential zones; however,
                Program 2.11 includes a commitment to process a Code amendment to ensure that these
                uses are also permitted in non-residential zones subject only to those requirements that
                apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone, in conformance with
                state law.
         •      Hanford – Emergency shelters are permitted by-right without discretionary review in the
                OR (Office Residential) zone subject to the following standards.
                o        Maximum 25 beds
                o        A management and security plan prepared in consultation with the City Manager
                o        Off-street parking provided at a ratio of one space per five beds plus one space for
                         each staff person on duty
                o        Minimum separation of 300 feet between emergency shelters
                The OR zone encompasses approximately 166 acres, is located near transit and commercial
                services, and provides adequate vacant or underutilized sites to accommodate the City’s
                need for additional shelter facilities. In order to ensure that parking standards do not unduly
                constrain development of new shelters, Program 3.11 includes a commitment to review
                current standards and process a Code amendment as part of the General Plan and Zoning
                Code update process.
                Transitional and supportive housing are treated as residential uses subject only to those
                requirements that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone, in
                conformance with state law.
         •      Lemoore – Emergency shelters permitted by right without discretionary review in the
                Community Facilities (CF) zone and by CUP in the Light Industrial (ML) zone. Required
                standards include only those that apply to other uses in the same zone. Parcels within the
                CF zone encompass approximately 589 acres, including 6 vacant parcels totaling over 150
                acres, and provide adequate vacant and underutilized sites to accommodate the City’s need
                for additional shelter facilities.
                In most zoning districts, transitional and supportive housing are treated as residential uses
                subject only to those requirements that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type
                in the same zone. Program 4.10 is included in the Housing Plan to amend zoning
                regulations in conformance with state law.
         •      Kings County – The Development Code allows emergency shelters through a ministerial
                site plan review process in the Public Facilities (PF) zone and subject to a conditional use
                permit in Mixed Use zones, in conformance with permissible development standards under
                Government Code 65583(a)(4). The PF zone contains approximately 325 acres and has the
                capacity to accommodate additional shelters. Transitional and supportive housing for up to
                six persons are permitted subject only to those requirements that apply to other residential
                uses of the same type in the same zone. Program 5.8 is included in the Housing Plan to
                ensure consistency with state law.

Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
Single room occupancy (SRO) facilities are small studio-type apartment units, typically occupied by one
or two extremely-low-income persons. SROs may provide either private or shared kitchen and bathroom
facilities. Each jurisdiction’s policies regarding SROs are described below.
          •     Avenal - SROs are permitted by CUP in the Downtown Commercial (DC) and Service
                Commercial (SC) zones.
          •     Corcoran – SROs are permitted by CUP in all commercial zones (CN, CC, CH, CD, CS)
                and the Light Industrial (IL) zone.
          •     Hanford – SROs are permitted by CUP in the Office Residential (OR) zone.
          •     Lemoore – SROs are permitted by-right in the High Density Residential (RHD) zone and
                by CUP in the Downtown Mixed Use zones (DMX-1, DMX-2 and DMX-3).
          •     Kings County – SROs permitted by ministerial Site Plan Review in the CS, CH and CR
                districts.
These regulations help to encourage and facilitate the provision of small economical housing units for
persons with limited incomes and do not pose an unreasonable regulatory constraint.
          d.       Development Standards
The Kings County jurisdictions regulate the type, location, density, and scale of residential development
primarily through their zoning ordinances. Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the
health, safety, and general welfare of residents, as well as preserve the character and integrity of
neighborhoods. The Zoning Ordinance sets forth the specific residential development standards, described
below and summarized in Table 4-7.

Structural Standards
The permitted density of residential development varies between jurisdictions and zones. The maximum
allowable density ranges from 22 units per acre in Avenal and Hanford up to 29 units per acre in
Corcoran and Kings County. The wide range of densities allowed in Kings County jurisdictions facilitates
a variety of housing types ranging from single-family homes to multi-family apartment complexes.
Minimum lot sizes range from 3,000 square feet to 30,000 square feet for single-family residential zones
and from 2,000 to 7,000 square feet per unit for multi-family residential zones. The zoning ordinances
also regulate the size of residential structures through lot coverage and height limits. All Kings County
jurisdictions have reasonable structural limits with maximum heights ranging from 30 to 60 feet which
can accommodate three-story structures and maximum allowable densities in all jurisdictions. However,
due to market conditions no residential buildings taller than two stories have been built or proposed in any
Kings County jurisdictions except Hanford and Lemoore. Multi-family lot coverage requirements are
generous, and all jurisdictions allow coverage of at least 50% in multi-family zones. The single-family

zones allow lot coverage of at least 40%. Agricultural zones have a lower lot coverage limit due to the
predominant non-residential nature of these areas. These development standards are typical of other cities
in the San Joaquin Valley and are not considered to be a constraint to development.
Parking Requirements
The parking requirements for Kings County jurisdictions are summarized in Table 4-8. All jurisdictions
require 2 parking spaces for single-family detached units. Requirements for multi-family units vary based
on bedroom counts with studio and one-bedroom units typically requiring not more than 1.5 spaces per
unit. Although two covered spaces are required for multi-family units in Avenal, reductions in this ratio
have been reduced for projects that qualify for a density bonus, and Program 1.7 includes a commitment
to review parking standards as part of the General Plan and Development Code update.

Providing adequate parking is necessary to facilitate the sale or rental of a unit. Allowing too few spaces
limits the potential occupants of a unit. These parking requirements are designed to accommodate
multiple vehicles for households most likely to own more than one vehicle – households in single-family
homes and in apartments with two or more bedrooms. According to recent Census data, 77% of owner-
occupied units and 47% of renter units in Kings County have 2 or more vehicles. Therefore, requiring two
spaces per residence is a reasonable requirement and does not constrain development in Kings County.
          e.        Secondary Dwelling Units
Secondary dwelling units are attached or detached units that provide complete independent living
facilities for one or more persons including permanent provisions for living, sleeping, cooking, and
sanitation, located on the same lot as the primary structure. Second units often provide affordable housing
for extremely-low-, very-low- and low-income households, including seniors. Government Code
§65852.2 (AB 1866) requires jurisdictions to allow second units by-right (as permitted uses) in all single-
family zones unless specific findings are made. As shown in Table 4-2 through Table 4-6, second units
are permitted in single-family zones in all five jurisdictions.

Chapter 4. Constraints
Specific requirements for secondary units for each jurisdiction are summarized below.
         •      Avenal – The City of Avenal requires a ministerial permit review for second units to
                ensure consistency with the following standards set forth in the zoning code: 1) the floor
                area of the second unit shall not exceed 1,200 square feet or 30% of the primary structure,
                2) the height shall not exceed the height of the main dwelling, and 3) one additional
                parking space shall be provided. These regulations are consistent with AB 1866 and do not
                pose a constraint on second units.
         •      Corcoran – The City of Corcoran allows second units subject to ministerial review.
                Standards include: 1) the floor area of the second unit shall not exceed 1,200 square feet (if
                detached) or 30% of the primary structure (if attached), 2) the second unit must be
                integrated into the design of the main unit and conform to applicable development
                standards for the site, and 3) one additional parking space shall be provided for second
                units with one or two bedrooms, and two additional spaces for second units with three or
                more bedrooms.
         •      Hanford – The City of Hanford requires an administrative application for second units to
                ensure consistency with development standards set forth in the Zoning Code. These
                standards include: 1) maximum floor area of 1,200 square feet (if detached) or 30% of the
                primary structure (if attached) and minimum floor area of 150 square feet, 2) owner
                occupancy of the primary residence or the second unit, 3) at least one additional parking
                space (which may be tandem), and 4) compliance with the other regulations for the R, RM
                and OR districts, except as provided in the second housing units standards. These
                regulations are consistent with AB 1866 and do not pose a constraint on second units.
         •      Lemoore – The City of Lemoore requires an administrative permit for all second units to
                ensure consistency with development standards set forth in the zoning code. Second units
                are permitted on lots of at least 5,000 square feet. Either the primary unit or the second unit
                must be owner-occupied. Development standards include: 1) a floor area limit of 30% of
                the existing living area (interior habitable area) of the existing dwelling if attached and
                1,200 square feet if detached, 2) a prohibition on second units in planned unit
                developments unless approved as part of the project, 3) height limited to the height of the
                existing unit and 4) compliance with the height, building setbacks, lot coverage and zoning
                requirement generally applicable to the zone in which the property is located. These
                regulations are consistent with AB 1866 and do not pose a constraint on second units.
         •      Kings County – Kings County requires ministerial site plan review for second units to
                ensure consistency with develop standards set forth in the zoning code. These standards
                include: 1) a floor area limit of 30% of the existing living area if attached and 1,200 square
                feet if detached, 2) owner occupancy of the primary residence or the second unit, 3) at least
                one additional parking space, and 4) compliance with the other regulations for the R
                districts. These regulations are consistent with AB 1866 and do not pose a constraint on
                second units.
         f.       Density Bonus
Under current state law (SB 1818 of 2004), cities and counties must provide a density increase up to 35%
over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the Municipal Code and the Land Use
Element of the General Plan (or bonuses of equivalent financial value) when builders agree to construct
housing developments with units affordable to low- or moderate-income households. The density bonus
policies for each jurisdiction are discussed below.

         •      Avenal –Section 9.19.01(D) of the Avenal Zoning Ordinance establishes density bonus
                incentives and procedures in conformance with current state law. Use of the density bonus
                has been limited, however, since allowable densities are sufficient to facilitate affordable
                housing without requiring a density bonus.
         •      Corcoran – The 2014 Zoning Ordinance update defers to state density bonus law.
         •      Hanford – Sec. 17.39.040 of the Municipal Code establishes density bonus incentives and
                procedures in conformance with state law.
         •      Lemoore – The City completed a comprehensive update to the Zoning Code in 2013.
                Article G – Affordable Housing Incentives (Density Bonus) establishes standards and
                procedures in conformance with state density bonus law.
         •      Kings County – Article 22 of the Development Code establishes density bonus procedures
                in compliance with state law.
         g.        Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing
There is often an economy of scale in manufacturing homes in a plant rather than on site, thereby
reducing cost. State law precludes local governments from prohibiting the installation of mobile homes on
permanent foundations on single-family lots. It also declares a mobile home park to be a permitted land
use on any land planned and zoned for residential use, and prohibits requiring the average density in a
new mobile home park to be less than that permitted by the Municipal Code.
As described below, all jurisdictions allow for the development of manufactured housing, factory-built
housing and mobile homes, providing a valuable source of housing for seniors, families, as well as
farmworkers.
         •      Avenal – The City of Avenal permits mobile homes, factory-built housing and
                manufactured housing on permanent foundations subject to the same standards as apply to
                conventional single-family homes by-right in the A-I, A-E, R-E and R-1 zones and by CUP
                in the R-2 and R-3 zones. Although the Zoning Ordinance includes a Mobile Home Park
                (MHP) district, there is no land designated as such in the city. All existing MHPs are zoned
                R-1. As part of the comprehensive General Plan update, an amendment to regulations for
                mobile and manufactured housing will be processed to ensure that these uses are permitted
                subject to the same standards as apply to conventional housing, and existing mobile home
                parks are redesignated “MHP” (see Program 1.3).
         •      Corcoran – The City of Corcoran permits mobile homes and manufactured housing on
                permanent foundations by-right in any residential zone. New mobilehome parks are
                allowed by CUP in any residential zone and existing MHPs are located in single-family,
                multi-family, or service commercial zones.
         •      Hanford – The City of Hanford permits mobile homes and manufactured housing on
                permanent foundations subject to administrative approval in any residential zones. Mobile
                home parks are permitted in the RM-2 and RM-3 zones subject to a Conditional Use
                Permit.
         •      Lemoore – The City of Lemoore permits mobile homes and manufactured housing on
                permanent foundations in the same zones and subject to the same standards as apply to
                conventional homes. Mobile home parks are permitted by administrative permit or CUP in
                all residential zones except Agricultural-Residential (AR). The regulations do not
                unreasonably constrain production of this type of housing.

Chapter 4. Constraints
           •       Kings County – Kings County permits mobile homes and manufactured housing on
                   permanent foundations in the same zones and subject to the same standards as apply to
                   conventional homes. Manufactured housing communities or mobile home parks are
                   permitted in all residential zones with a conditional use permit.
2.         Residential Permit Processing and Environmental Review
Development review procedures exist to ensure that proposals for new residential development comply
with local regulations and are compatible with adjacent land uses. As shown in Table 4-9, processing
times for Kings County jurisdictions are relatively quick: single-family projects require one to eight
weeks, while multi-family projects typically require one to three months.

State planning and zoning law guides permit processing requirements for residential development. Within
the framework of state requirements, each jurisdiction has structured its development review process in
order to minimize the time required to obtain permits while ensuring that projects receive careful review.
A description of each jurisdiction’s permit and environmental review process is described below.
           •       Avenal – Residential subdivisions require approval of a tentative map by the Planning
                   Commission and a final map by the City Council. Typical processing time for a tentative
                   map is two to three months. Multi-family projects are subject only to Site Plan Review by
                   the Director, which must be approved within 30 days if the project’s site plan conforms to
                   the Zoning Ordinance. No findings are required other than conformance with the standards
                   contained in the Zoning Ordinance.
           •       Corcoran – Individual single-family homes can be built by-right in residential zones,
                   while subdivisions require Planning Commission approval of a tentative map and City
                   Council approval of a final map. Multi-family projects of any size in RM zones require

Housing Element                                                                           Avenal, Corcoran, Hanford and Lemoore

                                                                           A.    Governmental Constraints
                only Site Plan Review, which is approved by the Director with no public hearing. Free-
                standing multi-family residential projects are also permitted with only Site Plan Review in
                the Downtown Commercial (CD) and Professional Office (PO) zones, with the exception
                of projects with five or more units in the PO zone, which require a CUP. Findings required
                for Site Plan Review approval include 1) consistency with the General Plan and any
                applicable area plan, specific plan, community plan, or neighborhood plan; 2) compliance
                with all applicable provisions of the Zoning Code and Municipal Code; and 3) the project
                is arranged to avoid pedestrian and vehicular circulation hazards. (Sec. 11-23-3.F)
         •      Hanford – Residential subdivisions require approval of a tentative map by the Planning
                Commission and a final map by the City Council. Typical processing time for a tentative
                map is 45 to 60 days. For multi-family projects, a site plan review is required to enable the
                City to determine whether a proposed project conforms to the intent and provisions of the
                Zoning Ordinance, to guide the Building Official in the issuance of building permits, and to
                provide for the expeditious review of environmental impact assessments. The Community
                Development Department makes findings for approval provided the project complies with
                the following City policies: 1) traffic safety, street dedications, street improvements, and
                environmental quality, 2) zoning, fire, police, building and health codes, and public works
                construction standards; and 3) any other applicable federal, state or local requirements.
                Architectural review is required only for Planned Unit Development (PUD) overlays, and
                only one parcel in Hanford is designated as such. Developers follow objective guidelines
                and the Planning Commission approves the project.
         •      Lemoore – Residential subdivisions require approval of a tentative map by the Planning
                Commission and a final map by the City Council. Individual homes are approved
                administratively with only a building permit and no requirement for a public hearing.
                Multi-family projects require Planning Commission approval of a Major Site Plan and
                Architectural Review and applicable CEQA requirements. City staff provides a standard
                checklist of items to developers at the outset of a project. The purpose of the Site Plan
                Review process is to enable the City to determine whether a project conforms to the intent
                and provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, to guide the building official in permit issuance,
                and to provide for expeditious review of environmental assessments. Required findings for
                Major Site Plan Review approval include: 1) Consistency with the objectives of the general
                plan and applicable zoning regulations, specific plan provisions, and improvement
                standards; 2) The proposed architecture, site design, and landscape are suitable for the
                purposes of the building and the site and will enhance the character of the neighborhood
                and community; 3) The architecture, character, and scale of the building and the site are
                compatible with the character of buildings on adjoining and nearby properties; and 4) The
                proposed project will not create conflicts with vehicular, bicycle, or pedestrian
                transportation modes of circulation. (Sec. 9-2B-15.E) These findings facilitate development
                certainty by addressing the physical characteristics of the project and not the use itself. The
                typical time required for review and approval of multi-family projects is 60 to 90 days. As
                an example of the City’s review and approval process, the Cinnamon Villas affordable
                apartment project was approved in two phases in 2009 and 2014. Phase I was approved by
                the Planning Commission in approximately 2 months and Phase II was approved in
                approximately 6 weeks. These timeframes are reasonable and do not pose a constraint to
                housing development.
         •      Kings County – Kings County allows single-family and multi-family residential projects
                by-right in residential zones. No conditional use permits are required for residential uses.
                Moreover, Kings County does not require architectural review or design review. However,
                the County does require a ministerial standard site plan review for multi-family housing to

Chapter 4. Constraints
                 enable the County to determine whether a proposed project conforms to the intent and
                 provisions of the Development Code, to guide the Building Official in the issuance of
                 building permits, and to provide for the expeditious review of environmental impact
                 assessments. Processing times are largely a function of compliance with CEQA
                 requirements. Required findings for site plan approval include consistency with the General
                 Plan and Development Code. (Sec. 1603.C)
These procedures help to ensure that each jurisdiction’s development process meets all legal requirements
without causing a significant unwarranted constraint to housing development.
3.        Developer Fees, Improvement Requirements and Building Codes
State law limits fees charged for development permit processing to the reasonable cost of providing the
service for which the fee is charged. Various fees and assessments are charged by Kings County
jurisdictions and other public agencies to cover the costs of processing permit applications and providing
services and facilities such as schools, parks and infrastructure. Almost all of these fees are assessed
through a pro rata share system, based on the magnitude of a project’s impact or on the extent of the
benefit that will be derived.
After the passage of Proposition 13 and its limitation on local governments’ property tax revenues, cities
and counties have faced increasing difficulty in providing public services and facilities to serve their
residents. One of the main consequences of Proposition 13 has been the shift in funding of new
infrastructure from general tax revenues to development impact fees and improvement requirements on
land developers. Kings County jurisdictions require developers to provide on-site and off-site
improvements necessary to serve their projects. Such improvements may include water, sewer and other
utility extensions, street construction and traffic control device installation that are reasonably related to
the project. Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a project for rights-of-way, transit
facilities, recreational facilities, and school sites, consistent with the Subdivision Map Act.
State law prohibits the imposition of building standards that are not necessitated by local geographic,
climatic or topographic conditions, and requires that local governments making changes or modifications
in building standards must report such changes to the Department of Housing and Community
Development along with a finding with justification that the change is needed. Kings County
jurisdictions’ building codes are based upon the most recent California codes and are updated
periodically. These are considered the minimum necessary to protect the public's health, safety and
welfare. Although minor amendments have been incorporated to address local conditions, no additional
regulations have been imposed that would unnecessarily add to housing costs.
Additional information regarding development fees, improvement requirements, and building codes is
provided below.
          a.       Planning and Development Fees
Housing construction imposes short- and long-term infrastructure costs on communities. Short-term costs
include staffing for planning services and inspections. In addition, new residential developments can
result in significant long-term costs to maintain and improve infrastructure, public facilities, parks, and
streets. In response to the taxing constraints imposed by Proposition 13, many California cities have relied
increasingly on planning and development fees to fund services needed by new housing.
In Kings County, all jurisdictions collect planning and building fees for new development, as well as
impact fees to assist in the construction of new schools as necessary. In addition, the cities of Avenal,
2016-2024                                                4-20                             Kings County and Cities of
Housing Element                                                               Avenal, Corcoran, Hanford and Lemoore

                                                                                   A.     Governmental Constraints
Hanford, Corcoran, and Lemoore collect impact fees to help fund infrastructure improvements. The
impact fees include public safety (police and fire), water system supply and distribution, wastewater
collection/treatment, streets/thoroughfares, parks and recreation, and various others. Development within
special districts (either a community service district or public utility district) requires connection fees to
be paid to the respective special district where services were provided.
Table 4-10 presents the development processing and impact fees charged in each jurisdiction. According
to a 2001 statewide fee study 9, Kings County jurisdictions’ fees were lower than half of all jurisdictions in
the state. Based on current conditions, fees (both processing and impact) range from approximately 6% to
16% of the total cost of housing in Kings County. Given the current realities of local government fiscal
conditions, this is considered very modest and is not an unreasonable constraint to housing.
Residential projects may sometimes require the extension of water, sewer, and roads. In these cases, the
off-site improvements are more costly than traditional infill development. In Kings County, cities often
require the developer to pay for extending water and sewer infrastructure, but then allow the developer to
recapture up to 50% of the costs if infill projects developed within ten years are served by that
infrastructure extension that was oversized.

Chapter 4. Constraints
Developer impact fees are charged in some cases for certain improvements. In addition to paying impact
fees, a developer may provide needed public facilities and services through the creation of a special
assessment or infrastructure financing district, annexation to existing public utilities or community
services district, or raising of private capital to complete the needed improvements. These costs are
passed on to residents through prices or rents charged for new housing. In rural communities, new
development is required to be annexed into a city or community services district in order to obtain water
and sewer services.
          b.          Site Improvement Requirements
For new housing developments, all jurisdictions require installation of curbs, gutters, sidewalks, and street
lighting. Developments must also provide connections to water and wastewater systems, or provide wells
and septic tanks. Where roadways are not present, developers are required to construct all internal
roadways for a subdivision, and provide connections to existing roadways. Table 4-11 summarizes typical
improvements.

While site improvement requirements increase housing costs, they are typical for most jurisdictions.
Moreover, site improvements are necessary to maintain the quality of life desired by residents, and ensure
the availability of needed public services and facilities. Jurisdictions can mitigate the cost of these

improvement requirements by assisting affordable housing developers in obtaining state and federal
financing for their projects, or providing regulatory and financial incentives.
         c.        Building and Construction Codes
All Kings County jurisdictions have adopted the 2013 California Building Standards Code. The City of
Lemoore requires new homes to be pre-wired to facilitate aftermarket solar energy installations. No other
additional regulations have been imposed by the jurisdictions that would unnecessarily add to housing
costs.
Code enforcement programs are implemented through each jurisdiction’s Building Department, Planning
Department, Police Department or Public Works Department. Code enforcement staff investigates
violations of building code and property maintenance standards as well as other complaints. When
violations are identified, eligible property owners are referred to appropriate rehabilitation programs
providing grants or low-interest loans for property and building improvements. Each jurisdiction is
committed to increasing public awareness of rehabilitation and home improvement programs and to
coordinating these programs with code enforcement efforts. This commitment is reflected in Program 1
(Code Enforcement) of each jurisdiction’s Housing Plan. In addition, all Housing Plans for Kings County
jurisdictions have a housing rehabilitation program.

Chapter 4. Constraints
  B. Non-Governmental Constraints
1.        Environmental and Infrastructure Constraints
Environmental and infrastructure issues affect the amount, location, and timing of new residential
development. New housing opportunities create challenges regarding public infrastructure extensions and
expansions, and encroachment into agricultural land. In addition, the availability of adequate water,
public infrastructure such as wells and wastewater treatment facilities, and other public services and
facilities can impact the feasibility of new residential development. This section analyzes the potential
environmental and infrastructure constraints to housing development in Kings County.
          a.      Agricultural Lands
The California Land Conservation Act, (commonly referred
to as the “Williamson” Act) was adopted by the state
legislature in 1965 to protect agricultural, wetland, and
scenic areas of the state from unnecessary or premature
conversion to urban uses. The Williamson Act explicitly
pronounces the State’s responsibility for protecting its
agricultural industry from stagnation and recession. The
agricultural industry is critical to the economy of Kings
County, and its agricultural preserve program was first
implemented in 1969.
To that end, Kings County has several mechanisms that serve to protect farmland from premature
urbanization. Conservation or Farmland Security Zone Contracts provide that property may not be used
by the owner, or their successors, for any purpose other than the production of agricultural products for
commercial purposes. The minimum timeframe of a Land Conservation Contract cannot be less than 10
years. Farmland Security Zone contracts cannot be less than 20 years. Both contracts automatically renew
one additional year and the automatic renewal continues indefinitely unless a notice of non-renewal is
filed.
As discussed in Chapter 3 and Appendix B – Land Inventory, the sites identified for housing development
are not encumbered with Williamson Act contracts, nor are any sites located within Farmland Security
Zones. Thus, all sites proposed for development are not constrained by agricultural land use conservation
contracts.
          b.      Wastewater Infrastructure
Wastewater service for residential development in King County is provided by public sewers in the
incorporated cities and the unincorporated community service districts (CSDs). In rural areas of the
County, wastewater service is not provided and residential developments rely on individual septic
systems. An analysis of sewer capacity in Kings County jurisdictions and the capacity to accommodate
growth commensurate with the RHNA for the 2016-2024 Housing Element planning period is provided
below.
          •     Avenal – The City of Avenal provides sewer service to its urbanized areas and the Avenal

                                                                      B.     Non-Governmental Constraints
                southeast Avenal. Based on projected population growth the City’s portion of treatment
                plant reserve capacity will not be fully utilized until the year 2024 under average flow
                conditions.
         •      Corcoran – Corcoran’s wastewater is collected and conveyed to the City’s treatment plant,
                located at the intersection of King Avenue and Pueblo Avenue, in the southeastern portion
                of the City. This facility provides secondary level treatment. Corcoran State Prison has its
                own wastewater treatment facility. The City’s wastewater treatment plant has been
                expanded in recent years to accommodate population growth as outlined in the General
                Plan. The City continues to plan for expansion of the wastewater treatment facility as part
                of its Capital Improvement Program and Wastewater Collection Master Plan as necessary
                to include alternative analysis of water reclamation facilities. New development is
                responsible for construction of all sewer lines serving the development. Adequate treatment
                plant capacity is projected through the planning period.
         •      Hanford – Hanford’s wastewater treatment plant has a design capacity of 8 million gallons
                per day (8 MGD) with a current inflow to the plant of approximately 5 MGD. There is
                sufficient capacity at the plant to support city growth for the foreseeable future. Hanford’s
                wastewater treatment plant was recently expanded to provide additional capacity for city
                growth through 2016. To allow for growth east of the City’s boundaries, either a major new
                interceptor line will be installed to connect this area with the wastewater treatment plant or
                a satellite tertiary wastewater treatment plant must be built. These improvements will either
                be funded through impact fees or provided by developers to ensure adequate capacity to
                accommodate development. Thus, adequate capacity will be available to serve new
                residential development commensurate with the regional housing production goals.
         •      Lemoore – Lemoore requires all new developments to connect to the City’s sewer system.
                Single-family homes on lots of at least one-acre, which were previously allowed to use
                private septic systems, are now required to connect to sewer systems to prevent
                groundwater contamination. Lemoore’s wastewater system has adequate capacity to serve
                projected development through the end of the planning period. New trunk lines and
                collectors must be planned in areas of the city where growth is expected to occur. Such
                improvements will be funded through wastewater impact fees.
         •      Unincorporated County – Wastewater treatment capacity is more limited in
                unincorporated communities than in the cities. In most of the unincorporated areas,
                wastewater treatment services are not provided, and residential development relies on
                individual septic systems. However, the Armona, Kettleman City and Stratford District
                areas are each served by that Districts wastewater treatment system. The Stratford Public
                Utility District is able to service only existing connections. The community districts of
                Armona, Home Garden, and Kettleman City have adequate wastewater treatment
                capabilities. Home Garden contracts with the City of Hanford for wastewater treatment.
         c.        Water Availability and Infrastructure
The availability of water to serve residential development is an important prerequisite for determining the
ability of sites to accommodate housing commensurate with the regional housing needs production goals
during the 2016-2024 planning period. The availability of water to serve additional growth in each
jurisdiction is discussed below. Pursuant to Government Code Sec. 65589.7, water and sewer providers
are required to grant priority to developments that include lower-income units, and jurisdictions are
required to provide copies of their Housing Elements to water and sewer providers within their
boundaries immediately upon adoption.

Chapter 4. Constraints
         •      Avenal – The City of Avenal uses imported water supplied from the San Luis Canal as part
                of the federal Central Valley Project. Based on the Avenal Water Master Plan, the City is
                projected to have a sufficient supply of imported water to meet growth demands and
                regional housing needs through the planning period, although it is difficult to predict future
                water supplies with certainty due to the current drought.
         •      Corcoran – Corcoran relies upon five groundwater wells located in a well field northeast
                of the City to meet all domestic, commercial, and industrial water demands. To prevent
                aquifer overdrafting, Corcoran participates in groundwater recharge activities, has adopted
                water conservation ordinances, and treats/reuses wastewater effluent for irrigation at
                Corcoran State Prison. The City has sufficient existing and planned groundwater supply to
                serve the City’s regional housing needs and maximum population projected at buildout of
                the General Plan without depletion of the aquifer.
         •      Hanford – Hanford and surrounding urban areas rely on local groundwater from the San
                Joaquin Valley Groundwater Basin to meet all domestic, commercial, and industrial water
                demand. The City also maintains drainage basins to percolate storm water and excess
                domestic water year-round to recharge the aquifer. Approximately one-half the potable
                water consumed by urban users is for outdoor water use such as landscape irrigation. The
                other half is utilized by consumers for indoor use. Indoor wastewater is delivered to the
                City’s wastewater treatment plant where it is treated, disinfected, and delivered to the
                Lakeside Irrigation District (by agreement) for reuse as agricultural irrigation water. The
                City’s Urban Water Management Plan identifies adequate water through the planning
                period to serve regional housing needs and anticipated urban growth.
         •      Lemoore – The City of Lemoore provides water service within its corporate limits from
                seven wells. According to the 2008 General Plan, projected average day demand is
                expected to be within the current supply capacity needed to meet the City’s share of
                regional housing needs for the planning period. As the City grows in accordance with
                General Plan projections, demand will eventually exceed the supply available from existing
                wells. At that time, the City may need to drill additional wells to serve new development.
                Lemoore is in the process of complying with new groundwater management regulations,
                but enforcement is still uncertain, so there is no known restriction on the number of wells
                that may be drilled inside the City limits. The City also encourages conservation measures
                to decrease demand. Because the City lies above a semi-confined aquifer, groundwater
                recharge is accomplished by up-basin stream recharge.
         •      Unincorporated County – The Kettleman City Community Services District (KCCSD)
                provides water to the unincorporated community of Kettleman City from two groundwater
                wells. The KCCSD has established a moratorium on new commercial and residential
                development until a new surface water treatment plant can be constructed which will treat
                water from the California Aqueduct. It is currently anticipated that construction of the new
                water treatment plant will begin in early 2016 and be completed in 2018.
                The Armona Community Services District (ACSD) provides water services in the
                unincorporated community from two groundwater wells. The ACSD has established a
                moratorium on new commercial and residential development until water system
                improvements or an imported water source is identified.
                Neither the KCCSD nor the ACSD are restricted in the amount of groundwater wells that
                can be drilled. The KCCSD and ACSD Capital Facilities Plans include the provision of
                new wells and additional water storage capacity to accommodate buildout of the General
                Plan land use policies. As demand for water supply increases with population growth, these

                                                                       B.     Non-Governmental Constraints
                community service districts will drill new wells and construct additional water storage
                facilities in accordance with their Capital Facilities Plans.
                Home Garden Community Service District (HGCSD) can support limited infill
                development and currently has undetermined capacity for future water connections.
                Stratford Public Utility District (SPUD) has three existing wells, however only two are
                operational and one will be abandoned soon and can support limited infill development.
                The existing capacity will not support large-scale development within the community and
                new sources of potable water will be needed.
                Although some water supply restrictions currently exist, they are not expected to preclude
                new residential development commensurate with regional housing needs in unincorporated
                areas during the 2016-2024 planning period. As indicated in Appendix B, the
                unincorporated County’s potential lower-income sites are evenly distributed among the
                four Community Service District areas.
2.       Land and Construction Costs
Land and construction costs contribute to the cost and
affordability of housing. However, these market factors are
largely beyond the control of local jurisdictions.
While land costs are primarily controlled by regional location,
cities and counties can influence per-unit land costs through
allowable densities. As discussed in the Governmental
Constraints section, all of the jurisdictions in Kings County
allow residential development at sufficient densities to
accommodate market demand.
Like land costs, construction costs are not significantly affected
by local policies. The price of materials and labor are affected
by regional, national and international forces. Construction
costs depend on the type of home as well as amenities, materials used, and quality of construction.
Jurisdictions have several means to reduce the cost of housing construction, improve housing
affordability, and expand housing opportunities for more residents. Using prefabricated or manufactured
housing is one way to reduce construction costs. All Kings County jurisdictions have policies to facilitate
the use of manufactured housing.
Local building code requirements could also affect the cost of new housing. All Kings County
jurisdictions have adopted the California Building Code and no local amendments have been adopted that
would significantly increase the cost of construction.
In some portions of Lemoore, mitigation is needed to comply with FEMA flood hazard regulations or to
provide noise insulation in homes impacted by aircraft overflight from the Naval Air Station Lemoore.
While these measures will increase constructions costs, they are at least partially offset by creating
additional areas for residential development, thereby increasing the potential supply of housing.
3.       Cost and Availability of Financing
Kings County jurisdictions are similar to most other communities with regard to private sector home
financing programs. The financial crisis that began in 2008 has affected the availability of real estate

Avenal, Corcoran, Hanford and Lemoore                                                        Housing Element

Chapter 4. Constraints
loans, and although interest rates in the past several years have been at historic low levels for those with
good credit, most lower-income households have difficulty qualifying for home loans.
Under state law, it is illegal for real estate lending institutions to discriminate against entire
neighborhoods in lending practices because of the physical or economic conditions in the area
(“redlining”). In monitoring new construction sales, re-sales of existing homes, and permits for
remodeling, there is no evidence of redlining in Kings County.
   C. Fair Housing
State law prohibits discrimination in the development process or in real property transactions, and it is
each jurisdiction’s policy to uphold the law in this regard. In Kings County, fair housing complaints are
referred to different agencies depending on the jurisdiction. The cities of Corcoran and Lemoore refer fair
housing complaints to the HUD Fair Housing Enforcement Center in San Francisco. The cities of
Corcoran and Lemoore also refer housing complaints to Tulare/Kings County Legal Aid. Kings County,
Avenal, Hanford and Lemoore refer fair housing complaints to the Human Rights/Fair Housing
Commission office in Fresno. Each jurisdiction’s efforts to support fair housing are described in the
Housing Plan (Chapter 5).
In 2014, the San Joaquin Valley Fair Housing and Equity Assessment report 10 (SJVFHEA) was produced
for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Sustainable Housing and
Communities. The report analyzes patterns in racial and economic segregation, discusses how segregation
impacts individuals and families’ ability to access opportunity, and proposes strategies and
recommendations to create more equitable and integrated communities. Although Hanford is the only
jurisdiction specifically addressed in the report, the recommendations are relevant to all portions of Kings
County.
The SJVFHEA report considers a wide range of issues, some of which are beyond the scope of Housing
Elements, but many of its recommendations are reflected in the housing programs for each jurisdiction
(see Chapter 5). Among these are programs that help to reduce geographic barriers for low-income
households and integrate affordable housing opportunities into all portions of the jurisdictions.

Chapter 5.                        Housing Plan
The earlier chapters of the Housing Element describe the housing needs, resources and constraints for the
five jurisdictions in Kings County. This Housing Plan sets forth a comprehensive strategy and program of
actions to address the housing issues identified within the cities of Avenal, Corcoran, Hanford, Lemoore,
and the unincorporated areas of Kings County.
Section A highlights the major housing issues identified in Kings County and corresponding goals and
policies to address those issues. Section B sets forth the specific programs to be implemented by the cities
of Avenal, Corcoran, Hanford, Lemoore, and unincorporated Kings County to effectively implement the
goals and policies.
  A. Goals and Policies
1.       Housing and Neighborhood Conservation
Improving the condition of housing is a primary housing goal for many communities. Although the
majority of homes in each community are in sound condition, there is a need for repair, improvement, and
rehabilitation of many homes, particularly older “Farmers Home” units and mobile homes as well as older
multi-family complexes. Thus a primary goal of the Housing Element is to continue to support policies
and programs for improving housing and residential neighborhoods.
GOAL 1.            Improve and maintain the quality of housing and residential neighborhoods.
                   Policy 1.1. Promote and improve the quality of residential properties by ensuring
                   compliance with housing and property maintenance standards.
                   Policy 1.2. Assist in the repair, rehabilitation, and improvement of residential structures;
                   demolish and replace structures which are dilapidated and beyond repair.
                   Policy 1.3. Invest in infrastructure and public facilities to ensure that adequate water,
                   sewer, roads, parks, and other needed services are in place to serve existing and future
                   residential developments.
                   Policy 1.4. Preserve assisted rental housing for long-term occupancy by low- and
                   moderate-income households.
2.       Housing Production
Like most other areas in the San Joaquin Valley, growth and development in Kings County is expected to
continue in the foreseeable future. The Housing Element sets forth policies to encourage the production of
high quality housing that meets identified housing needs, further stimulates economic development, and
improves residential neighborhoods.
Kings County and Cities of                              5-1                                           2016-2024

Chapter 5. Housing Plan
GOAL 2.           Facilitate and encourage the provision of a range of housing types and prices to
                  meet the diverse needs of residents.
                  Policy 2.1. Provide adequate sites for housing through appropriate land use, zoning and
                  development standards to accommodate the regional housing needs for the current
                  planning period.
                  Policy 2.2. Work collaboratively with nonprofit and for-profit developers to seek state
                  and federal grants to support the production of affordable housing.
                  Policy 2.3. Ensure the adequate provision of water, sewer, roads, public facilities, and
                  other infrastructure necessary to serve new housing.
                  Policy 2.4. Support the construction of high quality single- and multi-family housing
                  which is well designed and energy efficient.
3.       Housing Constraints
Market factors and government regulations can have a significant impact on the cost of new housing.
Although market factors are largely beyond the influence of local governments, Kings County
jurisdictions can continue to implement responsive programs to mitigate the impact of market conditions
and governmental regulations.
GOAL 3.           Remove or mitigate, to the extent feasible and appropriate, potential governmental
                  constraints to the production, maintenance, improvement and affordability of
                  housing.
                  Policy 3.1. Offer regulatory and/or financial incentives, as available and appropriate, to
                  encourage the construction of quality housing.
                  Policy 3.2. Periodically review local ordinances and building regulations to ensure that
                  they do not unduly impede housing investment.
                  Policy 3.3. Utilize planned developments and other creative mechanisms to facilitate the
                  construction of more creative, well-designed, housing projects.
                  Policy 3.4. Ensure that developments are processed efficiently to minimize holding costs
                  and comply with the Permit Streamlining Act.
4.       Housing Assistance
Certain groups may have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to unique
circumstances. Persons with special needs include low- and moderate-income households, military
personnel, seniors, persons with disabilities, large families, people who are homeless, single-parent
households, and farmworkers. Kings County jurisdictions remain committed to assisting people of all
walks of life in securing adequate housing.
GOAL 4.           Provide housing assistance to extremely-low-, very-low-, low-, and moderate-income
                  households and those with special housing needs.
                  Policy 4.1. Support the provision of rental assistance to provide affordable housing
                  options for extremely-low-, very-low- and low-income households.
                  Policy 4.2. Participate in efforts to expand homeownership opportunities to lower- and
                  moderate-income households through downpayment assistance and other
                  homeownership programs.

                                                                                     A.   Goals and Policies
                   Policy 4.3. Support the provision of housing suitable for special needs groups, including
                   seniors, people with disabilities, homeless people, military personnel, large households,
                   single-parent families, and farmworkers.
                   Policy 4.4. Develop and maintain collaborative efforts among nonprofits, for-profit
                   developers, and public agencies to encourage the development, maintenance, and
                   improvement of housing.
5.       Fair and Equal Housing Opportunities
Fair and equal housing opportunity is a continuing need in Kings County to ensure that all persons,
regardless of their status, have the opportunity to find a suitable home. Mediating tenant/landlord
disputes, investigating complaints of discrimination, providing education services, and improving public
awareness are all part of a comprehensive fair housing program.
GOAL 5.            Further equal housing opportunities for persons, regardless of status.
                   Policy 5.1.      Support enforcement of fair housing laws prohibiting arbitrary
                   discrimination in the development, financing, rental, or sale of housing.
                   Policy 5.2.      Periodically review City ordinances and development regulations and
                   modify, as necessary, to accommodate housing for disabled persons.

arrived in the Kettleman Hills during the 1850s with the dream of raising
cattle and farming. Oil, however, would bring fame, fortune, and people to
Avenal. In 1929, Standard Oil surveyed the current site of Avenal to build a
town. By 1940, Avenal was the second largest town in Kings County with a
population of 3,000 – mostly oil workers – and was known for some of the
best services and schools in California. During the 1940s, however, the
decline of oil and gas production affected Avenal's economy, and many
stores and houses were vacated.
                                                   Avenal’s transition began
                                                   when agricultural workers came to the area. During the
                                                   1970s, the completion of the California Aqueduct
                                                   provided needed water and completion of I-5 brought
                                                   new business opportunities. Following incorporation in
                                                   1979, the City attracted a state prison in 1987, and later
                                                   annexed the I-269/I-5 interchange and zoned the area for
                                                   commercial and industrial development.
                                                   Community development will play an important role in
                                                   Avenal’s future. New quality housing is needed to attract
              Avenal State Prison                  employees of Avenal State Prison, Coalinga State
                                                   Mental Hospital, and other future employers.
Rehabilitation and infrastructure programs are needed to
improve the quality of neighborhoods and foster identity
and pride. Assisting residents in securing affordable
rental and ownership housing remains a priority for
Avenal. The Housing Element plays an important role in
Avenal by guiding community development programs
which will define and shape the City’s future through
2024.
1.1      Code Enforcement
Code enforcement is an important means to preserve
public health and safety and ensure that the character and                  El Palmar Apartments
quality of neighborhoods and housing is maintained. To
that end, the City’s Code Enforcement staff under the
Public Works department will work to enforce state and local regulations. In conjunction with code
enforcement activities, City staff will provide information to homeowners regarding the City’s Housing
Rehabilitation Program (Program 1.2).
       Objective:                   Continue to work with the community to address code violations. Refer
                                    property owners to the Housing Rehabilitation Program.

1.2      Housing Rehabilitation Program
In collaboration with a housing partner, the City will
continue providing rehabilitation loans to lower-
income households, including very-low- and
extremely-low-income persons. Initiated in 1988
with CDBG funds, the Housing Rehabilitation
Program will provide loans for up to $190,430 for
most types of housing repairs, energy conservation
improvements, and handicapped accessibility
devices.
      Objective:                 Continue to provide
                                 between 6 to 12
                                 loans per year.

1.3      Preservation of At-Risk Affordable Housing and Mobile Home Parks
The City will work with interested agencies and community organizations to preserve at-risk units by
monitoring their status, providing technical and/or financial assistance in return for extended affordability
controls, and ensuring proper tenant notification prior to project conversion. As noted in Chapter 2,
Avenal has 317 units of affordable housing created through City, state, and federal programs, some of
which serve very-low- and extremely-low-income persons, and none are at risk for conversion during the
next 10 years.
In addition, as part of the comprehensive General Plan and Zoning Ordinance update the City will
redesignate existing mobile home parks from R-1 to MHP to facilitate preservation of this important
source of affordable housing, and ensure that manufactured and factory-built housing on permanent
foundations are permitted subject to the same standards as apply to conventional housing.
      Objective:                 Continue to monitor at-risk units; preserve mobile home parks.

1.4      Adequate Sites
The City will facilitate the production of new housing to accommodate demand commensurate with the
City’s share of regional housing needs. To that end, the Housing Element identifies “adequate” sites to
accommodate the City’s regional housing needs allocation identified as 639 units (73 extremely-low, 72
very-low, 108 low, 115 moderate, and 271 above moderate income affordability) during the current
2016-2024                                            5-6                               Kings County and Cities of

1.5       Infill Development
The City will continue to support infill development for homes and mobile homes in residential zones.
Infill lots are being extensively used in Avenal for new development. The City works with developers to
complete variances that allow more infill lots to be created and used. The City will provide an inventory
at the public counter on the location of infill sites that are adequately served by infrastructure and suitable
for residential development.
        Objective:                  Facilitate infill development by providing the location and zoning of
                                    residential infill sites in the community and working with developers to

The City assists developers of affordable housing by reducing or deferring development fees, reducing
processing times, and providing assistance with grant applications. The City will continue providing
regulatory and financial assistance to facilitate the development of affordable housing to extremely-low-,
very-low-, low-, and moderate-income households. In addition, as part of the General Plan and
Development Code update the City will review parking standards for smaller multi-family units and
reduce the current requirement for two covered spaces in order to facilitate production of housing for
small households.

1.8      First Time Homebuyer Program
In collaboration with a housing partner, Avenal will continue to provide home ownership opportunities to
new low-income homebuyers through the First Time Homebuyer Program. Initiated in 2000, this program
provides up to $130,000 in a deferred silent second loan to subsidize mortgage payments and closing
costs. Residents must provide a $1,000 down payment and qualify for a home loan. The City will
continue to apply for CDBG funds to provide assistance to first-time homebuyers.

1.10     Affordable Housing Assistance
The City works with nonprofit groups, such as Self-Help
Enterprises, to build and/or rehabilitate housing affordable to
lower-income households. The City receives CDBG and
HOME funds for these efforts. Affordable housing has been
developed under existing zoning and development standards,
without the need for density bonus, although in some cases the
City provides financial assistance to projects in the form of fee
waivers and regulatory incentives. To continue supporting
affordable housing, especially units for very-low- and
extremely-low-income persons, the City will undertake the
following actions.

1.14     Farmworker and Employee Housing
Farmworker housing is an important issue in the Central
Valley. Since Avenal has some of the lowest housing
prices and apartment rents in California, the need for
farmworker housing is largely met by traditional
housing. The City of Avenal actively assists
farmworker housing needs: the majority of homeowner-
ship loans are made to farmworkers and a majority of
units in assisted multi-family projects are occupied by
farmworkers. Many of the farmworkers served by these
programs have very-low or extremely-low incomes.
In addition, the Zoning Code complies with Health and
Safety Code §17021.5 and §17021.6 regarding
farmworker housing.
      Objectives:                1.      Continue to ensure that the Zoning Code conforms with §17021.5

2.       Corcoran Housing Programs
Corcoran’s history dates to the early 1900s. The town
site originally served as a junction for the San
Francisco Railroad and San Joaquin Valley Railroad.
Later developers found Corcoran’s climate and soil
ideal for farming, particularly cotton, and grazing. In
subsequent years, Corcoran grew rapidly with the rise
of the cotton industry – attracting workers to its
booming agricultural industry. In 1914, the town of
Corcoran incorporated and continues to be known as
the farming capital of California.
                                                  During the 1960s, the mechanization of cotton planting
                                                  and harvesting caused a significant loss of jobs,
                                                  residents, and economic vitality in Corcoran. Still the
                                                  City remains a center of agriculture. J.G. Boswell
                                                  Company, the nation's largest cotton producer, operates
                                                  major farming operations in Corcoran. In 1988 and
                                                  1997, the City attracted two state prisons providing
                                                  3,200 jobs. In 2001, the City attracted Bioproducts, a
                                                  world-leading manufacturer of nutritional animal food
                                                  product supplements. The City also adopted a
                                                  Downtown Specific Plan to revitalize its historic town
                                                  center.
             Corcoran State Prison
In addition to ongoing economic programs,
community development also plays an ongoing
important role in defining Corcoran’s future. The
City has undertaken several rehabilitation
programs to improve older farmer housing,
revitalize neighborhoods, improve infrastructure,
and renovate the downtown. New quality housing
is also needed for employees of Corcoran State
Prison and to attract other employers. Providing
housing assistance so that residents can afford
quality rental and ownership housing continues as
a priority.
Corcoran’s Housing Element plays an important
role by setting forth community development programs that will define and shaping the City’s future
through 2024.
2.1      Code Enforcement

2.3      Housing Rehabilitation Program
The City will continue providing rehabilitation loans to lower-income households through the Housing
Rehabilitation Program. Initiated in 1981, the Housing Rehabilitation Program provides loans for up to
the maximum allowed by HCD for most housing repairs, demolition/reconstruction, energy conservation
improvements, and handicapped accessibility devices. Health and safety grants of up to $7,500 are
provided to correct minor repairs or improve handicap accessibility for very low and low income
households.
      Objective:                   Provide loans and grants as funding allows. Continue to market the
                                   program through brochures at the public counter. Conduct outreach to
                                   major employers (e.g., hospital, school district, and prisons) regarding
                                   the program.

2.4      Preservation of At-Risk Affordable Housing
The City continues to work with interested agencies and
community organizations to preserve at-risk units by
monitoring their status, providing technical and/or
financial assistance in return for extended affordability
controls, and ensuring proper tenant notification prior to
project conversion. Corcoran has 593 units of affordable
housing for very-low-, low-, and moderate-income
households created through various City, state, and
federal programs. None of these housing projects is at-
risk for conversion to market rate during the next 10
years. The City will continue to monitor the status of
publicly-assisted affordable units and work with the
project owners and interested non-profit organizations
to preserve projects that may become at-risk of
conversion.
       Objective:                   Continue to monitor the status of publicly-assisted affordable units. The
                                    City will contact the property owners to determine their intentions,
                                    contact qualified nonprofits regarding potential opt-out projects, ensure
                                    that property owners comply with noticing requirements, support the
                                    acquisition of at-risk properties by nonprofits, and pursue grants to
                                    support the preservation of affordable at-risk housing.

2.5      Adequate Sites
The City will facilitate construction of new housing to accommodate projected employment and
population growth and to meet the needs of existing residents. To that end, the Housing Element
identifies adequate sites to accommodate the City’s share of the region’s housing needs allocation
identified as 946 units (215 very low, 161 low, 169 moderate, and 401 above moderate) for the new
planning period. Adequate sites are those with sufficient development and density standards, water and
sewer services, and adequate infrastructure. In order to encourage development of smaller sites, the City
will encourage lot consolidation through fee reductions and concurrent processing of lot mergers for
multi-family projects that include units affordable to lower-income households.
       Objective:                   Maintain appropriate land use designations to provide adequate sites
                                    appropriate for new housing to meet Corcoran’s housing needs allocation
                                    of 946 units. Work with downtown property owners to facilitate the
                                    conversion of underutilized commercial buildings for residential use.
                                    Facilitate development of smaller sites through lot mergers.

2.7      Affordable Housing Development Assistance
The City facilitates the development of affordable housing through a number of tools including density
bonuses, minimal fee requirements (no impact fees), and PUD development standards. The City will
continue to provide regulatory and financial assistance to facilitate and encourage the development of
housing affordable to extremely-low-, very-low-, low-, and moderate-income households commensurate
with its fair share housing needs, as well as housing for persons with special needs such as developmental
disabilities. SROs, transitional and supportive housing projects in particular can help to address the needs
of extremely-low-income persons and those with disabilities. In addition, the City will facilitate the
improvement and redevelopment of underutilized properties by encouraging consolidation of adjacent
parcels through expedited processing, modified development standards and reduced development fees
when such projects include affordable housing. To facilitate the development of affordable housing, the
City will approve projects at or above the maximum allowable density pursuant to state density bonus law
and continue to identify rezoning opportunities for additional High Density residential development.
       Objective:                  Seek applicable grants from state and federal sources (e.g., CDBG,

       Objective:                   Corcoran will coordinate with Kings County to select a local fair housing
                                    agency to provide landlord/tenant mediation services and fair housing
                                    investigations. The City will develop a fair housing brochure in Spanish
                                    and English or acquire one from a local fair housing provider. To
                                    broadly disseminate information, the City will distribute the brochure at
                                    the City Hall, the City website, library, post office, and appropriate
                                    shopping areas.

2.15     Weatherization and Energy-Efficient Home Improvements
The purpose of this program is to reduce energy use by providing financial assistance to lower-income
households for weatherization and energy-efficient heating (including solar photovoltaic water heaters)
and cooling systems. The City will refer lower-income households to the Kings Community Action
Organization and other community services agencies that provide financial assistance to qualifying
households for these improvements.
       Objective:                   Reduce residential energy use and carbon footprint by providing
                                    financial assistance to lower-income households for weatherization and
                                    energy-efficient heating and cooling systems.

3.       Hanford Housing Programs
Hanford had its roots in the expansion of the Central and
Southern Pacific Railroad system in the 1870s. Hanford
was incorporated in 1891. As the County seat, Hanford has
developed into the residential, commercial, and industrial
center of the County. Hanford is known to embrace growth
and change, while preserving the integrity of its past.
Hanford’s progressive business community coupled with
the quaint, comfortable lifestyle continues to attract new
people to Hanford, young or old.
                                                                          Hanford Civic Auditorium
                                                Hanford’s location along Highway 198 and pro-business
                                                climate contribute to the City’s success. Hanford is home to
                                                the County’s largest employers such as Kings County

                                                opportunities. The City’s Enterprise Zone, Foreign Trade
                                                Zone, and Industrial Park offer incentives for new business.
                                                The Housing Element plays a key role in shaping the City’s
           Downtown Hanford                     future. Continued development of housing is important to
                                                accommodate expected population and employment growth
                                                within the city. Community development programs
strengthen neighborhoods by providing assistance to maintain and upgrade housing. Housing assistance
programs ensure that residents of all income levels have the opportunity to live in the community. The
Housing Element sets the framework for building upon the City’s past successes in providing a diverse
living environment.
3.1      Code Compliance
Code compliance is an important means to preserve public health and safety and ensure that the character
and quality of neighborhoods and housing is maintained. To that end, the City’s Code Compliance staff
under the Community Development Department will work to enforce state and local regulations. In
conjunction with code compliance activities, City staff will provide information to homeowners regarding
the City’s Housing Rehabilitation Program.
       Objective:                   Continue to work with the community concerning code violations. Refer
                                    property owners to the Housing Rehabilitation Program.

3.2      Housing Rehabilitation Program
The City will continue providing rehabilitation
loans to lower-income households. Initiated in
1985, the Housing Rehabilitation Program
provides loans for up to $90,000 for housing
repairs, energy conservation improvements, and
handicapped accessibility devices. In addition
the City offers an Emergency Repair Program,
with grants up to $10,000. Hanford has
designated southwest and central Hanford as
“target areas” for this program.
       Objective:                Assist 10 to 15
                                 units per year if funds are available

       Timeline:                 Throughout the planning period
3.3      Preservation of At-Risk Affordable Housing
The City will continue to work with interested agencies and community organizations to preserve at-risk
units by monitoring their status, providing technical and/or financial assistance in return for extended
affordability controls, and ensuring proper tenant notification prior to project conversion. Hanford has
approximately 766 units of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households created through
City, state, and federal programs. Although none of the projects is considered to be at risk of converting
to market-rate housing during the next 10 years, the City will continue to monitor the status of these
projects.
       Objective:                Continue to monitor the status of publicly-assisted affordable units. The
                                 City will contact the property owners to determine their intentions,
                                 contact qualified nonprofits regarding potential opt-out projects, ensure
                                 that property owners comply with noticing requirements, support the
                                 acquisition of at-risk properties by nonprofits, and pursue grants to
                                 support the preservation of affordable at-risk housing.

3.4      Adequate Sites
The City will facilitate construction of new housing
to accommodate projected employment and
population growth to meet the needs of the City’s
residents. To that end, the Housing Element identifies
“adequate” sites to accommodate the City’s share of
the regional housing needs allocation identified as
4,832 units (1,097 very-low, 821 low, 865 moderate,
and 2,049 above-moderate) during the planning
2016-2024                                            5-22                             Kings County and Cities of

                                                                          B.3   Hanford Housing Programs
period. Adequate sites are those with sufficient development and density standards, water and sewer
services, and other infrastructure. Staff will monitor development affordability and report annually on
progress toward the City’s share of the regional housing need.
The City is currently preparing a comprehensive General Plan update, which is expected to be completed
in early 2016. In order to enhance opportunities for affordable housing development, allowable densities
are proposed to be increased to 20 units/acre in the Medium Density Residential category and 29
units/acre in the High Density Residential category.
The City will also encourage affordable housing development on small parcels by facilitating lot
consolidation through expedited processing, density bonus and/or reduced processing fees.
       Objective:                   Facilitate the construction of new housing through the provision of
                                    adequately zoned sites to meet Hanford’s housing needs allocation of
                                    4,832 units.
                                    Increase allowable densities for multi-family development as part of the
                                    comprehensive General Plan update.

3.5      Density Bonus Program
In accordance with state law, Hanford adopted a local density bonus ordinance in 2008 that is in
conformance with state law. The City will continue to implement this program to encourage and facilitate
development of affordable housing through the provision of density bonuses or other incentives for
qualifying projects.
       Objective:                   Continue to publicize and implement the density bonus ordinance to
                                    assist development of affordable housing.

3.6      Planned Unit Development
The Hanford General Plan includes a Planned Unit Development Zone process whereby a project
proponent can propose a concept that may change or remove many of the conventional zoning
restrictions. For example, housing units could be clustered around large open space areas or other
development amenities resulting in higher localized “net” densities. The PUD option provides greater
flexibility in the development process, which can lead to cost savings.
       Objective:                   Continue to utilize the PUD process to encourage unique design and
                                    develop housing that addresses site constraints.

3.7      First Time Homebuyer Programs
The City offers the Home Sweet Home First-Time Homebuyers Program that provides financing
assistance to very-low-, low- and moderate-income first-time homebuyers. The program has been revised
to increase the loan limit to $75,000, reduce the interest rate to 3% and extend the term to 30 years.
Payment is deferred for the entire loan term.
In smaller communities, there may be a limited number of qualified HOME administrative subcontractors
and non-profit affordable housing developers. In a situation where an organization acts as the
Administrative Subcontractor to a State Recipient in the State HOME program for a first-time homebuyer
(FTHB) assistance program, and also develops affordable housing in the same community, HCD restricts
homebuyers participating in a development program (e.g., mutual self-help housing) from utilizing
HOME FTHB funding to purchase their homes. This causes not only an impediment to the ability to
develop new single-family affordable homeownership opportunities, but also impacts the State Recipients
ability to spend FTHB funds in a community with limited affordable housing inventory. In order to
mitigate this potential constraint, the City will support non-profit housing organizations in working with
HCD to remove this impediment and/or allow for a streamlined process of requesting an exception
pursuant to 24 CFR 92.356(d) for projects/programs that will serve to further the purposes of the HOME
Investment Partnerships Program.
       Objective:                 Assist 10 households for the First-Time Homebuyer Program and assist
                                  20 households annually for the HOME Sweet Home Program
                                  Support non-profit housing organizations in working with HCD to

3.8      Section 8 Rental Assistance Program
Administered by the Kings County Housing Authority, Hanford will continue to participate in the Section
8 rental assistance program. The Section 8 rental assistance program extends rental subsidies to
extremely-low- and very-low-income households equal to the difference between 30% of the monthly
income and the allowable rent determined by the program.
       Objective:                 Assist Kings County Housing Authority in promoting the Section 8
                                  program.

3.9      Affordable Housing Assistance
The City promotes affordable housing through various programs such as home ownership assistance,
rehabilitation assistance, new construction/infill, and grant application programs. Hanford is an
entitlement city and receives CDBG and HOME funds directly from HUD. Affordable housing is being
developed under existing zoning and development standards with administrative and financial assistance

                                    qualifying projects, provide financial and regulatory assistance such as
                                    reduced fees and/or modified development standards, fee reductions and
                                    concurrent processing of lot mergers for multi-family projects that
                                    include units affordable to lower-income households, and continue to
                                    pursue housing production and rehabilitation with nonprofits including
                                    assistance in preparing grant applications. Housing for very-low- and

3.11     Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing
State law requires jurisdictions to provide adequate sites for a variety of housing types including
emergency shelters and transitional/supportive housing. Emergency shelters are permitted by-right in the
OR zone, and transitional and supportive housing facilities are permitted subject only to the same
regulations and procedures that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. In order
to ensure that development standards do not unreasonably constrain development of additional shelters,
parking standards will be reviewed and a Code amendment to reduce required parking to one space per
ten beds will be processed concurrent with the General Plan and Zoning Code update.
      Objective:                  Continue to facilitate the establishment of emergency shelters and

3.12     Housing for Persons with Disabilities
State law requires jurisdictions to analyze and remove potential constraints to housing for persons with
disabilities. As part of this Housing Element update the City conducted an analysis of its zoning and land
use processes, permitting processing procedures, and building codes and no constraints were identified.
The City will continue to monitor legal requirements and local conditions and will update local
regulations and procedures as necessary to encourage and facilitate the development, maintenance, and
improvement of housing for persons with disabilities.
      Objective:                  Continue to monitor legal requirements and local conditions and update
                                  local regulations, if necessary, to remove any impediments to housing for

3.13     Promote Equal Housing Opportunities
Promoting fair housing includes both education and enforcement. The City of Hanford will continue to
support both education and enforcement efforts. The City has recently partnered with the Fair Housing
Council of Central California (FHC-CC) for services related to fair housing.
The City will also support the recommendations of the 2014 San Joaquin Valley Fair Housing and Equity
Assessment (FHEA), including the following:
      •    Use the data and findings in the FHEA to guide the local Consolidated Planning process,
           ongoing CDBG and HOME funding allocations, the Housing Element, and other city planning
           documents

4.        Lemoore Housing Programs
Lemoore is a city preparing for the future while preserving the
best of its past. Incorporated in 1900, Lemoore has undergone
significant changes over its 115-year history. Although the
City’s major employers are still rooted in agriculture,
economic development has paved the way for a more
diversified economy. Yet despite change, Lemoore retains the
charm and beauty of a small rural town with its turn-of-the-
century buildings, residences and casual environment.
                                            Lemoore is committed to a sustainable economy and quality of
                                            life. Lemoore Naval Air Station provides a significant
                                            component of the City’s economic base. West Hills College,
                                            Brandman University, College of the Sequoias, and Kings
                                            County Job Training Office all provide workforce training. With
                                            the elimination of redevelopment and the Enterprise Zone
                                            Program, there are no incentives to offer new businesses. A new
                                            interchange at SR 198 and 19th Avenue was constructed in 2014,
                                            and the City is working with Caltrans for an improved
                                            interchange at SR 41 and Bush Street. In 2014 the U.S. Navy
                                            announced that the new F-35C Joint Strike Fighter will be based
at Lemoore beginning in 2016. This decision assures the long-term importance of the Naval Air Station to
Lemoore’s local economy.
The City’s downtown revitalization efforts focus on
mixed-use opportunities and converting historic
structures for housing.
The 2016-2024 Housing Plan represents Lemoore’s
efforts to continue to build upon past successes by
facilitating development of additional housing to
accommodate employment growth, providing housing
assistance to residents in need, and maintaining the
charm of Lemoore’s past.
4.1       Code Enforcement
The City will continue to provide code enforcement services and refer property owners to City
rehabilitation programs. Code enforcement is an important means to ensure that the character and quality
of neighborhoods and housing is maintained. The City’s Code Enforcement staff will work to enforce
state and local regulations. In conjunction with code enforcement activities, City staff will provide
information to homeowners regarding Lemoore’s Housing Rehabilitation Program.
       Objective:                   Continue to work with the community on code violations. Refer property
                                    owners to City programs for rehabilitation assistance.
       Responsible Agency:          Code Enforcement coordinated with Police, Business License, Planning,

       Timeline:                   Throughout the planning period
4.2      Housing Rehabilitation Program
In the past, the City’s Housing Rehabilitation Program assisted lower-income households with substantial
home repairs or reconstruction. Loans of up to $70,000 for rehabilitation and $116,000 for home
reconstruction were provided to qualified applicants. All loans were deferred for 50 years with a zero
percent interest rate as long as the residence remained the owner’s primary home. No funding is currently
available to operate this program; therefore, this program will only be implemented should HOME grant
funds be awarded. The City will continue to monitor funding opportunities and apply for grant funds as
they become available.
       Objective:                  Assist lower-income households with rehabilitation based on available
                                   funding.
       Responsible Agency:         Planning Department
       Funding Source:             HOME funds
       Timeline:                   Monitor the availability grant funding annually and submit applications
                                   as HOME funding is made available.
4.3      Zoning for Adequate Sites
The City will facilitate the construction of new housing to accommodate projected employment and
population growth and to meet the needs of residents. To that end, the Housing Element identifies
adequate sites to accommodate the City’s share of the Regional Housing Needs Allocation of 2,985 units
(339 extremely-low-, 338 very-low, 507 low, 534 moderate, and 1,267 above-moderate) during the
planning period. Adequate sites are those with sufficient development and density standards, water and
sewer services, and adequate infrastructure.
Mixed-use development represents one of the City’s key land use strategies not only for meeting its
housing needs, but also for achieving other planning objectives such as economic development, walkable
communities, and reductions in vehicular trips and greenhouse gas emissions. The new Zoning Code
includes regulations and incentives to implement the mixed-use policies contained in the Land Use
Element of the General Plan, including incentives to encourage the inclusion of a residential component
in projects located in mixed-use districts. Where necessary, the City will facilitate the subdivision of large
parcels for development. The City will continue to monitor and report annually on its progress toward
these objectives.
       Objectives:                 Provide adequate sites to meet the housing needs allocation of 2,985
                                   units.

4.4      Downtown Revitalization
As part of the City’s 1992 Downtown Revitalization Plan, the
City has been encouraging and facilitating the development and
redevelopment of its downtown core. An important component
                                                                                   Lucerne Hotel

of these efforts has been mixed residential-commercial uses in the Downtown Mixed Use zones. The City
has converted two historic hotels in the downtown to provide low-income and senior housing above
commercial uses. Such projects have assisted the City in meeting revitalization objectives, historic
preservation, and the need for lower-income housing.
       Objective:                   Facilitate additional mixed-use projects in the downtown as opportunities
                                    arise.

4.5      Planned Unit Development (PUD)
The City implements a PUD overlay zone to provide
flexibility in setback requirements and other
regulations, increase residential densities in certain
areas through techniques such as clustering, provide
flexible site requirements, and stimulate creative,
flexible and more affordable development.
       Objective:                   Continue to promote
                                    the benefits of PUD
                                    alternatives to

funded First Time Homebuyer Program. The Program offers assistance as a deferred second mortgage
loan of up to $65,000 for down payment and closing cost assistance. Assistance under this program may
include foreclosed properties. Buyers must provide a $1,000 down payment, qualify with a primary lender
and comply with their requirements.

4.7      Section 8 Rental Assistance
Administered by the Kings County Housing Authority, Lemoore will continue to participate in the
Section 8 rental assistance program. This program extends rental subsidies to extremely-low- and very-
low-income households that spend more than 30% of their income on rent. The rent subsidy is the
difference between 30% of monthly income and allowable rent determined by HUD.

4.8      Affordable Housing Project Assistance
The City provides financial and administrative
assistance to affordable housing projects whenever
feasible. Financial assistance is dependent on grant
funding and administrative assistance may include
support with the preparation of grant applications as
well as incentives such as density bonus and fast-
track permit processing.
Pursuant to Government Code Sec. 65589.7, each
public agency or private entity providing water or
sewer services shall grant a priority for the
provision of these services to proposed
developments that include housing units affordable to lower income households, and must adopt written
policies and procedures with specific objective standards for provision of services in conformance with
this section. The City will ensure conformance with these requirements.
       Objective:                 Assist affordable housing projects on a case-by-case basis, including
                                  priority for persons with developmental disabilities and extremely-low-

4.9      Senior and Special Needs Housing
The City supports development of affordable
housing for special needs households, including
elderly and disabled. The City has been
supportive of special needs housing including
affordable senior housing development, housing
rehabilitation programs, and development of
second units, all of which serve the needs of
very-low-        and       extremely-low-income
households and persons with disabilities. The
City also supported the conversion of the
Antlers Hotel into senior housing. The City will
continue to facilitate the development of senior
housing, special needs housing, and/or a senior
assisted living facility in the Lemoore Market
Area through incentives and administrative assistance.

4.10     Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing
State law requires jurisdictions to provide adequate
sites for a variety of housing types including emergency
shelters and transitional/supportive housing. This type
of housing is particularly important in addressing the
needs of very-low- and extremely-low-income persons.
The Zoning Code allows emergency shelters by-right in
the Community Facilities (CF) zone subject to
objective development standards. In addition,
transitional and supportive housing are considered
residential uses and are permitted in most zones subject
only to the same requirements as other residential uses
of the same type in the same zone. Minor revisions to
zoning regulations are needed to ensure conformance with state law.
       Objectives:                  Continue to facilitate emergency shelters and transitional/supportive
                                    housing consistent with state law.
                                    Amend the Zoning Code to revise regulations for transitional and
                                    supportive housing in 2016 to ensure conformance with state law

4.11     Employee and Farmworker Housing
As the second most urbanized city in
Kings County, Lemoore has few resident
farmworkers. Although agricultural
operations are very limited, an
amendment to City zoning regulations
will be processed to allow farmworker
housing in conformance with Health and
Safety Code §17021.5. Lemoore has
worked with Self-Help Enterprises to
create 36 affordable single-family units
by providing land and home ownership
assistance while families provided
“sweat equity” towards constructing
their homes. Occupants were primarily very-low-income farmworker families.

4.12     Remove Constraints on Housing for Persons with Disabilities and Special Needs
State law requires jurisdictions to analyze and remove potential constraints to housing for persons with
disabilities, who often have very-low or extremely-low incomes. As part of this Housing Element update
the City conducted an analysis of its zoning and land use processes, permit processing procedures, and
building codes and no constraints were identified.
       Objectives:                 Continue to facilitate the production of housing for persons with
                                    disabilities and other special needs consistent with current law.

4.13     Promote Equal Housing Opportunities
The City provides information on fair housing laws, landlord/tenant rights and responsibilities and refers
complaints of housing discrimination to the Department of Fair Employment and Housing in Fresno.
Information on housing discrimination is available at City Hall and flyers on fair housing are distributed
to participants in the City’s First Time Homebuyer Program.
In addition, the Zoning Ordinance includes reasonable accommodation procedures for reviewing and
approving requests for modifications to zoning and building regulations by persons with disabilities.
The City will also support the recommendations of the 2014 San Joaquin Valley Fair Housing and Equity
Assessment (FHEA), including the following:
       •   Actively seek funding for marginalized or distressed communities, such as Transit Oriented
           Development funds, Strategic Growth Council grants, HCD’s Housing-Related Parks Program,
           Safe Routes to School, and Brownfield funding
       •   Implement a proactive code enforcement program that holds property owners accountable and
           proactively plans for resident relocation when necessary (see also Program 4.1)
       •   Consider new technologies and/or products such as modular housing construction to reduce
           costs and increase access to housing

5.       Kings County Housing Programs
Kings County was formed in 1893 from the separation of
the western portion of Tulare County and from an additional
100 square miles added from Fresno County in 1908.
Located in the fertile agricultural valley floor along the
Kings River, Kings County quickly began to establish itself
as a prominent agricultural region. With the construction of
the Southern Pacific Railroad – Alcade branch in 1877, the
community of Armona soon began to flourish as a central
fruit packing and shipping point. Growth of the smaller rural
communities diminished as Hanford grew rapidly and later
developments in Lemoore prospered.
More than 100 years after its founding, Kings County
continues to remain strongly based in its agriculture roots. Today, Kings County is ranked as the 8th
leading agricultural county in California (25th in the nation), and has risen to one of the top fifteen milk
producing counties in the nation. With the County’s prominent agricultural resources and vast distribution
network to move agricultural goods to national and international markets, the County has remained
dedicated towards supporting agriculture while directing urban development to cities and community
areas where services are more efficiently provided.
This Housing Plan reflects the County’s historical
population trends and policies that direct urban
development to existing cities or community service
districts, while also providing opportunities for affordable
housing development. The Housing Plan sets forth policies
to encourage the production of housing where adequate
infrastructure and services are available, preserve and
rehabilitate residential structures, and provide housing
assistance to low- and moderate-income households to meet
their housing needs.
5.1      Code Enforcement
Code enforcement is an important means to ensure that the character and quality of neighborhoods and
housing is maintained. The Kings County Building Inspection staff will continue to work to enforce state
and local regulations regarding building and property maintenance. In conjunction with code enforcement
activities, staff will provide information to homeowners regarding the County’s Housing Rehabilitation
Program.
       Objective:                   Continue to address code violations in the County unincorporated areas.
                                    Refer property owners to rehabilitation assistance.

5.2      Housing Rehabilitation Program
Working through nonprofit organizations and
jurisdictions, the County offers housing rehabilitation
assistance through the Housing Rehabilitation Program.
Kings County offers housing rehabilitation assistance
throughout County unincorporated areas, including the
Corcoran fringe, Hanford fringe, Lemoore fringe,
Armona, Home Gardens, Kettleman City, Stratford and
other small community areas. The County provides
low- or no-interest loans up to $57,000 to correct health
and safety hazards and make more routine repairs. The
loan can be deferred until the owner sells the home,
moves out of the home, or is able to begin making
payments.
       Objective:                 Provide 5 to 10 loans per year.

5.3      Preservation of At-Risk Affordable Housing
The County will continue to work with interested agencies and community organizations to preserve at-
risk units by monitoring their status, providing technical and/or financial assistance in return for extended
affordability controls, and ensuring proper tenant notification prior to project conversion. Unincorporated
Kings County has four projects with approximately 197 units of affordable housing created through
various County, state, and federal programs. None of those units are at risk for conversion to market rate.
       Objective:                 Continue to monitor at-risk units.

5.4      Adequate Sites
The County will ensure that an adequate supply of
residential land is designated in unincorporated areas to
accommodate projected growth needs. Appendix B of
the Housing Element identifies adequate sites within
unincorporated areas to accommodate the County’s
share of the regional housing needs allocation, which is
identified as 818 units (93 extremely-low, 93 very-low,
138 low, 147 moderate, and 347 above-moderate) for
the new planning period. Adequate sites are those with
appropriate zoning and development standards and
adequate water and sewer services and other
infrastructure.
       Objective:                   Designate adequate sites to meet Kings County’s housing needs of 818
                                    units for the new planning period.

5.5      First-Time Homebuyer Program
 The County’s First-Time Homebuyer Program provides
qualified first-time homebuyers up to no more than 50% of
purchase price towards a home purchase. The loan is
deferred for the life of the first loan or until the home
owner sells the house. This program is available in all the
unincorporated areas of Kings County and is administered
by Self-Help Enterprises.
       Objective:                   Provide 10 to 15 loans per
                                    year.

5.6      Section 8 Rental Assistance
Administered by the Kings County Housing Authority, unincorporated communities will continue to
participate in the Section 8 rental assistance program. The Section 8 program extends rental subsidies to
extremely-low- and very-low-income households that spend more than 30% of their income on rent. The
rent subsidy is the difference between 30% of monthly income and allowable rent determined by HUD.
       Objective:                   Support the Housing Authority’s Section 8 program by promoting the
                                    program via the County website and brochures at County offices.

The County supports the Housing Authority in the
provision of transitional homes for foster youth. Foster
children are a top priority for Kings County. Working
with the Kings County Housing Authority, various
agencies and organizations have established two
transitional homes for aged-out foster children. The
homes each accommodate six residents. The Hanford
boys’ home was completed in 2001 by refurbishing a
dilapidated HUD home with the assistance of donations
of material and labor. The Lemoore girls’ home was
built in 2002 from a historical dwelling that was
refurbished.
       Objective:                 Continue to support the Housing Authority in the provision of
                                  transitional homes for foster youth.

5.8      Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing
Housing Element law requires jurisdictions to provide adequate sites for a variety of housing including
emergency shelters and transitional/supportive housing through appropriate zoning and development
standards. The Kings County Development Code allows emergency shelters in the PF zone subject only
to a ministerial Site Plan Review, consistent with SB 2, and also allows emergency shelters by CUP in the
R-1 and RM zones. The Development Code also allows transitional or supportive housing for up to 6
persons by-right in all residential zones. The Code will be amended to specify that transitional/supportive
housing is a residential use subject only to the same requirements and procedures as for other residential
uses of the same type in the same zone.
       Objective:                 Amend the Development Code to permit transitional/supportive housing
                                  subject to the same requirements and procedures as for other residential
                                  uses of the same type in the same zone, as required by state law.
                                  Continue to support the Kings/Tulare Continuum of Care Plan to develop
                                  transitional and emergency housing programs for homeless individuals

5.9      Mobile Home/Manufactured Housing
Mobile homes and manufactured housing can provide an important source of affordable housing in rural
areas. Pursuant to state law, all jurisdictions must allow for the development of manufactured
housing/mobile homes as a permitted use in all residential zones where single-family homes are
permitted. County codes are consistent with state law in this regard, and the County will continue to
facilitate this type of housing to address the needs of low- and moderate-income households.
       Objective:                   Continue to allow manufactured housing by right in all R zones which
                                    allow “one-family dwellings.”

5.10     Farmworker and Employee Housing
Kings County administratively permits mobile homes as
farm employee housing in the AL-10, AG-20, AG-40
and AX zones. Farmworker housing not exceeding 5
units per parcel is permitted in the AL-10, AG-20 and
AG-40 zones with larger facilities in the same zones
requiring a conditional use permit. Although no farm
labor camps currently are present in Kings County, the
County routinely permits mobile homes used as
employee housing and smaller farmworker housing
units. The County works with the Housing Authority
and non-profit developers to develop rental and
ownership housing for farmworkers. The County also
facilitated renovation of a former motel into temporary
and/or long-term, permanent agricultural employee
housing for 24 farmworker families. To further assist in meeting housing needs, the County will:
       Objective:                   Continue to support farmworker housing as follows:
                                    1.    Amend the Development Code to incorporate §17021.5 and
                                          §17021.6 of the Health and Safety Code

5.11      Housing for Persons with Disabilities
State law requires jurisdictions to analyze and remove potential constraints to housing for persons with
disabilities. As part of this Housing Element update, the County conducted an analysis of its zoning and
land use processes, permit processing procedures, and building codes to identify impediments and no
significant constraints were identified. In order to facilitate the provision of adequate housing for persons
with disabilities, the County will continue to:
       1.     Permit small licensed community care facilities (6 or fewer persons) by-right in all residential
              zones and larger community care facilities serving more than 6 persons by CUP in all residential
              zones; and
       2.     Continue to implement the reasonable accommodation ordinance (Zoning Code Sec. 2208)
              establishing administrative procedures for reviewing and approving modifications to land use
              and building regulations that are reasonably necessary to ensure accessibility and use by persons
              with disabilities.
       Objective:                  Continue to facilitate the provision of community care facilities and

5.13      Assist Affordable Housing Development
The County promotes the development of housing for extremely-low-, very-low-, low- and moderate-
income persons through direct financial assistance such as CDBG and HOME, priority entitlement
processing, regulatory incentives such as density bonus and modified development standards,
administrative support to developers on grant applications. Programs 5.6 (Section 8 Rental Assistance),
5.8 (Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing), 5.9 (Mobile/Manufactured Housing),
5.10 (Farmworker and Employee Housing), 5.11 (Housing for Persons with Disabilities) and 5.16 (SRO
Housing) are all intended to address the needs of extremely-low-income (ELI) households. In order to
further assist in the development of ELI units, the County will apply for State and Federal funds for direct
support of low-income housing construction and rehabilitation. Potential funding sources include CDBG
and HOME. The County will also seek State and Federal funding specifically targeted for the
development of housing affordable to ELI households, such as AHSC funds. The County will promote the

                                    basis as available.
5.14     Energy Conservation and Greenhouse Gas/Particulate Matter Reduction
The Community Development Agency offers expedited plan check and permit processing for residential
projects designed to comply with the voluntary residential requirements of the California Green Building
Standards Code. Expedited plan check/permit processing is also provided for photovoltaic systems that
generate energy for residential uses.
       Objective:                   Increase energy conservation and reduce greenhouse gases/particulate
                                    matter in Kings County by encouraging developers to comply with the
                                    California Green Building Standards Code. Developers receive expedited
                                    plan check/permit processing if their project meets or exceeds the
                                    California Green Building Standards Code or if the project incorporates a
                                    photovoltaic system that provides energy for residential uses. This
                                    program will be publicized through postings within the Community
                                    Development Agency office and on the Agency’s webpage.
       Responsible Agency:          Community Development Agency and housing developers
       Funding:                     No additional County funding required
       Timeline:                    Throughout the planning period
5.15     Weatherization and Energy-Efficient Home Improvements
The purpose of this program is to reduce energy use by providing financial assistance to lower-income
households for weatherization and energy-efficient heating (including solar photovoltaic water heaters)
and cooling systems. The County will refer lower-income households to the Kings Community Action
Organization and other community services agencies that provide financial assistance to qualifying
households for these improvements.
       Objective:                   Reduce residential energy use and carbon footprint by providing
                                    financial assistance to lower-income households for weatherization and
                                    energy-efficient heating and cooling systems.

5.16     Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Housing
To facilitate additional housing opportunities for lower-income residents, the County will continue to
encourage development of SRO housing.
       Objective:                 Address the needs of extremely-low-income persons through SRO
                                  housing.

       Timeline:                  Throughout the planning period
5.17     Promote Fair and Balanced Fee Structures
Kings County promotes the development of affordable housing. However, such properties are often
owned by non-profit organizations that are exempt from property taxes, which are necessary to provide
funding for the public services and facilities required by residents. As a result, non-profit developments
can have a negative fiscal impact on the County. In the event that affordable housing production by non-
profit developers exceeds the level of need identified in the RHNA Plan for this planning period, the
County will initiate a study to assess the fiscal impacts of additional non-profit affordable housing
development, and consider appropriate mechanisms such as in-lieu fees to mitigate such impacts. Prior to
implementation of such mitigation, the County shall conduct an evaluation of its effect on the cost and
supply of housing, and process an amendment to the Housing Element.
       Objective:                 The objective of this program is to balance the benefits of non-profit
                                  affordable housing tax benefits with the importance of maintaining local
                                  funding mechanisms for the continuance of essential County services.

                •          Extremely Low: Households earning less than 30% of County median family
                           income;
                •          Very low: Households earning less than 50% of County median family income;
                •          Low: Households earning 51% to 80% of the County median family income;

                •          Above Moderate: Households earning above 120% of County median family
                           income
Housing Problems: Defined by HUD as a household which: (1) occupies a unit with physical defects
           (lacks complete kitchen or bathroom); (2) meets the definition of overcrowded; or (3) spends
           more than 30% of income on housing cost.
Housing Subsidy: Housing subsidies refer to government assistance aimed at reducing housing sales or
           rent prices to more affordable levels. Two general types of housing subsidy exist: 1) where a
           housing subsidy is linked to a particular house or apartment, the housing subsidy is “project” or
           “unit” based; or 2) In Section 8 rental assistance programs the subsidy is provided to the family
           (called “tenant-based”) who can then use the assistance to find suitable housing in the
           accommodations of their choice.
Housing Unit: A room or group of rooms used by one or more individuals living separately from others
           in the structure, with direct access to the outside or to a public hall and containing separate
           toilet and kitchen facilities.
Inclusionary Unit. An ownership or rental dwelling unit which is required to meet affordability criteria
           established by local ordinance.
Large Household: A household with 5 or more members.
Manufactured Housing: Housing that is constructed of manufactured components, assembled partly at
           the site rather than totally at the site. Also referred to as modular housing.
Market-Rate Housing: Housing which is available on the open market without any subsidy. The price
           for housing is determined by the market forces of supply and demand and varies by location.
Median Income: The annual income (adjusted for household size) within a region for which half of the
           households have incomes above the median and half have incomes below the median. The
           “Areawide Median Income” (AMI) is established annually by HUD and HCD for each county
           as the basis for affordable housing programs.
Mobile Home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is at least 8 feet in width and 32

Chapter 6. Glossary of Terms
Overcrowding: As defined by the U.S. Census, a household with greater than 1.01 persons per room,
           excluding bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, and porches. Severe overcrowding is defined as
           households with greater than 1.51 persons per room.
Overpayment: The extent to which gross housing costs, including utility costs, exceed 30% of gross
           household income, based on data published by the U.S. Census Bureau. Severe overpayment, or
           cost burden, exists if gross housing costs exceed 50% of gross income.
Parcel: The basic unit of land entitlement. A designated area of land established by plat, subdivision, or
           otherwise legally defined and permitted to be used, or built upon.
Public Housing: A project-based low-rent housing program operated by independent local public
           housing authorities. A low-income family applies to the local public housing authority in the
           area in which they want to live.
Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP): The Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP) is based on State of
           California projections of population growth and housing unit demand and assigns a share of the
           region’s future housing need to each jurisdiction in Kings County. These housing needs
           numbers serve as a basis for the update of the Housing Element.
Rehabilitation: The upgrading of a building previously in a dilapidated or substandard condition for
           human habitation or use.
Section 8 Rental Voucher/Certificate Program: A tenant-based rental assistance program that
           subsidizes a family’s rent in a privately owned house or apartment. The program is
           administered by local public housing authorities. Assistance payments are based on 30% of
           household annual income. Households with incomes of 50% or below the area median income
           are eligible to participate in the program.
Senior: The Census Bureau defines a senior as a person who is 65 years or older. For persons of social
           security eligibility, a senior is defined as a person age 62 and older. Other age limits may be
           used for eligibility for housing assistance or retired communities.
Service Needs: The particular services required by special populations, typically including needs such as
           transportation, personal care, housekeeping, counseling, meals, case management, personal
           emergency response, and other services preventing premature institutionalization and assisting
           individuals to continue living independently.
Small Household: Pursuant to HUD definition, a small household consists of two to four non-elderly
           persons.
Special Needs Groups: Those segments of the population which have a more difficult time finding
           decent affordable housing due to special circumstances. Under California Housing Element
           statutes, these special needs groups consist of the elderly, people with disabilities, large families
           with five or more members, single-parent families with children, farmworkers and the
           homeless. A jurisdiction may also choose to consider additional special needs groups in the
           Housing Element, such as students, military households, other groups present in their
           community.
Subdivision: The division of a lot, tract or parcel of land in accordance with the Subdivision Map Act
           (California Government Code §66410, et seq.).
Substandard Housing: Housing which does not meet the minimum standards in the California Housing
           Code. Jurisdictions may adopt more stringent local definitions of substandard housing.
           Substandard units which are structurally sound and for which the cost of rehabilitation is
           economically warranted are considered suitable for rehabilitation. Substandard units which are
           structurally unsound and for which the cost of rehabilitation is considered infeasible are
           considered in need of replacement.

Supportive Services: Services provided to residents of supportive housing for the purpose of facilitating
           the independence of residents. Some examples are case management, medical or psychological
           counseling and supervision, child care, transportation, and job training.
Tenant-Based Rental Assistance: A form of rental assistance in which the assisted tenant may move
           from a dwelling unit with a right to continued assistance. The assistance is provided for the
           tenant, not for the project.
Transitional Housing: Transitional housing is temporary (often six months to two years) housing for a
           homeless individual or family who is transitioning to permanent housing. Transitional housing
           often includes a supportive services component (e.g., job skills training, rehabilitation
           counseling) to allow individuals to gain necessary life skills in support of independent living.
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD): The cabinet level department of the
           federal government responsible for housing, housing assistance, and urban development at the
           national level. Housing programs administered through HUD include Community Development
           Block Grant (CDBG), HOME and Section 8, among others.
Zoning: A land use regulatory measure enacted by local government. Zoning district regulations
           governing lot size, building bulk, placement, and other development standards vary from
           district to district, but must be uniform within the same district. Each city and county adopts a
           zoning ordinance specifying these regulations.

   2 Land Use
 This element of the General Plan constitutes the framework for land use planning in Lemoore
 to the year 2030. To provide a context, the evolution of the City is briefly described and
 existing land use is summarized. The guiding principles of the land use framework, the
 General Plan Diagram, the land use classification system, and the buildout of this Plan to the
 year 2030 are then presented. The heart of the element – the guiding policies and
 implementing actions – is intended to set the land use framework into motion and shape
 development to 2030.
2.1        BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT: EXISTING LAND USE PAT -
           TERN
 LAND USE PATTERN1
 The land use pattern found in Lemoore is typical of cities found in the Central Valley region.
 Most of the development can be attributed to Lemoore’s evolution as an agriculture center
 and subsequent transformation driven by the growth of the NAS Lemoore. The city center or
 downtown is characteristic of an older central business district, incorporating a mixture of
 retail and public facilities. Larger commercial, agriculture and newer residential
 neighborhoods are located further out from the city center. Some industrial land is located
 adjacent to the San Joaquin Valley Railroad and south of Iona Avenue. Parks and schools are
 distributed throughout residential neighborhoods. Figure 2-1 depicts uses in existence today,

using both County data and field reconnaissance. These existing land uses do not necessarily
match the land use designations in the existing General Plan.
Land Use Characteristics
As shown in Table 2.1, agriculture/rural land is the most significant land use within the
Planning Area, occupying 4,574 acres or 37 percent of the land. Just over 40 percent of land
in the Planning Area is under Williamson Act contracts; however, some of this land is not
currently in agricultural production. Vacant land is the second most prominent land use
within the Planning Area, comprising 2,082 acres or 17 percent of the land. Of the residential
category, Low Density Single Family Residential is the most significant, occupying roughly
1,146 acres or 9 percent of the land. Most of it occurs within existing City Limits. Very Low
Density Residential is the second most significant residential land use, comprising 399 acres.
Other residential land uses includes 35 acres of Mobile Home Parks, 34 acres of Low Density
Multi-Family Residential, and 115 acres of Multi-Family Residential.
Among non-residential land uses in Lemoore,
roads and other right-of-ways occupy 1,212 or
10 percent of all land in the Planning Area.
Industrial land only occupies 304 acres or 2
percent of all land despite its importance to
employment generation. The major industrial
and commercial land areas are located along
two State Routes. Some industrial land is also
located in close proximity to the San Joaquin
Valley Railroad. Parks of various sizes are
distributed throughout the City, often in close
                                                    The City wants to preserve as much agricultural land
proximity to schools.
                                                    as possible while allowing residential growth.
RECENT DEVELOPMENT
Since the last General Plan was adopted in 1992, Lemoore has been growing at a healthy
pace, with the increase in population and number of housing units at approximately 4 percent
per year. As of 2006, approximately 1,371 acres or 25 percent of the City is developed for
residential uses while industrial and commercial uses constitute 487 acres or nearly 10
percent of land within City borders.
Growth prospects for the next 23 years are strong, and land use demands are being met by a
number of residential and non-residential projects currently being constructed or under
development review. In the pipeline for residential development are 21 housing projects,
which together will create approximately 1,710 new housing units on 433 acres of land.
These residential units are mainly single family homes and multi-family condominiums.
Most projects are located at the north-east and western quadrant of the Planning Area where
there is ample land suitable for residential use.

A total of seven non-residential projects are also in planning phases or under construction.
When fully completed, they will create approximately 327,460 square feet of new
commercial, industrial, and public space on 127 acres of land at an average floor area ratio of
0.09. These include a new Wal-Mart Super Center and West Hills College expansion at the
western quadrant of Lemoore, facilities for Coker Ellsworth, Chevron, Nelson Majors, Auto
Zone, Walgreens, Valero Gas, a church for the Lemoore Church of the Nazarene, as well as
other non-residential projects all over the City.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
2.2      GENERAL PLAN DIAGRAM
The land use framework of the General Plan is shown in the General Plan Diagram on Figure
2-2. The diagram is a graphic representation of the themes and policies encapsulated in the
Plan; it designates the general location, distribution, and extent of land uses through buildout
in 2030. As required by State law, land use classifications — shown as color/graphic
patterns, letter designations, or labels on the diagram —specify a range for housing density
and building intensity for each type of designated land use. These density/intensity standards
allow circulation and public facility needs to be determined.
The Diagram is to be used and interpreted only in conjunction with the text and other figures
contained in the General Plan. The legend of the General Plan Diagram includes the land use
classifications described below, which represent an adopted component of the Plan. The
Diagram is not parcel-specific, and uses on sites less than one acre in size are generally not
depicted.
LAND USE FRAMEWORK
The General Plan Diagram embodies a vision of how land in Lemoore will be used in year
2030, and is designed to reflect community objectives and planning initiatives presented in
Chapter 1. These include:
•   Compact Urban Form. As depicted on the General Plan Diagram, all development is
    planned to occur within the Urban Growth Boundary to preserve agriculture and open
    space surrounding Lemoore and keep a distinct rural/ urban edge.
•   Small Town Character. Policies in the Land Use Element as well as other Elements of
    the General Plan are written with an eye for preserving Lemoore’s small town character.
    Specifically in this Element, actions are taken to revitalize downtown, prevent sprawl,
    keep neighborhoods within walking distance of amenities and schools, and provide open
    space and parks to maintain Lemoore’s quality of life.
•   Economic Development and Jobs. A significant amount of land is set aside to
    accommodate economic development efforts. Planning for jobs growth is a major
    consideration in the design of neighborhood centers and downtown for small businesses
    as well as large commercial and industrial sites for larger businesses.
•   Integrated Neighborhoods and Neighborhood Centers. The General Plan Diagram
    depicts a network of neighborhoods. Neighborhoods are defined as areas including a mix
    of land uses that interrelate and serve one another. Neighborhoods work as part of an
    overall system of the city, are internally accessible by non-motorized means, include
    community facilities such as parks and schools, and have a central focal point. The ½
    mile radii depicted on the Land Use Diagram encompass areas within convenient walking
    distance and show how these neighborhoods are related to each other and to
    neighborhood centers, schools, and parks and recreational facilities.
    Enhanced Community Character and Aesthetics. Community Character is enhanced
    through encouraging compact design, pedestrian-oriented circulation, neighborhood
    centered activities, and environmental sensitivity. A more detailed discussion of
    Community Design is presented in Chapter 3: Community Design.
•   A Network of Open Space and Parks. All of the Parks and Open Space uses are linked
    by a system of parkways, bikeways, and roadways. Residential uses are often situated
    adjacent to these parks, which provide a valuable amenity to nearby residents.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
    •    A Complete Roadway System. The land uses presented on the Diagram are structured
         around the roadway network, and the two components are interactive and interrelated.
         The types, location, capacity, and use of these roadways are presented in Chapter 4:
         Circulation.
    •    A Range of Commercial and Retail Opportunities. The General Plan provides for
         the full range of commercial and retail uses needed for the future population and
         business community. Regionally-oriented establishments are placed on major
         roadway corridors (e.g. SR-41 at Bush Street, SR-198 at 19th Avenue, SR-198 at
         Houston/D Street, and SR-198 at future Marsh/21 st Avenue interchange.);
         community- and neighborhood-oriented uses are placed within planned communities
         and neighborhoods.
    •    Adequate, Flexible School Sites. New school sites are proposed to accommodate
         future students. The sites depicted on the General Plan Diagram are intended to relate
         well to adjacent uses, such as neighborhood focal areas and park sites. A further
         discussion of schools is presented in Chapter 5: Parks, Schools, and Community
         Facilities.
The General Plan aims to provide more neighborhood parks and recreational facilities to improve the quality of life for
Lemoore’s residents.
DENSITY/INTENSITY STANDARDS
The General Plan establishes density/intensity standards for each use classification. In the
residential designations, residential density is expressed as a maximum number of housing
units per gross acre. For non-residential uses, the building intensity standard is expressed as a
maximum permitted ratio of gross floor area to site area, called a Floor Area Ratio (FAR).
For example, on a 10,000 square foot site with a maximum FAR of 0.5, 5,000 square feet of
building area can be built. FAR is a broad measure of building bulk that controls both visual
prominence and traffic generation. It can be clearly translated to a limit on building bulk in
the Zoning Ordinance and is independent of the type of use occupying the building. It allows
for both single and multi-story buildings.
Density (housing units per acre) and intensity (FAR) standards are for gross developable land
(that is, including streets and other rights-of-way), but exclude areas subject to physical or
environmental constraints, which include creek corridors, floodways, and areas to be
                                                       8

dedicated for greenways or habitat protection. The density/intensity standards do not imply
that development projects will be approved at the maximum density or intensity specified for
each use. Zoning regulations consistent with General Plan policies and/or site conditions may
reduce development potential within the stated ranges. Table 2.2 summarizes density and
intensity (FAR) standards for the Plan’s land use classifications.
LAND USE CLASSIFICATIONS
The land use classifications on the General Plan Diagram are described below. The total
acreage for each land use classification is presented in Table 2.3. These land use
classifications are meant to be broad enough to give the City flexibility in implementing City
policy, but clear enough to provide sufficient direction to carry out the General Plan. The
City’s Zoning Ordinance will contain more detailed provisions and standards. More than one
zoning district may be consistent with a single General Plan land use classification (see
Consistency between General Plan and Zoning in Chapter 9: Implementation and
Monitoring, Table 9.1). The residential land use designation definitions in the 2030 Lemoore
General Plan are somewhat different than those in the existing General Plan. However, the
color scheme was retained for consistency with planning practice.
Residential
Agriculture/Rural Residential. This designation is intended for single family detached
residential development in areas with rural and semi-rural characteristics. Lot sizes are
greater than 40,000 square feet. Residential buildout is assumed at 0.05 units per gross acre.
Very Low Density Residential. This designation is intended to provide transition between
semi-rural residential and single family detached residential areas. Lot sizes are between
15,000 to 40,000 square feet. Typical residential density for this designation ranges from 2 to
3 units per gross acre. Residential buildout is assumed at 2.5 units per gross acre.
Low Density Residential. Residential density for this designation is typical of a single-family
residential subdivision and range from 3 to 7 units per gross acre. Lot sizes range from 7,000
to 15,000 square feet. Buildout is assumed at 4.5 units per gross acre.
Low-Medium Density Residential. This designation includes a mix of housing types and can
accommodate small lot single family, attached single family and duplexes, triplexes,
fourplexes and townhomes to encourage homeownership. Typical residential density for this
designation ranges from 7 to 12 units per gross acre. The minimum lot size is 3,000 to 7,000
square feet. Residential buildout is assumed at 9 units per gross acre.
Medium Density Residential. This designation is to accommodate apartments and
townhomes. Medium density is typically 2- and sometimes 3-story, with balconies, common
area open space, and shared amenities. Typical lot sizes range from 2,000 to 5,000 square
feet. Typical residential densities are between 12 and 17 units per gross acre. The high range
of this density is achievable with supportive development regulations and does not
necessarily require multi-family development. An average density of 14 units per acre is used
for buildout projections.
High Density Residential. This designation is intended for multi-family apartments and
condominium development. Residential densities range from 17 to 25 units per gross acre,
and are intended for development along arterials and around Downtown.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
Mixed Use
Mixed Use. This designation is intended to provide for retail, residential, office, business and
personal services (copy centers, barber shops, dry cleaners), public, and institutional uses in
neighborhood-oriented centers, and other uses deemed appropriate by the Planning
Commission, in a variety of mixed-use configurations, such as ground-floor commercial with
residential or office uses above, or co-location of buildings with different single uses on a
contiguous mixed-use area. Development will be pedestrian-oriented to enhance street life
and the vibrancy of neighborhoods. Standards and project approval criteria will ensure
compatibility between mixed-use development and adjacent residential neighborhoods.
Typical residential density for this designation ranges from 8 to 20 units per gross acre.
Residential buildout is assumed at 9 units per gross acre and non-residential buildout is
assumed at an FAR of 0.25.2
Commercial/ Office/Industrial
Neighborhood Commercial. This designation is intended for small-scale commercial uses
that primarily provide convenience, personal services and social services such as small-scale
retail, eating and drinking establishments, commercial recreation, and professional office as a
secondary use. It is designed to foster a pedestrian setting along public streets. Non-
residential buildout is assumed at an FAR of 0.20.
Regional Commercial. This designation is intended for large-scale commercial development
that serves local and regional needs. Sites are easily accessible by freeways and may contain
a variety of goods and services, such as large-format retail, department stores, eating and
drinking establishments, hotels, and motels. Non-residential buildout is assumed at an FAR
of 0.30.
Professional Office. This designation is for professional offices, which typically include
administrative, financial, business, professional, medical, dental and public uses. Churches
and places for religious assembly and compatible multi-family housing also are allowed.
Complementary support services, such as copy shops and restaurants, also are permitted.
Non-residential buildout is assumed at an FAR of 0.25.
Heavy Industrial. This designation allows primary manufacturing, refining, packaging,
processing, and similar activities including those with outdoor facilities. It also
accommodates warehousing and distribution uses, with support commercial services and
ancillary office space. No retail uses are allowed. An average FAR of 0.20 is assumed for
buildout estimates.
2
   Zoning regulations will specify additional uses, including day care, medical clinics, residential care, banks and financial
  institutions, and eating and drinking establishments, permit requirements, and standards and limitations that may apply (size
  or location limits, restrictions, on hours of operation, etc.). Mixed use with residential above will not be required for all
  buildings, but a minimum amount of housing will be required in each center, and a minimum amount of ground floor retail
  (such as 2,000 square feet) must also be provided.

Light Industrial. This designation is intended for manufacturing, warehousing, storage,
distribution, sales and services with ancillary commercial and office space. Freestanding
retail stores, such as Wal-Mart, are not permitted. Non-residential buildout is assumed at an
FAR of 0.20.
Business, Technology and Industrial Reserve. This classification provides for planned
development in the area southwest of the SR-198/SR-41 interchange to accommodate long-
term employment needs. Uses may include research and development activities, offices uses,
high tech uses, light industrial and warehouse uses, support commercial services and limited
retail sales. Non-residential buildout is assumed at an FAR of 0.15.

Other
Community Facilities. Intended for lands owned by public entities, including schools,
administrative offices, corporation yards, and public facilities, including recycling centers,
sewage treatment ponds, and fire stations. There is no assumed buildout for non-residential
development.
Parks/Recreation. Intended for improved and unimproved park facilities, including
neighborhood, community, and regional parks; public golf courses; and recreational facilities
that provide visual open space and serve the outdoor recreational needs of the community.
No FAR is assumed.
Greenway/Detention Basin. This green space acts as a visual buffer between new residential
and the freeway and railroad; it also provides stormwater ponding capacity.
Wetlands. This designation applies to both the original and the re-created wetland areas. It is
intended to protect wildlife and hydrological and biological resources in these areas –

allowing only very low intensity open space uses that are compatible with and do not disturb
the resources to be protected.
Agriculture. This designation is intended for active private farmland. There is no assumed
buildout for residential or non-residential development.
Overlays
Navy’s Air Installation Compatible Use Zone – AICUZ. The proposed land uses in the
AICUZ are subject to review when the Navy’s Air Installation Compatible Use Zone
(AICUZ) study for the Naval Air Station Lemoore. In the interim, the policies and standards
of Chapter 8: Safety and Noise apply.
Deferred Annexation/Postponement Area. In the area south of the existing (May 2008)
City limits and west of State Route (SR) 41, no application for annexation or development
will be accepted for review until after completion of the Navy’s Air Installation Compatible
Use Zone (AICUZ) study for the Naval Air Station Lemoore and completion of flood hazard
studies by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
GENERAL PLAN BUILDOUT
The term “buildout” refers to a theoretical level of development where every parcel allocated
under the General Plan is fully developed according to plan. It should be noted that when
buildout will actually occur is not specified in or anticipated by the Plan, and designation of a
site for a certain use does not necessarily mean that the site will be built/redeveloped with the
designated use during the horizon of the Plan.
Table 2.3 shows the buildout acreage of the General Plan Diagram. At full buildout, a little
over 4,000 gross acres would be developed within the Planning Area, virtually all of which
would be in the UGB. Most areas that are planned for new development are residential in use,
totaling about 2,000 acres.

       2.3       PATTERN OF DEVELOPMENT, GROWTH AND EXPANSION
        Land use planning decisions are guided by the community’s desire to retain Lemoore’s small
        town character, maintain a compact urban form, and protect agricultural lands surrounding
        the City. The policies presented in this section reflect these desires. They are intended to help
        Lemoore achieve growth without compromising its identity, pace of life, and environment
        resources. They will ensure that growth occurs in a timely and ordered fashion.
                                                             13                                Revised 3-20-2012

2030 Lemoore General Plan
GUIDING POLICIES
           LU-G-1       Promote a sustainable, balanced land use pattern that satisfies
           existing needs and safeguards future needs of the City.
           LU-G-2       Maintain a well-defined compact urban form, with a defined urban
           growth boundary and development intensities on land designated for urban uses.
           LU-G-3       Ensure that new development provides for infrastructure, schools,
           parks, neighborhood shops, and community facilities in close proximity to
           residents.
IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
Growth Management
           LU-I-1       Establish an Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) in the General Plan
           Land Use Diagram that limits the extent of urban development up to the year
           2030, and specifically prevents development west of the 21 st Avenue alignment,
           in order to protect the Navy from encroachment.
           For purposes of this policy, “urban development” means development requiring
           one or more basic municipal services including, but not limited to, water service,
           sewer service, improved storm drainage facilities, fire hydrants and other
           physical public facilities and services. The General Plan reserves enough land to
           satisfy urban growth up to the year 2030.
           LU-I-2       Seek LAFCO approval of a Sphere of Influence (SOI) line that is co-
           terminus with the General Plan Urban Growth Boundary.
           The Sphere of Influence line will represent the ultimate edge of urban
           development in Lemoore through 2030, beyond which development will remain
           rural in nature and without urban services. This policy is intended to protect
           surrounding agricultural land, promote compact development, and prohibit
           annexation outside the boundary.
           LU-I-3       Do not accept any applications for annexation or development in the
           area south of the existing (May 2008) City limits and west of SR-41 until after
           completion of the Navy’s Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) study
           for the Naval Air Station Lemoore and completion of flood hazard studies by the
           Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
           LU-I-4       Require contiguous development within the SOI unless it can be
           demonstrated that land which is contiguous to urban development is unavailable
           or development is economically infeasible.
           The City desires to prevent leapfrog development where development skips over
           available land to outlying and isolated areas. Contiguous development will
           reduce sprawl, safeguard agriculture land, and reduce the cost of extending
           services.
           LU-I-5       Work with the County on a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
           in which the County will commit to:
           •      Retaining agriculture and open space areas around the City, consistent with
                  the General Plan; and
                                              14

                                                                                     Chapter 2: Land Use
            •      Notifying the City of development applications within the “secondary” SOI
                   adjacent to the City’s Planning Area for comment to avoid potential
                   conflicts.
            Joint planning agreements have been used successfully in many jurisdictions.
            This policy is intended to create a mechanism to protect the open space,
            agriculture, wetlands, and open canals that form the backdrop for the City, so
            that the City can keep a distinct urban edge. The City will also notify Naval Air
            Station Lemoore of development applications on the west side of the Planning
            Area in order to maintain the open space buffer between the City and the air
            station land use.
            LU-I-6       Update the Zoning Ordinance to set appropriate land use densities and
            development standards to ensure its compliance with the General Plan.
            The Ordinance also will include maximum floor area ratios (FARs) for non-
            residential development.
See Chapter 7: Conservation and Open Space for policies related to open space, wetlands,
and preservation of agriculture land outside the Urban Growth Boundary, and Section 2.6
Employment Centers for growth management policies on the Business, Technology, and
Industrial Reserve Area.
Development Mitigation
            LU-I-7       Create, maintain, or upgrade Lemoore’s public and private
            infrastructure to support future land use and planned development under the
            General Plan.
            Infrastructure needs include fiber optic and/or wireless communication systems,
            along with streets, water, sewer, electricity, natural gas, telephone, and cable.
            LU-I-8       Require new development to pay its fair share of the costs of public
            infrastructure, services and transportation facilities, in accordance with State law.
            These may include parks, fire and police stations, schools, utilities, roads or
            other needed infrastructure.
            LU-I-9       Allow development only when adequate public facilities and
            infrastructure are available or planned in conjunction with use, consistent with the
            traffic level of service (LOS) standards and standards for public facilities and
            services established in this Plan.
2.4     RESIDENTIAL AREAS
Lemoore is a highly desirable place to live
and work because of its friendly, affordable,
and high quality neighborhoods, with easy
access to schools, neighborhood parks, and
recreation facilities. The General Plan
promotes residential patterns that blend with
                                                         A typical residential neighborhood in Lemoore.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
Lemoore’s existing qualities. It seeks to build communities and a socially attractive
environment through land use controls and policies. Guiding principles behind
residential development and neighborhood organizing principles depicted on the
General Plan Diagram include:
     •   Mix of Housing Types. The General Plan promotes a mix of housing types in all
         neighborhoods and ensures that no one area is unduly burdened by higher-density
         residences. As discussed in Land Use Classifications, various types of residential uses
         are planned: Very Low Density Residential, Low Density Residential, Low-Medium
         Density Residential, and Medium Density Residential. Some residential development
         may also occur as part of a larger mixed-use project in office or commercial areas.
     •   Medium and High Density Residential Development in Strategic Locations. The
         Diagram locates Medium Density Residential residences in transportation corridors,
         next to parks, community facilities, and schools, and in mixed-use neighborhood
         centers. Higher density development is also proposed on vacant and underutilized
         infill sites in Downtown as well as on suitable sites likely to undergo long-term
         redevelopment.
BUILDING COMMUNITIES
                                        To build stronger communities, the General Plan places
                                        particular emphasis on creating community-centric
                                        activity areas and uses that serve the transportation,
                                        retail, and social needs of residents. The goal is to
                                        direct residential expansion in the new growth areas
                                        into neighborhoods. A neighborhood is defined as an
                                        area generally over forty acres that includes a variety of
                                        complementary uses including neighborhood retail and
                                        restaurants, schools, parks, and other needed services.
                                        Policies in the General Plan strive to promote the
                                        integration of new neighborhoods with existing urban
                                        development, and to preserve and enhance
                                        neighborhood connectivity with a continuous street
                                        network.
                                        Typically, neighborhoods are grouped around a focal
                                        point - a mixed-use center with neighborhood retail,
 Neighborhood centers provide a place   publicly-oriented uses, and open spaces. The
 for residents to shop for daily        neighborhood center defines a community’s identity
 necessities.                           and provides a place for residents to meet and interact.
                                        On the General Plan Diagram, several of these centers
are represented. Within these neighborhoods, the Plan designates sites for a range of housing
types in close proximity to a neighborhood centerpiece. The idea is that a larger number of
residents can be brought closer to the neighborhood focal point, so they can bike or walk to
these areas without having to rely exclusively on automobiles for local trips.

GUIDING POLICIES
LU-G-4  Provide for residential development with strong community identity, appropriate
        and compatible scale, identifiable centers and edges and well-defined public
        spaces for recreation and civic activities.
LU-G-5  Provide for a full range of housing types and prices within each neighborhood,
        including minimum and maximum requirements for traditional and small-lot
        single family homes, townhouses, duplexes, triplexes, and multi-family housing to
        ensure that the economic needs of all segments of the community are met and a
        jobs-housing balance is provided.
LU-G-6  Provide for a transition between higher density and lower density residential
        areas, or require buffers of varying size between residential uses and non-
        residential uses without restricting pedestrian and bicycle access.
IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
LU-I-10 Ensure new neighborhoods include a mix of housing types and community
        facilities oriented to a neighborhood center, in a land use mix consistent with the
        following table and with Table 2.2:

        A neighborhood will be defined by the local street system and typically include
        100-160 acres. New zoning regulations for residential neighborhoods will
        include specific standards for housing types, including spacing criteria, to ensure
        that a full range of housing is provided and that large projects with only a single
        type of housing are not built. The City also hopes that this housing mix can be
        achieved within the existing residential areas as well, through infill development.
        This policy would not apply to neighborhoods with approved area plans or
                                                    17                                         Revised 3-20-2012

2030 Lemoore General Plan
           subject to development agreements or to infill development on sites less than 100
           acres in size.
LU-I-11    Require a centrally located neighborhood square or “commons” within each new
           residential neighborhood that will serve as a focal point for the surrounding
           community.
           Centers are concentrations of activity and uses that serve a neighborhood
           function. They are located within close proximity and easy walking distance to
           adjacent residences, generally no more than ½ mile away. Squares should be at
           least 25,000 square feet in size and include outdoor seating and other pedestrian
           amenities.
LU-I-12    Ensure that the scale, operation, location, and other characteristics of community
           facilities, including parks, schools, child care facilities, religious institutions,
           other public and quasi-public facilities, enhance the character and quality of
           neighborhoods.
LU-I-13    Require new residential development adjacent to established neighborhoods to
           provide a transition zone where the scale, architectural character, pedestrian
           circulation and vehicular access routes of both new and old neighborhoods are
           well integrated.
LU-I-14    Require multi-family developments be planned near existing or projected
           neighborhood centers and open space, and be located within ¼ mile of a collector
           or arterial street.
LU-I-15    Ensure developments for senior housing provide special consideration for
           accessibility options.
           Senior housing projects will be distributed throughout the City within walking
           distance of neighborhood centers and shopping areas. If they are located on the
           periphery of the City, developers will be required to provide evidence that
           adequate and affordable special transportation, such as shuttles, are part of the
           project development.
LU-I-16    Establish zoning regulations for:
           •      Appropriate density bonuses for developers meeting State criteria for
                  affordable housing; and
           •      An additional density bonus for projects undertaking elective off-site
                  improvements (such as park improvements, public art, beautification, and
                  streetscape improvements) that further the City’s community design and/or
                  open space objectives. This latter bonus cannot be combined with the
                  affordable housing bonus. Off-site improvements directly resulting from a
                  project’s impacts, as specified in the Zoning Ordinance, may still be
                  required; the bonus is intended for improvements that go beyond the
                  required minimum.
LU-I-17    Utilize the Agricultural/Rural Residential designated areas as a mechanism for
           preserving active agricultural land and buffering urban uses from agricultural
           uses.

             The City requires Right-to-Farm disclosures (regarding usual odor and noise)
             from new residents in Agricultural/Rural Residential areas to protect adjacent
             active farms from future land use conflicts.
See Chapter 3: Community Design for additional policies on site and building design for
residential development.
2.5       DOWNTOWN AND SHOPPING CENTERS
Lemoore is a city of neighborhoods, connected by several clusters of commercial uses that
provide goods, services, and employment opportunities for both local residents and people
from surrounding communities. These centers are the basis of organizing policies in the
General Plan, and reflect contemporary approaches to retail and commercial areas by
ensuring a diverse range of opportunities are easily accessible to all residents. The Plan
provides for four categories of retail and commercial areas: neighborhood centers located
close to where people live and designed with the pedestrian in mind, mixed-use areas
throughout the City that provide vertical integration of uses and local services in close
proximity to residents but not necessarily as “center”, regional retail centers that serve both
residents and nearby communities, and a downtown mixed use center representing the social,
cultural, and historical heart of Lemoore.
NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERS
A neighborhood center is typically located on an accessible, main transportation artery and is
composed of small-scale commercial land uses that provide goods and services to the local
community. Services found at a neighborhood center may include schools, parks, grocery
retail, restaurants, drug stores, drycleaners, post office, bank, and other small businesses. It is
often surrounded by higher density housing, which helps to support ridership for a transit
stop. To assist local small business owners and ensure that a diverse range of neighborhood
activities are available and easily accessible to residents, the General Plan provides sites for
several neighborhood-oriented centers in both new and existing areas. This Plan would bring
a substantially increased population within a convenient distance of a neighborhood center.
MIXED USE AREAS
Mixed Use Areas are a new land use designation that will have flexible zoning to allow a
variety of activities and mix of tenants within single buildings, including retail, commercial,
professional office, and residential uses. Mixed Use Areas will be located close to
commercial areas, neighborhood centers, and roadway junctions to attract maximum
clientele, but are not necessarily “centers” in and of themselves.
REGIONAL SHOPPING CENTERS
Shopping and consumer activities provide for social contact as well as jobs and tax dollars.
Since Lemoore is located at the intersection of two highways, it can attract shoppers from
around the region, as well as residents from Lemoore. Shopping opportunities typically found
in regional retail consist of large-format national retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target, or Home
Depot. They are planned along major transportation corridors to be highly visible and
accessible, and tend to provide more parking for users.
                                                 19                               Revised 3-20-2012

 2030 Lemoore General Plan
The General Plan encourages more entertainment          Neighborhood commercial at Lemoore Avenue
facilities near downtown such as the Lemoore            and Hanford-Armona Road serves residents as
Cinema.                                                 well as those just passing through.
 DOWNTOWN
 Lemoore’s Downtown encompasses the relocated town center along the railroad that grew
 into present day Lemoore. Its historic legacy is visible in the number and variety of historic
 buildings in the area, such as City Hall, the old 1 st National Bank Building, the Civic
 Auditorium, Doctor Yates House, and others. Downtown is also a focal point for retail,
 recreational, and entertainment activities in the City. Residents and tourists alike enjoy its
 stadium, cinemas, shopping and dining opportunities, as well as other civic and cultural
 activities. In the future, uses such as art galleries and bookstores, more restaurants and shops,
 and mixed residential uses are envisioned.
 The General Plan aims to support the many roles that Downtown plays by promoting mixed-
 use. A mixed-use land use designation allows for a variety of activities, including residential,
 commercial and office uses, as well as public and quasi-public uses. The Plan calls for the
 creation of three new Zoning overlays – Downtown Mixed Use Zone 1, Downtown Mixed
 Use Zone 2, and Downtown Mixed Use Zone 3 with different land use priorities and intensity
 standards to guide future development. A wider spectrum of uses will be allowed to turn
 Downtown into a truly citywide destination.
 GUIDING POLICIES
 LU-G-7        Foster viable, pedestrian-oriented neighborhood centers and strong, visually
               attractive regional shopping centers with a mix of tenants to serve both local and
               regional needs.
 LU-G-8        Continue to nurture a vibrant, mixed-use Downtown that is the pride of the
               community.
 IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
 LU-I-18       Integrate design standards for varying scales of commercial development,
               including large-format regional shopping centers, neighborhood-serving retail
               centers, general mixed-use areas, and Downtown Mixed Use, into the Zoning
               Ordinance.
               These standards will include height and scale requirements, setback provisions
               and standards for screening, lighting, landscaping and location of parking,
               loading, refuse collection, and recycling facilities. These standards will be in

              conformity with the Downtown Revitalization Plan and the Architectural Design
              Guidelines for each zone.
Neighborhood Retail Centers
LU-I-19       Evenly distribute neighborhood retail centers in new development areas and
              encourage a mix of uses in them to offer both choice and convenience for
              shoppers and residents.
              The Land Use Diagram shows where these sites are located. The total acreage
              provided is intended to be sufficient to meet the need for retail space and
              commercial services that can be supported by local residents.
LU-I-20       Encourage existing neighborhood centers to expand to their maximum potential
              through reuse, rehabilitation and infill development.
LU-I-21       Require pedestrian-oriented design and gathering spaces in neighborhood centers
              to facilitate a small-town atmosphere.
LU-I-22       Allow residential above retail and neighborhood serving offices in neighborhood
              centers so long as they are ancillary in size and do not interfere with primary
              retail use.
LU-I-23       Facilitate the revitalization of existing blighted commercial/industrial areas by
              allowing mixed uses, infill, and/or increase in density on site.
              Middle scale retail formats like those in Pioneer Square, Popolo’s, Lincoln Square and
              Candlewick West have difficulty serving a retail market because they are neither large
              enough to complete with national stores, nor small enough to complete with national stores,
              nor small enough to be able to gain a loyal following. The current trend in retail is the

              create a sense of community with positive, varied experiences. A mix of uses, including
              professional offices and residential, may also help to revitalize the area

neighborhood retail centers.
Regional Shopping Centers
LU-I-24     Allow office uses with walk-in clientele that are associated with complementary
            commercial service businesses in regional commercial areas.
            Real estate firms, travel agencies, financial advisors, accountants would be
            permitted, as would second-story offices. A limit on the total square footage of
            ground floor office use could be established in the Zoning Ordinance.
See Chapter 3: Community Design for additional policies on site and building design for
regional shopping centers, and policies on design review requirements for exterior alterations
and additions, as well as new construction.
Mixed Use Centers
LU-I-25     Establish use regulations and development standards for Mixed Use Centers that
            allow a range of uses in the Zoning Ordinance.
LU-I-26     Establish an incentive program for mixed-use development including FAR
            bonuses for uses that contribute to public benefit and shared parking
            arrangements.
            Uses that contribute to public benefit include workforce or subsidized housing,
            daycare centers, and small scale commercial uses such as drycleaners,
            delicatessens and banks.
LU-I-27     Create guidelines and a Best Practices Manual for mixed-use development to
            educate local builders and developers about the types of mixed-use areas the City
            desires.
See Chapter 3: Community Design for additional policies on site and building design for
mixed-use areas.
Downtown
LU-I-28     Establish Downtown Mixed Use Zones (DMX1, DMX2 and DMX3) in the
            Zoning Ordinance with the following land use requirements:
            •     DMX1 will allow retail, commercial, professional office, second-story
                  residential, public and institutional uses, provided retail and restaurant uses
                  are retained as a primary use at the site. Typical new buildings will require
                  a minimum height of at least 16’, with exceptions for uses with special
                  needs (e.g. cinemas). Service Commercial types of uses may be allowed
                  when deemed appropriate through a Conditional Use Permit.
            •     DMX2 will allow retail, commercial, professional office, high-density
                  residential or live/work studios, public and institutional uses.
                                                22                               Revised 3-20-2012

              •     DMX3 will allow professional office and medium-density residential, with
                    small-scale support commercial uses, with bed-and-breakfast use an option.
              The design of all new buildings, including elements such as lot width and
              setback, must respect the character of Downtown and surrounding
              neighborhoods by following requirements set out in the Downtown Design
              Guidelines.
  LU-I-29     Allow a balanced and diverse mix of compatible uses to create a vibrant, 24-hour
              Downtown, such as:
              •     Mixed Use: Encourage a mix of uses in Downtown.
              •     Housing: Promote the development of a variety of housing options within
                    Downtown and in adjacent areas, including higher density near the Depot.
              •     Retail: Promote the development of street-level, consumer-oriented retail
                    establishments.
              •     Community Facilities: Promote high-quality, public development projects
                    that can serve as demonstrations of appropriate downtown urban design
                    principles.
              •     Change of Use: Allow existing units to remodel or upgrade to
                    accommodate new uses, provided they do not change the primary retail
                    character in Downtown or negatively affect historical buildings.
              •     Infill: Provide incentives for infill and development on underutilized land,
                    mixed-use credit for adjacent on-street parking and exemptions for small
                    ground floor retail and restaurant uses.
              Incentives may include, but are not limited to: use of Redevelopment Agency
              façade improvement program, rebate or reduction in development fees,
              adjustments in parking requirements, reductions to building height restrictions,
              expedited applications, and assistance with infrastructure or site improvements.
  LU-I-30     Establish incentives for new retail uses to be located at specific parts of
              downtown to maximize foot traffic and interest.
              New retail uses can act as circulation nodes and attract people to move from one
              point to another. The Zoning Ordinance will allow height bonuses, floor area or
              streamlined review to facilitate such developments.
  LU-I-31     Promote pedestrian-oriented amenities near Downtown such as outdoor seating,
              plazas, public art, weather protection, and waiting areas to reinforce Lemoore’s
              small-town character and provide areas for people to congregate.
  LU-I-32     Promote the rehabilitation of historic structures in Downtown in order to preserve
              the historic identity of the City for future generations.

2.6     EMPLOYMENT AREAS
Policies in this section relate to the following land uses:
    •   Professional Office;
    •   Industrial areas; and
    •   Business, Technology, and Industrial Reserve Area.
PROFESSIONAL OFFICE
The Professional Office land use designation is intended to accommodate offices for
professional persons and other related uses, encourage and sustain Lemoore’s economic
growth, and provide professional services to the community and the region. The General Plan
Diagram provides sites for both large and small office uses. Larger sites are envisioned as
office complexes that draw employees from a wider area. Smaller sites are typically expected
to be local-serving professional and administrative offices providing medical, real estate, or
financial services.
Offices are also permitted in Downtown or Neighborhood Commercial areas. This can be a
very effective use of land where new office uses are located above the first floor or as a
secondary use in multi-tenant buildings in order to promote retail continuity at the street
level.
INDUSTRIAL USES
This designation provides for automobile-
related sales and service, commercial service
uses,     manufacturing,       agriculture-related
production, truck terminals, utility operations,
warehousing, food-processing, and other
industrial uses. Large retailers of appliances,
heavy equipment rental, and sale of mobile
homes or fabricated housing will also go into
this area. Heavy industrial uses are only
allowed along a small portion of 19 th Avenue,
south of Iona Avenue. Due to potential land
conflicts with residential areas, industrial land Industries will be located in the northwest and
is planned only at the edges of the urban area. southern portion of City, away from residential
Buffers and other mitigation devices will be areas.
required if development occurs next to agricultural land or residential areas. City policy
requires that residential uses located within one mile of industry must sign a noise-odor
easement.

    BUSINESS, TECHNOLOGY, AND INDUSTRIAL RESERVE AREA
    The Business, Technology and Industrial Reserve Area is a sub-area located in the southwest
    quadrant of the intersection of SR-41 and SR-198. The area will be reserved for employment
    purposes and will not be developed until planned industrial, business and other employment
    generating land uses allocated for the area north of SR-198 in the General Plan is at least 75
    percent developed. Development of the reserve area will require the creation of a specific
    plan specifying land use, infrastructure, financing, and other planning attributes. When fully
    developed, the area is expected to provide more than 1.5 million square feet of employment
    space and 3,500 jobs.
    GUIDING POLICIES
    LU-G-9      Provide appropriately located areas for a broad range of employment generating
                uses to strengthen the City's economic base and provide employment
                opportunities for residents to achieve a jobs-housing balance.
    LU-G-10     Foster high quality professional office and industrial areas and ensure
                developments are self sufficient, with appropriate infrastructure, community
                facilities, and open space for employees.
    LU-G-11     Protect desirable industrial uses from encroachment by subsequent incompatible
                residential and commercial uses.
    IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
    LU-I-34     Provide sites for employment generating businesses, technology-based
                businesses, light industrial, professional offices, and other businesses wishing to
                locate in Lemoore.
                Locations for these sites are shown on the Land Use Diagram.
    LU-I-35     Allow offices as a secondary use in Industrial areas, upon finding that such use is
                compatible with the primary use and will not adversely affect the traffic-carrying
                capacity of adjacent streets.
    LU-I-36     Allow advanced educational or workforce training uses, such as commuter
                colleges and technology teaching institutes, in Professional Office areas.
                Educational or training facilities are complementary to Professional Office uses
                as they facilitate training as well as research.
    LU-I-37     Allow employee-serving amenities and services such as restaurants, cafes, dry
                cleaners, and other complementary uses in Professional Office areas.
    LU-I-38     Establish setback, landscaping, and screening requirements for Professional
                Office and Industrial land uses and ensure adequate buffering between
                incompatible land uses.
    LU-I-39     Adopt planning practices that support development of employment-generating
                land uses and help the City achieve a jobs-housing balance.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
            Measures include establishing a timetable for annexation, land preparation and
            extension of infrastructure, creating an inventory of “ready-to-go” sites, and
            providing a streamlined permit approval process for substantial projects.
LU-I-40     Allow up to 1.5 million square feet of non-residential development in the
            Business, Technology & Industrial Reserve Area, with up to 60 percent
            industrial, 35 percent office flex/R&D space/support services, and 15 percent
            retail space. A specific plan, including a financing plan for public facilities and
            services must be prepared prior to consideration of any development proposals.
            More non-residential space may be permitted under an approved specific plan
            only if the City determines that acceptable levels of service would be maintained
            on the Marsh Drive interchange at SR-198 and other access roads. The specific
            plan is at a minimum to provide for:
            •      Road connections and traffic capacity to accommodate planned
                   development;
            •      Infrastructure necessary to support the area and benefit the City;
            •      Development and design program, including standards and guidelines for
                   building scale and location, landscaping, parking design and location,
                   undergrounding of utilities, and signs.
            •      Open space protection program, including designation of permanent open
                   space and buffers adjacent to farmlands and the freeway corridors.
            •      Implementation program, including Zoning Ordinance amendments (if
                   required), cost and responsibility for necessary capital and other
                   improvements, phasing of development financing measures, plan
                   administration and enforcement.
            The 400-acre Business, Technology and Industrial Reserve Area, located in the
            southwest quadrant of the SR-198/SR-41 interchange, with access from Marsh
            Drive, is intended for long-term development. Planning for this area is not likely
            to be initiated before 2020, at a time when at least 75 percent of the planned
            development north of SR-198 has occurred. This space will not be needed to
            achieve the community jobs-housing balance within the General Plan 2030
            horizon.
See Chapter 3: Community Design for additional policies on site and building design for
employment areas, and Chapter 8: Safety and Noise for additional policies on noise
mitigation for development west of SR-41.
2.7     AGRICULTURE
While agriculture and rural residential land use classifications appear on the General Plan
Land Use Diagram, these land uses are not proposed for future land within the UGB and are
not a part of the long term development plan for the City of Lemoore. Rather, agricultural
land in the Planning Area is considered a natural resource and a traditional economic engine
for the region, and as such this land outside the UGB is targeted for conservation through
General Plan policies when at all possible. Policies for conservation of agricultural land uses
and retention of a green buffer around the City are included in Chapter 7: Conservation and
Open Space and pertain to both active farming and to species and habitats that exist in both
active and fallow agricultural land.

2.8      PUBLIC AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES
Public facilities such as City Hall, Police, Fire, water and sewerage facilities, transportation
terminals are intended to serve the general public (Schools and Parks are discussed under a
separate category). These facilities are scattered throughout the City.
Community facilities such as childcare services, schools and libraries are common indicators
that measure a community’s quality of life and social well being. Some facilities including
residential care, day care, elderly care, and alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment
facilities, are allowed within neighborhoods because they are considered "protected" facilities
and local zoning cannot exclude them as long as specified standards and licensing
requirements are met. In contrast, large scale community facilities are more appropriate in
mixed-use neighborhood centers, on commercial sites, and in Downtown.
Houses of worship and other places for religious assembly as well as private schools and
colleges are permitted in residential, professional office, and commercial areas, subject to
appropriate location and development standards and conditional-use permit requirements.
GUIDING POLICIES
LU-G-12       Provide appropriate settings for a diverse range of civic, institutional and
              community land uses.
IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
LU-I-41       Ensure adequate elementary and high school sites are reserved in new
              subdivisions, consistent with the Land Use Diagram and State law.
LU-I-42       Designate land for public uses to be maintained through capital projects for parks
              and open spaces, police and fire services, water and sanitary facilities,
              infrastructure and other City services.
LU-I-43       Promote the development of community facilities accessible to both vehicles and
              pedestrians.
For additional policies related to public and community facilities, please see Chapter 5:
Parks, Schools, and Community Facilities, and Chapter 6: Public Utilities.

3 Community Design
This Element addresses the physical character and visual quality of Lemoore’s built
environment. The design of key corridors, downtown, residential neighborhoods, commercial
centers, industrial areas, and public spaces, is central to shaping the City’s visual identity. A
well designed city impresses visitors, attracts investment, and improves the livability and
quality of life for city residents. Urban design policies and guidelines in this Element are
intended to express an urban vision for the future. The goal is to enhance positive features of
the existing community and the design quality of the City.
This Element includes guiding policies and implementing actions for the rural/urban edge,
gateways into Lemoore, connections and corridors linking different areas of the City, urban
activity centers, commercial and industrial areas, residential neighborhoods, “green design,”
and outdoor lighting.
         3.1     GUIDING PRINCIPLES
In recent years, Lemoore has become increasingly committed to high-quality community
design – the adoption of the Downtown Revitalization Plan and Planned Unit Development
Design Guidelines are positive steps in this direction. This Element builds on the design ideas
in these plans, and provides policies that will promote the maintenance and enhancement of
Lemoore’s small town feel and rural heritage.
The following guiding principles capture the essence of community design, as embodied in
this General Plan.
     • Maintain and enhance Lemoore’s sense of place, placing particular emphasis on its
     unique neighborhoods and public gathering spaces such as Downtown and neighborhood
     centers.
                                                3-1

2030 Lemoore General Plan
     • Foster walkability and connections between existing and planned neighborhoods,
     with emphasis on infill opportunity sites along major streets.
     • Enhance streetscapes with street trees and median plantings on both residential
     streets, as well as primary thoroughfares.
     • Design commercial and mixed use centers to be of pedestrian scale, so people can
     feel comfortable and congregate in these areas.
     • Promote visually appealing architecture and high quality developments that promote
     a small town atmosphere.
     • Protect and accentuate Lemoore’s environmental assets, its surrounding natural
     landscape, agricultural farmland, open canals, and wetlands.
         3.2      EDGES AND GATEWAYS
The most identifying feature leading Lemoore’s sense of place is its location amid lush,
natural landscape in the flat plains of Kings County. Lemoore residents strongly identify with
Lemoore’s setting in an agricultural landscape. Views of the surrounding pasture and crop
rows are important aesthetics as one enters the City via SR-41 and SR-198. By creating
strong city boundaries that emphasize the surrounding natural resources, the City is placed
appropriately in the context of the rural San Joaquin Valley.
Currently, the City is bounded to the east by the Lemoore Canal and to the west by wetlands.
However, incidental development has been occuring along SR-41 to the north and south,
agricultural land only loosely denotes the urban/rural edge. Plan policies will help define
Lemoore’s physical form and create a better sense of place. Keeping development within a
perceivable boundary has the added benefit of protecting agriculture lands that are important
to the City.
Strong entries are another important element of community design. The General Plan places
special emphasis on entries, with trees, lighting, and signage placed at appropriate points to
help accentuate the sense of arrival and define one’s experience of the city. Well designed
gateways will help fulfill the goal of enhancing the image of Lemoore.
In the General Plan, the Planning Area boundary is represented by Jackson Avenue to the
south, 22nd Avenue to the west, 17th Avenue to the east, and an area mid-way between
Glendale Avenue and Lacey Boulevard to the north. Visitors entering from the south via SR-
41 will be greeted by a landscaped, master planned industrial park that gently fades into the
countryside. Similarly, visitors entering from all other directions will appreciate a soft
transition between low density residential housing and the surrounding natural landscape.
The location and conceptual character of Edges and Gateways are illustrated in Figures 3-1
to 3-6.

          the urban-to-rural City boundary.
Gateways and Entries
CD-G-2    Enhance key city entrances on primary vehicular corridors.
CD-G-3    Demarcate the transition from rural to urban land with distinct entry features.
CD-G-3 IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
Urban/Rural Edge
CD-I-1    Establish an open country character for new development facing the countryside
          along Marsh Drive, the Lemoore Canal, and portions north of Glendale Avenue,
          portions of Belle Haven Drive, Industry Way, Idaho Avenue, Jackson Avenue,
          and other areas generally illustrated in Figure 3-1, 3-2 and 3-3, to demarcate the
          urban edge. This will be accomplished by:
          •   Enforcing a 50 foot minimum setback requirement on new development
              along these roads (see Figures 3-2 and 3-3);
          •   Creating a 30 foot wide landscaped buffer within the public right-of-way or
              landscape easement (Figures 3-2 and 3-3);
          •   Planting multiple layers of trees closely for visual impermeability, and using
              drought resistant indigenous trees where appropriate;
          •   Providing only minimal street lighting, at a rate that is 50 percent of
              comparable City standard;
          •   Prohibiting the use of solid walls along these edges (all fences must be
              visually permeable); and
                                             3-4

          •    Ensuring the scale and character of development does not overwhelm the
               surroundings by stepping down building heights at the edges.
CD-I-2    Maintain views into the agricultural lands on the rural side of the roadways by not
          planting within the right-of-way and spacing trees farther apart.
CD-I-3    Work with the Lemoore Canal and
          Irrigation Company and other canal
          companies to retain open canals and
          restore the Lemoore Canal to its
          natural appearance, and study the
          possibility of providing a bicycle
          trail along the canal.
          The Lemoore Canal historically has
          formed the eastern edge of the City
          and is an important landmark of
          Lemoore.         However,      annual The Lemoore Canal has untapped potential as a
          dredging activity by the Lemoore trail park with bikeways.
          Canal and Irrigation Company and
          a fence erected along its length prevent public enjoyment of this resource. To
          accomplish this policy, the City will need to revise their contract with the
          Lemoore Canal Company which requires the undergrounding of all canals as
          development takes place. Where undergrounding of a canal is required to
          accommodate development, the City will strive for trail access.

Gateways and Entries
CD-I-5    Create entry gateways at the intersection of SR-198 and Houston Avenue, the SR-
          41 off ramp at Bush Street, the intersection of SR-41 and Hanford Armona Road,
          along SR-41 south of Idaho Avenue, and the off-ramp at SR-198 near Marsh
          Drive with distinctive features, as follows:
          •    Intersection of SR-198 and Houston Avenue. This entry is located at an area
               where the two roads merged to form a triangular piece of land where
               commercial uses are existing. Placing vehicle-oriented street lights with
               welcoming signs attached on each side will accentuate both the City gateway
               and the development nearby. Lush trees planted closely on each side of the
               street will provide another transitional element as one enters from the rural
               area where the roads are marked with fewer trees.
          •    SR-41 off ramp at Bush Street. Regional retail planned around this area will
               attract traffic from SR-41 to the City. The exit will be clearly marked
                                                                                  Revised with

                •    Intersection of SR-41 and Hanford Armona Road. Low density residential
                     developments are planned around this intersection. The natural gas booster
                     station should be camouflaged with heavy landscaping on chain link fence

                     sign will announce the entry into the City.
                •    SR-41 south of Idaho Ave. Industrial development is proposed at this
                     gateway. Improvements to the Lemoore Midget Raceway will be needed if it
                     remains. Landscaping and signage will announce entry to the City.
                •    SR-198 near Marsh Drive. Regional retail is proposed at the northeastern
                     corner to take advantage of the area’s high visibility. A welcoming sign,
                     consistent with Caltrans standards, will be placed in the right-of-way or on
                     the Marsh Drive turn-out. A landscaped greenway at the northern edge of SR-
                     198 will create an attractive buffer as well as accommodate storm detention
                     needs. Rural edge treatment will also be provided at the western side of
                     Marsh Drive.

 Bush Street Improvements
         3.3      CONNECTIONS AND CORRIDORS
The design of major corridors, arterials, and local streets and the manner in which they
connect to each other is a critical design element. The key to enhanced connectivity is to
ensure that new neighborhoods are integrated in the City’s street grid; the way streets connect
to other streets, both within neighborhoods and to commercial or industrial districts. Many
existing subdivisions are not connected to one another and have few outlets onto major
arterials. Also, some collector and arterial corridors in the City are not well-defined and lack
pedestrian amenities and street trees. Improving the streetscape design of these roadways will
contribute to the visual character of Lemoore as a whole.
Streetscapes
Both residents and visitors must travel on streets, regardless whether they drive, cycle, or
walk. As such, street design has a strong impact on one’s traveling experience. A variety of
elements, from the width of streets to the choice of trees, are able to shape how we perceive
the street environment. Design themes such as light and shade, ratio of street width-to-
building height, street continuity, gradient, sidewalk design, relationship between pedestrian
and traffic, all contribute to street character. Maintaining and enhancing street character is the
key to urban design.

State Routes 41 and 198
Lemoore owes much of its historic growth and prosperity to the intersection of two
highways, SR-41 and SR-198. While their importance as circulation corridors is indisputable,
the two routes also divide the City into different quadrants. As such, the design of SR-41 and
SR-198 not only has significant impact on the City’s overall identity as main entryways to
Lemoore, but also vehicular and pedestrian connections that cross them. The General Plan
envisions upgrading the appearance of these corridors, improving cross street connections,
and reducing their adverse impacts on surrounding neighborhoods.
Median Parkways
Median Parkways function as both visual corridors and traffic arteries. A Median Parkway
street has trees on both sides of the street and a wide landscaped median. The median
provides shade and reduces the perceived width of the road, heightening the sense of privacy
and inducing traffic to reduce speed.
In Lemoore, a major Median Parkway street is planned to serve new development in the
western portion of the Planning Area. The parkway will begin at Bush Street, next to the
proposed Wal-Mart at Semas Drive, and end at the proposed SR-198 exit at Marsh Drive. A
landscaped roundabout is also planned at the south end of Semas Drive to facilitate cross-
street circulation and foster visual interest.
Intersections/ Traffic Circles/ Roundabouts
Intersections, traffic circles and other improvements in the Bush Street corridor and the
Westside will enhance connectivity. Specific proposals, shown in Figure 3-6, also include
pedestrian and bikeway improvements.
CD-G-4 GUIDING POLICIES
CD-G-4       Create a well-connected hierarchy of streets that serve existing and planned
             neighborhoods, and strengthen the visual and aesthetic character of the City.
CD-G-5       Create a comfortable street environment for motorized and non-motorized users.
CD-G-5 IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
Streetscapes
CD-I-6       Require landscaping in center medians and at major intersections. Provide
             medians for:
             •   Fox Street from Cinnamon Drive to E Street;
             •   Cedar Lane from Lemoore Avenue to 19 ½ Avenue, in addition to dual
                 parkway strips adjacent to the existing sidewalks;
             •   Hanford Armona Road from 19th Avenue to intersection of SR-41;
             •   Bush Street from 19th Avenue to Marsh Drive; and
             •   Semas Drive from Bush Street to Marsh Drive.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
             Center medians should not include grass, but rather trees and brick stamping
             and possibly low maintenance plants. If the medians contain plants, they should
             also use drip irrigation rather than regular sprinklers.
CD-I-7       Provide parkway strips with large canopy trees and other planting as needed
             along arterial, parkway, and collector (no on-street parking) streets between the
             road and sidewalk to buffer pedestrians from traffic and help define residential
             and commercial streets.
             Parkway strips would not be required in industrial areas or where existing
             monolithic sidewalk conditions would make it inappropriate.
CD-I-8       Require a 15-foot landscaped front setback area along all arterial and collector
             streets outside Downtown, as sites are developed or major renovations
             undertaken.
CD-I-9       Revise right-of-way and pavement standards to reflect adjacent land use and/or
             anticipated traffic, and permit reduced right-of-way dimensions where necessary
             to reduce traffic speed and maintain neighborhood character.
CD-I-10      Incorporate roundabouts as an alternative to signals and stop signs, and provide
             landscaping and other aesthetically appealing features in them where appropriate.
CD-I-11      Preserve and protect heritage trees:
 • Adopt a Tree Protection Ordinance;
 • Require developers to preserve protected trees and submit an inventory and a site plan
    showing the location of all trees prior to any grading, demolition, or site work. Cutting of
    protected trees will require a permit and will only be allowed if trees are diseased, dying,
    or pose a danger to human activity; and
 • Require developers replace a similar tree of like size and
    species within 50 feet of its original location if a
    protected tree is removed during construction.
    The Tree Protection Ordinance will also stipulate which
    trees qualify as heritage trees by type and size, permit
    application details, inventory requirements, and
    violation fines, and may also include maximum number
    of tree cuttings allowed per acreage of development,
    and different standards pertaining to heritage trees, old
    oak trees, riparian vegetation, and trees of community
    interest. These trees typically include Valley Oak,
    Magnolia Ash, California Sycamore, Modesto Ash,
    Italian Stone Pine, and California Fan Palm.
    Cottonwood and Eucalyptus trees shall generally be
    exempt from the Tree Protection Ordinance, unless they         A heritage Sycamore tree      is

CD-I-12      Update parking lot landscaping standards to increase the screening of parking lots
             from the streets and reduce heat build-up from pavement.
             Standards will address the minimum size and location of interior and perimeter
             landscaping, appropriate level of screening consistent with security
             considerations, and type and shade coverage required of parking lot trees. A
             minimum of 1 tree per 6 stalls for double-loaded bays, and 1 tree per 3 stalls for
             single-loaded or side-loaded bays will be required of parking lot shade trees.
CD-I-13      Upgrade City bus stops to provide adequate shelter from sun, rain, and wind, and
             to provide durable, vandalism-resistant seating that is aesthetically pleasing.
CD-I-14      Continue the City’s utility undergrounding program to replace existing wooden
             utility poles and overhead lines with underground utility lines along major
             thoroughfares, and require undergrounding of utilities in all new development.
             Where power lines are too large to put underground, they should be incorporated
             into the street system such that easy access is maintained.
Additional policies on neighborhood streets and connectivity are in Chapter 4: Circulation.

                  of signs and logos convey a positive image of the City.
      CD-I-16     Require “street friendly” designs in new and transitioning commercial
                  developments along SR-41.
                  The typical commercial development is designed with parking in front. New
                  development should reflect a positive orientation to the street, with the active
                  ground floor uses and parking areas screened from view, and provide for new
                  uses which can more fully contribute to the vitality, attractiveness and overall
                  viability of the area.
      CD-I-17     Work with Caltrans to identify needed improvements to its highway facilities.
                  Improvements include:
                  •    Creating a green buffer along parts of SR-198 and SR-41 adjoining residential
                       land;
                  •    Improving connections to local streets through improvements to off-ramps,
                       through-streets, traffic signs, and signals;
                  •    Improving the safety and aesthetics of fencing structures on bridges;
                  •    Establishing aesthetic standards for the design and color of concrete highway
                       dividers and walls; and
                  •    Establishing standards for streetscape improvements, including tree planting
                       along highways, and adding landscaping, artwork, or stamped concrete for
                       future medians.
                  Standards will include type and spacing of trees, shrubs, and setbacks. A
                  minimum 30 feet between the property lines to the edge of the highway should be
                  set aside for trees and landscaping purposes.

Houston Avenue-East D Street Improvements
        3.4      DOWNTOWN DESIGN
Founded in the 1870s, Lemoore was originally planned on a historic grid with intimate,
pedestrian-oriented streets due west of the existing Lemoore High School but later moved to
the current downtown area. Most of the downtown buildings were designed in a mix of turn-of-
the-century Early-American commercial architecture styles, with others reflective of modern
design themes from the 1960s to 70s. The design character is diverse with different roof-forms,
rhythm of openings, design styles, use of materials, ornamentation, detailing, and building
form. Building heights are predominantly one and two stories with retail on the first floor.
Lemoore’s adoption of the Downtown Revitalization Plan and the required implementation of
the Downtown Architectural Design Guidelines represented the City’s first steps towards
improving downtown. Implementation of these guidelines has improved design in general,
strengthened D Street as the heart of the downtown core, improved sidewalks and connections,
and has led to the restoration of a number of historic buildings. Today, two large iron landmark
arches at both ends of D Street mark the entrance to the area. However, more can be done to
improve the urban design quality downtown. The policies in this section aim to improve upon
                                               3-16

  Murals and wall art shown above help improve the look of blank walls and can be used as a design fix
  if buildings with blank walls are already pre-existing. The best solution, however, is not to have blank

  CD-G-9 IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
  CD-I-23     Continue to implement the Downtown Revitalization Plan and require use of the
              design standards provided in the Zoning Code throughout the Downtown Mixed
              Use Zones.
  CD-I-24     Require site and building design be consistent with Downtown’s historic
              character:
              •   Design: All new and renovated buildings must follow the traditional design
                  patterns found along D Street, with large window openings on the lower floor
                  for retail, and regularly spaced windows in upper floors.
              •   Massing: Buildings must follow the rhythm of bays found in the district, each
                  spaced approximately 20 to 30 feet apart.
              •   Setbacks: Buildings must be built to the property line to create a uniform edge
                  and a continued pedestrian path. They may include recessed entry doors.
              •   Access: All new buildings must be orientated to face primary streets and be
                  accessible by a pedestrian entry. Access for loading and unloading may be via
                  the rear of the building only.
              •   Corners: Vertical volumes and changes in height to break up long facades are
                  encouraged at corners. Corner buildings may be provided with special
                  architectural features, including but not limited to: Larger towers, gables, and
                  turrets, a rounded or angled facet, pilasters, overhangs, a corner entrance,
                  corner arcades, or street furniture.
              •   Landscaping: Visible setbacks must be paved or landscaped, and parking lot
                  landscaping will require canopy shade trees.
  CD-I-25     Amend the Zoning Ordinance to
              require all new Downtown
              buildings to have a minimum 20-
              foot street elevation, and allow
              three    story     buildings     with
              residential uses above the ground
              level.
              Existing standards limit building
              height to two-story or 25 feet and
              below. This restricts the amount of
              mixed-uses that can occur.

        and non-commercial banners leading to Downtown and maps informing visitors
        of attractions within Downtown itself.
        Uniform signage and maps directing visitors to Downtown serve to mark the
        area as a special destination.
CD-I-28 Establish a Downtown parking management program:
        •    Exempt ground floor retail and restaurant uses from parking fees;
        •    Identify permanent sites for pocket parking or centralized parking areas
             within Downtown;
        •    Require a five-foot perimeter setback for landscaping and trees at all public or
             private parking areas next to a street; and
        •    Prevent vacant parcels from being used for parking by installing warning
             signs and by planting trees on empty sites.
        Pocket parking areas should be within walking distance from the central core of
        Downtown (D-Street between Fox and Follett Street).

         3.5      AC TIVITY CENTERS
To make new centers of development (as described in the chapter on Land Use) vibrant and
livable, they will be planned as pedestrian-oriented, landscaped “activity centers”. Three
types of commercial centers are identified in land use diagram:
     • Regional Commercial Shopping Centers along major roadways. These centers will
     consist of large-format retail establishments that serve a regional need, are car-oriented,
     usually under unified ownership, and offer numerous service-related job opportunities for
     local residents. A regional shopping center is proposed near the intersection of SR-41 and
     Bush Street and at SR-198 and Marsh Drive.
     • Neighborhood Commercial Centers planned at strategic locations near residential
     areas. These centers are envisioned as “Village Centers” to reflect the small town
     character of Lemoore. They contain smaller stores (an individual store size of
     approximately 5,000 sq. ft., except grocery stores which may be approximately 40,000
     sq. ft.), and have a street-level, pedestrian orientation. By locating them close to
     residential areas, open space, schools, and community facilities, a sense of place can be
     achieved in new neighborhoods.
     • Mixed-use Centers located close to commercial areas or roadway interchanges.
     These centers will adopt flexible zoning to allow a variety of activities and a mix of
     tenants, including retail, commercial, professional office, or residential uses.
This section focuses on community design policies for Regional Shopping, Neighborhood
Centers, and Mixed-use Centers. Additional guidance on land use and development standards
is in Chapter 2: Land Use.
GUIDING POLICIES
Neighborhood and Regional Commercial Shopping Centers
CD-G-7        Ensure that new shopping centers support Lemoore’s small-town character and
              provide convenient pedestrian access to adjacent residential neighborhoods.
Mixed-use Centers
CD-G-8        Promote site sensitive design and pedestrian-oriented amenities in mixed-use
              centers.
CD-G-10           IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
Regional Commercial Shopping Centers
CD-I-31       Reduce the impact of site and building design of regional shopping centers on
              surrounding uses by:

             •    Providing access for pedestrians and bicyclists directly from surrounding
                  neighborhoods;
             •    Designing attractive       hardscape/landscape/pedestrian      entries   at   street
                  intersections;
Revised 3-20-2012
             •    Providing multiple entry and exit points to improve circulation;
             •    Providing sufficient pedestrian pathways between buildings and throughout
                  the site that are visually prominent and aesthetically pleasing;
             •    Providing perimeter landscape and buffering;
             •    Designing shared trash disposal areas that are both effective and aesthetically-
                  pleasing;
             •    Requiring 15 percent of the site to be planting area;
             •    Integrating above ground structures into the overall design scheme; and
             •    Orient buildings to primary streets and points of entry.
CD-I-32      Promote the innovative treatment of parking areas in order to reduce their
             negative environmental impact and avoid the appearance of a “sea of asphalt”.
             Strategies include but are not limited to:
             •    Establish specific standards for shading and plant large trees throughout the
                  parking area as well as along streets, sidewalks, and pathways;
             •    Separate pedestrian pathways from car lanes where possible; and
             •    Use porous paving and a variety of drainage features according to the site.
   Landscaping and plants on parking isles can help   Paving materials that differentiate the walkway
   add interest to the ubiquitous carpark.            from the road or parking areas can be used as an
                                                      urban design element.
Neighborhood Commercial Centers
CD-I-33      Provide a lively neighborhood center environment by allowing ground floor
             activities to spill into public open space, so long as they do not hinder pedestrian
             circulation.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
          Activities such as outside dining, outdoor sales, a farmers market, contribute to
          the vitality of neighborhood centers and the viability of retail in these centers.
CD-I-34   Require design of buildings in neighborhood centers to be consistent with
          Lemoore’s small town character.
          •   Style: Buildings must adopt a style that is non-intrusive in character, i.e. they
              must conform to the surrounding neighborhood and Lemoore’s small town
              character. Inappropriate architecture will not be allowed.
          •   Color: Exterior color and materials must be compatible with those of existing
              buildings. Proposed external materials must be high quality and durable.
              Color schemes will be evaluated on a case by case basis during site plan
              approval.
          •   Height: The height of buildings must not differ by more than one story from
              adjacent buildings. The rhythm of window openings or architectural elements
              must be consistent across each block.
          •   Landscape: At least 15 percent of the site must be planted with trees, shrubs,
              or groundcover.
          The City will develop additional standards for building elements such as
          awnings, commercial signs and window glazing, in a future update of the Zoning
          Ordinance.
CD-I-35   Designate streets and block patterns in neighborhood centers to increase
          walkability and pedestrian circulation.
CD-I-36   Establish minimum standards for
          pedestrian-oriented circulation
          and parking in neighborhood
          centers:
          •   Require buildings to be
              oriented toward the street.
              The ground-level façade
              facing the street should be
              transparent        and       be
              articulated to human scale to
              create      pedestrian-oriented     Transparent windows and doors with limited
              sidewalks.                          signage contribute to a more pleasant, rich, and
          •   Require that the ground floor       inviting pedestrian environment by connecting
              of buildings be at the same         activities occurring within a building to adjacent
              level as the public sidewalk        sidewalk areas.
              and include entries directly accessible from the sidewalk.
          •   Require a continuous street frontage. That is, no building should be setback
              from the street unless a canopy or cantilevered roof structure is provided to
              maintain a continuous sidewalk.
                                              3-24

                                                                      Chapter 3: Community Design
          •    Allow on-street parking. All streets in a neighborhood commercial core
               should provide on-street parking.
          •    Require parking areas to have centrally-located pedestrian access with rows
               of canopy trees to provide shadow walkways.
Mixed-use Centers
CD-I-37   Ensure that new mixed-use center development consider design issues relating to
          scale, massing, building orientation, accessibility, primary view corridors,
          community areas, location of parking and/or loading/unloading areas,
          compatibility of use, landscaping, relationship to surrounding neighborhoods, and
          other site and building design issues in their development.
          At least 15 percent of the site must be planting area.
CD-I-38   Require developers provide a pedestrian friendly environment in mixed-use
          centers with wide sidewalks, small plazas and benches, pedestrian scaled building
          massing, and parking hidden from view from the street.
CD-I-39   Establish a defined center, such as a landscaped area, civic square or transit stop
          with street furniture and other pedestrian amenities, at the core of a mixed-use
          center. Orientate buildings to face this center.
          At least 5 percent of the gross area in each center should be dedicated to public
          gathering space. Land for this purpose may be provided by public land or
          working with developers to create privately-owned public spaces within each
          development.

   Figure 3-2 Typical Neighborhood or Downtown Center
Unlike engineering, there are no hard and fast
rules in the realm of urban design. To achieve
‘good pedestrian scaled design’, context is the
single most important factor. The way we
perceive streetscapes depends on the building
type, degree of activity, design, shape and
color, landscaping, traffic, and other street
elements. Another determining factor is the
street’s width to height ratio. In this case, street
width refers to the whole street width plus
setbacks from building façade to building
façade,
a) Street width to building height ratios of 1:1
are best suited for downtown. At this scale, the
building façade is visible from across the street
and pedestrians are well protected from the
natural elements.
b) A ratio of 2:1 is suitable for mixed use,
neighborhood commercial and residential
areas. At this scale, cars are induced to travel
slower; people are able to address one another
from either side of the street without difficulty.
c) Residential streets at a ratio of 3:1 (or
beyond) are only suitable for rural or very low
density areas. At this scale, the street loses its
sense of enclosure, building facades are barely
visible from across the street and home owners

Community Design policies for Professional Office and Industrial areas are intended to
provide an attractive work environment for those that work in Lemoore. Typical uses include
research and development, administrative and general offices, corporate or regional
headquarter offices, medical offices, professional services, light industrial uses, warehouse
and distribution. A limited amount of retail and service activities is also planned to serve
employees and businesses in the area.
Located primarily along SR-41 and the San Joaquin Valley Railroad track, these areas will
have less relationship with the street than community or neighborhood commercial areas.
Internal pedestrian pathways should provide a safe and well-connected walking environment.
The architecture of office and industrial buildings should be articulated to minimize “boxy”
appearance.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
For a description of land use and associated policies for these areas, refer to Chapter 2: Land
Use.
CD-G-11          GUIDING POLICIES
CD-G-9      Ensure that new professional office and industrial development corresponds to
            its surroundings in building scale, form, and buffering of adjacent uses.
CD-G-10 Ensure that new professional office and industrial development provides
            pedestrian access to the surrounding neighborhoods and within the development
            itself.
CD-G-12          IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
CD-I-40     Establish design standards for new development, and require existing
            development upgrade to these standards when they undergo renovation:
            •    Orient building to face streets. Where development is adjacent to an arterial
                 or parkway, it also needs to be “outward looking” with the perimeter oriented
                 to vehicular traffic;
            •    Prohibit blank walls along streets and other public visible building elevations;
            •    Require industrial building setbacks and foundation landscaping as
                 appropriate;
            •    Require a minimum amount of site landscaping (15 percent), including
                 parking lot landscaping, perimeter landscaping, and foundation landscaping;
            •    Require screening of truck loading, parking, mechanical equipment,
                 transformers, ventilation systems, storage containers, and refuse collection
                 areas;
            •    Require architectural articulation to modulate the horizontal and vertical scale
                 of large buildings;
            •    Provide pedestrian-scale signs throughout new development; and
            •    Restrict truck parking adjacent to highways.
            Visual buffering of loading and parking areas will be carried out by planting
            trees or landscaping, and not by erecting a row of sound walls. Where building

        3.7     NEIGHBORHOODS
Creating and maintaining quality neighborhoods is a key initiative of this General Plan.
Existing neighborhoods should be maintained and improved, and new neighborhoods in
Lemoore should be developed with a strong sense of identity. Policies and design concepts in
this section are intended to create a “sense of place” in new neighborhoods, by recognizing
and strengthening the fundamental elements of traditional neighborhoods. These building
blocks included a mix of housing types, parks, and community facilities; organized around a

neighborhood focal point. Some neighborhoods are subject to policies and standards for noise
mitigation; see Chapter 8: Safety and Noise.
CD-G-13          GUIDING POLICIES
CD-G-11 Encourage development of diverse and distinctive neighborhoods.
CD-G-12 Develop a sense of neighborhood identity through design elements and
            neighborhood focal points, such as commercial areas, schools, parks, community
            centers, or a combination of these elements.
CD-G-13 Ensure that new street networks are coherent and provide multimodal access
            within and between neighborhoods.
CD-G-14          IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
Neighborhood Policies
CD-I-44     Ensure that new residential development enhances Lemoore’s neighborhood
            character and connectivity by establishing the following standards in the
            subdivision ordinance:
            •    Maximum block length: 500 feet, except for blocks with single-family
                 residential uses that may be up to 600 feet long (750 feet with a mid-block
                 pedestrian connection);
            •    Required connectivity: All new streets and alleys must connect to other streets
                 and alleys to form a continuous vehicular and pedestrian network. Local,
                 internal streets should be narrow and designed with traffic calming features to
                 control speed.
            •    Cul-de-sacs: Limit use of cul-de-sacs to no more than ten percent of the
                 length of all streets in a subdivision map, where constrained by surrounding
                 land attributes.
            •    Loop-outs: Encourage use of loop-out streets rather than cul-de-sacs.
            Long blocks are functionally more suitable for automobile use than pedestrians.
            If block lengths are too small, cars will need to pause every few seconds of travel.
            On the other hand, if block lengths are too large, they limit pedestrian
            connectivity. For optimum walkability, block sizes stated above are ideal.
            Where cul-de-sacs are used, require pedestrian and bicycle connections through
            the end to adjacent streets, if a connection is needed to a school, park, retail, or
            connector street.
CD-I-45     Establish residential design guidelines for new subdivisions to include but not be
            limited to:
            •    Require use of varied massing and roof types, floor plans, detailed planting
                 design or color and materials. Maintain overall harmony while providing
                 smaller-scale variety;

           •     Require building facades with distinctive architectural features like windows,
                 chimneys, and other such elements. Use articulation of building massing to
                 reveal internal organization of building elements such as stairs and atriums,
                 internal gathering spaces and major interior spaces;
           •     Require corner buildings to have wrap-around façade architectural details;
                 and
           •     For single-family housing: Ensure adjacent units are different in size,
                 composition and/or design. Designs used in a subdivision should be
                 substantially different from one another so that no plan/elevation should look
                 similar to another.
           •     Homes built in pre-existing neighborhoods should be built in similar scale
                 and design to existing neighborhood as determined by the Planning
                 Department.
           The City’s goal is to ensure variety, prevent “cookie-cutter” developments and
           allow new neighborhoods to develop their unique neighborhood identity through
           design.
    Plan policies require corner buildings to have wrap- Variable roof forms and height create architectural
    around architectural details like the one shown      interest and help larger buildings appear as a series
    above.                                               of smaller modules.
CD-I-46    Require a mix of housing types and community-oriented facilities within multi-
           family zoning districts.
           New multi-family residential development should meet the following design
           criteria:
           •     Minimum 20-foot landscaped yards between streets and parking areas;
           •     Parking frontages limited to no more than 25 percent of lot frontages;
           •     Carport and garage designs that match building designs;
                                                                                    Revised 10-21-2008
           •     Carport locations restricted such that they are not highly visible from public
                 streets; and portable carport covers be prohibited;

              •   Open space such that each dwelling unit has at least 400 square feet of on-site
                  open space, which may be private open space provided by balconies or patios,
                  or common open space;
              •   Common open space for all ages, including tot lots;
              •   At least 50 percent of open space shall be landscaped;
              •   Buffer landscaping, at least 10 feet deep shall be provided along the project
                  perimeter where adjacent to sensitive uses (usually referred to as a ‘buffer
                  area’);
              •   Architecturally interesting buildings that are not bulky and “box-like.” This
                  can be created by requiring variable roof forms in building designs and
                  limiting the dimension of any single building to 125 feet;
              •   Building entries to have roofed projections or recessed entries;
              •   Roof-mounted mechanical equipment should be screened or incorporated into
                  a roof design or, if this cannot be done, such equipment must be ground-
                  mounted on the interior side or in the rear of the lot; and
              •   Pedestrian access provided by walkways to link residential units with other
                  units and with recreational and other facilities within a project.
              Additional development standards and design guidelines will be specified in the
              Zoning Ordinance.

CD-I-47 Discourage gated communities that restrict public access to multi-family and
        single family residential areas but permit only if they do not result in cutting off
        critical access between neighborhoods in accordance with thresholds, standards,
        and design criteria and conditional use permit process described in the Zoning
        Ordinance consistent with other General Plan policies. Small town character
        should remain an important factor throughout the design of any proposed gated
        community.
        Developers build gated communities to appeal to buyers' desire for security and
        prestige. However, studies indicate that safety in gated communities is more
        illusion than reality. Crime rates in gated communities are not necessarily lower
        than non-gated communities. Gated communities are also criticized by
        sociologists as being exclusionary and reinforcing differences along class or
        racial lines. In addition, having physical barriers placed between different
        neighborhoods often impairs bicycle and pedestrian connectivity.
CD-I-48 Minimize the visual dominance of garages by establishing specific standards in
        the Zoning Ordinance, including:
        •    Limiting the front width of a house that can be occupied with a garage to be
             no more than one-half the building width;
        •    Encourage garage setbacks from the front façade, permitting a range of
             setbacks none of which may extend more than 5 feet in front of the building;
        •    Requiring additional setback or off-setting of such garages if more than a
             two-car garage entrance is provided;
        •    Encouraging use of alleys in new development, with garages accessed from
             the rear, yet maintain backyards; and
        •    Incorporating design elements on the second level above the garages such as
             accessory dwelling units, bay windows or balconies.
        Figure 3-15 shows the housing typologies envisioned for this plan, including
        ideas about how to address garage location. Up to 25 percent of homes may have
        street-facing garages that extend in front of the home, but they may not occupy
        more than 45 percent of the building’s street frontage, and the overall project
        designs must include a range of home/garage designs.
CD-I-49 One permanent carport structure may be allowed per dwelling unit in front yard
        setback areas, with the exception of corner lots, so long as their design in the
        front of the house matches that of the housing unit structure and is at least 4’ in
        back of the sidewalk.
CD-I-50 Require all new multi-family developments submit plans for trash enclosures for
        design review approval.
        Trash enclosure walls should be of a block or masonry material and designed to
        match the building where it is located. The enclosure should be accessible to
        residents and businesses, yet located away from main entries. Trash enclosures
        within developments of two-story or more should incorporate a trellis cover or a
        roof design to screen views from above. Landscaping around the enclosure is
        highly recommended. The size and number of enclosures needed should be such
        that the type of use of the project would adequately be served.

                considerations into the design and location of cluster mailboxes to ensure design
                compatibility and increase social contact in the neighborhood.
                Developers are to submit
                architectural     drawings      or
                sketches      illustrating     the
                proposed structures as part of
                the design review process.
                Mailboxes should not be
                installed in the parkway strip
                between sidewalk and street.

    Street/Building Relationship
    CD-I-53     Require new housing to provide transitions between the street and building, with
                variable front setbacks, building articulation and massing.
                Elements such as porches, bay windows, and landscaping can be designed to
                create a transition between public and private spaces.
    CD-I-54     Design local streets not only to accommodate traffic, but also to serve as
                comfortable pedestrian environments. These should include, but not be limited to:
                •   Along Arterial, Parkway, and Collector Streets, street tree planting adjacent to
                    curb between the street and sidewalk (the “parkway strip”) to provide a buffer
                    between the pedestrian and the automobile, as well as in the landscaped
                    buffer between the sidewalk and adjacent buildings/walls, where appropriate.
                •   Along Local Streets, provide a landscape parkway between the curb and back
                    of walk. Additionally, provide a street tree at the rate of one per single family
                    dwelling unit or 30 feet for other uses. This street tree may be located either
                    within the parkway, behind the sidewalk within the utility easement, or in the
                    front yard setback at the choice of the developer or property owner.
                •   Sidewalks on both sides of streets.
    Neighborhood Identity and Boundaries
    CD-I-55     Promote use of design elements that signify neighborhood identity.
                Elements such as a name plaque in a central open space and street lights with
                signs attached to them on a neighborhood commercial street can instill a sense of

                  taller than 3’ once they are even or in back of the main structure and placed at
                  least 3’ behind the back sidewalk. Landscaping shall be required between the
                  sidewalk and the fence and properly maintained by the owner. If proposed
                  fencing placement would obstruct sight lines for vehicular traffic causing a

Security and Defensible Space
CD-I-57       Require new developments to incorporate security and defensible space
              considerations in the design of residential units and neighborhoods.
              Some of the considerations of defensible space include the design and location of
              entries, lobbies, hallways, parking lots, and visual access to adjoining properties,
              “eyes on the park” or “eyes on the street”. The City will continue to review
              design plans to ensure there are no dark corners or neglected spots in track

        3.8      GREEN DESIGN
Green design involves more than community design or aesthetics. It has a direct impact on
environmental resources and the quality of life of current and future Lemoore residents. The
policies in this section demonstrate the City’s commitment to environmental, economic, and
social stewardship, and contribute to the City’s goals of protecting, conserving, and
enhancing regional environmental resources.
A variety of policies described in this General Plan, such as land use policies that foster infill
development, transportation policies that encourage walking, and utility policies that
encourage water and waste recycling that indirectly promote sustainable and environmentally
friendly practices are dispersed throughout the General Plan. This section identifies policies
directly related to site planning as well as “green building”.
Site Planning
Sustainable site planning practices —sometimes also referred to as Low-Impact Design (or
LID)—are designed to reduce environmental footprint of buildings, reduce heat and energy
usage, maintain or restore the natural hydrologic functions on a site through sustainable
design. The goal is to reduce development impacts through arrangements of buildings, roads,
parking areas, and site features. By reducing heat loss, maximizing natural lighting, or
reducing water pollution and other measures, sustainable site design helps to reduce building
maintenance costs and protect the environment. In Lemoore, the impact of sustainable site
planning is maximized when they occur on large commercial and industrial sites planned
along SR-41 and San Joaquin Valley Railroad.
Green Building Design
Green building is a term used to describe a structure that is designed, built, renovated, or
reused in a sustainable and resource-efficient manner. It encompasses energy efficiency
design, water conservation, indoor environmental quality, use of recycled and renewable
materials, and construction waste reduction. The result is a more sustainable building that
enhances the health and productivity of its occupants while saving resources and money. As
of 2007, Lemoore has initiated a study to investigate the possible use of solar power in new
development. However, more can be done. The following goals and policies create a
framework for future guidelines and related sustainable building programs and incentives. It
is important to constantly monitor progress toward implementation actions, and consider
modifications to the implementation program based on feasibility and technological change.

CD-G-15       GUIDING POLICIES
CD-G-14 Provide leadership and guidance to encourage the application of sustainable site
          planning and green building practices in Lemoore.
CD-G-16       IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
Heat and Light
CD-I-58   Require new development to incorporate passive heating and natural lighting
          strategies if feasible and practical. These strategies should include, but are not
          limited to, the following:
          •   Using building orientation, mass and form, including façade, roof, and choice
              of building materials, color, type of glazing, and insulation to minimize heat
              loss during winter months and heat gain during summer months;
          •   Designing building openings to regulate internal climate and maximize
              natural lighting, while keeping glare to a minimum; and
          •   Reducing heat-island effect of large concrete roofs and parking surfaces.
Surface Water Runoff
CD-I-59   Require new development to reduce storm water run-off, control water pollution,
          and promote water recharge through sustainable hydrological design. Measures
          should include, but are not limited to, the following:
          •   Reducing imperviousness by limiting building footprint, using permeable
              paving or landscaping to break up expanses of impervious surfaces;
          •   Using canopy trees or shrubs to absorb rainwater and slow water flow;
          •   Removing curbs and gutters from streets and parking areas, where
              appropriate, to allow storm water sheet flow into vegetated areas;
          •   Incorporating drainage design into the infrastructure, including roof
              downspouts, retention cells, or infiltration trenches, to filter and direct storm
              water into vegetated areas or water collection devices; and
          •   Requiring the installation of sub-surface water retention facilities (for large
              development) to capture rainwater for use in landscape irrigation and non-
              potable uses.

Energy Efficiency
CD-I-60      Incorporate green building standards into the Zoning Ordinance and building
             code to ensure a high level of energy efficiency in new development, retrofitting
             projects, and City facilities. These standards should include, but are not limited
             to, the following:
             •    Require the use of Energy Star® appliances and equipment in new and
                  substantial renovations of residential development, commercial development,
                  and City facilities;
             •    Require all new development incorporate green building methods to qualify
                  for the equivalent of LEED Certified “Silver” rating or better (passive solar
                  orientation must be a minimum component);
                                                3-44

                                                                         Chapter 3: Community Design
            •    Require all new residential development to be pre-wired for optional
                 photovoltaic energy systems and/or solar water heating on south facing roofs;
                 and
            •    Require all new projects that will use more than 40,000 kilowatt hours per
                 year of electricity to install photovoltaic energy systems.
Good Construction Practice
CD-I-61     Adopt a Green Building Design Ordinance.
            Green Building Design Guidelines may include required and recommended
            "green" design and construction subjects including: Building Site and Form,
            Natural Heating and Cooling, Transportation, Building Envelope and Space
            Planning, Building Materials, Water Systems, Electrical Systems, HVAC Systems,
            and Construction Management.
CD-I-62     Facilitate environmentally sensitive construction practices by:
            •    Restricting use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons
                 (HCFCs) and halons in mechanical equipment and building materials;
            •    Promoting use of products that are durable and allow efficient end-of-life
                 disposal (recyclable);
            •    Requiring subdivision applications on sites greater than five acres to submit a
                 construction waste management plan for City approval;
            •    Promoting the purchase of locally or regionally available materials; and
            •    Promoting the use of cost-effective design and construction strategies that
                 reduce resource and environmental impacts;
            Some building materials, such as certain types of heat insulation, damp proof
            membrane, glue or paint, are highly toxic. The City will promote the use of
            sustainable building materials and encourage the purchase of building materials
            from local or regional sources to reduce the environmental cost of transporting
            them from far away sources.
 Photovoltaic roof systems produce emission-free power, Permeable paving allows natural drainage and
 reduce energy cost to the owner, and can help displace contributes to subsurface water recharge. In frequently-
 the amount of power required from City utilities during traveled areas such as parking lots they should be used
 peak hours.                                             in conjunction with pollution filter devices.

          3.9       OUTDOOR LIGHTING
The objectives of outdoor lighting are threefold. First, outdoor lighting is used to facilitate the
safe movement of vehicles and pedestrians, to promote a secure environment and minimize
the potential for crime and accidents. Second, outdoor lighting is used to improve visibility,
especially the legibility of critical nodes, landmark structures, and circulation or pedestrian
zones. Outdoor lighting is also used for aesthetic purposes as they help reveal salient features
of a site or building with either soft ambient lighting or accent lighting.
The question of what type of lighting to use for any given situation will depend on a number
of factors – a combination of safety, urban design, and economic considerations.
     • Function: The quantity of lighting required should correspond to the task performed.
     For example, a variety of street luminaries, mounting configurations and spacing widths
     may be used depending on the type of roads, number of lanes, and the lighting context.
     The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)
     Information Guide for Roadway Lighting, as well as Illuminating Engineering Society of
     North America (IESNA) Lighting for Exterior Environments provides recommendations
     for different situations. A qualified lighting engineer should be consulted when adopting
     new standards.
     • Safety and security: Safety involves providing light on hazards so that they are
     detected with sufficient reaction time. Hazards may include pedestrian path and vehicle
     intersections, crosswalks, stairs and ramps. Darkness, together with unfamiliar
     surroundings, can induce strong feelings of insecurity.
     • Atmosphere and character: Lighting choice for urban design depends on the color
     and size of foreground/background elements, the volumetric form or gradient of light that
     falls on illuminated object, the lighting intensity, and color perception. Incandescent
     lighting, for example, gives a warm tone while florescent lighting emits a cool white
     color.
     • Cost: Purchase, installation, continued maintenance costs are important factors in the
     selection of luminaries. The replacement of old high pressure sodium lamps with newer
     QL lamps1 may mean savings in re-lamping, servicing, and energy costs.
CD-G-17             ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE LIGHTING
It is important to remember that outdoor lighting can cause environmental impacts resulting
in health and community problems. Two negative impacts associated with night time lighting
are light trespass and light pollution. Light trespass, or the “light shining on my window”
syndrome, is a common source of contention between neighbors. Usual culprits are
unshielded floodlights, security spotlights, high wattage pedestrian light, and other poorly
aimed or improperly located lights. Light trespass can be easily avoided by careful lighting
design and design specifications.
Light pollution is uncontrollable light that travels into the atmosphere. This creates “sky
glow” which reduces the viewer’s ability to see the stars and profoundly changes the
appearance of the night time sky. Light pollution may also be a source of glare, causing
discomfort and inducing sleeplessness. Additionally, unshielded light that can be seen from
1
  QL lamp is a type of induction lighting developed by Phillips.
                                                            3-46

                                                                 Chapter 3: Community Design
the sky contributes to a waste of energy. To prevent light pollution, smaller lamp wattages
may be used in conjunction with lower light placement. Figure 3-20 shows some urban
design principles on light usage and placement.
Figure 3-20 Lighting Placement
                                                         Lighting for pedestrian paths should minimize
                                                         contrast and be as continuous as possible.

                                                         Careless placement of path lights create
                                                         glare. Lamps should be angled to ensure light

CD-G-18        CATEGORIES OF LIGHT FIXTURES
Various categories of light fixtures commonly used in outdoor lighting situations are shown
in Figure 3-21 and are described below:
Low-level landscape lights:
           •   Low-level landscape lights are used to illuminate paths, landscape features, or
               show important signage.
           •   Lamp heights are usually below 6 feet but sometimes up to 10 feet.
           •   Lamps may be incandescent, compact fluorescent, induction, or metal halide.
               Mercury vapor lamps or high-pressure sodium lamps are not recommended.
           •   Low-wattage capabilities, with limited intensities.
           •   Light sources should be below eye level to control glare.
           •   Low maintenance and high susceptibility to vandalism are important
               considerations.
Intermediate-height pedestrian lights:
           •   These are used in and around pedestrian paths for safety and security
               purposes. Average height is around 10 feet.
           •   Lamps can be compact florescent, induction, or metal halide. Incandescent,
               mercury vapor, or high pressure sodium lamps are not recommended.
           •   Lower fixture mounting heights are susceptible to vandalism and damage
               from lawn mowers.
Parking lot and roadway lights
           •   These are used to light streets, parking lots, recreational, commercial, and
               industrial areas.
           •   Average heights between 12 and 32 feet.
           •   Lamps may be metal halide induction, mercury vapor, high pressure sodium.
High-mast lights
           •   High-mast lights are only used in selected locations such as on sport fields or
               highway interchanges.
           •   Heights are usually greater than 50 feet and fixtures must be lowered to be
               maintained.
           •   Lamps can be metal halide or high pressure sodium.

              recommendations put forth by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North
              America (IESNA) Design of Roadway Lighting (RP-8);
          •   All outdoor lighting fixtures shall be energy-efficient. Parking lot light
              fixtures and light fixtures on buildings shall be full cut-off fixtures and all
              permanently installed exterior lighting shall be controlled by either a
              photocell or an astronomical time switch;
          •   Lighting design in parking lots, commercial and industrial areas shall be
              coordinated with the landscape plan to ensure that vegetation growth will not
              interfere with the intended illumination;
          •   Light levels in all new development, parking lots, and street lights to not
              exceed industry and state standards;
          •   Lighting along the urban-rural edge should be designed to provide one-half
              the light standard for urban areas.
          All new development is to submit an outdoor lighting plan for approval during
          the design review process and regular site plan review.
CD-I-64   Create and adopt a Dark Sky Ordinance to minimize glare, light trespass,
          excessive lighting and other forms of light pollution to preserve the enjoyment of
          the night sky and night environment.
          A Dark Sky Ordinance allows the City to enforce lighting regulations and control
          light pollution.
CD-I-65   Do not allow continuous all night outdoor lighting in sport stadiums, construction
          sites, and rural areas unless they are required for security reasons.
CD-I-66   Educate the public about light trespass and light pollution and establish a
          voluntary program to encourage existing sources of light pollution to convert to
          non-polluting, energy efficient lighting systems.
          The City will use its website and newsletter to raise awareness of these issues.

4 Circulation
The Circulation Element is intended to provide guidance and specific actions to ensure the
continued safe and efficient operation of Lemoore’ circulation system. The Element is based
on a fundamental philosophy that traffic conditions in the City can be managed through a
comprehensive program of transportation planning, land use planning, and growth
management strategies. This Element includes provisions for roadways, truck routes, transit,
rail use, pedestrian, and bicycle transportation modes, as well as parking.
State law recognizes that circulation and land use are closely related and requires that policies
in this Element and the Land Use Element be linked. Careful integration of the City’s traffic
and circulation policies with its land use policies will ensure that there is sufficient roadway
capacity to accommodate traffic generated by planned future development. The City is
committed to designing a system of regional routes, local roads, public transit, and bicycle
and pedestrian routes that will enhance the community and protect the environment.
The Circulation Element includes policies related to the physical framework for development
that the circulation system is designed to serve, and includes policies for parking and public
transportation.
4.1      BACKGROUND: CONTEXT
Transportation programs are based on circulation system planning and land use planning. The
City’s traffic circulation planning efforts are integrated with those of the Kings County
Regional Transportation and Caltrans in a cooperative, regional planning effort. State of the
art traffic engineering is used to bring planned improvements to reality. Only through the
development and implementation of all these strategies can the City’s commitment to a
balanced, efficient circulation system be achieved.
Another objective of this Element is to create a balanced transportation system that addresses

2030 Lemoore General Plan
General Plan provides for new routes to serve new development and expansion of capacity
and efficiency of the existing circulation system. In addition, the Plan provides for narrower
streets in some areas than might otherwise be designed based on traffic requirements alone.
The Element recognizes the need to provide an environment that encourages walking,
particularly at high-activity centers, and provides ways to reduce auto-dependence by
facilitating the use of alternate modes of travel.
4.2      ROADWAY NETWORK
At the core of Lemoore’s circulation network is the roadway system. All modes of
transportation depend to some degree upon the roadway system. In Lemoore, this system is
based on a traditional grid pattern in the downtown surrounded by a system of arterial and
collector roadways. Regional access is provided by SR-198 from northeast to southwest and
SR-41 from north to south. The hierarchy of street classifications is shown in Figure 4-1 and
listed in Table 4.3, while the general design is shown on Figure 4-3.
C-G-1      STREET SYSTEM
Highways. Highways are designed to carry heavy traffic volumes at speeds of 40-65 miles
per hour and link the City with other nearby urban areas. Lemoore is bisected by two
highways – SR-198 in an east-west direction and SR-41 in a north-south direction. On both
highways, access is limited, crossings are generally signalized at grade or grade-separated,
parking is not allowed, and a continuous median separates lanes moving in opposite
directions. On SR-198 between the City of Hanford to Lemoore Avenue exit, a concrete wall
separates eastbound and westbound traffic. In the near future, Caltrans anticipates continuing
the wall to the Lemoore Naval Air Station.
Arterial Streets. Arterial streets are designed to move large volumes of traffic between
highways and other arterials in Lemoore and to adjacent jurisdictions. Major arterials are
access controlled roadways emphasizing mobility between major portions of the City and to
regional freeways and highways. The only major arterial the City has is on a portion of
Hanford-Armona Road from Blake Street (near Lemoore Avenue) to the Lemoore Canal.
Minor arterials provide mobility through the City and access to major residential,
employment, and activity centers. On-street parking should not be provided on major arterials
but may be appropriate for minor arterials that emphasize accessibility over mobility. Minor
arterials should provide two lanes and striped bike lanes in each direction of travel. Where
inadequate room exists to stripe bike lanes in the street, large sidewalks should be installed to
protect children walking or bicycling to school. Driveway access should be minimized,
consistent with the primary function of arterials to move through traffic. Landscaped
parkway strips, sidewalks, and transit facilities may also be accommodated within the right-
of-way of minor arterials, depending on the right-of-way width. Lemoore Avenue, 19 th
Avenue, Bush Street, D Street, Belle Haven Drive, Iona Avenue, College Drive, Pedersen
Avenue, Marsh Drive, Semas Drive (which is also a parkway), Jackson Avenue west of 19 th
Avenue, and portions of Hanford-Armona Road are examples of this category. Where older
streets cannot accommodate parkways, street trees will be planted in tree wells within
sidewalks while maintaining adequate handicapped access. (Lemoore Avenue is a perfect
example of a street with challenges.)

Median Parkways. Median Parkways are
designed to provide a scenic and pastoral
driving experience. It is a street that has full or
partial access control, divided by a wide,
landscaped median with trees. It is usually
located adjacent to residential neighborhoods
or extremely wide roadways segments, and
prohibits trucks or commercial vehicles on
many segments. Buses are not considered
commercial vehicles in this case. All of Cedar
Lane, Golf Links Drive, and the proposed
                                                      Lemoore Avenue is one of the busiest arterials
Semas Drive falls under this category of street

system as well as portions of Hanford-
Armona Road, Fox Street, and Bush Street as
depicted in Figure 4-1.
Collector Streets. Collector streets provide a link between neighborhood streets and arterials.
Collectors provide two through travel lanes, in addition to any bike lanes where called for in
the bikeway plan. In fact, all collectors should be designed to include bicycle lanes. On-street
parking may be provided if sufficient width is available. Collectors also provide access to
adjacent properties, so driveway access should be discouraged but need not be restricted
(subject to accepted engineering practices). Bike lanes, landscaped parkway strips, sidewalks,
and transit facilities may also be accommodated depending on the right-of-way available.
Collector Streets include Hanford-Armona Road, west of Belle Haven Drive, Industry Way,
Cinnamon Drive, Cedar Lane, 19th ½ Avenue, Liberty Drive, Fox Street, Follett Street,
Daphne Lane as well as the three proposed collectors (2 north-south and 1 east-west) in the
north-easterly part of the City.
Local Streets. The primary function of local streets is to provide direct access to adjacent
properties. Local streets should provide two travel lanes, landscaped parkway strips, and
sidewalks. On-street parking may be restricted if needed. Bike lanes are usually not needed
because these streets carry low traffic volumes and all are considered to be bicycle friendly.
Rural Streets. Rural streets are not a technical classification. However, the City uses this
term to describe streets that are outside of or near the edge of the Urban Growth Boundary or
Planning Area or can be located in very low density residential neighborhoods. Along the
urban/rural edge, some collector and arterial streets have been designated; they will be
designed as streets with rural “edges,” as illustrated in Chapter 3: Community Design. Rural
Streets typically have two travel lanes without curbs or gutters and have little or no lighting.
The only exception would be Marsh Drive, which is anticipated to contain four travel lanes
and other City improvements on one side of the street.

C-G-2     LEVEL OF SERVICE
The Level of Service (LOS) concept is generally used to measure the amount of traffic that a
roadway or intersection can accommodate, based on maneuverability, driver dissatisfaction,
and delay. LOS ranges from LOS A, or free-flow conditions, to LOS F, or jammed
conditions. These conditions are generally described in Table 4.1. The daily capacities for
Lemoore are shown in Table 4.2.
Table 4.1 Qualitative Description of Level of Service
Level of Service Driver’s Perception
      A/B        LOS A / B are characterized by light congestion. Motorists are generally able to
                 maintain desired speeds on two and four lane roads and make lane changes on
                 four lane roads. Motorists are still able to pass through traffic-controlled
                 intersections in one green phase. Stop-controlled approach motorists begin to
                 notice absence of available gaps.
       C         LOS C represents moderate traffic congestion. Average vehicle speeds continue
                 to be near the motorist’s desired speed for two and four lane roads. Lane change
                 maneuvers on four lane roads increase to maintain desired speed. Turning traffic
                 and slow vehicles begin to have an adverse impact on traffic flows. Occasionally,
                 motorists do not clear the intersection on the first green phase.
       D         LOS D is characterized by congestion with average vehicle speeds decreasing
                 below the motorist’s desired level for two and four lane roads. Lane change
                 maneuvers on four lane roads are difficult to make and adversely affect traffic
                 flow like turning traffic and slow vehicles. Multiple cars must wait through more
                 than one green phase at a traffic signal. Stop-controlled approach motorists
                 experience queuing due to a reduction in available gaps.
       E         LOS E is the lowest grade possible without stop-and-go operations. Driving
                 speeds are substantially reduced and brief periods of stop-and-go conditions can
                 occur on two and four lane roads and lane changes are minimal. At signalized
                 intersections, long vehicle queues can form waiting to be served by the signal’s
                 green phase. Insufficient gaps on the major streets cause extensive queuing on
                 the stop-controlled approaches.
        F        LOS F represents stop-and-go conditions for two and four lane roads. Traffic flow
                 is constrained and lane changes minimal. Drivers at signalized intersections may
                 wait several green phases prior to being served. Motorists on stop-controlled
                 approaches experience insufficient gaps of suitable size to cross safely through
                 a major traffic stream.

The City of Lemoore does not currently have any adopted level of service (LOS) standard.
However, recent traffic studies have used level of service D as the standard for evaluating
project impacts at intersections. Caltrans endeavors to maintain a target LOS at the transition
between LOS "C" and LOS "D" on SR-facilities, however, Caltrans acknowledges that this
may not always be feasible and recommends the lead agency consult with Caltrans to
determine the appropriate target LOS. If an existing State highway facility is operating at less
than the appropriate target LOS, the existing measures of effectiveness should be maintained.

Intersections
Intersections were not evaluated as part of this General Plan. Rather, roadway segments were
the focus of the Dowling Associates, Inc. analysis. That said, several locations where major
changes in the roadway traffic demand that results in roadway widening will also require the
consideration of traffic signal installation and/or modifications. City staff reviewed recent
project-specific traffic studies and the 2007 Impact Fee Report in order to anticipate what
intersections may likely need signalization or other improvements as well as railroad crossing
improvements. These anticipated improvements have been included in Figure 4-2. Prior to
moving forward with such projects, a traffic warrant study should be done to evaluate the
need based on seven warrants. Stop or yield signs are not reviewed in this plan and their
installation is determined by the Police Department. An anticipated lane configuration
column is included in Table 4.3. The recommendations for left or right turn lanes would
apply to the intersections located along the roadway segments. The recommendation for a
center turn lane would apply to the mid-block portion of the roadway segment. Further
analysis of peak hour operations at all critical intersections will be undertaken as part of
implementation of the recommended turn lanes to ensure that where independent turning
lanes are needed, they are provided.
2007 Traffic Conditions and Forecast Volumes
To determine existing conditions and the impact of General Plan development on traffic
conditions, a Traffic Model was constructed for selected street segments. Traffic volume-to-
capacity ratio and the resultant levels of service (LOS) for existing conditions and for the
build out under the General Plan are shown in Table 4.3.1 No roadway segments were found
to operate at unacceptable levels of service under existing conditions.
For the buildout condition, the roadway improvements listed above were assumed
constructed. Under the build out condition, all City roadway segments operate at acceptable
levels of service. No further improvements are needed to maintain acceptable operations. It
should be noted that the Circulation Element includes policies directed to local intersection
impacts, which should be addressed during the normal environmental review of a project, as
needed.
C-G-3 TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT FOR THE BUSINESS, TECHNOLOGY, AND
INDUSTRIAL RESERVE AREA
To minimize traffic impacts, the General Plan requires adoption of a Transportation
Performance Monitoring (TPM) program, as part of the specific plan for the Business,
Technology, and Industrial Reserve Area on the southside of SR-198 between 21st Avenue
and SR-41. This will ensure that the Marsh Drive/21st Avenue interchange at SR-198 will
not operate at unacceptable service levels once it is fully constructed.
C-G-4      CITYWIDE STREET DESIGN
The design objectives for street standards are as follows:
    •    To provide guidance for a system of public streets that will meet the City’s needs.

    • To ensure that streets will fulfill their intended functions, consistent with the General
    Plan, and support multiple modes of travel.
    • To provide adequate traffic-carrying capacity, while minimizing width, to create
    strong neighborhood character.
    • To create a system of sidewalks and bikeways which promote safe walking and
    bicycle riding for transportation and recreation.
Table 4.4 establishes the required elements and typical widths for each street classification
that serves residential neighborhoods. All street designs are subject to review and approval by
the Planning Commission, City Council, Planning Department and Public Works
Department. Figure 4-3 showcase typical street sections.

                                                                             Chapter 4: Circulation
Connectivity
Traditional grid street designs allow for through movement and good connections between
and within neighborhoods. Short blocks offer a choice of routes and enable more direct
connections. Variations from the traditional grid can allow for diagonal and curvilinear
streets as well as larger or smaller blocks for maximum flexibility and improved connectivity.
Some neighborhoods in Lemoore have been built using many cul-de-sacs. This type of design
promotes circuitous travel and results in traffic being distributed along fewer streets where
heavy traffic concentrates. More desirable is a grid-based development that balances a sense
of proximity and ease of access with the quieter environments of neighborhoods. In order to
ensure that street layout in future development incorporates the need for neighborhood
connectivity and the comfort and safety of pedestrians and bicyclists, it is essential that:
    • New development be "connected" to the surroundings with an increased number of
    access points and pedestrian and bicycle connections to the neighborhood network;
    •    Blocks be short to allow for more direct connections;
    • Neighborhood streets be designed at a human-scale, without excessively wide streets;
    and
    • Traffic controls are incorporated including speed limits, signage and truck routes to
    restrict commercial traffic in neighborhoods.
As part of the detailed planning that will follow Plan adoption, new residential development
will need to be linked through transportation to the State highway system, Downtown and
other employment centers, as well as shopping locations in Lemoore.
Careful integration of land use and transportation systems will be especially critical between
the eastern and the western part of Lemoore, given that both sides are separated by SR-41,
with only Bush Street and Hanford-Armona Road connecting the parts locally. As already
noted, there is potential in the planning area to foster development that supports pedestrian-
oriented development and maintains a “small-town” atmosphere; however, simply allowing
market-driven development, without regard to use mix, dispersion and connections with the
transportation system, will not be considered adequate. Attention must be given to the design
and location of pedestrian and bicycle networks, the design of linkages, the location of
parking and provisions for local transit will be essential. The following guiding and
implementing policies are designed to address the issues described in this Element:

C-G-11 IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
Overall Circulation System Planning
C-I-1    Adopt street standards that provide
         flexibility in design, especially in
         residential neighborhoods. Revise
         right-of-way and pavement standards
         to reflect adjacent land use and/or
         anticipated traffic, and permit
         reduced right-of-way dimensions
         where necessary to maintain
         neighborhood character.
                                                    Plan policies aim to increase pedestrian safety
          Cross-sections and design standards       and improve the attractiveness of roads in the
          are shown on Figure 4-3. Some             City.
          existing    areas     may      require
          additional right-of-way to accommodate buildout traffic demand, or may be
          constrained by existing land use, which may limit the City’s ability to meet the
          standards in Table 4.4.
C-I-2    Require all new developments to provide right-of-way and improvements consistent
         with the General Plan street designations and street cross-section standards. Further,
         ensure that either the City Capital Improvement Program Budget or new
         developments carries out the planned improvements included in Table 4.3.
         Alternative improvements shall be considered if supported by a traffic assessment
         conducted under the guidance of City staff.
          Within infill areas, the City may just require that street improvements match the
          designs and cross-sections of abutting streets.
C-I-3    Provide for greater street connectivity by:
          •   Incorporating in subdivision regulations requirements for a minimum number
              of access points to existing local or collector streets for each development (e.g.
                                              4-26

                                                                         Chapter 4: Circulation
          at least two access points for every 10 acres of development, with additional
          access, if warranted, for multi-family housing);
      •   Encouraging the construction of roundabouts instead of traffic signals and 4-
          way stop signs, where feasible;
      •   Requiring bicycle and pedestrian connections from cul-de-sacs to nearby public
          areas and main streets; and
      •   Requiring new residential communities on undeveloped land planned for urban
          uses to provide stubs for future connections to the edge of the property line.
          Where stubs exist on adjacent properties, new streets within the development
          should connect to these stubs.
C-I-4 Develop a multi-modal transit system map integrating bicycle, public transportation,
      pedestrian and vehicle linkages within the City to ensure circulation gaps are being
      met. Safe Routes to School and any necessary related improvements will also be
      shown on this map, and costs and priorities indicated based on need.
C-I-5 Use traffic calming measures to reduce speeds in existing and future residential
      areas. Traffic calming measures may include, but are not limited to:
      •   Reducing curb-to-curb pavement
          widths      to    the    minimum
          necessary to ensure traffic flow
          and safety;
      •   Allowing on-street         parking
          where possible;
      •   Providing generous street tree
          plantings and other vegetation;
      •   Building corner bulb-outs and
          intersection roundabouts;             Landscaped medians will be provided to calm
      •   Allowing for curvilinear street       traffic, add greenery to the City, and reduce
          design; and                           heat reflected from pavements.
      •   Installing, where appropriate,
          specific traffic calming features, such as bulb-outs and medians.
      These measures are preferred over the use of speed bumps and undulations. As
      part of the planning and design for the implementation for traffic calming devices,
      the City will evaluate the impacts to adjacent neighborhoods created by cut-
      through and diverted traffic patterns.
C-I-6 Establish vehicular access controls that limit access to developments from new
      median parkways, such as Semas Drive, by:
      •   Limiting left-turn intersections to only major intersecting roads by use of
          medians; and
                                           4-27

2030 Lemoore General Plan
          •   Limiting driveway access for new development along parkways by promoting
              use of alleys and frontage streets.
Traffic Level of Service
C-I-7    Develop and manage the roadway system to obtain Level of Service (LOS) D or
         better for two hour peak periods (a.m. and p.m.) on all major roadways and arterial
         intersections in the City. This policy does not extend to local residential streets (i.e.,
         streets with direct driveway access to homes) or state highways and their
         intersections, where Caltrans policies apply. Exceptions to LOS D policy may be
         allowed by the City Council in areas, such as Downtown, where allowing a lower
         LOS would result in clear public benefits, social interaction and economic vitality,
         and help reduce overall automobile use.
          No new development will be approved unless it can be shown that required LOS
          can be maintained on affected roadways either through this General Plan
          documentation or more specific traffic studies conducted through the City where
          appropriate.
C-I-8    Develop and manage local residential streets (i.e., streets with direct driveway
         access to homes) to limit average daily vehicle traffic volumes to 1,100 or less and
         85th percentile speeds to 25 miles per hour or less.
          An average daily traffic volume of 1,100 is considered the threshold for a local
          residential street. Traffic volumes above this level tend to change the street from a
          residential street where children can play to a traffic street with the primary task of
          moving traffic.
C-I-9    Establish a Transportation Performance Monitoring (TPM) program for the
         Business, Technology, and Industrial Reserve Area, generally located in the
         Southwest quadrant of SR-198 and SR-41, to monitor and control traffic arising
         from new development.
          Development occurring within the TPM program area or any other such
          designated portion of the City must submit data to the City Engineer to calculate
          the number of site trips generated per developable acre. Within this area,
          development “caps” will be assigned to maintain service levels within traffic
          analysis zones (TAZs). Developers must provide data to the City Traffic Engineer
          for site trip calculations and reduce the number of housing units or size of non-
          residential buildings if the number of trips exceeds the allowed cap to gain
          development approval. The City will maintain a “trip ledger” showing all site trips
          that have been approved for each TAZ, with allocations made on the basis of
          receipt of a Certificate of Reservation of Site Trips or a building permit
          application. The City Council will periodically review the trip generation rates and
          allowable adjustments and exceptions established for the TPM program and the
          trip allocations by TAZ, and allow for recalculation of the maximum number of site
          trips allowed based on approved changes in trip generation rates or other
          adjustment factors. Details on how trip generation rates are established, how site

        trips are calculated, how the trip ledger is maintained, how exceptions are granted
        and what happens when unallocated site trips are unavailable will be included in
        the ordinance establishing the TPM once a Specific Plan has been developed.
C-I-10 Require traffic impact studies for any proposed General Plan amendment that will
       generate significant amounts of traffic (such as 100 or more peak hour trips).
        Specific thresholds will be based on location and project type, and exceptions may
        be granted where the traffic generation is consistent with the assumptions made for
        this General Plan or traffic studies have been completed for adjacent development
        and the City knows what mitigation, if any, will ensure that LOS standards will be
        maintained. The City’s new traffic model developed for the 2030 General Plan will
        facilitate this analysis. Detailed intersection and queuing analyses may be required
        to determine site specific improvements as circumstances warrant.
C-I-11 Establish and implement additional programs to maintain adequate peak hour LOS
       at intersections and along roadway segments as circumstances warrant, including
       the following actions:
        •   Collect and analyze traffic volume data on a regular basis (at least every 5
            years) and monitor current intersection and roadway segment levels of service
            on a regular basis. Use this information to update and refine the City's travel
            forecasting model, so that estimates of future conditions are more strongly
            based upon local travel behavior and trends.
        •   Consider, on a case by case basis, how to shift travel demand away from the
            peak period by changing work shift starting times, especially in those situations
            where peak traffic problems result from a few major generators (e.g. the West
            Hills College area and Bush Street corridor and the Industrial Area south of the
            City).
        •   Perform routine, ongoing evaluation of the efficiency of the urban street traffic
            control system, with emphasis on traffic signal timing, phasing and
            coordination to optimize traffic flow along arterial corridors. Use traffic control
            systems to balance arterial street utilization (e.g. timing and phasing for turn
            movements, peak period and off-peak signal timing plans).
        To assure acceptable traffic operating standards over time, the Public Works
        Department will conduct on-going traffic counts and the City Engineer or other
        designee will monitor conditions on an ongoing basis and apply applicable
        remedial measures as needed.
C-I-12 To increase roadway safety and maintain emergency access between Cedar Lane
       and Lemoore Avenue:
        •   Construct the extension of Cedar Lane to Lemoore Avenue as a two-lane
            collector roadway with restricted access on Lemoore Avenue to only allow
            northbound left, southbound right, and eastbound right turn movements;
                                              4-29

2030 Lemoore General Plan
           •   Construct a center median along Lemoore Avenue to restrict all other
               movements (such as eastbound left turns from Cedar Lane onto northbound
               Lemoore Avenue). Further, do not provide any pedestrian crossings of Lemoore
               Avenue at this location;
           •   Provide crosswalks across Cedar Lane at Lemoore Avenue;
           •   Provide a stop control sign on the Cedar Lane approach to the intersection with
               Lemoore Avenue. No signalized traffic controls will be provided on Lemoore
               Avenue; and
           •   Cul-de-sac Larish Street approximately 220 feet west of Lemoore Avenue to
               eliminate cut-through traffic and better facilitate southbound left turn
               movements into the High School parking lot.
Funding for Improvements
C-I-13    Continue to require that new development pay its fair share of the costs of street and
          other traffic improvements based on traffic generated and its impact on traffic
          service levels.
C-I-14    Establish city-wide traffic impact fees to provide additional funding for
          transportation improvements needed to serve new development, including new
          interchanges and ramps. Provide for automatic annual adjustments in traffic fees to
          reflect increases in construction costs (e.g. materials, rate of inflation, etc.).
4.3      TRUCK ROUTES AND RAILROAD CORRIDOR
C-G-1     TRUCKS
In addition to moving people, the roadway system in Lemoore carries a substantial number of
trucks moving goods. Specific truck routes have been designated throughout the City and are
shown on Figure 4-4. These routes are designed to allow truck traffic to pass through the
City with minimal impact on residential neighborhoods as well as local vehicular and
pedestrian traffic.
C-G-2     RAIL
The San Joaquin Valley Railroad provides
east-west train operation service on Union
Pacific owned land in the City. An average
of two train trips stop in, and/or pass
through, the community per day with speeds
ranging from 10-40 miles per hour.
In 2000, the City of Lemoore worked with
the cities of Huron and Visalia to form the
Cross Valley Rail Corridor Joint Powers            In downtown Lemoore, the multi-modal railroad
Authority (CVRC JPA) to upgrade 45 miles           depot is aesthetically-pleasing and provides current
                                                   transit and future passenger rail opportunities.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
By 2004, the upgrade allowed the accommodation of 286,000 pound railcars to safely travel
down the line with the intent of improving economic development opportunities for
communities along the rail line and removing trucks off valley highways.
At this time, the primary rail shipper in Lemoore is Leprino Foods. In an attempt to further
utilize rail access, the City created an new industrial park on the north side of the railroad
tracks west of Belle Haven Drive to help accommodate future industries to locate within the
community that require the use of the railroad. As a branch facility, the railroad only carries
freight at this point in time and stops on demand.
Crossing arms are required at all arterial and collector railroad crossings. Railroad crossing
improvements are needed at all existing crossings in Lemoore with the exception of Belle
Haven Drive which was constructed in 2001 and 19th ½ Avenue. Two new railroad crossings
are needed in the future to accommodate needed roadway connectivity, one at Daphne Lane
and one at the College Drive alignment. Improvement locations are shown on Figure 4-2.
In 2003, the City relocated, reconstructed, and renovated the old Strathmore train depot on
the south side of the tracks just north of Heinlen Street, where Lemoore’s old passenger and
freight rail depot used to stand. This building is the same year and type station as the
previously demolished Southern Pacific rail depot. The intent of the project was to bring back
a historic depot, provide a multi-mode component to the downtown area, and prepare for
future passenger rail service along the line. This general plan designates the current depot and
a second site on the Westside of Lemoore near West Hills College for future passenger rail.
An extensive passenger rail feasibility study by Kings County Association of Governments in
the 1990’s looked at the entire local rail system run by the San Joaquin Valley Railroad. In
2004, the CVRC JPA study further analyzed the feasibility of passenger rail from the Naval
Air Station Lemoore, through Lemoore and Hanford to the City of Visalia. Both studies
showed that passenger rail was not viable until future population could support it and
necessary upgrades could be made to the railroad’s signal system and a possibly a flyover
needed to be constructed in Goshen junction in Tulare County to eliminate stoppages at the
Union Pacific’s north-south rail line.
When the CVRC JPA upgraded the railroad, their contract with the San Joaquin Valley
Railroad stated that the railroad might consider passenger rail services in the future.
Additionally, if the freight service went out of business, the CVRC JPA would have the first
right to purchase the track structure to retain future passenger rail viability. Passenger rail
service may not seem like a reasonable option, but if it is not reasonably planned for it will
never be a transportation option. For long range planning purposes, the reservation and
possibly early acquisition of land developed with an interim carpool parking area, assuming
funding is available, can help keep this option open, as well as helping preserve the track
structure, and increasing the residential population around future stations to create dense
ridership starts. If high speed rail becomes a reality in California, connecting passenger rail
on the San Joaquin rail line to Hanford or Visalia becomes more viable.

C-G-5     Support the San Joaquin Valley Railroad operations.
C-G-6     Support the activities of the Joint Powers Authority of the Cross Valley Rail
          Corridor, which include freight and passenger rail goals.
C-G-7     IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
C-I-1     Designate specific truck routes to provide for movement of goods throughout the
          City, ensure that adequate pavement depth, lane widths, and turn radii are
          maintained on the designated truck routes, and prohibit commercial trucks on non-
          truck routes except for direct deliveries.
C-I-2     Require the truck route street designs on Idaho and Iona Avenues and others to
          match the estimated truck weight and include unloading and turning movement for
          safe and efficient goods delivery.
C-I-3     Ensure that truck and tractor vehicle overnight parking is designated at key
          freeway-oriented locations to avoid truck parking in residential neighborhoods.
           These truck parking locations will be shielded from view with landscaping and
           trees, when possible.
C-I-4     Re-route truck routes to avoid residential neighborhoods and schools, where
          feasible:
           •   Obtain adequate right of way on East D Street, widen where necessary due east
               of Lemoore Avenue, and re-route the existing truck route along East Bush
               Street to East D Street to increase safety by the High School; and
           •   Reevaluate designated truck routes when the new 19th Avenue or 21st
               Avenue/Marsh Drive interchanges are constructed on SR-198.
C-I-5     Work with Amtrak California and the San Joaquin Valley Railroad in the planning
          for freight service, train schedules, proposed stations, railroad crossings, and other
          issues of interest to the City in line with the General Plan discussion.
           The City will support the activities of the Cross Valley Rail Corridor Joint Powers
           Authority, which include freight and passenger rail goals outlined in the 2004
           Passenger Rail Feasibility Study.
4.4     PUBLIC TR ANSIT
Kings Area Rural Transit (KART) provides fixed-route and demand-response (Dial-a-Ride)
service in the Planning Area. Amtrak and Orange Belt provide bus service connections to
                                                 4-35

2030 Lemoore General Plan
areas outside of the KART service area. These services connect to Goshen in Tulare County
for transfers to Greyhound or to Paso Robles to connect to points beyond. The Navy base
provides bus service around the military base to areas that KART does not serve.
KART Fixed Route Services
The KART fixed route system covers all of
the urbanized areas, as well as the rural
communities of Kings County and Visalia.
KART transit route #7 provides service
within Lemoore and between the City of
Lemoore and the NAS Lemoore and the
City of Hanford Amtrak station. One-hour
service is provided between Lemoore and
Hanford from 6:30 AM until 10:30 PM
Monday to Friday. Saturday service is
provided 8 AM to 5 PM. One-hour service is
also provided between Lemoore and the KART transit busses provide service to
NAS Lemoore Monday through Friday from Lemoore residents
5:00 AM until 7:00 PM. However, the
service to the base may be reduced due to the lack of funding. The service also operates
Saturdays from 9:00 AM until 5:00 PM. The extended half-hourly schedule makes this route
convenient for commuters traveling between communities, giving it the second highest
ridership figures in the KART system.
KART Dial-a-Ride Services
Dial-a-Ride services are offered by KART each weekday within the communities of Hanford,
Lemoore, Armona and Avenal to meet the needs of the disabled community who might not
be able to access the fixed route services. Dial-a-ride service is used for rides to the Lemoore
Senior Center, medical appointments, and shopping. Riders can connect with the Lemoore
fixed route service for transportation beyond Lemoore city limits. Service is available for
persons who are eligible for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) status and for persons
who are more than a half-mile from the fixed route and within the services area.
C-G-1     GUIDING POLICIES
C-G-2     Promote improved transit service and the development and use of park-and-ride
          facilities for commuters.
C-G-3     IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
C-I-1     Coordinate with Caltrans and Kings Area Rural Transit to identify and implement
          Park & Ride sites with convenient access to public transit.
           Park & Ride areas should include secure parking for cars, motorcycles, and
           bicycles, and have minimal impact on neighborhoods.
                                              4-36

C-I-2 Work with Kings Area Rural Transit to situate transit stops and hubs at locations
      that are convenient for transit users, and promote increased transit ridership through
      the provision of benches, bike racks on buses, and other amenities.
       This will include identifying existing underserved neighborhoods and new areas
       under development that will need transit service. The Kings County Association of
       Governments conducts annual transit needs public hearings where the City and the
       public may express their transit
       needs.
C-I-3 Work with Kings Area Rural
      Transit to provide accessible, well-
      lighted and attractive bus shelters
      that     are     compatible      with
      surrounding neighborhoods.
       Bus shelters should be located
       within landscape easement areas
       adjacent to the pedestrian               Bus shelters should shield patrons from the
       sidewalks      and      incorporate      elements, as well as blend well with surrounding
                                                urban design.
       features that are handicapped-
       friendly. They should be designed to discourage overnight sleepers and withstand
       vandalism. The City will work with KART on the issue of sharing responsibility on
       the upkeep of these shelters and incorporate them as part of its Capital
       Improvements Plan, if necessary.
C-I-4 Provide incentives for City employees to commute by public transit, car-pool, or
      use alternative fuel technology vehicles.
C-I-5 Offer alternative work hours and telecommuting when appropriate to City
      employees to reduce VMT and trips to work.
C-I-6 Purchase hybrid gasoline-electric, bio-diesel fuel or electric vehicles for the City
      fleet.
C-I-7 Ensure that new development is designed to make public transit a viable choice for
      residents. Options include:
       •   Locate medium-high density development whenever feasible near streets served
           by public transit; and
       •   Link neighborhoods to bus stops by continuous sidewalks or pedestrian paths.

C-G-1     BIKEWAYS
Kings County’s Regional Bicycle Plan,
adopted in 2005, illustrates both existing and
planned bikeways for the City of Lemoore as
well as other jurisdictions within the County.
Currently Lemoore’s bikeways extend
throughout central Lemoore to the Municipal
Golf Course and Little League field in the
south and out 18th Avenue to the north.
Planned bikeways will expand the network
further out from central Lemoore to include
the West Hills Community College in the
west. In all, the Plan identifies 56 miles of          Bike lanes and bike paths will continue to be a
existing and future bike lanes. Figure 4-5             familiar sight in Lemoore at full buildout.
depicts both existing and future bicycle paths
and trailways within the Planning Area.
There are three types of bikeway classifications, as shown in Table 4.5. A “Class I” bikeway,
also referred to as a bike path or multi-use trail, is a right-of-way that is completely separated
from any street. A “Class II” bikeway, or bike lane, is a one-way, striped, and signed lane on
a street or highway. A “Class III” bike route shares the road with motor vehicle traffic and is
marked only by signs.

C-G-2       PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION
Pedestrian flow patterns show similarities to vehicular traffic stream characteristics. Speed,
flow rate, and density are interrelated. Capacity and density for pedestrians are dependent on
width of the walking facility and the type of walking facility (e.g., walkways, crosswalks, and
street corners). For crosswalks, pedestrian capacity and waiting time is affected by turning
vehicles, signal timing, pedestrian/vehicle right-of-way laws, and pedestrian platoons
meeting in the middle of the street. Street corners at signalized intersections are holding areas
as well, and can be a critical location in the sidewalk network.

Policies in the proposed General Plan are designed to make Lemoore a more “pedestrian friendly” city in the
future.
   that accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists. Improvements in areas within the City that
   currently have undersized or no pedestrian facilities should be made a priority so that the
   pedestrian system will be better connected. The new neighborhood centers should also be
   designed to be "pedestrian friendly." In these areas, wider sidewalks should be considered to
   accommodate increased flows and to give preferential treatment to pedestrians. Pedestrian-
   friendly facilities should also be provided near transit stops and adjacent to medium and
   higher density residential areas.
   C-G-3      GUIDING POLICY
   C-G-4      Promote bicycling and walking as alternatives to the automobile.
   C-G-5      IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
   C-I-1      Implement the Lemoore Bikeway Plan in coordination with the County’s Regional
              Bicycle Plan, which is updated every four years.
   C-I-2      Establish bicycle lanes, bike routes, and bike paths consistent with the General Plan.
               This would include establishing a new, more specific, Lemoore Bike Map.
   C-I-3      Increase bicycle safety by:
               •   Sweeping and repairing bicycle lanes and paths on a regular basis;
                                                   4-42

                                                                          Chapter 4: Circulation
       •   Ensuring that bikeways are delineated and signed in accordance with Caltrans'
           standards, and lighting is provided, where needed;
       •   Providing bicycle paths or lanes on bridges and overpasses;
       •   Ensuring that all new and improved streets have bicycle-safe drainage grates
           and are kept free of hazards such as uneven pavement, gravel, and other debris;
       •   Providing adequate signage and markings warning vehicular traffic of the
           existence of merging or crossing bicycle traffic where bike routes and paths
           make transitions into or across roadways;
       •   Working with the Lemoore Union School districts to promote classes on
           bicycle safety in the schools; and
       •   Installing large sidewalks along arterial and median parkway streets so that
           children may ride safely away from traffic (e.g., Lemoore Avenue and Hanford-
           Armona Road).
C-I-4 Amend the Zoning Ordinance to require bicycle parking facilities at large
      commercial and industrial employer sites, including racks and lockers that are
      integrated into the overall site and building design.
C-I-5 Develop a series of continuous walkways within new office parks, commercial
      districts, and residential neighborhoods so they connect to one another.
C-I-6 Provide for pedestrian-friendly zones in conjunction with the development,
      redevelopment, and design of mixed-use neighborhood core areas, the Downtown
      area, schools, parks, and other high use areas by:
       •   Providing intersection "bulb outs" to reduce walking distances across streets in
           the Downtown and other high use areas;
       •   Providing pedestrian facilities at all signalized intersections;
       •   Providing landscaping and shade that encourages pedestrian use;
       •   Constructing adequately lit and safe access through subdivision sites; and
       •   Providing mid-block electronic warning lights and signals, where warranted, to
           inform motorist of the presence of pedestrians at the crosswalk.
C-I-7 Establish specific standards for pedestrian facilities to be accessible to physically
      disabled persons, and ensure that roadway improvement projects address mobility
      or accessibility for bicyclists or pedestrians.
       The City will incorporate federal and State requirements of the Americans with
       Disabilities Act (ADA) into standards for circulation access and pedestrian
       facilities (such as provisions for ramp improvements, curb cuts, audible traffic
       signals, etc.)
C-I-8 Amend the Zoning Ordinance to include standards in all new development for
      pedestrian circulation including: patterned concrete sidewalks across vehicular

         with parking areas, and street lighting.
4.6     PARKING
Parking regulations are intended to accommodate vehicles used by occupants, visitors,
customers, clientele, and employees of a variety of buildings. The regulations can help to
provide accessible, attractive, secured parking facilities; they can help to reduce traffic
congestions. Cutting-edge parking is shared parking, or parking that is no longer paved, but
on pervious surface with grass filtering systems to increase groundwater levels, or includes
solar panels on parking structures.
C-G-1    GUIDING POLICY
C-G-2     Foster practical parking solutions.
C-G-3    IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
C-I-1    Ensure that all residential development provides adequate on-site parking for
         residents and guests.
          As part of the Zoning Ordinance update, the City will evaluate what best practices
          exist for parking standards and establish procedures and criteria for requiring that
          developers provide parking surveys where spillover parking demand could cause
          neighborhood impacts.
C-I-2    Amend the Zoning Ordinance to require large employers to implement a Traffic
         Demand Management program that combines parking restrictions with transit or
         bicycle subsidies, such as promoting carpooling, free bus passes, priority bicycle
         parking and car share programs.
          These requirements would apply to businesses employing more than 100 people for
          any single shift. They also will help the City meet greenhouse gas reduction targets.
C-I-3    Amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow shared parking for mixed-uses where peak
         parking demands do not overlap.
          Different standards may be established for downtown and mixed-use areas. Shared
          parking should include residential in its typical nighttime use.
C-I-4    Amend the City’s Parking Design Standards to promote multiple benefits, including
         shared parking for mixed-use projects, solar panels on parking structures to generate
         energy for parking lot lighting, and pervious pavement for parking lots to improve
         groundwater recharge.

5 Parks, Schools, and
        Community Facilities
The presence of a well-designed system of parks, schools, and community facilities is essential
to achieving the ideal image envisioned by the City and its residents. The purpose of this
element is to document existing facilities, identify areas for improvement, and ensure they are
adequate to meet the recreational, educational, and community needs of existing and future
residents.
5.1     PARKS AND RECREATION FACILITIES
A main goal of the 2030 General Plan update is to create and maintain a park system that
meets citizens’ recreational needs and contributes to the City’s positive image. This Element
will serve as a guiding document for any implementation documents prepared by the Parks
and Recreation Department in the process of developing parks in Lemoore.
EXISTING PARKS AND RECREATION FACILITIES
Currently, the Parks and Recreation Department of the City of Lemoore maintains
approximately 88 acres of the parkland summarized in Table 5.1, which excludes the City-
owned municipal golf course. The City’s ponding basins, including the one adjacent to West
Hills College, provide an additional 38 acres of open space (in the table they are counted at
less than half value because they are available for recreational use only on a seasonal basis).
The City’s current park standard for public parkland is 5 acres of parkland per thousand
residents. With a population of 23,390 residents in 2006, the City currently provides 5 acres of
parkland per thousand residents. In the near future, the City plans to develop a joint Little
League Park and Youth Football facility, involving the relocation of the Little League Field.

CLASSIFICATION
The City of Lemoore uses a hierarchy to classify the types of parks and park standards that are
desirable for various locations in the city. This hierarchy is an adaptation to local conditions
of the National Recreation and Park Association Open Space Standards.
•    Pocket Park. A Pocket Park is typically under an acre in size and intended to serve the
     needs of a specific neighborhood within a ½ mile radius. Pocket parks are usually fully
     landscaped with trees and turf and are between one-quarter acre and two acres in size.
     Besides residential neighborhoods, they can also be found in downtown areas to serve the
     needs of shoppers or employees as places
     to rest or eat.
•    Neighborhood Park. In Lemoore, a
     Neighborhood Park is typically located
     close to an elementary school, surrounded
     by several neighborhoods. This type of
     park is primarily for children in the 5-14
     year age group and for families. The
     Neighborhood              Park should    be
     approximately 7.5 acres.
•    Community Park. A Community Park is
     intended to serve the needs of the entire Lyons Park is an existing neighborhood park that also
     city especially those living within about a serves as a ponding basin.
     2-mile radius of the park. Being larger in
     size, it provides outdoor and indoor
     facilities that accommodate a much wider range of recreational interests than a
     Neighborhood Park. Facilities usually include fields and courts for various adult sports,
                                               5-2

                                                     Chapter 5: Parks, Schools, and Community Facilities
      swimming pool, stadium, gymnasium, community center building for arts, crafts, clubs
      and social activities, spaces for free play by all age groups, family picnic area, and
      landscaped quiet area. An ideal size for a Community Park is 20 acres or more.
 In general, the park classifications listed above should consider only flat land as functional
 acreage. A range of facilities such as sport fields, tennis courts, basketball courts, soccer fields,
 picnic areas, children play areas, as well as grass areas for informal play, may be developed.
 Currently, there is a joint use agreement between the Lemoore Union Elementary and High
 School Districts and the City to share facilities after school hours. School fields and facilities,
 however, are not included as part of park land calculations. Table 5.2 summarizes the total
 acreage and ratio of parkland per thousand residents.

 FUTURE PARKLAND
 Future parkland in Lemoore will come primarily from two sources:
 •    Neighborhood and Community Parks provided as a result of dedication by developers in
      new development areas; and
 •    Other parkland provided through City acquisitions or contributions by public and private
      sources.
 The amount of parks and open spaces allocated under the General Plan, as shown in Table
 5.3, is larger than is required under current City Park Standards and the Quimby Act. This is
 in response to the wish of Lemoore residents to have greater access to recreation facilities and
 a higher quality of life.

The parkland goal will be achieved through parkland dedications in new subdivisions, at a
ratio of 5 acres per thousand residents, and additional parkland at 1 acre per thousand
residents, to be acquired by the City through private and public funding sources and through
impact fees. The system of parks and recreational facilities will be geographically distributed
throughout the City. With full buildout of the General Plan, 96 percent of Lemoore residents
will live within ¼ mile of a neighborhood park or ½ mile of a community park.
GUIDING POLICIES
PSCF-G-1          Create and maintain a high-quality public park system for Lemoore.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
PSCF-I-1          Establish a goal of 6 acres of parkland per thousand residents to be met by:
                  •    Dedication and reservation requirements consistent with the Quimby Act,
                       for landscaped open spaces, parks, trail systems, and/or special community
                       service facilities in new residential developments based on a standard of 5
                       acres of developed parkland per thousand residents; and
                  •    A standard of one acre per thousand residents to be met with an impact fee
                       for City-owned and operated parks and special recreation areas that serve all
                       residents.
                  In addition to new parkland dedicated by developers, the City will continue to
                  acquire or re-develop parklands as needed, subject to availability of funding. It is
                  the City’s intent to meet the parkland goal with functional public acreage only.
                  Restricted recreation facilities (such as golf courses, raceways, and on-site school
                  recreational facilities) are not included in this parkland total. The City also will
                  maintain flexibility in the location and design of parks. In-lieu fees will only be
                  acceptable where an exemption from providing a neighborhood park facility would
                  not adversely affect local residents because an existing park is nearby.
PSCF-I-2          Require that at least 75 percent of new residents live within a half mile or less of
                  a public park facility, using the development permit review and approval
                  processes.
                  The only exemptions would be for residents in very low density development.
                                                               5-4

                                                Chapter 5: Parks, Schools, and Community Facilities
PSCF-I-3 Require non-residential developers contribute to the City’s parks and open
         space system based on proportional share of needs generated and use of
         facilities, in compliance with the State Mitigation Fee Act and other applicable
         laws.
         A “nexus” study will be undertaken to establish impact fees based on surveys of
         park use during the workday by employees of nearby development. Exemptions for
         small infill projects may be granted.
PSCF-I-4 Develop new parks with high quality facilities, universal accessibility, durability
         and low maintenance in mind. Existing parks will be improved, if feasible and
         economically justified, to reduce maintenance cost and water use, as well as
         improve park safety and aesthetics.
PSCF-I-5 Incorporate the following elements into the creation of new community,
         neighborhood, and pocket parks:
         •    A mix of passive and active recreational facilities that meet the needs of
              citizens of all ages and interests;
         •    Clear pedestrian and bike connectivity between parks and local schools,
              shops, and other neighborhood resources;
         •    Visual permeability, so the interior of the park is visible from the street;
         •    Parking, when necessary and appropriate, including use of on-street space
              in and around community and neighborhood parks;
         •    Bicycle parking, storage, and other support facilities; and
         •    Native, drought-tolerant landscaping and water-conserving irrigation
              systems including “smart” irrigation that utilizes moisture and weather
              sensor technology.
PSCF-I-6 Use existing natural and man-made features of the community, such as creeks,
         canals and railroad corridors when possible to enhance the parks and open
         space network.
PSCF-I-7 Develop a system of consistent, recognizable and pedestrian-scale signage for
         the parks and trail system throughout the City, including bikeways, pathways
         and sidewalks that link key community resources (e.g. schools, public facilities,
         and transit) to the parks and open space network.
PSCF-I-8 Provide lighted facilities for certain specialized community recreation areas (e.g.
         tennis courts, basketball courts, pathways) in order to extend usable hours.
         When possible, design electric lighting to be light-sensitive (dims during the
         day), solar powered, and to allow as little light pollution as possible.
PSCF-I-9 Incorporate shallow ponding basins in community parks and large
         neighborhood parks, where feasible, to promote the efficient use of land.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
             A credit toward parkland requirements will allow up to 50 percent of ponding basin
             land provided by a subdivider to count toward dedication requirements if it will be
             available for recreation purposes during the spring and summer. Basins that have
             less recreational availability will only get partial credit toward this goal.
PSCF-I-10    Improve the 19th Avenue Park and other existing parks that are not fully
             developed with features such as landscaping, trails, children’s play areas, and a
             hedge or wall where the park adjoins the freeway.
             Future improvements made should be based on the ponding requirements and
             future footprint of the new interchange anticipated to start construction in 2013.
PSCF-I-11    Create landscaped open spaces at the main entrances to Lemoore, to include
             trees, bushes, and other native vegetation.
             This will include the intersection of SR-198 with Houston Avenue, SR-41 off ramp
             at Bush Street, the intersection of SR-41 and Hanford Armona Road, the entrance
                                                                                                        st
             at SR-41 south of Idaho Avenue, and the entrance at SR-198 near Marsh Drive/21
             Avenue.
PSCF-I-12    Acquire the land and funding to redevelop the Little League Park, relocating it
             from its current location on Iona Avenue to the possible park location at Cedar
             Lane and 19th ½ Avenue or another suitable location.
             The new Little League Park will also serve as a neighborhood park and shall have
             additional facilities other than baseball. The existing site will not be considered for
             other land uses until the relocation is complete.
PSCF-I-13    Adopt and implement a 10-year Parks and Recreation Master Plan to be
             reviewed biennially and updated quadrennially.
             The Parks and Recreation Department of Lemoore will be responsible for
             implementing the Master Plan, and ensuring that the development of parks and
             recreational facilities proceeds as planned.

Community Design contain additional policies
related to entrances to the community.
Chapter 4: Circulation contains additional
specific policies relating to bikeway
requirements and their relationship to public
parks.

5.2        SCHOOLS
The Lemoore Union Elementary School District and the Lemoore Union High School District
oversee public schools in the Planning Area. The Elementary School District is comprised of
four elementary schools (from grades K-6), one middle school, and one charter elementary
/middle school (K-8). The Lemoore Union High School District has a larger coverage area
that includes the unincorporated community of Stratford and Naval Air Station Lemoore
(NAS Lemoore) and currently comprises the main campus of Lemoore High School, an
adjoining campus of the Gertrude F. Gundacker Alternative Education Facilities, and
Lemoore Middle College High School which is located at the West Hills College Campus.
Together, both elementary and high school districts provide education to approximately
5,600 students. Although both elementary and middle school facilities are running under
capacity, the Lemoore Union High School is running 17 percent over capacity. Table 5.4
summarizes recent enrollment and capacity counts for these schools. The locations of school
facilities are illustrated in Figure 5-1.

In addition to public schools, a number of private and alternative schools provide educational
opportunities to Lemoore residents. Mary Immaculate Queen School and Kings Christian
School provide private elementary and middle school education while Kings Christian also
provides high school level education within the Planning Area. Several elementary schools
administered by the Central Union School District, a Yokuts (American Indian) High School,
and a Community Day School at Lemoore Naval Air Station are also located within a ten
minute drive of the Planning Area.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
To meet projected enrollment within Lemoore, the Lemoore Elementary School District is
                                                                                 th
planning to build a new school located on the corner of 19 Avenue and Cinnamon Drive
within the next five years. Meanwhile, the High School District is also planning to acquire a
new site and build a new high school. This project is considered high priority because
enrollment at the Lemoore Union High School has already exceeded optimum capacity. A site
acquisition study has already identified several potential sites shown on Figure 5-1.
West Hills College Lemoore is located at the west side of the Planning Area and provides
college level education to residents from around the region. The college presently
accommodates 3,770 students onsite and online. When the campus is fully completed, the
college expects to enroll approximately 11,100 part-time students or 6,000 full-time
equivalents.

Projected Enrollment
Buildout of the General Plan will result in the addition of 8,020 households (single family and
multi-family), with an additional population of approximately 24,860. Student generation
factors by household type shown in Table 5.5 are used to calculate future enrollment. School
size assumptions for households in the planning area are as follows:
•    K- 6: 750 students per school
•    6- 8: 800 students per school
•    9- 12: 1800 students per school

Planned Facilities
According to a California Department of Education report, an estimated 4 percent of all
school-age children in Kings County attended religious, private, or chartered schools in 2005-
2006. Future school demand estimates have taken this into consideration. Assuming the ratio
of public to private schools remains constant, 4 new elementary schools, 1 middle school, and
1 high school will be required at full buildout in year 2030. However, the Lemoore
Elementary School District has a desire to keep 7-8 graders on the new elementary school
sites. Therefore, larger K-8 campuses are delineated on the General Plan Diagram to
accommodate both elementary and middle school students. Figure 5-1 illustrates planned
school sites in the Planning Area.
According to typical school size guidelines provided by the California Department of
Education, a minimum of 125 acres should be reserved for new schools. This estimate serves
only as a guide. The actual amount of land needed will depend on each school’s facility
requirements, expected enrollment and land costs.

GUIDING POLICY
PSCF-G-2           Provide superior educational opportunities for all members of the community.
IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
PSCF-I-14        Develop partnerships with the Lemoore Union Elementary School District,
                 Lemoore Union High School District, private schools, community
                 organizations, and West Hills College to facilitate planning for new school sites
                 and facilities and infrastructure improvements which are compatible with City
                 plans.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
PSCF-I-15      Develop partnerships with Lemoore Union Elementary School District and
               Lemoore Union High School District to optimize the joint use of school
               facilities for community benefit.
               School playgrounds and grass fields offer excellent opportunities for use by the City
               during off-school hours to accommodate City-sponsored athletic clubs and the
               needs of after-school programs. Other school facilities that could be used by the City
               include auditoriums or cafeterias to host community meetings. Currently, both the
               elementary and high school districts have joint-use agreements with the City.
PSCF-I-16      Support establishment of vocational and other training programs to prepare
               Lemoore’s residents for employment, in addition to traditional educational
               opportunities.
5.3      COMMUNITY FACILITIES
Community facilities are the network of public and private institutions that support the civic
and social needs of the population. They offer a variety of recreational, artistic, and
educational programs and special events. New community facilities are not specifically sited
on the General Plan Land Use Diagram. Small-scale facilities are appropriately sited as
integral parts of neighborhoods and communities, while existing larger-scale facilities are
generally depicted as public/semi-public land use, as appropriate. These facilities in Lemoore
can be grouped into the following categories:
•   Community Centers. Facilities designed to meet the needs of the population for civic
    meetings, recreational activities, social gatherings, and cultural enrichment;
•   Cultural Facilities. These facilities house scientific and historical exhibits or offer space for
    artistic performances and presentations. The Sarah A. Mooney Museum is an example of
    these facilities;
•   Civic Buildings. Includes City and County administrative and public buildings;
•   Libraries. Facilities in which literary, artistic, and reference materials are kept for public
    use and circulation. The Lemoore Branch of Kings County Library, located at 457 C Street
    near downtown, will require larger facilities to meet the area’s needs through General
    Plan buildout;
•   Medical Facilities. This includes public and private clinics, care facilities, and medical
    offices (only NAS Lemoore and Hanford have hospitals);
•   Religious Facilities. Includes houses of worship and other related uses. There are more
    than 40 churches, temples and other houses of worship in Lemoore from different
    religions.

GUIDING POLICY
PSCF-G-3        Provide public and cultural facilities that contribute to Lemoore’s positive image,
                enhance community identity, and meet the civic and social needs of residents.
IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
Community Centers
PSCF-I-17     Locate new Community Centers in mixed-use Neighborhood Centers,
              Downtown, or in parks, and offer incentives for developers who set aside land
              for the development of Community Centers.
              The incentives could include density bonuses (units, or increases in maximum non-
              residential floor area) or transfers of development rights from land dedicated for
              this purpose.
Cultural Facilities
PSCF-I-18     Support the development of a range of cultural and arts facilities, such as
              museums, performing art centers and art exhibition spaces throughout the City.
              The City will promote artistic and
              cultural activities by: 1) offering
              incentives to developers who set
              aside land for the development of
              cultural facilities, 2) allowing the
              use of City venues for art
              exhibitions        and       cultural
              performances        by     non-profit
              groups, 3) identifying grants and

6 Public Utilities
The Public Utilities Element addresses the planning, provision, and maintenance of water,
wastewater, solid waste systems, and other facilities operated by the City. Additionally, it
addresses water reuse, conservation and waste recycling measures as required under State
Law.
The City of Lemoore Public Works Department (PWD) is responsible for providing water,
wastewater, stormwater, and refuse services to residents. The Kings Waste and Recycling
Authority (KWRA) is responsible for solid waste and hazardous waste disposal and carries out
its duties with assistance from the City’s PWD collection.
6.1       WATER SUPPLY
Lemoore is located in the Tulare Lake Hydrologic Region and extracts ground water from the
Tulare Lake Sub-basin to meet all of the City’s water supply. The shallowest groundwater
aquifers range from three to seven feet below the land surface. Water is taken from
underground aquifers via ten active groundwater wells, six of which are located within the
Planning Area (Figure 6-1). The other four are located in an 80 acre well field five miles north
of the City. Currently, these wells have a combined capacity of approximately 19.2 million
gallons per day (mgd) and a firm capacity of 15.9 mgd 1 .
Water is conveyed from the wells to four above-ground storage reservoirs/tanks with a total
capacity of 4.4 million gallons and delivered to consumers via a distribution pipe system. The
City’s main water storage and distribution plant is located on G Street west of Lemoore
Avenue. In addition to the main domestic water supply system, the City operates a separate
water system to supply industrial water to the SK Foods tomato processing plant. The two

water systems are separated, but can be connected in an emergency, such as a major fire or
natural disaster.
Water quality has been a continuing concern due to the existence of water discoloration and
hydrogen sulfide produced in various in-town wells. Wells located in the north well field have
higher arsenic concentrations than wells in town. The PWD is able to address these concerns
through blending water from different wells and by treating with hypochlorite systems.
Water Source and Water Production
The amount of groundwater pumped from city wells has been increased steadily over the
years to meet population growth demands. As shown in Table 6.1, the City produced
approximately 1,917 million gallons or 5,885 acre-feet of water in 2002. Four years later,
water production was increased to 2,301 million gallons or 7,064 acre-feet. Anticipating
future demand is part of the City’s water management program.
According to the Department of Water Resources, the Tulare Lake Subbasin total storage
capacity is estimated to be 17,100,000 acre feet to a depth of 300 feet, and 82,500,000 acre feet
to the base of fresh groundwater. The Department’s Water Plan Update Bulletin 118 states
that the overall water level in the subbasin declined nearly 17 feet from 1970 through 2000,
with frequent periods of steep declines and rises. 2 Fluctuations are more pronounced nearer
the Tulare Lake area, down-gradient from Lemoore.

The two major industrial operations in the City, SK Foods and Leprino Foods, are estimated
to be responsible for between 15 and 20 percent of the total water demand. Over time,
however, it is expected that the percentage share of the total water supply consumed by SK
Foods and Leprino Foods will fall as the percentage share consumed by the rest of the
community increases with growth in population.

Canal Companies
Although not a district or public agency, the Lemoore Canal and Irrigation Company and the
John Heinlen Water Company own, maintain, and operate surface water canals near and
within the City of Lemoore, The activities of these companies indirectly affect groundwater
levels and usage in the Lemoore area. The City maintains a minor share of the Lemoore Canal
and Irrigation Company which allows it to discharge stormwater into its canals for transport
to NRCS wetlands and other agriculture areas. Additionally, this ownership gives the City
water rights for irrigation of the municipal golf course.
Kings County Water District
The Kings County Water District (KCWD) manages surface water supply east of the City and
groundwater directly upgradient of the Planning Area. It is a legal entity formed to provide
water management in the northeast portion of Kings County. Since 1954, the KCWD has
monitored groundwater levels, implemented programs to recharge basins, conserve water,
increase water supply, and prevent water waste in the County.
Laguna Irrigation District
The Laguna Irrigation District (LID) is located up-gradient of the Planning Area. The City has
an agreement with LID to preserve ground water. Among the major elements of the
agreement are:
•    An agreement to limit the City’s pumping from the well field to an average of 3,380 acre-
     feet per year (the 1994 base year amount). Pumping may increase in any one year to 3,700
     acre-feet;
•    Constraints on increasing pipeline capacity between the City and the well field by building
     a second transmission line;
•    A prohibition of additional wells in or near the well field; and
•    Setup of a jointly held fund, to be used to purchase recharge water.
The Lemoore Canal Company conducts yearly            A water storage tank near West Hills College.

PROJECTED WATER DEMAND
According to the 2005 Urban Water Management Plan, the City’s 2005 maximum day
demand is approximately 12.8 mgd. This is well within the current supply capacity of 19.2
mgd. Assuming that the current demands of SK Foods and Leprino Foods remain constant,
the well supply is sufficient to meet city needs. As the City grows in accord with General Plan
projections, however, demand will exceed the supply available from existing wells. Since
Lemoore is not located within an adjudicated water basin, there is no restriction on the
number of wells Lemoore may drill inside the City. The challenges facing City water
management today are not so much related to water quantity as water quality maintenance.

WATER QUALITY
The EPA and the State Department of Health Services have recently tightened the
requirement for arsenic content in drinking water from 50 micrograms per liter (µg/L) to 10
µg/L. The City has until February, 2009 to meet the new limit.
The City is modifying its water supply and distribution system to meet the new water quality
standard. Water drawn from north wellfield wells has historically exceeded this lower limit.
The City is obligated by a stipulated agreement with an irrigation district to keep the total
production from the north wellfield to an average of 3,380 acre feet per year.
As the City grew, it became necessary to supplement water supply from the north wellfield
with water drawn from wells within the city. Water from city wells has an arsenic content less
than 10 µg/L but is of somewhat lower quality in color and taste. To accommodate continued
growth while meeting arsenic standards, the City has undertaken several steps after
determining that treatment of the north wellfield supply was not economically feasible:
•     Drilling a “substitute” well in the north wellfield designed to draw from lower-arsenic
      strata, albeit with lower production capacity;
•     Planning for modification of an existing north wellfield well to reduce arsenic
      concentrations in its produced water;
•     Planning for the construction of additional deep wells in the southwest area of the City,
      an area in which low-arsenic water production has resulted in new wells; and
                                                            6-6

                                                                                Chapter 6: Public Utilities
 •    Authorizing funding and design for a cross-town transmission main to enable the entire
      community to be served by southwest area wells.
 Implementation of the above mentioned steps will assure that the long-term supply of
 groundwater will meet EPA and State water quality standards. The City continues to evaluate
 surface water as an alternative or to supplement ground water in cooperation with other local
 water agencies and the NAS Lemoore.
 WATER CONSERVATION
                                                       The City of Lemoore has a Water
                                                       Conservation Ordinance implemented by the
                                                       Public Works Department to conserve water
                                                       use in residential areas. The ordinance limits
                                                       the watering of lawns to specific days of the
                                                       week, depending on street address, and
                                                       requires water meters on all new services,
                                                       residential, commercial, and industrial. In
                                                       addition, the City regularly participates in
                                                       educating the public on water conservation,
                                                       such as providing tips on the efficient use of

 Committee.] Recently, the PWD has hired a part-time water enforcement officer that notifies
 persons regarding excessive water usage (e.g., water in the streets).
 WATER RECYCLING AND REUSE
 The overall health of the local groundwater subbasin, from which the City pumps its water,
 has shown some consistent trends since the late 1950’s. Data from City wells show that there
 has been a consistent decline of 0.5 feet per year in groundwater levels in the semi-confined
 aquifer (below the “A” Clay) and no decline in levels in the confined aquifer below the (“E”
 Clay). The City utilizes water comprising approximately 0.14 percent of total basin storage
 capacity each year, and this percentage is anticipated to increase to 0.19 percent by the year
 2010 if current trends continue. There was no change in the historic levels of the deep aquifers
 of the subbasin attributable to the construction and operation of the City’s wells; the City’s
 continued use of their wells is not projected to cause a decline in water levels in the portion of
 the groundwater basin below the “E” Clay.
 Groundwater recharge of the deep, confined, aquifers tapped by City wells is primarily from
 up-basin stream recharge, from deep percolation of applied irrigation waters and from up-
 basin snow runoff and rainfall.
 Effluent from the combined domestic and SK Foods waste discharges to the City’s wastewater
 plant is conveyed via a 6-mile pipeline to the Westlake Canal. The recycled water is then used
 to supplement irrigation of about 50,000 acres of animal feed grains and cotton on Westlake
 Farms. Discharge to Westlake Canal in 2004 was approximately 25 percent of the water
 utilized by domestic consumers and SK Foods.
                                                      6-7

2030 Lemoore General Plan
SK Foods, a tomato products processing facility, discharges approximately 75 percent of its
total annual water usage directly to agricultural land previously supplied by groundwater and
surface water entitlements for crop irrigation. The balance of the industry’s effluent is
discharged to the City’s wastewater treatment and recycling facility. Thus essentially 100
percent of the industry’s water usage is recycled.
Leprino treats its process wastes before discharging them to the downstream end of the City’s
wastewater treatment facilities. That treated waste, approximately 2 million gallons per day, is
transported through the City’s 30-inch outfall line to the Westlake Farms’ irrigated
agriculture. In excess of 50 percent of the industry’s water usage is recycled, the balance being
evaporated in the cheese production process.
It is anticipated that the effluent recycled by SK Foods and Leprino Foods will remain
constant or increase slightly during the planning horizon. The City’s recycled domestic
effluent will increase proportionate to anticipated population growth, essentially doubling
during the planning period (through 2025).
The effectiveness of the existing and projected agricultural irrigation recycling program
precludes the necessity of evaluating other recycling programs such as dual distribution
systems. The two major industries, as cost-saving measures, fully recycle and multi-use water
within their plants prior to discharge and will continue to do so.
GUIDING POLICIES
PU-G-1      Maintain and enhance water resources to ensure that Lemoore has an adequate,
            affordable, water supply to sustain the City’s quality of life and support existing and
            future development—without jeopardizing water supply for future generations.
PU-G-2      Conserve water through supply-side efficiencies and water conservation programs.
IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
Water Supply Management
PU-I-1      Update the City’s Urban Water Management Plan every five years and ensure its
            contents are consistent with the California Water Code and General Plan policies,
            including prioritization and identification of funding sources.
PU-I-2      Provide and maintain a system of water supply distribution facilities capable of
            meeting existing and future daily and peak demands, including fire flow
            requirements, in a timely and cost effective manner.
PU-I-3      Monitor the demands on the water system and, as necessary, manage
            development to mitigate impacts and/or facilitate improvements to the water
            supply and distribution systems.
PU-I-4      Continue to support the Laguna Irrigation District’s ground water recharging
            (water banking) efforts, in consultation with the State Department of Water
            Resources and county water management authorities.

          Water banking is a technique where water that is not immediately needed is stored –
          typically in underground aquifers – for future use. The Laguna Water District currently
          stores excess water from the Kings River.
Land Use/New Development
PU-I-5    Require that necessary water supply infrastructure and storage facilities are in
          place concurrently with new development, and approve development plans only
          when a dependable and adequate water supply for the development is assured.
PU-I-6    Require water meters in all new development.
PU-I-7    Require all major new development projects with more than 200,000 square feet
          of floor area overall to have a water management plan, in accordance with State
          law:
          •    Large projects will be required to submit planting plans, irrigation plans,
               schedules, and water use estimates for City approval prior to issuance of
               building permits;
          •    Industrial projects will be required to submit water recycling plans and
               irrigation plans for proposed landscaping.
          Pursuant to policies under Water Conservation in Chapter 7: Conservation and Open
          Space, the City will establish water conservation standards and guidelines so that
          conservation efforts are addressed early in the design process. This requirement will apply
          to development where the total floor area would exceed 200,000 square feet.
PU-I-8    Require water bubblers for street trees, separate from surface irrigation used for
          turf.
PU-I-9    Promote the use of evapotranspiration (ET) water systems in irrigating large parks
          and large landscaped areas.
          ET water systems are “smart water systems” that can be programmed with data such as
          the type of soil, slope of landscape, type of vegetation, and daily weather conditions, so
          that they can automatically adjust irrigation schedules based on those conditions. The
          result is lower water bills and a healthier environment.
PU-I-10   Require that developers of agricultural land to be annexed to the City offer the
          water rights associated with this land to the City.
New Water Sources
PU-I-11   Revise regulations to allow the safe use of reclaimed water (“gray water”) by
          homes and businesses where feasible. Examples of areas where “gray water” might
          be safely used include:
          •    Irrigation of parks and residential yards, and irrigation for farming;
          •    Cooling towers and HVAC systems in commercial or industrial buildings; and
          •    Water cisterns in flush toilets.
                                                 6-9

2030 Lemoore General Plan
            Generally, a gray water system consists of an underground surge tank, with a filtration
            system, a pump, and associated pipework. The type of gray water system appropriate for
            individual sites will be determined on the basis of location, soil type, ground water level,
            and building use. Title 24, part 5 of the California Administration Code has established
            standards, specifications, and procedure for estimating discharge to and from different
            gray water systems.
PU-I-12     Establish and implement a program of cooperative surface water use with local
            water purveyors and irrigation districts to retain surface water rights and supply
            following annexation and urban development so as to protect against aquifer
            overdrafts and water quality degradation.
PU-I-13     Promote the continued use of surface water for agriculture to reduce groundwater
            table reductions.
PU-I-14     Drill additional wells within the City when other water supply alternatives are not
            feasible and demand warrants their development.
            This policy is consistent with the 2005 Urban Water Management Plan.
See Chapter 7: Conservation and Open Space for policies related to water conservation and
groundwater quality.
6.2      WASTEWATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS
The City Public Works Department is responsible for planning and managing sanitary sewer
service in Lemoore. The waste water treatment plant (WWTP) consists of four lagoons with
floating surface aerators. The existing facility has a maximum capacity of 4.5 mgd. Domestic
waste is collected from all development within the city via a network of sanitary sewer
collection pipelines, treated at the WWTP, and discharged via a 6-mile pipeline to the
Westlake Canal. The treated effluent is then used to supplement irrigation of about 50,000
acres of animal feed grains and cotton on Westlake Farms.
Average influent flow was 4.0 mgd in 2006, with higher flows occurring during winter
rainstorms. Of this 4.0 mgd, Leprino Foods accounts for approximately 2.0 mgd. Leprino
Foods is currently upgrading their treatment facility. When this upgrade is completed, in
2008, influent flow to Lemoore’s WWTP will be reduced by nearly half.
Thus, average influent flow to serve development in accord with the General Plan is projected
to drop to 3.1 mgd in 2015, and then rise to 6.3 mgd in 2030 (see Table 6.3). The existing
headworks will need to be upgraded between year 2015 and 2030 and treatment facilities must
be expanded or replaced with discharge requirement-compliant facilities which can handle
increased influent volumes. New trunk lines and sewer subsystems must be planned in areas
of the city where growth is expected to occur. Such improvements will be funded through
wastewater impact fees as well as increased sewer rates.
The City faces the dual challenge of needing to treat increased wastewater flows to Regional
Water Quality Control Board standards and the possibility of not being able to continue
Westlake Canal discharge on a long-term basis. The City has received Economic Development
Administration funding to study possible land disposal options.

GUIDING POLICY
PU-G-3           Ensure that adequate wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal facilities are
                 provided in a timely fashion to serve existing and future needs of the City.
IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
PU-I-15          Maintain existing levels of wastewater service by expanding treatment plant and
                 disposal facilities as required by growth and by the Regional Water Quality
                 Control Board.
PU-I-16          Update the Wastewater Master Plan by 2010 and construct planned facilities to
                 serve development under this General Plan.
PU-I-17          Establish impact fees and sewer rates adequate to finance required wastewater
                 treatment and disposal facilities upgrades or replacements.
6.3        SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AND RECYCLING
Solid waste disposal for Lemoore is managed by Kings Waste and Recycling Authority
(KWRA). The City’s PWD Refuse Division is responsible for solid waste collection services.
The majority of the City’s solid waste is taken to Kettleman Hills Landfill Facility, a Class
II/III facility owned by Chemical Waste Management (CWMI). The facility is located south of
Lemoore, has a capacity of 4.2 million cubic yards, and is 55 percent full as of June 2005.
KWRA is currently studying the future needs of solid waste services including building a new
landfill to be operated by CWMI near the existing site. The County has a 25-year contract
with CWMI to handle its solid waste until 2023.
Lemoore has had a “green” waste service since 1999, for grass clippings, weeds, leaves, wood
(without nails, glue, or paint), plant material and saw dust; in 2006 the City added a “blue”
waste service for recyclables such as empty plastic containers, glass, aluminum, newspaper,
and cardboard. In addition, e-waste and used-oil are collected at the City Corporation Yard.

GUIDING POLICIES
PU-G-4         Manage solid waste such that City needs are met, opportunities for waste reduction
               and recycling are maximized, and the best possible service is provided to the citizens
               and businesses of Lemoore.
IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
PU-I-18        Adopt standards and screening criteria for refuse collection and recycling areas in
               commercial, industrial and multi-family residential buildings.
               These requirements will apply to new development and to major alterations and
               additions.
PU-I-19        Continue to require property owners to provide recycling containers in refuse
               collection areas that are within buildings or screened so as not to be visible from
               public streets and residential neighborhoods.
PU-I-20        Reduce waste production by using post-consumer recycled paper and other
               recycled materials in all City operations.
PU-I-21        Implement programs to reduce waste at home and in businesses through public
               education efforts that use many different forms of communication.
               Avenues of communication of waste reduction and conservation messages may include
               advertisements in local newspapers, radio advertisements, large flashy stickers on public
               refuse bins, articles on the City website or in the City newsletter, or posters in retail
               establishments that sell recyclable products.
PU-I-22        Amend local ordinances to further support KWRA requirements for proper
               handling and storage of solid waste and recyclables and diversion of solid waste
               from landfills.
               The Kings Waste Recycling Authority has lead responsibility for this program.
                                                          6-12
                                                                              Chapter 6: Public Utilities
PU-I-23      Explore ways to provide financial incentives for recycling by reducing the cost for
             recycling and increasing the cost for garbage disposal.
PU-I-24      Actively promote reuse by supporting existing and future swap meets, flea
             markets and consignment/second-hand shops and providing information on
             donation pick-up or drop off locations, as well as other waste reduction
             programs, on the City website.
             Although recycling is generally the focus of most local waste management programs,
             reusing discarded materials is actually the best method of waste reduction because it
             conserves more of the article’s inherent structure and value, as well as the energy that
             produced it. Examples of reusable goods include furniture, clothing, business supplies and
             equipment, sinks, lighting fixtures, and building materials. The City already holds a
             monthly community swap meet in the summertime to encourage these reuse practices.
PU-I-25      Help the College and local schools to recycle by including them in curbside
             recycling programs and by encouraging them to teach about recycling and waste
             reduction.
             Recycling can benefit student activity funds and help the school district cut disposal costs.
             A number of lesson plans have been developed throughout the country and are available
             for use by school districts. A comprehensive reference list of solid waste education
             materials for youth, as well as a video list, is available from the Cornell Waste
             Management Institute.
6.4      ELECTRICITY AND GAS
The City of Lemoore belongs to the San Joaquin Valley Power Authority, which was formed
in November 2006 to develop and conduct electricity-related programs for the region. The
San Joaquin Valley Power Authority is governed by a 12-member board of directors,
representing each of the 12 participating local public agencies. The executive board holds
positions for a chair, vice chair, secretary and treasurer/auditor. The board meets every fourth
Thursday at the office of the Kings River Conservation District.
San Joaquin Valley Power Authority Member Agency List: Kings County, and the cities of
Clovis, Corcoran, Dinuba, Kerman, Kingsburg, Lemoore, Hanford, Parlier, Reedley, Selma,
and Sanger. The San Joaquin Valley Power Authority is the governing body authorized by
Community Choice, created by the California legislature in 2002, to provide an opportunity
for local government (cities, counties or combinations of cities and counties) to purchase
electricity on behalf of their residents and businesses. Community Choice is only for the
purchase of electricity. The delivery, metering, billing, operation and maintenance of wires
and poles remains the responsibility of PG&E within Lemoore.
Under the Authority’s Community Choice program, the Board will set electrical generation
rates for customers within its service area and will purchase power from the Kings River
Conservation District. Conservative estimates on rates show a 5 percent savings on generation
costs. Residents and businesses within the jurisdictions of these participating municipalities
will have the opportunity to participate in this regional energy program. The Authority
prepared a Community Choice Implementation Plan and received certification by the
California Public Utilities Commission on April 30, 2007. It is anticipated that the Power
                                                  6-13

2030 Lemoore General Plan
Authority will begin purchasing electricity in February 2008 to serve City and County
jurisdiction loads. In May and August 2008 large and medium commercial properties will be
added and in November 2008, residential, small business and agriculture accounts are
anticipated to be added. City gas service is provided by the Gas Company.
Policies pertaining to the conservation of energy are included in Chapter 3: Community
Design and Chapter 7: Conservation and Open Space.
                                               6-14
7 Conservation and Open
         Space
The Conservation and Open Space Element is intended to establish policies and programs
for the conservation, development, and use of open space and natural resources in
Lemoore. Topics addressed include open space planning, land and agricultural resources,
biological resources, hydrology and water quality, cultural resources, and air quality.
Water supply and conservation as it pertains to water utilities is addressed in the Public
Utilities Element.
7.1        OPEN SPACE
Lemoore’s setting—in an agricultural county laced with creeks and waterways—includes
natural resources that are important not only for aesthetic value, but also for
environmental quality, habitat protection, and water resources. Preserving the general
configuration and relationships of area wetlands, canals, and other natural features fosters
a sense of place for the community while at the same time ensuring the functionality of the
larger regional ecological system. The many roles of open space underscore the
importance of careful land use planning.
CLASSIFICATION OF OPEN SPACE
State planning law (Government Code Section 65560) provides a structure for the
preservation of open space by identifying open space categories. An additional category is
included in this Plan to help define the urban development edge.
•   Open space for public health and safety including, but not limited to: earthquake fault
    zones, unstable soil areas, floodplains, watersheds, areas presenting high fire risks,
    areas required for the protection of drinking water quality and water reservoirs, and
    areas required for the protection and enhancement of air quality.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
•   Open space for the preservation of natural resources including, but not limited to, areas
    required for the protection of plant and animal life, such as: habitat for fish and
    wildlife species; areas required for ecologic and other scientific study purposes; rivers,
    streams, and creeks, lakeshores, banks of rivers and streams; and watershed lands.
•   Open space used for the managed production of resources including, but not limited to,
    forest lands, rangeland, agricultural lands and areas of economic importance for the
    production of food or fiber; areas required for recharge of ground water basins;
    marshes, rivers and streams that are important for the management of commercial
    fisheries; and areas containing major mineral deposits.
•   Open space for outdoor recreation including, but not limited to, areas of outstanding
    scenic, historic and cultural value; areas particularly suited for park and recreation
    purposes, such as access to lakeshores, beaches, rivers and streams; and areas that
    serve as links between major recreation and open space reservations, including utility
    easements, banks of rivers and streams, trails, and scenic highway corridors.
•   Open space in support of the mission of military installations that comprises areas
    adjacent to military installations, military training routes, and underlying restricted
    airspace that can provide additional buffer zones to military activities and complement
    the resource values of the military lands.
•   Open space for the protection of Native American sites, including, but not limited to,
    places, features and objects of historic, cultural, or sacred significance such as Native
    American sanctified cemetery, place of worship, religious or ceremonial site, or sacred
    shrine located on public property (further defined in California Public Resources Code
    Sections 5097.9 and 5097.993). These sites are not mapped in this Plan as locations are
    suppressed for their protection.
•   Open space to shape and limit urban form including, but not limited to, areas meeting
    other open space objectives, such as greenbelts and corridors established to implement
    community design goals or objectives.
  Agricultural open space is an important land use around
                                                   7-2    Lemoore and throughout the Central Valley.

                                                              Chapter 7: Conservation and Open Space
The open space resources listed above and further illustrated in Figure 7-1 are not
intended to imply that the public interest would be best served by prohibiting
development on all such lands. Rather, these open space resources likely signify one of
three possible scenarios, depending upon the ecosystem fragility, location, hazard
potential, regulatory constraints, and other pertinent factors. The three possible scenarios
are:
•    All development should be prohibited;
•    Development should be permitted on part of the land and the balance preserved as
     open space—a clustering concept; or
•    Development should be permitted subject to site plan review and the imposition of
     specific conditions to protect against hazards and preserve the integrity of the land and
     the environment.
General Plan policies and zoning requirements should be consulted on a case-by case
basis to decide which scenario and what standards apply to specific areas of open space.
EXISTING OPEN SPACE
The City of Lemoore is surrounded primarily by agricultural open space and undeveloped
lands in the unincorporated areas. Open space outside city boundaries are rarely visited by
City residents and are preserved for ecological or agricultural reasons.
The policies listed in this section are designed to secure lands for general open space
designation, ensure their protection, and improve management and access to these areas.
Policies pertaining specifically to open space for the preservation of natural resources and
the managed production of resources are provided in sections 7.2-7.4. Policies pertaining
to open space for public health and safety are described in Section 7.4 as well as Chapter 8:
Safety and Noise. Policies for recreational open space are provided in Chapter 5: Parks,
Schools, and Community Facilities.
GUIDING POLICIES
COS-G-1        Acquire, preserve, and maintain open space and natural resources for future
               generations.
COS-G-2        Use the open space system to meet multiple needs, including bike and trail
               linkages, storm water drainage and treatment, wildlife habitat, active and passive
               recreation, and greenbelt buffer to define the boundaries of the City.
COS-G-3        Design open spaces as sustainable systems with drought-tolerant plant materials.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
COS-I-1     Protect lands designated for Agricultural/ Rural/ Conservation uses with
            appropriate zoning consistent with the General Plan.
COS-I-2     Identify a secure funding mechanism for the purchase of conservation
            easements to support farmland preservation and a green space buffer on
            County land surrounding the Lemoore Planning Area, with particular
            emphasis on land east of the City.
            There are several ways to obtain funding for farmland conservation easements,
            including but not limited to, development impact fees, transfers of development
            rights (TDRs), tax allocations/appropriations, grants, donations or bonds. Each
            tool has strengths and weaknesses and the options must be evaluated to choose the
            best one for Lemoore. Implementation will necessitate cooperation with the
            County, usually in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), and
            would also benefit from guidance through applicable land trust organizations,
            such as the American Farmland Trust or the California Council of Land Trusts.
COS-I-3     Work with the County to evaluate the need for and feasibility of creating a
            County Farmland Trust or Open Space District to negotiate open space
            transactions, hold easements, pursue local open space and farmland
            preservation policies.
            A land trust or open space district would be a voter-established entity with
            authority to hold and manage lands for farmland preservation and conservation
            purposes. Donation of easements to a land trust or open space district may validate
            easements for tax purposes.
COS-I-4     Promote use of native vegetation, drought tolerant plants, recycled water
            irrigation and other water-saving devices in City open spaces for ease of
            maintenance and environmental sustainability.

7.2            AGRICULTURAL AND LAND RESOURCES
California State Law requires that a General Plan address agricultural resources from both
soil conservation and open space perspectives.
SOILS
Soil properties have a significant bearing on land planning and development. Sixteen soil
types have been mapped by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the Lemoore area
including urban land and water, and are illustrated on Figure 7-2 and summarized in
Table 7.1. Due to the range of soil types located in the Planning Area—with soil properties
resulting in cutbanks caves1, flooding, shrink-swells (expansive soils, described below),
excess wetness, excess salt, excess sodium or droughty—various building site development
restrictions exist in the Planning Area and affect land development costs. On average,
Kimberlina and Nord soil types have the most favorable properties for development while
Gepford, Goldberg, Pitco, and Vanguard soils have the least favorable properties. Soils
with only slight or moderate soil restrictions comprise 8,900 acres or 73 percent of the
Planning Area. These soils are concentrated on the eastern portion of the Planning Area.
Much of the Westside contains soils with more severe building site development
restrictions. None of the soils in the Planning Area comprise a significant direct health or
safety hazard to residents. For more detail on building site development restrictions for
soils located within the Planning Area refer to the 1986 Kings County Soil Survey.
Erosion
Soil erosion is a process whereby soil materials are worn away and transported to another
area, either by wind or water. Soil erosion matters for agricultural land because it causes
the fertile topsoil to wash away. Rates of erosion can vary depending on the soil material
and structure, placement, and human activity. Soil containing high amounts of silt can be
easily eroded, while sandy soils are less susceptible. In terms of building site restrictions,
excessive soil erosion can eventually damage building foundations and roadways. Erosion
is most likely to occur on sloped areas with exposed soil, especially where unnatural slopes
are created by cut-and-fill activities. Soil erosion rates can be higher during the
construction phase of development. Typically, the soil erosion potential is reduced once
the soil is graded and covered with concrete, structures, or asphalt. In the case of
agricultural or open space uses, erosion potential is reduced with vegetative coverage.
Soil erosion potential or susceptibility is identified by the soil’s “K Factor”. The “K-
Factor” provides an indication of a soil’s inherent susceptibility to erosion, absent slope
and groundcover factors. Values of K range from 0.05 to 0.43. The higher the value, the
more susceptible the soil is to sheet erosion by water. Soils high in clay have low K values,
about 0.05 to 0.15, because they are resistant to detachment. Coarse textured soils, such as
sandy soils, have low K values, about 0.05 to 0.2, because of low runoff even though these
soils are easily detached. Medium textured soils, such as the silt loam soils, have a
moderate K values, about 0.25 to 0.4, because they are moderately susceptible to
detachment and they produce moderate runoff. Soils having high silt content are the most
susceptible to erosion of all soils. They are easily detached, tend to crust, and produce

high rates of runoff. Values of K for these soils tend to be greater than .42. Soils with these
very high K factor values should be conserved. 3

In the Lemoore Planning Area the majority of soils—10,909 acres or 89 percent—are
moderately or highly susceptible to erosion, with K values greater than .25. Of those soils,
the K values for many fall between .37 and .43. In the UGB, 66 percent of the soils are
moderately or highly susceptible to erosion. The risk of erosion is further increased during
grading and construction activities when soils are loosened and bare of vegetation.

MINERAL RESOURCES
The California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act (SMARA) of 1975 requires that all cit-
ies incorporate into their general plans mapped mineral resources designations approved
by the State Mining and Geology Board. SMARA was enacted to limit new development in
areas with significant mineral deposits. The State Geologist classifies land in California
based on availability of mineral resources. The classification system is intended to ensure
consideration of statewide or regionally significant mineral deposits by the City in planning
and development administration. There are no mapped mineral resources in the Planning
Area, and no regulated mine facilities as of July, 2007. 4
FARMLAND
Agriculture is a dominant factor in the local economy and social character of Kings
County and the City of Lemoore. In 2005 Kings County was ranked 9th among California
counties in agricultural production. Trends in gross agricultural production value in Kings
County are provided in Table 7.2. Common crops include cotton, tomatoes, alfalfa, and
corn. Dairies are currently located in the southern portion of the Planning Area along
Idaho Avenue and in the eastern portion of the Planning Area at State Route 198 and D
Street interchange, as shown in Figure 7-3.
Farmland across the State is classified by the California Department of Conservation with
respect to its potential for agricultural productivity. The State applies seven farmland
categories:
•     Prime Farmland. Land with the best
      combination of physical and chemical
      features able to sustain long-term
      agricultural production.
•     Farmland of Statewide Importance. Similar
      to Prime Farmland but with minor
      shortcomings, such as greater slopes or
      decreased ability to store soil moisture.
•     Unique Farmland. Land with lesser
                                                                     Row crops planted          in   the areas surrounding
      quality soils used for the production of
                                                                     Lemoore
      the state's leading agricultural crops.
•     Farmland of Local Importance. Land of importance to the local agricultural economy as
      determined by each county's board of supervisors and local advisory committee.
•     Grazing Land. Land on which the existing vegetation is suited to the grazing of
      livestock.

  In April of 2007 there were still two mine facilities on the SMARA AB3098 list with addresses given for Lemoore, both owned
  by Stoney’s Sand & Gravel, LLC. However, in the current list the only regulated facility in Kings County in located in Avenal.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
•    Urban and Built-up Land. Land occupied by structures with a building density of at
     least 1 unit to 1.5 acres, or approximately 6 structures to a 10-acre parcel.
•    Other Land. Low-density rural developments; brush, timber, wetland, and riparian
     areas not suitable for livestock grazing; confined livestock, poultry or aquaculture
     facilities; strip mines, borrow pits; and water bodies smaller than forty acres. Vacant
     and nonagricultural land surrounded on all sides by urban development and greater
     than 40 acres.

Figure 7-3 illustrates the distribution of these farmland categories within the Planning Area.
As summarized in Table 7.3, Farmland of Statewide Importance comprises approximately
5,800 acres or 47 percent of land dispersed throughout the Planning Area. It is also almost
40 percent of the land within the UGB. Urban and Built-Up Land concentrated within
existing City Limits comprising approximately 4,600 acres or 38 percent of the Planning
Area (46 percent of the UGB). Prime Farmland comprises a small portion of the Planning
Area and UGB (4 percent and 3 percent respectively), located to the northeast and
northwest of the existing City Limits.

WILLIAMSON ACT
The California Land Conservation Act of 1965, commonly referred to as the Williamson Act,
was enacted in 1965 to preserve agricultural and open space land in danger of premature
conversion to urban uses. Its success has been based on the dual incentives of lowered
property taxes for individual landowners and payments of subventions to counties for some
of the losses of property tax revenues. Currently approximately 5,900 acres (48 percent) of the
Planning Area is designated as Williamson Act land. A little over 2,000 acres—35 percent of
Williamson Act land in the Planning Area, and 26 percent of all land in the UGB— are within
the UGB.
AGRICULTURE PROTECTION ISSUES
Between the years 2000 and 2004 Kings County experienced the conversion of over 6,000
acres of agricultural land to urban uses, about 1 percent of all farmland in the county. While
the county experienced farm productivity growth between 2000 and 2005, 2006 saw an 8.4
percent decrease in value of production, due to a combination of land conversion and
product price fluctuations.
The City of Lemoore anticipates the future conversion of some County agricultural land to
urban uses, however, multiple steps are taken in this General Plan to prevent excessive
agricultural land conversion, such as directing growth away from areas of Prime Farmland
(located primarily north of the existing City Limits), focusing on opportunities for infill
development, and implementing buffers between active agricultural production and new
residential uses in order to avoid conflict.

7.3     BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
FLORA
Agricultural
Almost 59 percent of the habitat in the Planning Area is agricultural. Croplands comprise the
majority of the agricultural lands; vegetation includes a variety of sizes, shapes, and growing
patters. Plants may either be annual (e.g. tomatoes) or perennial (e.g. alfalfa), and when
grown in rows provide a varying amount of bare ground between rows. Annual crops are
usually planted in spring and harvested in summer or fall. However, they may be planted in
rotation with other irrigated crops. Some agriculture fields are flooded, this flooding may be
required by the type of crop produced (e.g. rice), or may be a management tool to meet other
objectives. Orchards and vineyards typically are composed of a single species, and are evenly
spaced in uniform rows. Crops are typically grown on the most fertile soils, and typically have
lower habitat values than the native habitats they replaced.
                                               7-16

                                                                                Chapter 7: Conservation and Open Space
Many species of rodents and birds have adapted to agricultural areas, with some considered
agricultural pests. Agricultural practices can provide benefits to wildlife. Various raptors, such
as Swainson’s hawks (Buteo swainsoni), hunt in and around agricultural fields seasonally.
Flooding of agricultural fields in the fall and winter may provide habitat and foraging
opportunities for waterfowl, and open irrigation ditches and canals could potentially provide
movement corridors and foraging habitat for many species. Agricultural habitats can provide
food and water for many species, but do not generally provide long-term shelter due to the
frequency of their disturbance. Vernal pools and wetland areas can be found within the
cropland areas located within the western portion of the Planning Area, predominately within
larger agricultural areas.

Valley Sink Scrub is a low succulent scrubland dominated by alkali-tolerant species, especially
iodine bush (Allenrolfea occidentalis). There is usually no understory, though sparse
herbaceous cover of foxtail chess (Bromus madritensis ssp. rubens) sometimes develops. This
community formerly surrounded the large San Joaquin Valley lakes (Kern, Buena Vista,
Tulare, Goose) and along the San Joaquin Valley through Merced County to Solano and
Glenn counties west of the Sacramento River. Valley Sink scrub has now been essentially
extirpated by flood control, agricultural development, and ground water pumping (Holland,
1986).
Great Valley Cottonwood Riparian Forest
Great Valley cottonwood riparian forest is a dense, broad-leafed, winter deciduous riparian
forest dominated by Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii ssp. fremontii) and Goodding’s
black willow (Salix gooddingii). The understory is usually dense, with abundant vegetative
reproduction of canopy dominants and California wild grape is the most conspicuous vine.
Scattered seedlings and saplings of shade-tolerant species such as box elder (Acer negundo var.
californica) or Oregon ash (Fraxinus latifolia) may be found, but frequent flooding prevents
their reaching into the canopy. This habitat type is usually found along the major low-
gradient streams throughout the Great Valley5, but is now reduced to scattered, isolated
remnants or young stands because of flood control, water diversion, agricultural
development, and urban expansion. This community is typically found below 1,000 ft in the
northern valley and 300 feet in the south (Holland, 1986).

Special Status Species
Special-status species are those plants and animals that, because of their acknowledged rarity
or vulnerability to various causes of habitat loss or population decline, are recognized in some
fashion by federal, State, or other agencies as deserving special consideration. According to
records maintained by the California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB), no sensitive
status plant species occur within the Planning Area. The CNDDB does indicate that
approximately 400 acres of land located in the northwest corner of the Planning Area is

 Other species potentially occurring in the Planning Area includes the Fully Protected blunt-
 nosed leopard lizard, the State Species of Special Concern western pond turtle, and the State
 Threatened Swainson’s hawk. While the sandhill crane, a state-listed Threatened species, is
 not noted in the CNDDB database, it is common knowledge to biologists, birders, and
 residents of the Central Valley that they do indeed frequent Valley marshlands and may occur
 in the wetland complex in the western portion of the Planning Area. Other sensitive status
 species with documented occurrences in the Planning Area are northern harrier, white-tailed
 kite, ferruginous hawk, and tricolored blackbird. A large population of burrowing owl occurs
 throughout the property of the NAS Lemoore, and can be presumed to occur in the Planning
 Area as well. Provided below is a brief description of the special status species known to occur,
 or have a high likelihood to occur, in the Planning Area. Species with a medium or low
 likelihood to occur in the Planning Area are not described in the detail here, but are included
 in the list provided in Appendix B.
 Blunt-nosed Leopard Lizard (Gambelia sila) is a Fully Protected species. The blunt-nosed
 leopard lizard occurs in open, sparsely vegetated, relatively flat areas on the valley floor and
 the surrounding foothills. Habitat types where this species is known to occur include alkali
 playas, alkali saltbush scrub, and also in chenopod scrub communities which are associated
 with non-alkaline, sandy soils. These burrows typically include abandoned ground squirrel
 tunnels and occupied or abandoned kangaroo rat tunnels (USFWS 2002).
 Western pond turtle (Clemmys marmorata marmorata) is a California special concern species
 associated with permanent or nearly permanent water in a wide variety of habitats. It requires
 rocks, logs, or exposed soil for basking sites and may nest up to 0.3-mile (0.5-km) away from
 water (USFWS 2002). While the CNDDB does not indicate this species in the Planning Area,
 the potential for this species to occur in the Planning Area is high.
 San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) is a Federally-listed Endangered and California
 Threatened species. San Joaquin kit foxes inhabit grasslands and scrublands, many of which
 have been extensively modified by oil exploration and extraction, wind turbines, and
 agricultural mosaics of row crops, irrigated pastures, orchards, vineyards, and grazed annual
 grasslands. Oak woodland, alkali-sink scrub, and vernal pool and alkali meadow communities

also provide habitat for the San Joaquin kit fox. Kit foxes construct their own dens, but they
can also enlarge or modify burrows constructed by other animals, such as ground squirrels,
badgers, and coyotes. They also den in human-made structures, such as culverts, abandoned
pipes, and banks in roadbeds. Dens are usually scarce in areas with shallow soils due to the
proximity to bedrock, high water tables, or impenetrable hardpan layers (Williams et al.,
1997). The CNDDB contains a record of this species in the northwestern portion of the
Planning Area, but outside of the UGB.
Tipton kangaroo rat (Dipodomys nitratoides nitratoides) is a Federal and State Endangered
species. Tipton kangaroo rats inhabit arid-land with level or nearly level terrain located within
the floor of the Tulare Basin in the southern San Joaquin Valley. Many of the presently
inhabited areas have one or more species of woody shrubs, such as saltbush, iodine bush,
goldenbush, and honey mesquite, and a ground cover dominated by introduced and native
grasses and forbs. Burrows are commonly located in slightly elevated mounds, road berms,
canal embankments, railroad beds, and bases of shrubs and fences. Soft soils, such as fine
sands and sandy loams, and powdery soils of finer texture and of higher salinity generally
support higher densities of Tipton kangaroo rats than other soil types. Terrain not subject to
flooding is essential to sustain a population of Tipton kangaroo rats (Williams et al., 1997).
The CNDDB notes occurrences along the southern boundary of the Planning Area, outside of
the UGB.
Swainson’s hawk (Buteo swainsoni) is listed as a Threatened species under the California
Endangered Species Act and is also fully protected against take pursuant to Section 3503.5 of
the Fish and Game Code of California and the Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The
Swainson's hawk is a relatively large bird-of-prey that typically nests in large trees in riparian
corridors as well as in isolated trees remaining in or adjacent to agricultural fields in the
Central Valley. Swainson's hawks require suitable nest trees adjacent to or in close proximity
to large open agricultural fields, grasslands, and pastures that have an abundant prey base.
Breeding occurs in late March to late August. This species forages in open grassland habitats
and has adjusted to foraging in certain types of agricultural lands. These raptors typically
forage within a 10-mile radius of nest sites but may range up to 18 miles from a nest site in
search of suitable foraging habitat and available prey (Williams et al., 1997).
Ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis) is a California Special Concern species. The wintering
grounds for the ferruginous hawk consist of open grasslands. A previous occurrence of this
species was noted in the wetland complex in the western portion of the Planning Area (Urban
Futures 1997).
Northern harrier (Circus cyaneus) is a California Special Concern species that nests in wet
meadows and tall grasslands, and forages in grasslands and marshes. A previous occurrence of
this species was noted in the large wetland complex in the western Planning Area (Urban
Futures 1997).
White-tailed kite (Elanus leucurus) is a Federal Species of Concern and a California Fully
Protected species. The white-tailed kite forages in open plains, grasslands, and prairies;
typically nests in trees. A previous occurrence of this species was noted in the wetland
complex in the western Planning Area (Urban Futures 1997).
Sandhill crane (Grus canadensis tabida) is listed as a threatened species under the California
Endangered Species Act. This species is known to breed on the plains east of the Cascade

Range and south to Sierra County and
winters in the Central Valley, southern
Imperial County, Lake Havasu National
Wildlife Refuge, and the Colorado River
Indian Reserve. The sandhill crane summers
in open terrain near shallow lakes or
freshwater marshes and winters in plains and
valleys near bodies of fresh water (USFWS
2006).
Burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) is a
California Special Concern species that Sandhill cranes are long legged, long necked, gray, he-
forages in open plains, grasslands, and ron-like birds with a patch of bald red skin on their
prairies, and typically nests in abandoned heads.
small mammal burrows. The Planning Area contains potentially suitable habitat and is within
the range of this species. A relatively large population of burrowing owls occurs at Naval Air
Station Lemoore (Rosenberg et al, 1998).
Tricolored blackbird (Agelaius tricolor) is a California Special Concern species which is most
numerous in the Central Valley and surrounding areas. This species requires open water,
protected nesting substrate, and foraging grounds within vicinity of the nesting colony. The
Tricolored blackbird nests in dense thickets of cattails, tules, willow, blackberry, wild rose,
and other tall herbs near fresh water. Also nests in crops such as silage. A previous occurrence
of this species was noted in the large wetland complex (Urban Futures 1997).
Wetlands
Within the Planning Area, water habitats can be composed of flooded agricultural fields, rive-
rine and lacustrine habitat, or freshwater emergent wetlands (also referred to as “marsh”).
These habitats provide roosting, foraging and cover opportunities for numerous species, in-
cluding waterfowl, sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis) and western pond turtles (Emys marmo-
rata).
The freshwater marsh in the western Planning Area within existing City limits is relatively
undisturbed by farming, and appears to have been used only for light grazing in the recent
past. This marsh provides habitat for wildlife, particularly water birds. The mix of emergent
vegetation, open water, and drier sites covered by a low growth of saltgrass provides a mosaic
of open areas and dense cover that are prime nesting areas for marsh birds, such as marsh
wren and song sparrow. The marsh is very productive for insects, crustaceans, amphibians
(particularly bullfrogs), and aquatic plant life, which serve as a food source for many of the
birds. Wildlife use of the marsh changes with each season; migratory birds stop over in the fall
and spring, while water birds such as ducks, geese, sandhill cranes, and migratory raptors
winter in the marsh. Their presence is sometimes limited by seasonal hunting activities. These
wetlands also provide an area where urban stormwater is treated by natural processes, and
acts as a receiving area that reduces potential for flooding of adjacent agricultural properties.
The City of Lemoore has historically discharged much of its storm water runoff into irrigation
canals. While ditch users typically desired an opportunity to use surplus drainage water in dry
years, the downstream property owners complained of localized flooding during wet years.
Farmers had also expressed concerns about the possible negative impacts to water quality

COS-G-7     Protect rare and endangered species.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
COS-I-10    Require protection of sensitive habitat areas and “special status” species in new
            development in the following order: 1) avoidance; 2) onsite mitigation, and 3)
            offsite mitigation. Require assessments of biological resources prior to approval
            of any development within 300 feet of any creeks, sensitive habitat areas, or areas
            of potential sensitive status species.
            The term “special status” species includes species classified as rare and endangered.
            These priorities are consistent with the California Department of Fish and Game
            guidelines. When habitat preservation on-site is not feasible (i.e., preserved parcels
            would be too small to be of any value), then off-site mitigation should occur.
COS-I-11    Periodically monitor existing and future stormwater drainage system pre-
            treatment and flows entering wetlands.
            The City will impose monitoring requirements as part of development projects’
            mitigation monitoring and reporting requirements under CEQA where a project
            could have a potentially significant impact on wetlands.
COS-I-12    Require drainage basin buffers, maintenance of adequate water supply and
            reduced disturbance of the water table and wetlands systems.
COS-I-13    Establish a “no net loss” standard for sensitive habitat acreage, including wet-
            lands and vernal pools potentially affected by development.
            The City will required that assessments are conducted by a qualified biologist to
            determine the presence or absence of any sensitive resources, to assess the potential
            impacts, to identify measures for protecting the resource and surrounding buffer
            habitat and to ensure that the no net loss standard is achieved and maintained.
COS-I-14    Consult with trustee agencies (California Department of Fish and Game, U.S.
            Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Environmental
            Protection Agency, and Regional Water Quality Control Board) during envi-
            ronmental review when special status species, sensitive natural communities, or
            wetlands or vernal pools may be adversely affected.
            Applicants will be required to consult with all agencies with review authority for
            projects in areas supporting wetlands and special status species at the outset of
            project planning.
COS-I-15    Prohibit the use of invasive plant species, such as Pampas grass, adjacent to wet-
            lands and other sensitive habitat, where such landscaping could adversely impact
            wildlife habitat.

7.4     WATER RESOURCES
The City of Lemoore is located in the San Joaquin Valley Groundwater Basin and the Tulare
Lake Subbasin. The City relies exclusively on groundwater for its water supply, making the
relationship between the City and the groundwater basins a critical one for future sustainable
development.
GROUNDWATER BASINS
The northern portion of the San Joaquin Valley drains toward the Delta by the San Joaquin
River and its tributaries, the Fresno, Merced, Tuolumne, and Stanislaus Rivers. The southern
portion of the valley is internally drained by the Kings, Kaweah, Tule, and Kern Rivers that
flow into the Tulare drainage basin including the beds of the former Tulare, Buena Vista, and
Kern Lakes. The Tulare Lake Subbasin is bounded on the south by the Kings-Kern county
line, on the west by the California Aqueduct, the eastern boundary of Westside Groundwater
Subbasin, and Tertiary marine sediments of the Kettleman Hills. It is bounded on the north
by the southern boundary of the Kings Groundwater Subbasin, and on the east by the
westerly boundaries of the Kaweah and Tule Groundwater Subbasins. The southern half of
the Tulare Lake Subbasin consists of lands in the former Tulare Lake bed in Kings County.
Average annual precipitation is seven inches throughout most of the subbasin and nine inches
at the northern margin.
SURFACE HYDROLOGY
Major water features located within the Planning Area are portrayed in Figure 7-4 along with
biological resources. These features are primarily canals which provide important drainage
resources for the City (some may be in pipes below ground). The Lemoore Canal, a
prominent irrigation and drainage feature in the region, runs north-south, forming the
eastern border of much of the Planning Area. The Lemoore Canal & Irrigation Company
operates drainage ditch facilities within the Planning Area. The wetlands in the western
portion of the Planning Area are another important surface water feature, particularly as
concerns the maintenance of groundwater quality; they are discussed in more detail in the
Biological Resources section.
Storm Drainage and Non-point Pollution Sources
During periods of wet weather, rain carries pollutants and sediments from all parts of a
watershed into surface water bodies such as storm drains, streams, rivers, reservoirs, or
marshes. In an urban setting, natural drainage patterns have been altered and storm water
runoff, as well as non-storm discharge (irrigation water, accidental spills, washdown water,
etc.), picks up sediments and contaminants from land surfaces, and transports these
pollutants into surface and ground water. The diffused sources of pollutants range from:
parking lots, bare earth at construction sites, agricultural sites, and a host of many other
sources. Therefore, storm water discharged to surface waters may carry pollution from
“nonpoint” sources. The total amount of pollutants entering aquatic systems from these
diffused, non-point sources is now generally considered to be greater than that from any
other source, such as pipe discharges (point source).

2030 Lemoore General Plan
Groundwater Quality
Groundwater recharge occurs primarily from deep percolation of applied irrigation water and
rainfall. The rate of recharge depends on the permeability of the surface and subsurface
materials.
Water quality has been and may continue to be an issue due to the existence of hydrogen
sulfide and colored water produced in various in-town wells. Additionally, arsenic in wells
located in the north well field (wells number 2, 4, and 5) and in-town (well number 11)
causes water quality issues.
Regulations Protecting Groundwater Quality
The major federal legislation governing the water quality is the Clean Water Act, as amended
by the Water Quality Act of 1987. The objective of the act is “to restore and maintain the
chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation’s waters.” The State of California’s
Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (Division 7 of the California Water Code)
provides the basis for water quality regulation in California. The State Water Resources
Control Board (SWRCB) administers water rights, water pollution control, and water quality
functions throughout the State, while the Regional Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCBs)
conduct planning, permitting, and enforcement activities.
GUIDING POLICIES
COS-G-8      Preserve and improve the quality of the groundwater supply.
COS-G-9      Manage storm drainage to protect agricultural areas, habitats, and the ground

             discharges directly into waterways to prevent pollution, in conjunction with
             federal, State, local agencies, and the private sector.
COS-I-17     Protect groundwater recharge areas by carefully regulating the type of
             development within and adjacent to these areas.
             Conditions of approval may include the limitation of structural coverage and
             impervious surfaces and prohibition of uses with the potential to discharge harmful
             pollutants, increase erosion, or create other impacts degrading water quality.

Wastewater and Storm Drainage
COS-I-18  Update, monitor and implement the City’s Storm Drainage Master Plan.
          As part of the Master Plan, the City will update storm drain maps to identify
          locations where easements should be reserved for the eventual installation of pipes
          and structures to ensure appropriate system management.
COS-I-19  Establish and implement a storm drainage fee in conjunction with the recreation
          impact fee to acquire and develop combined pond basin/park sites and/or other
          drainage facilities to mitigate growth impacts.
COS-I-20  Require temporary on-site storm drainage basin in subdivisions and other
          development proposals, if needed, until storm drainage plans for that area are
          completed and formal connections are implemented. Design should take into
          consideration the properties of soils on the site.
COS-I-21  Require developers to construct and maintain permanent water control facilities
          (storm water basins or retention ponds) for new development in the Westside
          and other areas deemed necessary by the City Engineer, to control storm water
          and protect areas from flooding. Facilities shall incorporate the following:
          x    A fenced “low-flow” area to contain potential contaminants;
          x    Regularly-tilled top soil to maintain good percolation;
          x    When feasible, storm drainage facilities to channel water into the re-created
               wetlands which currently lack sufficient water to survive; and
          x    Other design features consistent with the Regional Water Quality Control
               Board’s Best Management Practices.
          Soils at the bottom of retention ponds will be periodically checked for concentrations
          of contaminants. Contaminated soil shall be disposed in an environmentally-
          friendly manner.
COS-I-22  Require on-site storm drainage to drain away from the streets in areas with no
          curbs and gutters.
COS-I-23  Continue to prohibit septic tanks and drain fields to prevent pollution of

COS-I-24  Control use of potential water contaminants through inventorying hazardous
          materials used in City operations, listing possible changes that can be made,
          educating City employees, and designing and implementing a re-
          placement/reduction program.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
COS-I-25    Reduce the use of pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, or other toxic chemical
            substances by households and farmers by providing education and incentives for
            Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices.
            IPM is an approach to plant care that uses biological controls instead of, or in
            conjunction with, chemical controls. IPM does not necessarily eliminate the use of
            pesticides and other chemical controls, but it strives to use them as sparingly as
            possible. Utilize regional resources such as the UC Davis Extension for informational
            materials and technical support.
Water Conservation
COS-I-26    Establish water conservation guidelines and standards for new development and
            for municipal buildings and facilities.
            The City also will develop and maintain a list of water conservation technologies,
            methods, and practices.
COS-I-27    Become a signatory to the California Urban Water Conservation Council and
            implement all Demand Management Measures as soon as they become feasible.
            The California Urban Water Conservation Council is a non-profit organization
            whose goal is to integrate urban water conservation Best Management Practices
            (BMPs) into the planning and management of California’s water resources. Since
            it’s inception in 1991, 384 urban water agencies and environmental groups have
            pledged to develop and implement fourteen comprehensive conservation BMPs.
COS-I-28    Develop a schedule for the retrofitting of existing public buildings with water
            conservation features, and budget accordingly.
COS-I-29    Annually check for leaks throughout the City’s main water supply and
            distribution system, and initiate repairs when necessary to reduce water waste.
COS-I-30    Consider establishing rebate and/or incentive programs for the replacement of
            leaking, aging and/or inefficient plumbing with more efficient, water saving
            plumbing and for the use of water efficient landscaping.
COS-I-31    Educate the general public about the importance of water conservation, water
            recycling and groundwater recharge through the following means:
            x    Making water production and treatment facilities available for tours by
                 schools or organized groups;
            x    Encouraging educators to include water conservation in their curriculums;
            x Providing tips to business groups on water conservation and recycling.
            The City may solicit assistance from environmental groups, the Lemoore Elementary
            and High School Districts, and/or concerned citizens to provide education materials
            or staff time for these public outreach programs.
Water supply and conservation are addressed in Chapter 6: Public Utilities.

7.5        CULTURAL RESOURCES
In addition to a desire by the local community to protect historic resources, several State laws,
most notably the California Environmental Quality Act, protect archaeological and historical
resources. To preserve historic resources, the State has formed the State Historical Resources
Committee that conducts the State Historic Resource Inventory and maintains the California
Register of Historic Resources, which identifies historic landmarks and points of interest. The
Committee also provides recommendations for the National Register of Historic Places.
Cultural resources are defined as prehistoric and historic sites, structures, and districts, or any
other physical evidence associated with human activity considered important to a culture, a
subculture, or a community for scientific, traditional, religious, or any other reason.
Archaeological resources are places where human activity has measurably altered the earth or
left deposits of physical remains. Archaeological resources may be either prehistoric (before
the introduction of writing in a particular area) or historic (after the introduction of writing).
The majority of such places in this region are associated with either Native American or
Euroamerican occupation of the area.
Historic resources are standing structures of historic or aesthetic significance. Architectural
sites dating from the Spanish Period (1529-1822) through the post-World War II period
(1945-1955) are generally considered for protection if they are determined to be historically
or architecturally significant. Sites dating after the post-World War II period may also be
considered for protection if they could gain significance in the future. Historic resources are
often associated with archaeological deposits of the same age.
Contemporary Native American resources, also called ethnographic resources, can include
archaeological resources, rock art, and the prominent topographical areas, features, habitats,
plants, animals, and minerals that contemporary Native Americans value and consider
essential for the preservation of their traditional values.
PREHISTORIC CONTEXT
The San Joaquin Valley may have been inhabited by humans as early as 10,000 years ago;
however, the evidence of early human use is mostly buried by alluvial deposits that have
accumulated over the last several thousand years. The greatest exception to this has been the
                                              6
prolific discoveries at Tulare Lake , which has yielded evidence of the earliest occupation of
California. Nonetheless, later periods are better understood because there is more
representation in the archaeological record.
HISTORIC RESOURCES
According to the Southern San Joaquin Valley Archeological Information Center (SSJVAIC)
at California State University Bakersfield (CSUB), there are currently no buildings or
structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or as California Historic
Landmarks. However, there are 37 sites listed as having local historic significance. Many of

2030 Lemoore General Plan
these local historic sites are located within the downtown district, bounded by the railroad to
the north, Lemoore Avenue to the east, “C” Street on the south and Hill Street to the west.
These are summarized in Table 7.5 and mapped in Figure 7-5.
Although there are no buildings or structures currently listed in the National Register of
Historic Places or California Historic Landmarks, according to the SSJVAIC the Lemoore
Canal is likely eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The Canal,
previously know as the Lower Kings River Ditch, was the first irrigation system to be
constructed in what is now Kings County (then Tulare County), and continues to play a
critical role in the agricultural development of the county.
ARCHEOLOGICAL RESOURCES
According to CSUB, there are ten recorded archeological resource sites within the Planning
Area. Of those, there are five habitation sites with human burials, two of which are completely
destroyed, one is being systematically destroyed, and the other is destroyed on the surface
only. There is one habitation site with no human burials but which contains many artifacts
collected by the landowner.

GUIDING POLICIES
COS-G-11 Identify and preserve the archaeological and historic resources that are found within
         the Lemoore Planning Area.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
COS-I-32 Establish an inventory of historical buildings in Lemoore, including schools,
         churches, commercial buildings, public buildings, and residential buildings.
         A historic preservation checklist is the primary planning tool used to identify, record,
         and evaluate historic properties within a community, neighborhood, project area, or
         region. The checklist may include items to determine a building’s architectural
         significance, age, historic importance, structural integrity, cost of restoration and
         other attributes. The inventories generated from these survey activities form an
         important component in local preservation programs, and ultimately contribute to
         local knowledge of historical resources.
COS-I-33 Require that new development analyze and avoid potential impacts to
         archaeological, paleontological, and historic resources by:
         x    Requiring a records review for development proposed in areas that are
              considered archaeologically or paleontologically sensitive;
         x    Determining the potential effects of development and construction on
              archeological or paleontological resources (as required by CEQA);
         x    Requiring pre-construction surveys and monitoring during any ground
              disturbance for all development in areas of historical and archaeological
              sensitivity; and
         x    Implementing appropriate measures to avoid the identified impacts, as
              conditions of project approval.
         In the event that historical, archaeological, or paleontological resources are
         accidentally discovered during construction, grading activity in the immediate area
         shall cease and materials and their surroundings shall not be altered or collected. A
         qualified archaeologist or paleontologist must make an immediate evaluation and
         avoidance measures or appropriate mitigation should be completed, according to
         CEQA Guidelines. The State Office of Historic Preservation has issued
         recommendations for the preparation of Archeological Resource Management
         Reports that will be used as guidelines.
COS-I-34 If, prior to grading or construction activity, an area is determined to be sensitive
         for paleontological resources, retain a qualified paleontologist to recommend
         appropriate actions. Appropriate action may include avoidance, preservation in
         place, excavation, documentation, and/or data recovery, and shall always include
         preparation of a written report documenting the find and describing steps taken
         to evaluate and protect significant resources.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
COS-I-35        Provide technical assistance with the registration of historic sites, buildings, and
                structures in the National Register of Historic Places, and inclusion in the
                California Inventory of Historic Resources.
COS-I-36        Adopt a Landmarks and Historic Preservation District Overlay Zone or
                Ordinance to preserve all City-, State-, and federally-designated historic sites and
                structures to the maximum extent feasible.
COS-I-37        Establish an interim design review process for proposed demolitions and
                exterior alterations and additions to non-residential buildings that are more
                than 75 years old. The Planning Commission will be the review authority, with
                their decisions subject to appeal to the City Council. Criteria to be considered in
                approving or conditionally approving the proposed change will include:
                x   For proposed alterations and additions: The project design is compatible
                    with Secretary of the Interior Standards for the Treatment of Historic
                    Properties and with the Downtown Revitalization Plan; and
                x   For proposed demolitions: The applicant has demonstrated that the existing
                    use can not generate a reasonable rate of return; the existing building
                    constitutes a hazard to public safety and is economically infeasible to
                    rehabilitate, the design quality of the replacement building will be superior
                    to the existing building and will be compatible with adjacent buildings and
                    the character of Downtown Lemoore, or the proposed demolition or
                    removal is necessary to allow a project that will have public benefits
                    outweighing the public benefits of retaining the existing building.
                This process will be in place until the inventory of potential landmarks and historic
                buildings is completed and zoning for Landmarks and Historic Districts is adopted.
7.6      AIR QUALITY
The U.S. EPA, pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act of 1967 (Amended 1990) sets national
ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for several pollutants and oversees their
implementation by State air quality agencies. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is
the corresponding State agency. CARB is responsible for establishing emission standards for
on-road motor vehicles sold in California and overseeing the activities of regional/county air
districts. It also establishes air quality standards and is empowered under the California Clean
Air Act to enforce compliance.
Lemoore is located within the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin (SJVAB), considered one of the
most polluted air basins in California due to its unique topography and weather patterns
(Figure 7-6). Air quality in the basin is monitored by the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution
Control District (SJVAPCD), which operates a network of monitoring stations throughout
the Valley to determine if emissions and air pollutant levels meet health and safety standards.
The SJVAPCD is made up of eight counties in California’s Central Valley: San Joaquin,
Stanislaus, Merced, Madera, Fresno, Kings, Tulare, and the Valley portion of Kern. The
SJVAPCD is governed by an eleven member Governing Board consisting of representatives
from the Board of Supervisors of all eight counties and three Valley city representatives.

SJVAPCD has permit authority over stationary sources such as factories, acts as the primary
reviewing agency for environmental documents and develops regulations consistent with
State and federal air quality agencies.
The Kings County Association of Governments also has a role in air quality planning by
ensuring its transportation plans, programs, and projects conform to the most recent air
quality requirements; and by coordinating effectively between government agencies.
DEFINITIONS
Air quality is affected by three general types of pollutants – criteria air pollutants, toxic air
contaminants, and odors and nuisances. Criteria air pollutants and toxic air contaminants (as
described below) are under the purview of the SJVAPCD. The City has a more direct role in
regulating odors and nuisances, and the release of particulate matter at construction sites.
Criteria Air Pollutants
Criteria air pollutants are most pervasive in urban air environments and include pollutants
such as Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), and particulate matter, including Nitrogen
Dioxide (NO2), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), PM10, PM2.5 and Lead (Pb). State and federal ambient
air quality standards have been established to monitor their levels.
Under the California Clean Air Act and amendments to the Federal Clean Air Act, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board are required
to classify Air Basins as either “attainment” or “non-attainment” for each criterion of air
pollutants, based on whether or not the national and State standards have been met. Table 7.6
shows minimum standards for criteria air pollutants, their effects on health, and potential
sources. The Valley meets federal standards for all air pollutants except PM10 and 8-hour
ozone, which remain in the “serious non-attainment” category. The quality index for PM2.5
in San Joaquin Valley is still in the federal “non-attainment” category but has been improving
in the last 3 years.7
Vehicle and industry activity plays a large role in the emission of particulates and ozone in the
Valley, particularly north-south goods movement on I-5 and Highway 99. Emissions are also
generated through commercial operations and building energy use. Lemoore’s primary role
in achieving and maintaining regional air quality standards is through land use decision-
making to reduce vehicular use in the city, and in cooperation with State agencies such as
SJVAPCD and California Air Resources Board (CARB) to implement emissions control plans.

Toxic Air Contaminants
Toxic air contaminants (TACs) are typically pollutants that occur at relatively low
concentrations and are associated with carcinogenic (cancer causing) or other adverse health
effects. Carcinogens, mutagens, or reproductive toxins are some examples. They are typically
emitted from mobile sources such as cars and trucks, as well as stationary sources, such as
factories, gas stations, hospital operations, and other businesses. Some examples of sources of
TACs: most paradichlorobenzene in the environment comes from its use in moth repellent
products and in toilet deodorizer blocks; perchloroethylene is the main solvent used in the
dry-cleaning process, and also used in metal degreasing, and in some adhesives, aerosols,
paints, and coatings; benzene and formaldehyde are emitted by mobile sources.
Unlike criteria air pollutants, there are no ambient air quality standards established for TACs.
Regulation of TACs is achieved through federal and State controls on individual sources. The
SJVAPCD implements a State law known as the Air Toxics “Hot Spots” Information and
Assessment Act to control emissions. This law requires each district to compile an inventory
of toxic emissions from polluting facilities. TACs from mobile sources such as benzene and
formaldehyde have traditionally been regulated through emissions standards for on-road
motor vehicles and specifications for gasoline and diesel fuel. The City can reduce public
exposure to toxic air contaminants by ensuring sufficient buffer zones are provided around
stationary sources. The Air Resources Board maintains an inventory of toxic air contaminants
concentrations and their health risks. Table 7.7 describes total emissions in the years 1995 to
2005 from stationary sources of toxic air contaminants in the San Joaquin Valley.
Odors and Nuisances
Odors and nuisances are emissions or occurrences with little or no adverse health effects but
which have the potential to generate citizen complaints. Controlling odors from livestock and
some industrial sites is a challenge, as well as complaints of dust from construction sites.
Lemoore can address these nuisances through land use regulations such as buffering
incompatible uses and local controls at construction sites.
Since 2000, the City has implemented a General Plan Amendment designed to protect the
viability of the three industrial parks in the City. Resolution 2000-01 promotes the location of
industry in areas where prevailing winds would not increase the impact of odors on adjacent
property, while also requiring all residential uses developed within a mile of industrial zones
to record noise and odor easements acknowledging the presence of nearby industries.
AIR QUALITY CONDITIONS AND TRENDS
The SJVAPCD operates a network of air pollution monitoring stations in San Joaquin Valley
to provide information on ambient concentrations of critical air pollutants and toxic air
contaminants. Since air quality is rarely localized and typically of a regional character, data
recorded nearby can be taken to approximate air quality standards in Lemoore. Table 7.8
summarizes recent data collected from Kings County (Ozone, Nitrogen Dioxide, Carbon
Monoxide, PM10 and PM2.5).

Ozone
Ground level ozone is a major component of smog (it should not be confused with
'stratospheric' ozone, which protects us from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays). Ground level
ozone is not directly emitted to the atmosphere, but is a secondary air pollutant produced by
complex chemical reactions between hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides in the presence of
sunlight. Between 1999 and 2004, the number of days Ozone exceeded State standards ranged
from 48 as the high in 2000 to 7 as the low in 2004. For “peak hour” Kings County remains in
the Severe/non-attainment category, though conditions have improved since 2000.
Carbon Monoxide
Carbon monoxide is an odorless, invisible gas produced by incomplete combustion or
emitted from organic substances. Carbon monoxide levels are not monitored in Lemoore or
Kings County, but overall figures for Madera, Merced and Kings counties place it in the
‘Attainment’ category.8 Readings at the nearest stations at Fresno and Modesto also indicate
general attainment of federal standards. Since the introduction of oxygenated fuels in 1992,
background carbon monoxide concentrations have been dramatically reduced. Future
concentrations are expected to decline further as older, heavily polluting vehicles are
gradually replaced by newer, cleaner-running models.
Suspended Particulate Matter
Particulate matter is the general term used for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets
in the air. They include aerosols, smoke, fumes, dust, ash, and pollen. Fine particulate matter
is classified as PM10 for matters 10 microns or less in diameter and PM2.5 for matters 2.5
microns or less in diameter. Fine particulate matter is known to cause adverse health
problems such as decreased lung capacity, respiratory disease, lung damage, and cancer, as
this particulate can penetrate deep into the respiratory system.
Both PM2.5 and PM10 emissions are expected to increase in the future with an overall
increase in vehicle ownership and miles traveled. As part of its effort to protect the
environment, the City will encourage residents to use alternatives modes of transportation or
switch to clean-energy vehicles.

   Although EPA has determined that the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin has attained the federal PM 10 standards, their de-
 termination does not constitute a re-designation to attainment per section 107(d)(3) of the Federal Clean Air Act. The
 Valley will continue to be designated non-attainment until all of the Section 107(d)(3) requirements are met.
 4
   The Valley is designated non-attainment for the 1997 PM 2.5 federal standards. EPA designations for the 2006 PM 2.5
 standards will be finalized in December 2009. The District has determined, as of the 2004-06 PM 2.5 data, that the Valley
 has attained the 1997 24-Hour PM 2.5 standard.
 5
   On April 30, 2007 the governing board of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District voted to request EPA to
 reclassify the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin as extreme non-attainment for the federal 8-hour ozone standard. On June 14,
 2007, the California Air Resources Board approved the request. This request must be forwarded to the EPA by the
 CARB and would become effective upon EPA final rulemaking after a notice and comment process; it is not yet in effect.

SENSITIVE RECEPTORS
Some people are more sensitive than others to the effects of air pollutants. Chronic asthma or
bronchitis suffers, young children or the elderly, for example, may experience more
discomfort compared to other residents. Aside from age and health problems, heightened
sensitivity may also be caused by prolonged exposure to air pollutants and proximity to an
emissions source. Therefore, hospitals, schools, convalescent facilities, residential areas, and
other sensitive receptors should not be located close to pollution sources. Potentially
incompatible uses can be separated by land use zoning or other regulations.
In addition to the policies listed in this section, land use policies in Chapter 2 and circulation
policies in Chapter 4 promote alternative modes of transportation and land use concepts that
are intended to reduce overall vehicle emissions.
GREENHOUSE GASES AND GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE
Global climate change (GCC) is currently one of the most important and widely debated
scientific, economic, and political issues in the United States. GCC is a change in the average
weather of the earth that may be measured by wind patterns, storms, precipitation, and
temperature. The baseline by which these changes are measured originates in historical
records identifying temperature changes that have occurred in the past, such as during
previous ice ages. Of particular concern is the gradual increase in average temperatures and
associated changes in environmental conditions. In California these may include, but are not
limited to: decreased air quality; more severe heat; increased wildfires; shifting vegetation;
declining forest productivity; decreased spring snowpack; water shortages; a potential
reduction in hydropower; a loss of winter recreational opportunities; agricultural damage
from heat, pests, pathogens, and weeds; and rising sea levels resulting in shrinking beaches;
disruptions in estuarine habitats and fresh water supply, and increased coastal flooding.
Although GCC is a widely accepted concept, the extent of the change or the exact
contribution from human activity remains in debate. In addition, the connection between
local land use decisions and global climate change is not well understood and, therefore, is
not reflected in climate modeling. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) has predicted that the range of global mean temperature change from 1990 to
2100, given six scenarios, could range from 2.0° Celsius (C) or 3.6 °F to 4.5°C or 8.1 °F
(IPCC, 2001). Regardless of analytical methodology, global average temperature and sea level
are expected to rise under all scenarios (IPCC, 2001).
Gases that trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere are called greenhouse gases (GHG). These
gases play a critical role in determining the Earth’s surface temperature. Part of the solar
radiation that enters our atmosphere from space is absorbed by the Earth’s surface. The
Earth’s surface emits radiation back toward space in the form of infrared radiation, and
GHGs absorb some of that radiation. Some radiation that otherwise would have escaped back
into space is thus retained, resulting in a warming of the atmosphere. This phenomenon is
known as the greenhouse effect.
The accumulation in the atmosphere of GHGs regulates the earth’s temperature. Without
naturally-occurring GHGs, the Earth’s surface would be about 61°F cooler (CCAT, 2006).
However, many scientists believe that emissions from human activities, such as electricity

production and vehicles, have elevated the concentration of these gases in the atmosphere
beyond naturally-occurring concentrations.
Common GHGs include water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides,
chlorofluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride, ozone, and
aerosols. GHG have varying global warming potential (GWP) and atmospheric lifetimes.
Carbon dioxide equivalents are a measurement used to account for the fact that different
GHGs have different potential to retain infrared radiation in the atmosphere and contribute
to the greenhouse effect. The GWP is the potential of a gas or aerosol to trap heat in the
atmosphere.
Expressing GHGs emissions in carbon dioxide equivalents takes the contribution of all GHG
emissions to the greenhouse effect and converts them to a single unit equivalent to the effect
that would occur if only CO2 were being emitted. GWP ranges from 1 (carbon dioxide) to
23,900 (sulfur hexafluoride). GHG emissions
with a higher GWP have a greater global
warming effect on a molecule per molecule
basis. For example, one ton of CH4 has the
same contribution to the greenhouse effect as
approximately 21 tons of CO2. (California
Climate Action Registry, General Reporting
Protocol, Appendix C (2006).
Emissions of GHGs contributing to global
climate change are attributable in large part
to human activities associated with the

transportation, and agricultural sectors
(California Energy Commission 2006).
Consumption of fossil fuels in the transportation sector was the single largest source of
California’s GHG emissions in 2004, accounting for 40.7 percent of total GHG emissions in
the state (California Energy Commission 2006). This category was followed by the electric
power sector (including both in-state and out-of-state sources) (22.2 percent) and the
industrial sector (20.5 percent) (California Energy Commission 2006). California is the
second largest GHG emitter in the United States (trailing only Texas) and the 12th largest
emitter in the world, producing 492 million gross metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents
in 2004 (California Energy Commission 2006).
In September 2006, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the California Climate
Solutions Act of 2006. This Act requires that statewide GHG emissions be reduced to 1990
levels by the year 2020. This reduction will be accomplished through an enforceable statewide
cap on GHG emissions that will be phased in starting in 2012. To effectively implement the
cap, the Act directs the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to develop and implement
regulations to reduce statewide GHG emissions from stationary sources. The Act also requires
the State to develop regulations to address GHG emissions from vehicles.
Though the Attorney General’s office has filed multiple lawsuits to force local agencies
(mostly large and populous counties) to take action on GHGs, to-date the State has not
imposed any specific requirements on local agencies to help achieve the requisite emissions
reductions. The Attorney General has announced the intent to continue filing lawsuits in the

absence of implementing regulations. The State has, however, adopted several so-called early
action GHG reduction measures that will help to reduce GHG emissions from local land use
decisions that may generate additional vehicle traffic. These actions include: a low-carbon fuel
standard that reduces carbon intensity in California fuels; reduction of refrigerant losses
during motor vehicle air conditioning system maintenance by restricting the sale of "do-it-
yourself" automotive refrigerants; and requiring broader use of state-of-the-art methane
capture technologies to increase methane capture from landfills. CARB has also adopted a
requirement, effective in 2009, that requires every new car sold in California to bear a sticker
showing the vehicle’s smog and greenhouse gas emission characteristics. The label will allow
consumers to consider and compare a vehicle's environmental impacts. (California
Environmental Protection Agency, 2007)
Because generation of GHGs is, for the most part, related to growth, short of stopping growth
in its tracks, policies that reduce energy consumption and fuel usage can also have a positive
effect. In addition to promoting development patterns that will reduce the vehicles miles
traveled per capita, there are a variety of other actions that cities and counties can take to
reduce energy consumption even as they grow. The City is in the process of purchasing
electric and hybrid vehicles, as well as analyzing the possibilities for energy retrofits and
adding solar power to City buildings and facilities.

warming, GHG emissions, and other sustainability goals outlined as eight global warming

IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
COS-I-38 Compile and update an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from City
         operations and track related solid waste, energy, economic, and environmental
         data.
COS-I-39 Support State efforts to reduce greenhouse gases and emissions through local
         action that will reduce motor vehicle use, support alternative forms of
         transportation, require energy conservation in new construction, and energy
         management in public buildings.
         By proposing compact development, mixed use centers, walkable neighborhoods,
         green building technology, and jobs-housing balance, the City will be helping to
         implement many of the strategies and programs in the San Joaquin Valley 2007
         Ozone Plan.
COS-I-40 Prepare a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Plan, focusing on feasible
         actions the City can take to minimize the adverse impacts of Plan
         implementation on climate change and air quality. The Plan will include but will
         not be limited to:
         x   An inventory of all known, or reasonably discoverable, sources of green-
             house gases (GHGs) that currently exist in the City and sources that existed
             in 1990. In determining what is a source of GHG emissions, the City may
             rely on the definition of “greenhouse gas emissions source” or “source” as
             defined in Section 38505 of the California Global Warming Solutions Act
             (“AB 32”) or its governing regulations. The inventory may include estimates
             of emissions drawing on available information from to state and regional air
             quality boards, supplemented by information obtained by the City.
         x   A projected inventory of the new GHGs that can reasonably be expected to
             be emitted in the year 2030 due to the City’s discretionary land use decisions
             pursuant to the 2030 General Plan Update, as well as new GHGs emitted by
             the City’s internal government operations. The projected inventories will
             include estimates, supported by substantial evidence, of future emissions
             from planned land use and information from state and regional air quality
             boards and agencies.
         x   A target for the reduction of those sources of future emissions reasonably
             attributable to the City’s discretionary land use decisions under the 2030
             General Plan and the City’s internal government operations, and feasible
             GHG emission reduction measures whose purpose shall be to meet this
             reduction target by regulating those sources of GHG emissions reasonably
             attributable to the City’s discretionary land use decisions and the City’s
             internal government operations.
         The General Plan includes a comprehensive set of policies that will support the GHG
         Emission Reduction Plan. See Table 7.10 for a cross-reference of these policies.

                 roads carrying 50,000 vehicles per day.
            x    1,000 feet of a distribution center (that accommodates more than 100 trucks
                 a day, more than 40 trucks with operating transport refrigeration units
                 (TRUs) a day, or where TRU operation exceeds 300 hours per week).
            x    300 feet of any dry cleaning operation that uses toxic chemicals. For

                 million gallons or more per year).
COS-I-42    Conforming to the SJVAPCD Fugitive Dust Rule, require developers to use best
            management practices (BMPs) to reduce particulate emission as a condition of
            approval for subdivision maps, site plans and all grading permits. BMPs include:
            x    During clearing, grading, earth-moving or excavation operations, fugitive
                 dust emissions shall be controlled by regular watering, paving of
                 construction roads, or other dust-preventive measures;
            x    All materials excavated or graded shall be either sufficiently watered or
                 covered by canvas or plastic sheeting to prevent excessive amounts of dust;
            x    All materials transported off-site shall be either sufficiently watered or
                 covered by canvas or plastic sheeting to prevent excessive amounts of dust;
            x    All motorized vehicles shall have their tires watered before exiting a
                 construction site;
            x    The area disturbed by demolition, clearing, grading, earth-moving, or
                 excavation shall be minimized at all times; and
            x    All construction-related equipment shall be maintained in good working
                 order to reduce exhaust.
COS-I-43    Enact a wood-burning ordinance compliant with District Rule 4901 that:
            x    Regulates the installation of EPA-certified wood heaters or approved wood-
                 burning appliances in new developments or replacements;
            x    Lists permitted and prohibited fuels; and
            x    Describes a “No Burn” policy on days when the air quality is poor.
COS-I-44    Seek grant funding for a “change-out” program to help homeowners replace old
            word-burning fireplaces with EPA-certified wood-burning appliances.
            Smoke released from fireplaces and wood stoves contains carbon monoxide, nitrogen
            dioxide, volatile organic compounds, and inhalable particulate matter (PM-10).
            The changeout programs have been successful in areas of the State where emissions
            from wood-burning fireplaces cause significant air pollution. Many grant programs
            offer cash rebates to encourage replacement of old wood-burning appliances with
            more efficient ones.

COS-I-45      Utilize more plants and trees in public area landscaping, focusing on those that
              are documented as more efficient pollutant absorbers.
COS-I-46      Establish a Clean Air Awards Program to acknowledge outstanding effort and to
              educate the public about the linkages between land use, transportation and air
              quality.
COS-I-47      Coordinate air quality planning efforts and CEQA review of discretionary
              projects with potential for causing adverse air quality impacts with other local,
              regional and State agencies.
              The City will work with the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District on
              parallel initiatives for air quality, so programs are complementary and uniform
              wherever possible.
COS-I-48      Educate employees and department managers about sustainability with a focus
              on specific operational changes that can be made to reduce greenhouse gas
              emissions, such as fuel efficient driving and reducing energy use at work.
COS-I-49      Require tenants of all new development within one mile of industrial land uses
              to record odor easements attesting to the presence of nearby industry and
              acknowledging the right of said industry to emit odors that are not a threat to
              human health.

8 Safety and Noise
The purpose of the Safety and Noise Element is to identify the natural and man-made public
and safety hazards that exist within the city, and to establish policies and programs to
mitigate their potential impacts through both preventative and responsive measures. This
Element addresses seismic hazards, wildfire hazards, drainage and flood control, hazardous
materials, health and safety services, and the community noise environment.
8.1      SEISMIC AND GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
GEOLOGY
The Lemoore Planning Area lies just east of the trough of California’s Central Valley. The
Central Valley stretches 500 miles in a northwest to southeast direction and averages about
40 miles in width between the Coast Ranges in the west and the Sierra Nevada in the east.
The whole region is characterized by flat-lying sedimentary rocks overlain by alluvial soils
up to 200 feet deep near the Sacramento River.
EROSION
Soil erosion is a process whereby soil materials are worn away and transported to another
area, either by wind or water. Rates of erosion can vary depending on the soil material and
structure, placement, and human activity. Soil containing high amounts of silt can be easily
eroded, while sandy soils are less susceptible. Excessive soil erosion can eventually damage
building foundations and roadways. Erosion is most likely to occur on sloped areas with
exposed soil, especially where unnatural slopes are created by cut-and-fill activities. Soil
erosion rates can be higher during the construction phase. Typically, the soil erosion potential
is reduced once the soil is graded and covered with concrete, structures, or asphalt.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
SUBSIDENCE
Subsidence is the gradual settling or sinking of the earth’s surface with little or no horizontal
motion. Subsidence typically occurs in areas that overlie an aquifer where the groundwater
level is gradually and consistently decreasing. Additionally, subsidence may also occur in the
presence of oil or natural gas extraction. Areas of substantial subsidence occur on the west
side of the Kings River, outside the Planning Area, and predominately relate to groundwater
withdrawal.
EXPANSIVE SOILS
Expansive soils possess a “shrink-swell” characteristic. Shrink-swell is the cyclic change in
volume (expansion and contraction) that occurs in fine-grained clay sediments from the
process of wetting and drying. Structural damage may occur over a long period of time,
usually the result of inadequate soil and foundation engineering, or the placement of
structures directly on expansive soils. Several portions of the Planning Area have soil with
high to moderate shrink-swell potential.
These soils suitability issues are described in more detail in Chapter 7 and the accompanying
Figure 7-2.
FAULT ZONES AND GROUND SHAKING
There are no known active seismic faults in Kings County or its immediate vicinity. Beyond
surface rupture along the fault zone, potential hazards related to major earthquakes include
ground shaking and related secondary ground failures. The principle earthquake hazard

fault situated about 8 miles northwest of Coalinga. Surface rupture occurred along this fault
in the 1983 Coalinga earthquakes, which had a magnitude of 6.7. This was followed by
another earthquake with magnitude of 6.0 in 1985. The location of this fault however, is far
away from Lemoore and aftershocks during both earthquakes did not cause any damage.
Secondary natural hazards associated with earthquakes result from the interaction of ground
shaking with existing ground instabilities, and include liquefaction, settlement or subsidence,
landslides and seiches. While some of these secondary hazards are a concern to other parts of
Kings County and the 5-County Seismic Study region, none are considered of particular
concern to the Lemoore Planning Area because of its distance from the major regional fault
(San Andreas Fault), the lack of steep slopes, and the clay composition of area soils.

RESPONSE OF STRUCTURES TO EARTHQUAKES
Existing structures in the Planning Area could be affected by the earthquake-induced ground
shaking described above, but to varying degrees based on length, intensity, and distance of
the earthquake from a given building. New structures are required to adhere to current
California Uniform Building Code (CUBC) standards, providing adequate design,
construction and maintenance of structures to prevent exposure of people and structures to
major geologic hazards. In particular, any critical facilities such as hospitals, fire and police
stations, and emergency communications and operations centers must be adequately
designed, constructed and maintained with the goal of remaining functional after a large
seismic event. The use of flexible utility connections, building anchors, and adequately
reinforced concrete can reduce the loss of life and damage to buildings for human occupancy.
The requirements of Zone II of the Uniform Building Code are considered adequate for
normal facilities in the Lemoore Planning Area.

             poles and utility equipment at sub-stations.
SN-I-6       Control erosion of graded areas with vegetation or other acceptable methods.
             Plant materials should not be limited to hydro seeding and mulching with annual
             grasses. Trees add structure to the soil and take up moisture while adding color
             and diversity.
SN-I-7       Establish location standards and inspection requirements for above-ground

             Above ground storage tanks (AST) include storage of water, agriculture products,
             petroleum, or other materials. These tanks must be located at an appropriate
             distance from residential areas, and inspected annually, to ensure compliance
             with appropriate State and federal codes.
8.2     FLOOD CONTROL
FLOOD ZONES
The 100-year and 500-year floodplains for the Lemoore Planning Area are delineated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Flood Insurance Rate Maps. A total of 14 percent
of the Planning Area (1,710 acres) is located within the 100-year flood plain and 6 percent is
located in the 500-year flood plain (764 acres). Within the Urban Growth Boundary, 6
percent (448 acres) is located within the 100-year flood plain. These floodplains are largely
located in the western portion of the Planning Area near the wetlands and the westside
industrial park. The majority of the Planning Area (80 percent) is located outside of these two
floodplains. (The City has applied for an amendment to the current FEMA floodplain maps.
The City will amend the General Plan maps after approval is received.)
The Kings River, which is the primary source of irrigation water for the Planning Area, is
regulated by the Pine Flat Dam, located east of Fresno. A Flood Inundation Analysis
performed for Pine Flat Dam by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers indicates the potential
effects of dam failure on the downstream floodplain covers the entire Planning Area. The
extremely low probability of the occurrence of dam failure, large volume of flood water
available for dilution of potential pollutants, and the relatively long warning period to ready
the dairy sites for flooding indicate that inundation related to dam failure would not be a
significant impact on growth and development in and around Lemoore.

GUIDING POLICIES
SN-G-2         Protect the community from risks to lives and property posed by flooding and
               stormwater runoff.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
SN-I-8         Require all new development within a flood zone to comply with the City’s Flood
               Damage Prevention Ordinance.
SN-I-9         Identify and remedy deficiencies in the existing storm drainage infrastructure in
               partnership with regional and federal agencies.
               Minor flooding currently occurs on Cedar Lane east of 19th Avenue, East D Street
               east of Lemoore Avenue, and areas north of Hanford Armona Road. The City will
               continually plan for and upgrade storm drainage facilities to meet future
               drainage needs in cooperation with the Lemoore Canal and Irrigation Company,
               California Department of Transportation, and other regional and federal
               agencies.
SN-I-10        Require new development to prepare hydrologic studies and implement
               appropriate mitigation measures to minimize surface water run-off and reduce the
               risk of flooding.
               Developers will be required to provide an assessment of a project’s potential
               impacts on the local storm drainage system as part of the development review
               process. If development is found to have a negative impact on storm drainage,
               mitigation measures such as the creation of permanent or temporary detention or
               retention basins, provision of additional landscaped areas, installation of pump
               stations, and the use of permeable paving in driveways and parking areas, may
               be required.
SN-I-11        Require developers to provide for the ongoing maintenance of detention basins.
               Maintenance may be by the City under contract or by a private entity. If wetlands
               are affected, maintenance of detention basins will include mitigation monitoring
               in compliance with regulatory requirements.

SN-I-12       Ensure City staff and its Emergency Response Services receive early warning of
              a catastrophic failure of Pine Flat Dam, and are trained to respond to this
              emergency and receive formal training in an Emergency Operation Center.
              The early warning and training system will include coordination and
              communication with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
8.3       WILDLAND FIRE HAZARDS
Fire hazard potential is largely dependent on the extent and type of vegetation, known as
surface fuels, that exists within a region. Fire hazards are typically highest in heavily
wooded, undeveloped areas as trees are a greater source of fuel than low-lying brush or
grassland. Suburban, urban areas or rocky barren areas have minimal surface fuels and
therefore typically have the lowest fire hazard. Wildfire hazard data for the Lemoore
Planning Area is provided by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, as
illustrated in Figure 8-2 and summarized in Table 8.1. The majority of the Planning Area is
considered to have either little or no threat or a moderate threat of wildfire. Only one percent
of the Planning Area currently has a high threat of wildfire. Wildfire hazard present in the
Planning Area should decrease as vacant parcels become developed. Although not identified
on the map, the City does experience frequent fire problems along the railroad, as they tend
to not take proper care of their weed abatement.

SN-I-17       Update news media and City residents on current wildfire threat levels during
              drought periods.
8.4      HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
A material is considered hazardous if it appears on a list of hazardous materials prepared by a
federal, state, or local agency, or if it has characteristics defined as hazardous by such an agency.
The California Code of Regulation (CCR) defines a hazardous material as a substance that,
because of physical or chemical properties, quantity, concentration, or other characteristics, may
either (1) cause an increase in mortality or an increase in serious, irreversible, or incapacitating,
illness or (2) pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or environment when
improperly treated, stored, transported or disposed of, or otherwise managed (CCR, Title 22,
Division 4.5, Chapter 10, Article 2, Section 66260.10). Hazardous materials have been and are
commonly used in commercial, agricultural, and industrial applications and, to a limited
extent, in residential areas.
Hazardous wastes are defined in the same manner. Hazardous wastes are hazardous materials
that no longer have practical use, such as substances that have been discarded, discharged,
spilled, contaminated, or are being stored prior to proper disposal. Hazardous materials and
hazardous wastes are classified according to four properties: toxic (causes human health
effects), ignitable (has the ability to burn), corrosive (causes severe burns or damage to
materials), and reactive (causes explosions or generates toxic gases) (CCR, Title 22, Chapter
11, Article 3).
Areas where historic or on-going activities have resulted in the known or suspected release of
hazardous materials to soil and groundwater or to the air, as identified by the Central Valley
Regional Water Quality Control Board and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.
EPA), are shown in Figure 8-2. These sites are designated as either, Leaking Underground
Fuel Tanks (LUFT) sites, SLIC (Spills, Leaks, Investigations, and Cleanups) sites, which are
non-fuel contamination sites, Toxic Release sites, and Air Emissions. Most of the
contaminated sites within the Planning Area are largely associated with leaking underground
storage tanks and are predominately clustered around the City’s railroad tracks, between 19th
Avenue and Lemoore Avenue. LUFT sites are predominately associated with retail and
commercial uses (e.g., gas stations, convenience stores, car washes, etc.) while additional
sites are associated with local industrial and agricultural uses. In 2007, there are 13 LUFT
sites, one SLIC site, and two Toxic Release sites within the Planning Area. A complete list of
hazardous materials sites and handlers is included in Appendix B.

Although not included on the map or as a listed hazardous site, hazardous materials have
potential to exist at the old jet bowl, located north of Iona and east of the golf course parking
lot, as well at the fueling distribution site, located off Lemoore south of the railroad tracks
and wrecking yards located on 19 ½ Avenue and Iona Avenue. The potential also exists for
agricultural chemical residues to be present in shallow soils within the Planning Area. In
addition, the San Joaquin Valley Railroad line extends through the central portion of the
Planning Area. Railroad rights-of-way typically have surface contamination due to the
lubricating oil used on the wheels and the use of herbicides to help minimize weeds within
these areas.
Currently, there are no hazardous wastes landfill sites within Lemoore. The Kings Waste &
Recycling Authority maintains a permanent Household Hazardous Waste facility in the City
of Hanford. Lemoore residents can make use of this facility through free household
hazardous waste disposal services available at collection sites in the City. The City collects e-
waste, battery, and used oil for disposal.
GUIDING POLICIES
SN-G-4       Protect Lemoore’s ecology and residents from harm resulting from the improper
             production, use, storage, disposal, or transportation of hazardous materials.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
SN-I-18      Prohibit locating of businesses or expansion of businesses meeting federal
             Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) reporting
             requirements within a quarter mile of schools, hospitals, and residential
             neighborhoods.
             This policy applies to all facilities that qualify for hazardous chemical storage
             reporting requirements under EPCRA Sections 311 and 312. Where the location
             or expansion of such facilities within a quarter mile of these uses cannot be
             feasibly avoided, effective planning, notification, and mitigation measures will be
             implemented.
SN-I-19      Require remediation and cleanup of sites contaminated with hazardous
             substances.
             The level of remediation and cleanup will be determined by the City based on the
             intended use and health risk to the public. At the minimum, remediation will be in
             compliance with federal and State standards. Clean-up shall be required in
             conjunction with new development, reconstruction, property transfer of
             ownership, and/or continued operation after the discovery of contamination.
SN-I-20      Coordinate enforcement of the Hazardous Material Disclosure Program with the
             Kings County Health Department to identify facilities producing, utilizing, or
             storing hazardous wastes.
             State and Federal legislation requires every business that handles hazardous
             materials report their inventories to the local fire department. The program's primary

              function is to identify, monitor, and assist businesses using or storing hazardous
              materials and allow the City to handle emergency incidents more effectively. The City
              will maintain and share this information with police, fire, and emergency services.
SN-I-21       Promote the reduction, recycling and safe disposal of household and business
              hazardous wastes through public education and awareness.
              The City will: 1) Educate the public on the types of household and business
              hazardous wastes and their proper disposal methods, 2) Provide information on
              the Kings Waste and Recycling Authority collection programs, including drop-off
              points and collection dates, and 3) Encourage citizen reporting of unlawful
              dumping activity. The City currently handles e-waste and battery and oil
              recycling.
8.5      SAFETY SERVICES
POLICE SERVICES
Housed at 657 Fox Street on the northwest corner of Fox Street and Cinnamon Drive, the
Lemoore Police Department provides police services for the City. The Police Department has
a staff of 31 sworn peace officers and 7 civilian staff members. There are 30 vehicles
assigned to the Department. The location of the police station is illustrated in Figure 8-2.
                                                          The Police Department currently operates
                                                          at a ratio of 1.33 officers per thousand
                                                          residents, which is lower than the western

As the City grows, the Police Department faces the dual challenges of maintaining smooth
traffic flow and ensuring the safety of Lemoore citizens. It will be important for the City of
Lemoore to consider projected growth and geographic distribution of population as presented
in the General Plan when allocating resources to the Police Department and negotiating
locations for new facilities.
Police Programs
The Lemoore Citizens' Police Academy started in March 1997 gives members of the
community a better understanding of the criminal justice system. The Citizens' Academy has
been tailored to the philosophy of community policing embraced by members of the Lemoore
Police Department. The Department’s goal is to provide 2 sessions of the Citizen's Police
Academies a year.
In October 1997, the Department started the Volunteers in Policing Program, where
graduates of the Citizens' Academy volunteer hours to make patrol checks, handle clerical
work, work radar, finger print and other miscellaneous tasks as required. The Volunteers in
Policing donated 5,092 hours of volunteer time during 2006 to their community. This brings
the total number of hours donated by members of the Volunteers in Policing to 38,349 hours
since the start of the program.
FIRE AND LIFE SAFETY SERVICES
The Lemoore Volunteer Fire Department (LVFD) has operated as an all volunteer
department since 1921. The LVFD includes one Chief, two Assistant Chiefs, four Crew
Captains, seven Engineers, eleven Emergency Medical Technicians, one paid part-time
Secretary, and one paid full-time maintenance worker. The department covers an area of
approximately nine square miles, with Mutual Aid Agreements with Kings County Fire,
Hanford City Fire and the Naval Air Station Lemoore. Other public services provided include
fire inspections, tours and demonstrations, permitting of certain hazardous materials, and
investigation of hazardous materials incidents. The Fire Department regulates explosive and
hazardous materials under the Uniform Fire Code, and permits the handling, storage and use
of any explosive or other hazardous material.

In 1997 the City earned its Insurance Service
Office’s (ISO) rating of 3, on a scale of 1 to
10 with 1 being the best rating. The City
currently has a ratio of 1.5 firefighters per
thousand residents. Future staffing required
to maintain current the ratio is depicted in
Table 8.4. Existing fire response times
average between 4 and 6 minutes. The

2030 Lemoore General Plan
County fire stations are illustrated in Figure 8-2. As the City develops on the westside, the
Fire Department estimates that an additional station, equipment, and personnel will need to
be added in order to maintain the current ISO rating and response times. If fire response
service improvements do not keep pace with growth, response time will increase, fire losses
will increase, insurance rates will increase, and citizens’ safety will be in jeopardy. It will be
important for the City of Lemoore to consider projected growth and geographic distribution
of population as presented in the General Plan when allocating resources to the Fire
Department and negotiating locations for new facilities, in particular on the west side of the
City.
EMERGENCY RESPONSE
The California Emergencies Services Act (State Government Code Section 8550-8668)
requires each city to prepare and maintain an Emergency Plan for natural, manmade, or war-
caused emergencies that result in conditions of disaster or in extreme peril to life. The City of
Lemoore published an Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) in 2005. The City’s EOP provides
guidance to City staff in the event of extraordinary emergency situation associated with natural
disaster and technological incidents. The EOP concentrates on operation concepts and response
procedures relative to large-scale disasters. In the event of a county-wide disaster, the City is to
assume its role assigned in the Kings County EOP.
GUIDING POLICIES
SN-G-5      Maintain and enhance the City’s capacity for law enforcement, fire-fighting and
            emergency response.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
SN-I-22     Assess the manpower, facility, and equipment needs of Police and Fire services at
            least every three years in order to provide all residents with an optimal level of
            protection.
            To meet existing and future demand, the City will continue to plan for adequate
            law enforcement and fire-fighting services and ensure their staffing ratios and
            response time meet national standards. The requirements for additional Police
            and Fire Stations shall be considered in Capital Improvement Program budgets
            and development impact fees.
SN-I-23     Support public education programs involving crime prevention, fire protection
            and safety issues.
            Currently, Lemoore’s Police Department has a number of outreach and training
            programs in place. These include the Neighborhood Watch, Are you ok?
            Explorers, Volunteers in Policing, Secret Witness, D.A.R.E., and Citizens’
            Academy programs, as well as County-wide Narcotics and Gang task forces. The
            Volunteer Fire Department also has public education programs. The City will
            support these and future efforts by these departments involving crime prevention,
            fire protection and safety issues. Additionally, the City will encourage residents
            to prepare a 72 hour emergency kit as part of its public education initiative.

Law Enforcement
SN-I-24     Develop an additional police station with improved access to parts of Lemoore
            west of SR-41 and parts south of SR-198, when necessary to maintain
            performance and response standards.
SN-I-25     Maintain mutual aid agreements with Kings County, Naval Air Station Lemoore,
            neighboring law enforcement agencies and the California Highway Patrol.
SN-I-26     Collaborate, and exchange information with other local, state and federal
            agencies and with utility service providers in activities related to terrorism
            prevention and response.
Fire-Fighting
SN-I-27     Maintain Fire Department performance and response standards at Class 3 ISO
            rating or better, including building and staffing a new fire station in West
            Lemoore if necessary.
SN-I-28     Require adequate access for emergency vehicles in all new development,
            including adequate widths, turning radii, and vertical clearance on new streets.
            The street cross-sections in the General Plan are consistent with this policy.
SN-I-29     Require sprinklers in buildings exceeding 5,000 square feet and all mixed use
            development to protect residential uses from non-residential uses, which typically
            pose a higher fire risk.
            Appropriate fire protection measures are necessary in mixed use developments,
            since residential units are typically in close proximity to higher fire load
            occupancies, such as retail stores, restaurants, etc.
SN-I-30     Maintain mutual aid agreements with Kings County, California Department of
            Forestry, Naval Air Station Lemoore, and nearby cities for fire and disaster
            services.
            Additional policies in the Land Use Element will ensure that new development
            finances additional public safety facilities as necessary to mitigate its own
            impacts.
8.6     NOISE
The purpose of this section is to identify the noise sources that exist within the City, and to
establish policies and programs to mitigate their potential impacts through both preventive
and responsive measures. This section has a direct relationship with the land use, circulation,
and housing elements. A thorough understanding of the noise characteristics of the
                                              8-15
2030 Lemoore General Plan
transportation system as well as the noise sensitivity of certain land uses will allow Lemoore
citizens and officials to make smart decisions to prevent noise annoyance before it occurs.
NOISE CHARACTERISTICS AND MEASUREMENT
Noises vary widely in their scope, source, and volume, ranging from individual occurrences
such as a leaf blower or holiday firecrackers, to regular though intermittent disturbance by
aircraft flying overhead, or an infrequent train going through town, to the fairly constant
noise generated by traffic on large highways or freeways. Noise is primarily a concern with
regard to noise–sensitive land uses such as residences, schools, churches, and hospitals.
Noise Measurement
Noise is commonly defined as any undesirable or unwanted sound. Three aspects of noise are
used in assessing the community noise environment:
•    Level (e.g., magnitude or loudness) of sound. Sound levels are measured and expressed in
     decibels (dB) with 10 dB roughly equal to the threshold of hearing. Figure 8-1 shows the
     decibel levels associated with different common sounds.
•    Frequency composition or spectrum of the sound. Frequency is a measure of the pressure
     fluctuations per second, measured in units of hertz (Hz). The characterization of sound
     level magnitude with respect to frequency is the sound spectrum, often described in
     octave bands, which divides the audible human frequency range (e.g., from 20 to 20,000
     Hz) into ten segments.
•    Variation in sound level with time, measured as noise exposure. Most community noise
     is produced by many distant noise sources that change gradually throughout the day and
     produce a relatively steady background noise with no identifiable source. Identifiable
     events of brief duration, such as aircraft flyovers, cause the community noise level to
     vary from instant to instant. A single number called the equivalent sound level or Leq
     describes the average noise exposure level over a period of time. Transient noise events
     may be described by their maximum A-weighted noise level (dBA). Hourly Leq values
     are called Hourly Noise Levels.
Reporting Noise Levels
Measuring and reporting noise levels involves accounting for variations in sensitivity to noise
during the daytime versus nighttime hours. Noise descriptors used for analysis need to
account for human sensitivity to nighttime noise; background noise levels are generally lower
than in the daytime and outside noise intrusions are more noticeable. Common descriptors
include the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and the Day-Night Average Level
(DNL). Both reflect noise exposure over an average day with weighting to reflect the
increased sensitivity to noise during the evening and night. The two descriptors are roughly
equivalent. The CNEL descriptor is used in relation to major continuous noise sources, such
as aircraft or traffic, and is the reference level for the Noise Element.
Knowledge of the following relationships is helpful in understanding how changes in noise
and noise exposure are perceived:
•    Except under special conditions, a change in sound level of 1 dB cannot be perceived;
•    A 3 dB change is considered a just-noticeable difference;
                                                 8-16

                                                                    Chapter 8: Safety and Noise
•   A 5 dB change is required before any noticeable change in community response would be
    expected. A 5 dB increase is often considered a significant impact; and
•   A 10 dB increase is subjectively heard as an approximate doubling in loudness and al-
    most always causes an adverse community response.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
Criteria for Significance
The following noise exposure criteria will be used to evaluate proposed residential and
mixed-use development within the City of Lemoore:
•     The California Building Code requires that habitable rooms in multi-family dwellings
      with an exterior DNL or CNEL noise exposure above 60 dB receive an acoustical
      analysis to ensure a maximum interior noise level of 45 dB1;
•     State and federal agencies set the 65 db exterior CNEL noise exposure as the maximum
      normally acceptable level above which residential uses may be incompatible if not
      acoustically treated2;
•     The State Office of Noise Control in coordination with the Governor’s Office of Planning
      and Research has published guidelines showing residential noise compatibility
      “Conditionally Acceptable” in areas of DNL or CNEL noise exposure between 55 dB and
      70 dB, and “Normally Unacceptable” in areas between 70 dB and 75 dB3; and
•     The Navy’s Air Installations Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ) land use compatibility
      guidelines for aircraft noise zones state that residential uses are not compatible and
      should be “discouraged in areas of DNL or CNEL noise exposure in DNL 65-69 and
      strongly discouraged in DNL 70-74”4. The Navy’s instructions for AICUZ studies, such
      as are currently being undertaken by NAS Lemoore, go on to state that:
      “The absence of viable alternative development options should be determined and an
      evaluation should be conducted locally prior to local approvals indicating that a
      demonstrated community need for the residential use would not be met if development
      were prohibited in these Zones. Where the community determines that these uses must be
      allowed, measures to achieve an outdoor to indoor Noise Level Reduction (NLR) of at
      least 25 dB in DNL 65-69 and NLR of 30 dB in DNL 70-74 should be incorporated into
      building codes and be in individual approvals; for transient housing a NLR of at least 35
      dB should be incorporated in DNL 75-79. Normal permanent construction can be
      expected to provide a NLR of 20 dB, thus the reduction requirements are often stated as
      5, 10 or 15 dB over standard construction and normally assume mechanical ventilation,
      upgraded Sound Transmission Class (STC) ratings in windows and doors and closed
      windows year round. Additional consideration should be given to modifying NLR levels
      based on peak noise levels and vibrations”5.

NOISE GENERATION IN LEMOORE
The major noise sources in Lemoore are related to vehicle traffic on highways and major
arterial roads, and secondarily, aircraft based at the Naval Air Station Lemoore (NAS
Lemoore). Other noise sources include rail transportation, industrial activities, and the
Lemoore Midget Raceway.
Traffic Noise
Traffic noise depends primarily on the speed of traffic and the percentage of truck traffic. The
primary source of noise from automobiles is high frequency tire noise, which increases with
speed. In addition, trucks and older automobiles produce engine and exhaust noise, and
trucks also generate wind noise. While tire noise from cars is generally located at ground
level, truck noise sources can be located as high as ten to fifteen feet above the roadbed due
to tall exhaust stacks and higher engines. Sound walls are not effective for mitigating such
noise unless they are very tall.
Noise exposure contours for Lemoore were modeled by Charles Salter Associates by
applying the Federal Highway Administration’s noise modeling procedure. These noise
contours are conservative, meaning that the contours are modeled with minimal noise
attenuation by natural barriers, buildings, etc. The noise level measured at a specific location
may be lower than what is shown on the noise contour map. An 8 foot tall block masonry
wall constructed along the length of the highway can provide a noise reduction of around 5
dB. Landscaping and trees can also provide an additional degree of shielding and noise
reduction.
Noise from Trains along the San Joaquin Valley Railroad
The San Joaquin Railroad provides east-west train services on land owned by Union Pacific
Railroad on an average of two trips a day. The trains generally travel with speeds ranging
from 10 to 40 miles per hour, depending if they make a stop in Lemoore on that particular
trip. The trains currently stop on-demand only, providing service for industrial and
agricultural shippers in the city. However, there is a possibility of expanding the service to
include passenger rail in the future (for a discussion on this, refer to the Circulation Element).
As trains approaches railroad crossings in the City, they blow their horns to signal their
arrival. The noise generated by a typical diesel operated train (with horn and without horn), at
10 mph with 15 cars is shown in the table below. The corresponding noise contours generated
are shown in Figure 8-4.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
Noise from Industrial Zones
There are two industrial zones in Lemoore with the potential to cause noise hazards. The first
is located south of Iona Avenue along both sides of 19th Avenue, and the second is located
northwest between the San Joaquin Railroad tracks and SR-41. Activities carried out in both
of these areas are primarily related to food processing and light manufacturing. At full
buildout of the General Plan, more industries are expected to locate in both areas, adding to
the number of noise sources.
To minimize noise impacts to surrounding residents, industrial uses are usually separated
from residential areas by a road or other physical element. The amount of noise present will
depend on the type of industrial activity carried out, and is not expected to be as severe as
noise from vehicular traffic or airplanes.
Noise from Lemoore Raceway
The Lemoore Raceway, located at the southwest corner of SR-41 and Idaho Avenue is
another source of noise in the City. The raceway operates on most Saturdays from April
through October from 3:00 p.m. to midnight. The track is a 1/5+ mile semi-banked oval, with
wide corners and straight-aways with a clay racing surface. It accommodates ¼ midget junior
sprints, restrictor plate 600s, stock 600s, and 600 modified winged midget racecars. Engines
range from 100s motorcycle engines to multi-cylinder 4-cycle engines pulling 619 cc's.
Generators are occasionally brought to the site by race crews. During race nights, noise
measurements can range from 80 dB to102 dB when measured 50 feet away from the edge of
the track, and up to 81 dB when measured at 150 feet.6
Due to the infrequency of races and its location amid industrial properties, this use is not
expected to cause noise disturbance to residents.

Aircraft Noise from NAS Lemoore
NAS Lemoore, located just west of the City, is a valued asset to the community, providing
numerous jobs for City residents. However, one of the principal concerns of airport land use
planning is noise compatibility–or minimizing the effects of aircraft noise on communities
adjacent to airports and preventing incompatible land use development in areas adjacent to
airports.
Noise modeling was completed in February of 2007 in order to determine the likely noise
impact of aircraft flying over West Lemoore. Aircraft operations at NAS Lemoore are
typically F-18 aircraft flying 1,500-feet above ground level in a ‘Radar’ landing pattern near
the west side of the City. The predicted noise exposure is related to land use noise
compatibility criteria, community response criteria, and sleep interference criteria that are
normally used in community land use planning. The two cases modeled yielded similar noise
exposure results for residents of the prospective residential and mixed use development, and
for students and faculty at the college. The projected noise levels are significantly higher than
the exterior noise level standards for single family development and multi-family residential
development set in the current General Plan. Following is a summary of the noise exposure
and response results for the two cases for a 26,000 foot wide cross section beneath the flight
tracks:
•     DNL7 or CNEL8: 51 dB – 70 dB
•     Maximum exterior Single Event Levels9 (SEL values): 93 dB – 106 dB
•     Maximum exterior sound pressure levels: 86 dB – 99 dB.
•     Predicted percentage of population highly annoyed: 3 percent - 23 percent
•     Predicted percentage of population awakened (ANSI criteria10) by each flyover in a well-
      noise-insulated home: 2 – 4 percent
A follow-up noise monitoring study was completed in April of 2007 in order to provide
“hard” data to compare against the modeling predictions. Noise measurements were taken in
locations at Liberty School, Lemoore Elementary School, Meadow Lane School and the
Lemoore Golf Course. This study found the present single event noise levels in various
locations in the City east of Highway 41 to be 10-15 dBA lower than modeling calculations
for West Lemoore. Looking ahead, one of the objectives of the new General Plan will be to
support a land use pattern that maintains compatibility and livability between the air station
and City residents and visitors; particularly as the future is expected to bring troops home
from Iraq and with them increased frequency of flyover activities.

2030 Lemoore General Plan
    Aircrafts from the Naval Air Station Lemoore are a major source of noise in Lemoore.
NAS Lemoore is very concerned about the City growing closer to their facility due to the
potential noise conflicts their future aircraft might cause and, as noted previously is preparing
an AICUZ study, which is currently scheduled to be completed in mid-2008. The urban
expansion westwards, however, is unavoidable given the City’s desire to preserve farmland
in the north and east and to support the West Hills College with compatible land use. To
minimize noise conflicts, the City has taken steps to ensure appropriate noise mitigation
measures are in place before allowing development, including measures such as the noise
level reduction (NLR) criteria in AICUZ instructions11. The UGB stops development at 21st
Avenue, and in addition to UGB restrictions, the recreated wetlands located west of the 21st
Avenue/Marsh Drive will help provide a permanent buffer between the City and the base.
PROJECTED CONDITIONS UNDER GENERAL PLAN BUILDOUT
Higher traffic volumes, more industrial and commercial noise sources, and a larger
population will all contribute to the noise environment in Lemoore by 2030. In additional to
noise generated in Lemoore itself, this Plan anticipates on-going and perhaps increased noise
generated by NAS Lemoore. The General Plan anticipates these trends in traffic, stationary
source, and aircraft noise and supplies policies to actively and efficiently combat these
changes to the noise environment for health, safety, and aesthetic reasons. Future Noise
Contours are provided in Figure 8-4.

GUIDING POLICIES
SN-G-6    Strive to achieve an acceptable noise environment for present and future
          residents of Lemoore.
SN-G-7    Ensure new development is compatible with the noise environment.
SN-G-8    Protect especially sensitive uses from excessive noise, including schools,
          hospitals, and senior care facilities.
SN-G-9    Enforce stricter noise abatement measures for development within the high-noise
          contours from NAS Lemoore.
IMPLEMENTING POLICIES
General Noise Policies
SN-I-31   Enact a Noise Control Ordinance with specific noise measurement standards,
          required noise insulation standards for new residential development exposed to
          aircraft noise and other noise sources, and enforcement procedures.
          The new ordinance will be enacted in the Zoning section of the Municipal Code,
          and will complement the existing Noise Ordinance in the Public Safety section. It
          will be generally oriented toward limiting the generation of noise emissions, but
          may also include provisions for mandatory mitigation actions.
SN-I-32   Use the community noise compatibility standards, shown in Table 8.6, as review
          criteria for new land uses.
          These standards show noise levels that are “normally acceptable”,
          “conditionally acceptable”, “normally unacceptable”, and “clearly
          unacceptable” for different types of land use. Indoor noise level reductions (NLR)
          exceeding minimum standards for NLR in the Navy’s AICUZ instructions will be
          required for any new residential development in areas where the CNEL will
          exceed 65 dBA; see Policy SB-I-35. SN-I-36, SN-I-37 and SN-I-38.
SN-I-33   Consider an increase of five or more dBA to be “significant” if the resulting noise
          level would exceed that described as “normally acceptable” in Table 8.6.
SN-I-34   Apply performance-based noise standards within zoning classifications likely to
          encompass sensitive land uses.
          Performance-based standards have the benefit of flexibility in that they do not
          attempt to regulate precisely what uses may locate in the particular zone, but
          rather what sort of noise environment those uses produce. Performance-based
          standards can work well with community noise compatibility criteria such as
          those listed in Table 8.6.

                     Normally      Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any building
                     Acceptable    involved is of normal conventional construction, without any special noise insulation
                                   requirements.
                     Conditionally New construction or development should be undertaken only after a detailed
                     Acceptable    analysis of the noise reduction requirements is made and needed noise insulation
                                   features included in the design. Conventional construction, but with closed windows
                                   and fresh air supply systems or air conditioning will normally suffice.
                     Normally      New construction or development should generally be discouraged. If new
                     Unacceptable  construction or development does proceed, a detailed analysis of the noise
                                   reduction requirements must be made and needed noise insulation features
                                   included in the design.
                     Clearly       New construction or development should not be undertaken.

Residential Development
SN-I-35       Require that all new residential development achieve noise level reductions to
              meet the land use compatibility standards through acoustical design and
              construction of the building elements:
              •    Residential building designs must be based upon a minimum interior design
                   noise level reduction of 40 dB in all habitable areas (i.e., garages, storage
                   areas, etc. are excepted). The 40 dB criteria must provide a minimum
                   constructed noise level reduction of 35 dB; and
              •    Residential building designs must also be based upon a minimum design
                   noise level reduction of 45 dB in all bedrooms. The 45 dB criteria must
                   provide a minimum constructed noise level reduction of 40 dB.
SN-I-36       Establish standards for the basic elements of noise reduction design for new
              dwellings exposed to DNL above 65 dB (anticipated for areas west of SR-41),
              including the following:
              •    All facades must be constructed with substantial weight and insulation;
              •    Sound-rated windows providing noise reduction performance similar to that
                   of the façade must be included for habitable rooms;
              •    Sound-rated doors or storm doors providing noise reduction performance
                   similar to that of the façade must be included for all exterior entries;
              •    Acoustic baffling of vents is required for chimneys, fans and gable ends;
              •    Installation of a mechanical ventilation system affording comfort under
                   closed-window conditions is required; and
              •    To meet the highest noise level reduction requirements it will likely be
                   necessary to use double-stud construction, double doors, and heavy roofs with
                   ceilings of two layers of gypsum board on resilient channels.
              Alternative acoustical designs that achieve the prescribed noise level reduction in
              Policy SN-I-35 may be approved if a Board Certified Acoustical Engineer
              submits information demonstrating that the required reductions can be achieved
              and maintained.
SN-I-37       Prohibit construction materials and methods that do not provide enough noise
              insulation to ensure compliance with compatibility standards, including:
              •    Pre-manufactured housing and mobile homes built with framing less than 2 x
                   4 inches;
                                                  8-27

2030 Lemoore General Plan
          •   Facades using aluminum, vinyl or other exterior siding weighing less than 5
              psf;
          •   Façade construction without insulation;
          •   Flat roofs without an interstitial cavity space or with a space less than 10
              inches (i.e., no monolithic T&G roof/ceiling systems);
          •   Jalousie or other lightweight or poor-sealing window systems; and
          •   Packaged terminal air-conditioning (PTAC) units (i.e., through-the-wall air-
              conditioning).
SN-I-38   Require that all residential building designs, for sites where the CNEL will
          exceed 65dBA, include supporting information for City review and approval
          demonstrating that an acoustical design providing the necessary noise level
          reduction has been prepared by a Board Certified Acoustical Engineer for each
          dwelling unit prior to construction. Elements of this acoustical review process
          shall include:
          •   A letter by a Board Certified Engineer approving the acoustical design of
              each dwelling unit (or group of units, if identical), submitted to the Lemoore
              Building Department with building permit applications. This letter must be
              received and approved prior to the issuance of a building permit;
          •   Following construction, a letter by the Board Certified Engineer showing
              noise level reduction test results for a minimum of two habitable areas within
              each dwelling unit (or group of units, if identical), submitted to the Lemoore
              Building Department for review and approval prior to the issuance of an
              occupancy permit.
          The City will establish noise monitoring procedures and review criteria in the
          Zoning Ordinance. General review and approval of groups of buildings or
          prototype designs may be sufficient to meet these requirements. All acoustical
          engineering and measurement must be conducted under the direction of an
          Acoustical Engineer who is currently Board Certified by the Institute of Noise
          Control Engineering, USA.
SN-I-39   Develop uniform guidelines for acoustical studies based on current professional
          standards in the Noise Control Ordinance.
          Uniform guidelines for the preparation of noise studies will help applicants
          understand City requirements for adequate acoustical evaluations.
SN-I-40   Require developers to mitigate the noise impacts of new development on adjacent
          properties as a condition of permit approval through appropriate means,
          including, but not limited to:
          •   Screen and control noise sources, such as parking and loading facilities,
              outdoor activities, and mechanical equipment;
          •   Increase setbacks for noise sources from adjacent dwellings;
                                            8-28

                                                                    Chapter 8: Safety and Noise
           •   Retain fences, walls, and landscaping that serve as noise buffers;
           •   Use soundproofing materials and double-glazed windows;
           •   Use open space, building orientation and design, landscaping and running
               water to mask sounds;
           •   Control hours of operation, including deliveries and trash pickup, to minimize
               noise impacts; and
           •   As a last resort, construct noise walls along highways and arterials when
               compatible with aesthetic concerns and neighborhood character. This would
               be a developer responsibility.
           Proposed development may introduce new potential noise sources even where,
           from a zoning perspective, it is compatible with existing adjacent uses. An
           example is the handling of large trash bins for multi-family housing. Site design
           and/or screening techniques can help mitigate the resulting noise. Within urban
           residential neighborhoods where medium and high density residential
           development and mixed use development is planned, the City will balance the
           need for noise mitigation with urban design considerations. The construction of
           sound walls will be considered where reducing noise to acceptable levels by
           other means is not feasible.
SN-I-41    Promote the use of noise attenuation measures to improve the acoustic
           environment inside residences where existing single-family residential
           development is located on an arterial street.
           These measures may include those listed under policy SN-I-36.
SN-I-42    Establish criteria for evaluating applications from residents for exceptions to
           residential noise level requirements for the operation of standby electrical
           equipment used to meet medical needs.
           This assumes that equipment noise will be mitigated to reduce the noise level at
           the property line to the 60 decibel level requirement.
SN-I-43    Require new noise sources to use best available control technology (BACT) to
           minimize noise emissions.
SN-I-44    Require noise from permanent mechanical equipment to be reduced by sound-
           proofing materials and sound-deadening installation.
SN-I-45    Minimize vehicular and stationary noise sources and noise emanating from
           temporary activities, such as those arising from construction work.
Aircraft Noise Policies
SN-I-46    Require a noise study and mitigation measures for all new projects that have
           aircraft noise exposure greater than “normally acceptable” levels. Mitigation
           measures may include noise insulation, noise disclosure, buyer beware programs,
           or avigation easements, as shown in Table 8.7.
                                             8-29

2030 Lemoore General Plan
SN-I-47   Coordinate with NAS Lemoore to incorporate their Air Installation Compatible
          Use Zone (AICUZ) study into future updates to the City Zoning Ordinance and
                                        8-30
                                                                               Chapter 8: Safety and Noise
             General Plan to the extent consistent with the City’s compatibility standards and
             noise level reduction requirements.
The boundaries of the Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) are depicted on the
Land Use Diagram.
SN-I-48      Minimize noise impacts of NAS Lemoore flight operations on noise-sensitive
             development.
             NAS Lemoore is a valued element of the Lemoore community. The City will work
             with NAS Lemoore to identify existing sensitive receptors and develop strategies
             for implementing noise mitigation measures such as those suggested for new
             development in Table 8.7.
