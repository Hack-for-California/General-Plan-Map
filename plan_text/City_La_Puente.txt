General Plan Introduction
( .)


Introduction
he City of La Puente has changed dramatically since the 1930's, when the area was famous for fruit and walnut groves. Today, La Puente is a culturally diverse and dynamic community of over 42,000 residents. La Puente combines the characteristics of a community with a firm link to its heritage, broad vision for the future, and a commitment to action. The City offers residents and the business community important cultural, economic, and educational opportunities that continue to define and shape La Puente's "place" in the San Gabriel Valley. The City, community residents, and the business community are committed to implementing a long-range plan that enhances the physical, economic, and human resources of the community. This General Plan has been crafted to achieve these objectives.
Important planning issues facing the City include:
■ What commercial and residential opportunities can be realized in La Puente?
■ How can the City reinforce a unique identity along its commercial corridors?
■	As local and regional growth occurs, what improvements to the local circulation system can be made to ensure smooth and safe travel for residents, employees, and visitors?
■	What tools are appropriate to preserve the character of residential neighborhoods and allow for new housing opportunities?
■	Given limited vacant land resources remaining in the City, what flexible land use regulations can be used to accommodate a range of development types and intensities and enhance the economic viability of its commercial base?
■	What incentives can be used enhance the quality of life in the City's neighborhoods and to attract modern commercial business, including light manufacturing and high technology industries?
The General Plan establishes the framework for moving from the La Puente of today toward the desired community of the future. This Plan guides the City to the year 2025 by establishing goals and policies that address land use, circulation, economic development, and related issues. Each of these issues affects quality of life in La Puente and the economic

health of the community. Incorporating input from residents, City leaders and businesses in La Puente, the General Plan works to retain the qualities that make the City unique, responds to the dynamics of regional growth, and meets changing community needs. Implementation of the General Plan will ensure that future development projects are consistent with the community's goals and that adequate urban services are available to meet the needs of new development.
Community Participation
Because the General Plan reflects the community's goals and objectives, citizen input has contributed significantly to identifying this Plan's issues and goals. Public participation and education in the General Plan preparation process occurred through the following methods.
The City held two community workshops on November 9 and 13, 2002 to allow residents to identify key issues important to La Puente's future. Information collected at each meeting was mapped, tallied, and used to develop a community vision statement and questionnaire to be distributed at subsequent neighborhood meetings.
Following the November workshops, six neighborhood workshops were held throughout La Puente to discuss planning issues affecting residents and businesses. Workshops were held in the following neighborhoods:
■	East La Puente (Hurley Elementary School, January 23, 2002)
* Downtown La Puente (La Puente Women's Club, February 6, 2002)
■	California Ave, Stimson Ave, Cadwell-Larimore-Hayland and 5th Street (Del Haven Community Center, February 20, 2002)
■	Temple/Tonopah Neighborhood (Sunset Wesleyan Christian School, March 6,2003)
■	Hacienda Boulevard (La Puente Senior Center, March 13, 2003)
■	Glendora Avenue and E. Amar Road (Willow Adult School, March 19,2003)
On July 15, 2003, a joint Planning Commission and City Council study session was held to review issues, goals and policies distilled from the community meetings. The meeting was open to public comments and approximately 45 residents were present.
Additional outreach activities included a second Planning Commission and City Council study session, two additional community workshops, and public hearings before the Planning Commission and City Council.

Introduction
La Puente Planning Area

Located 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles in the San Gabriel Valley, the predominantly residential city of La Puente is home to more than 42,000 people. One of the City's strongest assets is location. Freeway access is readily available from Interstate 10 and State Route 60. La Puente is centrally located relative to the region's large employment centers.
State planning law gives a city the authority to undertake long-range planning not just for properties within the corporate limits, but also for lands within the city's sphere of influence. La Puente's sphere of influence encompasses lands outside the City which are not in any other city's jurisdiction and which may influence the decisions and planning activities related to properties within the City. The Planning Area for the General Plan (Figure 1-1) includes all properties within the City limits, as well as properties within La Puente's sphere of influence.
The sphere of influence consists of two areas located north of the City. The first, commonly known as Valinda, is bounded by Francisquito Avenue, Echelon Avenue, and Amar Road. The second - West Puente Valley - is bounded by Puente Avenue, Fairgrove Avenue, and California Avenue. The entire planning area encompasses 2,462 acres, with approximately 1,720 acres within the City's corporate limits and an additional 742 acres within the sphere of influence. Although the City has no plans to incorporate these areas, they bear a critical relationship to La Puente's future planning activities.
History of the Community
In 1769, the Gaspar de Portola expedition, the first European land exploration party in the Los Angeles area, built a bridge (or puente in Spanish) over San Jose Creek while camped nearby. The current City of La Puente is still platted as a part of Rancho La Puente, a portion of Mission San Gabriel, which was established in the 1770s. In 1842, following 72 years of solely Mexican land control and ownership, John Rowland and William Workman were granted preliminary title to Rancho La Puente by the Governor of the Prefect of the Second District of California. By 1850, Rancho La Puente had developed into an almost self-supporting independent community. The Town of Puente was first platted and the map recorded in 1886. During this 36-year period, signs of urbanization began to appear. With the construction of the first railroad through the area in 1875, the Town of Puente took on an urban form while agricultural uses began to dominate other portions of the

large ranches. Centrally located, the Town of Puente was primarily a commercial center for farming implements and related supplies, and provided accompanying social activities and merchant housing.
Orange groves near the Town of Puente in the 1920s.
By the early twentieth century the region was known for an abundance of citrus, walnut, and avocado crops, and maintained its agricultural character while mixed with growing industrial development of oil, banking, and communications through the middle of the twentieth century. After World War II, the region experienced a dramatic building boom that eventually edged out crops in favor of development. Today, the community is largely residential in nature, with commercial land uses located primarily along major highways and streets. Industrial land makes up less than 5 percent of the City's 3.5-squ are-mile land area.
Community Vision
Building upon the City's history, the Community Vision sets the foundation for the entire General Plan. The vision expresses La Puente residents' strongest values for the future and guides development of the community. The following principles convey the community's desires for the future:
La Puente desires to be:
■	A family-oriented community providing a range of public services
■	An attractive community of homes and neighborhoods
■	A community that provides opportunities for businesses to be successful
■	A safe place to live, work, and shop
■	A balanced community that promotes varied housing options
■	A mobile and accessible community

Introduction

These guiding principles are expressed throughout the General Plan elements and will guide all decisions made to implement the General Plan. Working together with civic leaders, community organizations, and residents, we can pursue our common values and enjoy a community that achieves our goals and instills pride. The key community desires that underlie each principle are detailed on the following pages.
Guiding Principle:
A Family-Oriented Community Providing a Range of Public Services
La Puente desires to be a family-oriented community that offers a variety of cultural, recreational, educational, and social activities. The City's Senior Center and libraries will be enhanced and maintained as valuable resources for residents. La Puente Park will provide recreational and community-oriented events for families. The City's Community Center will provide activities for our children and opportunities for volunteer service. Building upon this foundation, La Puente will strive to develop a Youth Learning Activity Center, and explore the possibility of expanding recreational opportunities by providing mini-parks and shared-school facilities, and providing other enriching outlets for our families and youth.
La Puente families enjoying a tot lot.
Guiding Principle:
An Attractive Community of Homes and Neighborhoods
La Puente desires to promote community pride and identity by providing residents with quality living conditions in a community of desirable neighborhoods. A tradition of Puente Pride, combined with City enforcement of property maintenance standards and building codes, will result in clean, attractive homes. Neighborhoods will be maintained, and the City will support the maintenance and provision of infrastructure, landscaped amenities, community services and public facilities. The City will explore the possibility of establishing mini-parks in various

ntro auction
neighborhoods. Working together with City leaders, community organizations, and residents, our efforts will achieve safe and attractive neighborhoods that instill pride and community identity.
Guiding Principle:
A Community that Provides Opportunities for Businesses to be Successful
La Puente desires to offer a diversity of business opportunities in a business-friendly community. Commercial areas will be clean and well-maintained, providing an attractive environment for businesses to succeed. The City will support our business community through programs to repair buildings, encourage the provision of attractive landscaping, create an attractive environment for shoppers and clients, and coordinate marketing efforts. Enhanced business opportunities that generate tax revenues to support community services will be encouraged throughout the City. As the historic center of La Puente, Downtown will continue to provide a diversity of shopping, new housing, and a place for community activities and civic functions. Upgraded shopping centers will better serve residents.
Page I - 7
Introduction
Guiding Principle:
A Safe Place to Live, Work, and Shop
As a family-oriented community, La Puente desires to be a safe place to live, work, and shop. City residents will be protected from natural and human-caused hazards, excessive noise, and criminal activity. Law enforcement and fire services will continue to be provided at appropriate levels. Traffic safety will be enhanced through the improvement of street intersections, turn lanes and stop lights, as well as neighborhood-level efforts to reduce cut-through traffic and noise. City leaders, law enforcement, residents, and community organizations will work together to find alternative solutions to gang activity, including opportunities for learning, employment, and community service. Land use planning will allow a diversity of residential, business, recreational, and other uses within a safe environment.
Traffic and pedestrian safety is an important component of La Puente’s vision.
Guiding Principle:
A Balanced Community that Promotes Housing Options
La Puente desires to be a balanced community providing varied housing opportunities, while preserving established neighborhoods. Providing a variety of housing types allows persons and families of all ages and income levels to live in La
Puente as housing needs change with life circumstances. New houses, townhomes, well-designed apartments, mixed use in the Downtown La Puente, and landscape amenities will complement established
La Puente provides a variery of housing options, including older single'■family homes.

neighborhoods. City programs and policies will enhance housing opportunities, protect the character of single-family neighborhoods, and improve the quality of life.
Guiding Principle:
A Mobile and Accessible Community
La Puente desires to be a mobile and accessible community. The local street system will provide accessible, attractive, and viable mobility options for residents, visitors, and the business community. Traffic and pedestrian safety remains a priority, particularly improving safety in residential neighborhoods, near schools, and other public gathering places. Enforcing traffic laws and maintaining the street system will improve mobility and protect pedestrians. The installation of sidewalks and bike paths will be pursued where feasible so that pedestrians and cyclists will be able to travel quickly throughout La Puente. The City will continue to support MTA, Foothill Transit, and other regional public transit providers and promote alternative modes of local transportation in efforts to reduce automobile dependency and reinforce connections to all of Southern California.
General Plan Purpose and Scope
La Puente's General Plan is a document required by State law that serves as a guide to the long-term physical development of a community. A city's general plan can be thought of as a pattern or blueprint for future growth and development.
Per State regulations, a general plan must address at least the following issues: land use, circulation, housing, noise, safety, conservation, and open space (California Government Code, Section 65302). However, a jurisdiction can vary the contents of the general plan to deal with any issue which decision makers, staff, residents, business owners, and other stakeholders deem important within the community. The La Puente General Plan discusses these issues in five chapters, called elements.
These elements are:
■	Community Development
■	Circulation and Infrastructure
■	Community Resources
*	Community Safety
*	Housing

Community development weaves together three important themes: land use, community design, and economic development. The Circulation and Infrastructure Element addresses how people, goods, and services move in and through La Puente. The Community Resources Element provides flexible consideration of community resources that combines the City's physical assets with cultural and social assets. The Community Safety Element addresses hazards in the physical, built, and social environments and presents goals and policies to reduce the potential risk of death, injuries, property damage, and economic and social impacts associated with hazards.
The Housing Element identifies current and future housing needs and sets forth an integrated set of goals, policies, and programs to assist in the preservation, improvement, and development of housing to meet the needs of the community. Pursuant to State law, La Puente's Housing Element is updated every five years.
Table 1-1 shows the relationship between the five elements of the La Puente General Plan and the State mandated elements.

refocused priorities, to address annual budget constraints and/or
opportunities, and to account for changes in the physical conditions or
economic circumstances of the community (for example, occurrence of a
natural disaster).
Related Plans and Programs
The scope and content of the General Plan is primarily governed by the
General Plan Law and Guidelines, and the Planning, Zoning and
Development Laws of the State of California. In addition, a number of
other relevant plans and programs play an important role in the
formulation of General Plan issues, goals, and policies. These programs
are grouped into the following categories: land use, circulation,
conservation and safety.
Land Use
La Puente Zoning Ordinance
The City's Zoning Ordinance, which is part of the Municipal Code,
divides La Puente into areas, called zoning districts, and establishes
regulations for each district with respect to permitted uses, allowable
density, building height, development character, etc. The Zoning
Ordinance consists of a map delineating zone district boundaries, plus
text that explains the purposes of each district, specifies permitted and
conditional uses, and establishes development and performance
standards. The Zoning Ordinance serves as the primary tool to achieve
the goals, policies and development expectations established in La
Puente's Land Use Plan. Under California law, the Zoning Ordinance
must be consistent with the General Plan.
Downtown Business District Specific Plan
Under California law, a specific plan can be prepared for any defined
geographic area which might benefit from special land use regulations
and development standards. Specific plans can be used to concentrate (or
prohibit) particular types of land uses, establish distinctive design
themes, provide for phased development, or provide incentives for
privately initiated redevelopment activity. In 1994, La Puente adopted a
Downtown Business District Specific Plan. The plan set forth land use
policies, design standards, and development incentives for the
intensification and redevelopment of Downtown La Puente. The
Community Development Element discusses these plans.

Introduction
Circulation
Regional Transportation Plan
The Regional Transportation Plan is a component of the Regional Comprehensive Plan and Guide prepared by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) to address regional issues, goals, objectives, and policies for the Southern California region into the early part of the 21st century. The Plan, which SCAG periodically updates to address changing conditions in the southland, has been developed with active participation from local agencies throughout the region, elected officials, the business community, community groups, private institutions, and private citizens. The Plan sets broad goals for the region and provides strategies to reduce problems related to congestion and mobility. Goals of the Plan relevant to La Puente include:
■	Improving levels of service for the movement of people and goods;
■	Ensuring that transportation investment provides the greatest possible mobility benefit;
■	Serving the transportation needs of everyone; and
■	Developing regional transportation solutions that complement subregional transportation systems and serve the needs of cities and communities.
Congestion Management Plan
The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is responsible for planning and operating regional transit facilities and services in Los Angeles County. As required by State law, MTA prepares a Congestion Management Plan (CMP) for Los Angeles County. The CMP identifies the future regional transportation network, establishes acceptable service levels for network routes and identifies strategies to reduce congestion. Local jurisdictions within the County are responsible for implementing the CMP. The intersection of Azusa Avenue and Main Street is classified as a CMP arterial monitoring station and Azusa Avenue is classified as a principal arterial in the CMP System. The CMP roadway network also includes the following freeways that serve La Puente:
■	San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10)
■	Pomona Freeway (State Route 60)
■	San Gabriel River Freeway (Interstate 605)

Introduction

Air Quality Management Plan
The federal Clean Air Act requires preparation of plans to improve air quality in any region designated as a non-attainment area. (A nonattainment area is a geographic area identified by the Environmental Protection Agency and/or California Air Resources Board as not meeting State or federal standards for a given pollutant). The plan must outline specific programs, strategies, and timelines for bringing the area into compliance with air quality standards. The Air Quality Management Plan prepared by the South Coast Air Quality Management District, first adopted in 1994 and updated on a three-year cycle, contains policies and measures designed to achieve federal and State standards for healthier air quality in the South Coast Air Basin. Many of the programs address circulation improvements, since fossil-fuel-powered vehicles account for more than 60 percent of the nitrogen oxide emissions and 70 percent of the carbon monoxide emissions within the Basin.
Conservation
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
As part of a comprehensive effort to improve the quality of the nation7s water resources, the federal government authorizes the State Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles Region to set up programs to implement National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) goals. Under the NPDES Stormwater Permit issued to the County of Los Angeles and La Puente as co-permittees, most new development projects in the City are required to incorporate measures that minimize pollutant levels within storm water runoff. Compliance is required at the time construction permits are issued, as well as over the long term through periodic inspections. The Community Resources Element discusses the NPDES program.
Safety
National Flood Insurance Program
The Federal Emergency Management Agency administers the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Participating jurisdictions must exercise land use controls and purchase flood insurance as a prerequisite for receiving funds to purchase or build a structure in a flood hazard area. The NFIP provides federal flood insurance subsidies and federally financed loans for eligible property owners in flood-prone areas. La

Introduction

Puente is identified on the National Flood Insurance Program's Flood Insurance Rate Maps as being within Zone Xz an area outside the 100- and 500-year flood zones, subject to minimal flooding.
Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
California's 1990 Seismic Hazards Mapping Act requires the State Geologist to compile maps identifying and describing seismic hazard zones throughout California. Guidelines prepared by the State Mining and Geology Board identify the responsibilities of State and local agencies in the review of development within seismic hazard zones. Development on a site that has been designated as a seismic hazard zone requires a geotechnical report and local agency consideration of the policies and criteria established by the Mining and Geology Board. Over the years, the program has expanded to include mapping of seismic-related hazards such as liquefaction- and landslide-prone areas. The Community Safety Element discusses seismic hazards associated with faults and those identified on State seismic hazard maps.

The Community Development Element guides physical change over the long term by establishing the type and distribution of planned land uses in La Puente, The Element also provides a framework for all other General Plan elements, since the manner in which the community develops affects the design of the circulation system (Circulation and Infrastructure Element), the way urban services are provided to residents and businesses (Community Safety Element), and how open space and recreation resources are allocated (Community Resources Element).
Community Development Themes
Community development weaves together three themes established in La Puente's Community Vision: balanced land use, a positive community image, and economic development. Land use refers to the general location, type, and intensity of development and the physical relationships among various uses. Community image describes how the streetscape, scale and design of buildings, and neighborhood appearance define how residents, businesses, and visitors regard La Puente. Economic development refers to how land use decisions create a demand for services and affect the ability to pay for services.
This Element supports the community's desire to retain the features of La Puente that are considered unique and special: a historic Downtown, diverse residential neighborhoods, and popular commercial districts. Community development policies also address the housing and recreation needs of a changing population, economic and social wellbeing of City residents, concerns within the business community, and the long-range fiscal stability of the City.
Land Use Plan
The Land Use Plan identifies how private and public redevelopment efforts will change, intensify, or otherwise modify uses of property in La Puente over tire next 20 years. Land uses are classified and mapped, showing where the City anticipates residential, commercial, and business
Page CD - f
....spr-v,	Community Development Element
park development, and identifying areas set aside for community purposes, such as parks, schools, and open spaces.
The City's long-range objectives with respect to land use are:
■	To revitalize Downtown La Puente as a vibrant mixed-use district providing many opportunities for new commercial, office and residential development
■	To create opportunities for new commercial business growth in shopping centers that are not functioning to their full potential
■	To preserve and enhance the quality of the City's infrastructure and its residential neighborhoods
■	To accommodate and attract industrial businesses that employ skilled workers
Measuring Density and Intensity
While people generally understand terms like "residential", "commercial", and "industrial", State law requires a clear and concise description of these categories. In addition, population and intensity standards must be specified. To describe the intensity of use - how much development exists on a property - land use planners have developed quantitative measures called density and intensity.
The term density describes the population and development capacity of residential land. The General Plan describes density in terms of dwelling units per net acre of land (du/ac), exclusive of present or planned streets and other public rights-of-way.
Development intensity refers to the extent of development on a parcel of land or lot. Intensity may be calculated using several measures, such as the total building floor area, building height, floor area ratio, or the percent of lot coverage. The General Plan uses floor-area ratio as a measure of non-residential intensity. Floor-area ratio (FAR) is tire ratio between the total gross floor area of all buildings on a lot and the total land area of that lot. This measure does not include area within parking structures.

This diagram illustrates how FAR controls the intensity of use on a lot. FAR is determined by dividing the gross floor area of all buildings on a lot by the land area of that lot. For example, a 20,000 square foot building on a 40,000 square foot lot yields an FAR of 0.5:1. A 0.5:1 FAR allows a single-story building which covers half the lot, or a two-story building with reduced lot coverage.

Land Use Policy Map
The Land Use Policy Map provides a two-dimensional description of land use policy, indicating the preferred location and types of permitted uses throughout the Planning Area. The land use patterns shown on the Land Use Policy Map (Figure CD-I) recognize the benefits and disadvantages of the City's past and present development practices, and respond to potential safety concerns, limitations of current infrastructure, and the nature and character of current development. Implementing the Land Use Policy Map will adjust or reverse development trends within La Puente that are inconsistent with the Community Vision. The Planning Commission, City Council and City staff will accomplish this objective through day-to-day evaluation of development and redevelopment projects against the City's Zoning Ordinance and Map.
Land Use Categories
The text on the following pages identifies the categories of different land uses within the Planning Area. Four residential categories allow a range of housing types, ranging from low-density single-family developments
Page CD - 3
—■ ■■■ T5"'
Community Development Element
to high-density multiple-family projects. Two commercial and one business/employment category address business land uses. A mixed commercial and residential use category encourages flexible combinations of commercial, office and residential uses in the Downtown area. The Land Use Policy Map (Figure CD-I) graphically illustrates the type, nature, and location of future development and redevelopment permitted in La Puente.
Table CD-I summarizes the density and intensity associated with each land use category. The maximum density/intensity listed in Table CD-I sets forth tire maximum development potential of any individual parcel. However, not every parcel develops to the maximum due to public right-of-way needs, placement of buildings, zoning requirements, and other factors. Average densities and intensities identified in Table CD-I correspond to the level of development of each type of land use generally present in La Puente. These measures determine the probable buildout capacity within the Planning Area in terms of population, housing units and non-re sidential square feet. The average densities and intensities are for planning purposes only. Any development proposal involving a density/intensity in excess of the average but below the maximum does not require a General Plan Amendment.

Community Development Focus Areas

The City's well-established land use pattern appears to offer limited opportunities for new development. However, urban design and economic issues continue to shape how property is developed and redeveloped over time in the following five focus areas:
■	The Hacienda/ Glendora Commercial Corridor
■	Downtown La Puente
■	Shopping Centers throughout the City
■	La Puente's Industrial/Manufacturing Cluster
■	Residential Neighborhoods
Hacienda/Glendora Commercial Corridor
Originally a strip commercial corridor of locally serving businesses, Hacienda Boulevard has transformed into the primary commercial corridor in La Puente, offering 1.5 million square feet of floor space to more than 350 businesses. Businesses continue to relocate along Hacienda Corridor to take advantage of the strategic location along one of the most heavily traveled arterials in the east San Gabriel Valley. Hacienda Boulevard is home to a range of retail uses, from automobile dealers to hardware stores to major retailers. Specialty stores catering to the Latino population have also emerged. Smaller shopping centers complement larger anchor businesses by providing both goods and personal services to residents and people working in La Puente.
Hacienda Bind, and Glendora Bind, Commercial Corridor
Hacienda Boulevard is the major commercial corridor in La Puente.
Page CD - 15
Community Development Element

Economic Development
Quality of life depends on a healthy local economy. The Hacienda/Glendora Corridor is La Puente's economic engine,, generating more than 85 percent of all sales tax revenues within the City. These revenues support the maintenance of infrastructure, fire and police services, community services, and public facilities. Given that the City is largely built out and few commercial development opportunities remain outside this corridor, La Puente's long-term fiscal stability depends on the continued stable financial performance of the Corridor. Preserving, retaining, and building the City's sales tax base through the Hacienda Corridor allows La Puente to continue to provide a high level of public services, and to construct public improvements that enhance the community.
The City will promote economic strategies that build upon the assets of the Corridor.
A large portion of taxable sales within the City originate from automobile sales, auto supply stores and service	stations,
restaurants, and food markets. However, La Puente residents also purchase household supplies, clothing, furniture and appliances at regional malls in West Covina and Puente Hills, as well as retail stores (Target, Mervyn's, WalMart, Ikea, Best Buy) located along SP-60 in the City of Industry. Establishment of a regional department store, such as Target or La Curacao, would increase potential for residents to shop in La Puente. Adding high-quality eating and drinking establishments to the mix of businesses located within the Hacienda Corridor would also attract residents and regional customers to La Puente.
The City will employ a creative mix of land use policy, business attraction and retention strategies, and local revenue enhancement within the Hacienda/Glendora Corridor to achieve long-term fiscal security. This strategy recognizes that building fiscal strength will require incremental investment from both the public and private sectors.
Adding retail stores selling household goods will boost La Puente’s tax base.
Page CD - 16
Community Development Element
c
Among the Corridor's greatest assets is the presence of several large underdeveloped or undeveloped parcels, including the La Puente Lanes site.
The community has considered several options for this site, including retail, housing, and mixed-use development. Taking into account the site's location along a busy arterial, the role of Hacienda Boulevard in
providing revenue for the City, and the types of businesses that are desired in the community, the community desires that this site be used for either a large commercial store, as an entertainment complex, or as some combination of the two uses. As a General Commercial land use located on Hacienda Boulevard, upwards of 200,000 square feet of commercial and/ or entertainment uses can be achieved at this location. Innovative site planning techniques and redevelopment tools will help ensure the best use of this large parcel for the community's benefit.
Redevelopment
The City supports future development of several large parcels within the Hacienda/Glendora Corridor that can accommodate new stores, services, or entertainment offering diversity and strength to
The 6.2-acre La Puente Lanes site is the City's best opportunity for new commercial
both the Corridor and the City's tax base. Although the Corridor does
have additional buildable land, some of the smaller sites are irregularly
shaped and individually do not present significant opportunities. Lot
consolidation, development incentives, and financing tools can create
additional commercial development opportunities.
Redevelopment is a key tool to enhance quality of life for residents and
businesses. California redevelopment law equips the City with the means
to establish a separate Redevelopment Agency for the purposes of
fostering employment opportunities, financing public and private
improvements, reversing negative business trends, and maximizing the
use of property.
Redevelopment also provides a built-in financing mechanism called tax
increment financing. When an Agency adopts a redevelopment plan, the
assessed property values within a Redevelopment Project Area become
fixed. As property values within the project area rise over time, the
Agency can use the additional tax revenues or even issue bonds
guaranteed by future tax increment to make public improvements within
the City that benefit businesses located within project areas.
Page CD - 17
Community Development Element

Redevelopment authority also allows an Agency to acquire properties/ to consolidate neighboring parcels into larger lots more attractive to developers/ and set aside a portion of increment revenues to encourage affordable housing within the City.
Designating the Hacienda/Glendora Corridor as a Redevelopment Project Area will encourage consolidation of irregularly shaped parcels into larger sites suitable for development. With prime development sites and a coordinated economic strategy/ the City can attract businesses that will maintain the competitiveness of the Hacienda/Glendora Corridor for years to come.
Design Strategies
Ensuring high-quality design on Hacienda Boulevard is especially important to promote lively activity while providing the community with diverse commercial/ retail/ and service uses. The Hacienda/Glendora Corridor should be a lively/ consumer-friendly area that creates a statement when entering La Puente. Large shopping centers should balance and accommodate automobiles and pedestrians using landscaped roadways and entrances and enhanced crosswalks.
The appearance of the corridor should offer an attractively landscaped environment. The architectural heritage of La Puente should be recalled. The following design strategies address vehicular access, pedestrian access, sidewalk dedication, building orientation, visual aesthetics, landscaping, and signs. These strategies are further defined and implemented within the City's Design Guidelines and Zoning Ordinance.

Design Strategies
Haciend^/Glendora Commercial Corridor - "Gateway into La Puente"
Pedestrian amenities in large shopping centers should include large street trees, seating areas with shade umbrellas, decorative trash receptacles, fountains, decorative paving, and landscaping.
Identify the City at prominent entrances on Hacienda Boulevard. Distinctive public art pieces, signage, and/or graphics that express the history and character of the community are recommended at City gateways.
Provide generous medians and parkways that support extensive plantings, In addition, medians should accommodate distinctive gateways at La Puente’s boundaries.
Reduce the visual and environmental impacts of expansive parking lots. Numerous trees and plantings should provide shade within parking areas and define circulation routes. For public safety purposes, views of parking lots from adjacent properties and Hacienda Boulevard should be preserved.
Use landscape treatments to define Hacienda Boulevard.
Minimize expansive, unbroken wall planes, and provide highly visible public entrances to all buildings and uses. In particular, public entrances and heavily trafficked outdoor areas should incorporate human-scaled details such as canopies and window displays.
Provide well-marked and comfortable pedestrian walkways, including pedestrian circulation within parking lots with connections to adjacent sidewalks and safe access from parking areas. Pedestrian circulation routes within parking lots should be clearly delineated and pedestrian amenities in the form of courtyards, plazas, vine-covered trellises, and covered walks are encouraged to provide shade and human scale elements.
Give large shopping centers a unified architectural character. A common design theme that reflects La Puente’s history and character for all buildings, signs, and landscape treatments is encouraged. Design themes that draw upon the Puente Valley agricultural heritage of citrus, walnut, and avocado crops are strongly encouraged,
Generate visual interest along outdoor passages and paseos with pedestrian amenities such as lighting, landscaping, and street furniture. Building fapades should be varied and articulated to provide visual interest.

Commercial Anchor
Smaller building pads sited at street and corner
Visibility is maintained into parking areas
Buildings oriented to the street help define the street edge, Landscaping such as hedges, grass, and street trees provide a comfortable walking atmosphere for pedestrians.
Provide logical transitions between higher intensity development along Hacienda Boulevard and nearby single •'family neighborhoods; scale, massing, and the location of services should respond sensitively to adjacent residential uses.
Plant street trees appropriate to the scale and function of the street. Flowering trees and shrubs may be included to increase color interest and to augment the appearance of the street, particularly at intersections and street corners.
Improve pedestrian access throughout the Corridor. Continuous sidewalks and on-site paths that connect adjacent uses, buildings, off-site pedestrian walkways, outdoor spaces, and parking are strongly encouraged.
Automobile dealerships should have a unifying architectural theme, attractive automobile displays, pleasant landscaping and trees, and unsightly automotive bays and repair areas should be screened from the public right-of-way.
Automobile dealerships should create pedestrian-friendly street frontages using landscaping and other pedestrian amenities.
Figure CD-2 illustrates how the City will apply these strategies within the Hacienda/Glendora Corridor. La Puente's Zoning Ordinance reinforces these strategies through development requirements applicable within the Corridor.

Downtown La Puente
The Downtown Business District is part of the original Town of La Puente subdivision recorded in 1886. From the community's earliest agricultural days, Downtown has served as the heart of La Puente, offering a central location for retail, commercial, and service activities. The City's oldest residential neighborhoods surround Downtown. Over the past fifty years, Downtown's role has evolved into more of a civic and cultural center. As home to City Hall, the Library, and Senior Center, Downtown hosts City parades, civic meetings, and community gatherings.
(
Main Street La Puente, 1930.
Downtown preservation and enhancement remain important City objectives. Downtown La Puente offers additional opportunities for broader use, coordinated development, improved appearance, and a complementary mix of commercial and residential uses to create a more vibrant and economically productive area. To achieve these objectives, the City Council adopted a Downtown Business District Specific Plan in 1994, proposing a combination of land uses (retail, office, residential, and public uses), design guidelines, and public/private investment strategies to revitalize Downtown and preserve the neighborhood's small town charm.
Page CD - 23
Community Development Element
General
Strengthening and preserving the role of Downtown La Puente requires a creative and multi-faceted strategy comprised of land use policy, focused housing development, infrastructure investments, and marketing strategies. The City's long-term strategy for Downtown requires incremental investment from both the public and private sectors. Economic Development
Economic development plays an important role in the continuing gradual transformation of Downtown. Migration of major businesses to the Hacienda/Glendora Corridor underscores the need to attract new businesses suitable to Downtown. Downtown has the potential to become an even stronger local service center comprised of clusters of retail tenants, small firms, and business professionals who can work from Downtown offices and service spaces.
Mixed-Use Development
The City encourages residential uses in Downtown to revitalize the area. The Downtown Business District Specific Plan provides for mixed-use districts within portions of Downtown. Mixed residential and commercial uses have several tangible benefits:
■	Mixed use attracts private investment in the form of residential and commercial development.
■	Mixed use increases patronage within Downtown and can convey substantial economic benefits to businesses.
Page CD - 24
Community Development Element

■ Mixed use helps streets, public spaces and commercial areas again become places where people meet and interact.
Creating opportunities for residents to live in high-quality housing side by side with retail, entertainment and civic uses will help establish a sense of place and give Downtown an attractive, unique feel.
Design Strategies
Visual attractiveness of Downtown is a key component in maintaining the small-town charm of La Puente. Downtown La Puente is challenged by aging buildings, a remote location within the City, and deferred maintenance, all of which deter private investment. To assist in the revitalization of Downtown, the City's Commercial Rehabilitation Grant Program assists property owners and tenants to rehabilitate exterior portions of commercial buildings. The Downtown Business District Specific Plan also provides land use direction to create a diverse pedestrian activity district that serves the needs of residents and business owners and provides additional residential opportunities.
The following design strategies create a place consistent with a lively "Historic Main Sheet" downtown area, complemented by residential, civic, and other pubic uses. These strategies are further defined and implemented within the City's Design Guidelines, Zoning Ordinance, and Downtown Business District Specific Plan.
Design Strategies
Downtown La Puente - "Historic Main Street"
■	Encourage facade improvements that reinforce classic American storefront architecture, such as decorative elements, new colors, appropriate sign features, awnings, detailed lighting elements, and use of decorative paving treatments that can add a fresh look to older commercial buildings. The architectural features should also reflect the history and heritage of the downtown La Puente area.
* Build a strong relationship between buildings and the street, especially along Main Street and First Street. Building configurations should maintain a continuous edge along the sidewalk and clearly define public space.
■	Support a street-oriented development pattern, with buildings sited at or near the sidewalk edge. Mixed-use structures should be a

component of “main street” commercial development and other areas where pedestrian activity is strongly encouraged.
Provide a frequent and consistent rhythm of shop entrances along Main Street and First Street. Recessed entries are encouraged.
Encourage the creative expression of individual storefronts, and use shop windows to help animate and sustain attention on Main Street and First Street. Generous street level windows predominantly of transparent glass are strongly encouraged.
Emphasize design elements such as separate storefronts, display windows, shop entrances, exterior light fixtures, awnings, overhangs, and pedestrian-oriented signs. These features will add interest and give a human dimension to street-level fagades.
Within mixed-use projects, require commercial uses on the ground-floor level and office and residential uses on upper floors.
Rely on ground-floor commercial space with frequent sidewalk entrances to promote pedestrian activity along the street. In particular, ground-floor commercial uses should offer shops and services appealing to La Puente residents,
Make ground-floor commercial uses visually distinct from the residential space above. Dwelling units should exhibit a residential character, and residential entrances should read differently from entrances to ground floor commercial uses.
Incorporate upper floor balconies, bays and windows that overlook the street and improve the street elevation. These will also communicate the residential function of upper levels.
Add significant landscaping such as trees, shrubs, potted plants and trees, vines, ground cover, and perennial and annual plant species to soften commercial sites lacking landscaping.
Significant landscaping can improve the look of buildings and streetscape. Trees, clinging vines, planters, potted plants, and other landscaping elements soften otherwise harsh building frontages.

Shopping Centers	
Shopping centers in La Puente supplement regional commercial activity on Hacienda Boulevard. Hacienda Boulevard serves residents citywide and caters to regional customers that travel through La Puente. Neighborhood shopping centers, on the other hand, provide goods and services for residents and local businesses in the immediate surrounding neighborhoods. These shopping centers provide a significant variety of goods and services. La Puente's two main neighborhood-level shopping districts are located at Amar Road/Willow Avenue and Azusa

Smaller shopping centers provide a more limited number of convenience stores and shops than do the larger shopping centers. Residents will continue to maintain relationships with businesses in these centers. The City's residential densities and traffic on arterial highways will continue to provide the City's shopping centers with a strong customer base.
La Puente shopping centers can benefit from high-quality building standards, site design considerations, and City financial assistance. Land use planning will ensure that shopping centers provide appropriate services and are designed and operated in a manner compatible with adjacent land uses.

Economic Development
Proactive economic development strategies will facilitate and encourage the revitalization of shopping centers. Revitalization activities include strengthening the type and mix of tenants and including a varied mix of recognizable retailers. Examples of potential tenants include brand-name pharmacies, food markets, shoe stores and media stores. Working with brokers to highlight the assets of these neighborhood shopping centers and finding long-term tenants that can establish roots within the community remain strong City priorities.
One of the most significant assets that the larger shopping centers, located at Amar/Willow and Azusa/Valley, have is a lack of nearby competition. While these retail centers primarily serve the residential neighborhoods near them, they have the potential to significantly expand and capture business from surrounding unincorporated communities with appropriate revitalization and marketing efforts. However, high tenant turnover, inadequate product and service offerings, and the need for modernization have kept these centers from realizing their full economic potential. The City recognizes these limitations and proposes creative efforts to revitalize these shopping centers.
Successful revitalization requires increased cooperation among property owners and tenants, significant private investment, and public financial assistance. The City will continue to offer financial assistance to property owners and tenants to renovate the exterior faces of commercial structures. The City also has created development incentives for the Amar/Willow and Valley/Azusa districts by allowing increased floor-area ratios, creating flexible development standards, and encouraging tenant composition improvements to encourage tire highest and best future use of these centers.
Design Strategies
Shopping center design is both an aesthetic and economic development concern. Site design, good visibility, property maintenance, and landscaping all improve the economic performance and attractiveness of shopping centers. Deferred maintenance, the proliferation of truck parking, and poor storefront presentations give neighborhood shopping centers a barren and unattractive character. Improvements in these areas can help revitalize La Puente's shopping centers.
The City supports rehabilitation and revitalization efforts through creative site planning, site reconfiguration, design strategies and building

standards. The General Plan sets increased intensity standards at the Amar/Willow and Azusa/Valley shopping districts relative to other commercial uses in the City. These increased standards will allow for greater lot coverage and increased flexibility in terms of design and appearance. Using these tools, renovated shopping centers can incorporate more modern designs, increase visibility, improve landscaping, and a create a more pleasant shopping environment.
The following design strategies will help create comfortable, well designed, and attractive neighborhood centers with uses that meet the needs of local residents. These strategies are further defined and implemented within the City's Design Guidelines and Zoning Ordinance.
Design Strategies
Shopping Centers - "Providing Commercial Needs and Services Safely and Attractively"
For public safety purposes, on-site parking should be visible from sidewalks, roadways, and adjacent properties. Trees and plantings maybe used in moderation to provide shade and screen undesireable views.
■	Create a street-level environment that includes many pedestrian amenities, such as potted plants or flowers, decorative paving treatments, detailed lighting elements, benches, or outdoor seating along the street frontage.
■	Respond to adjacent, residential uses with sensitive transitions in scale and massing. For example, building mass should be broken down using height step backs, articulated sub-volumes, and horizontal and vertical fagade articulation.
■	Incorporate functional pedestrian connections to adjacent uses. Nearby residential uses should benefit from convenient access to local shopping and services.
■	Encourage high-quality facade improvements such as arcades, canopies, awnings, transparent
Signage, landscaping, and good architectural design together can really create an attractive shopping center building.

windows, window displays, and new colors to add a new look to existing commercial buildings and to promote long-term maintenance.
■ Architectural design and sytle of shopping centers should communicate a scale and common design theme that does not overwhelm the neighborhood or adjacent residential uses. A design theme that reflects La Puente’s history and character for all buildings, signs, and landscape treatments is encouraged.
Goal 3	Attractive shopping centers that provide an appropriate mix of quality goods and services for adjacent residential neighborhoods.
Policy 3.1	Encourage and facilitate a balanced mix of residential, commercial, shopping, and services at neighborhood shopping centers.
Policy 3.2	Encourage the rehabilitation or renovation of neighborhood shopping centers through facade improvements, property maintenance, and financial assistance.
Policy 3.3	Consider designating the Amar/Willow and Azusa/Valley shopping districts as Redevelopment Project Areas as a means to revitalize and renovate the districts.
Policy 3.4	Establish architectural and design standards for neighborhood shopping centers to ensure consistency and quality of building design, facades, signage, and landscaping.
Policy 3.5	Encourage the reconfiguration and development of neighborhood shopping centers by offering modified development standards, more intense floor-area ratios, and other tools.
Policy 3.6	Aggressively enforce commercial property standards, including maintenance of buildings, landscaping, parking areas, lighting, and health and safety standards.

The Valley Business Center is the centerpiece of La Puente’s Business/Employment Corridor.
Business/Employment Corridor
A skilled, well-paid population base will strengthen the City's overall economic health and improve the community's quality of life. Spending money locally increases the success of local businesses and employers, and improves private investment in the community. La Puente's Business/Employment corridor, located along Old Valley Boulevard and Valley Boulevard, has the potential to attract new businesses, create skilled jobs, and revitalize the tax base. City revitalization efforts and circulation improvements have improved the corridor, and completion of the Valley Business Center has enhanced a
major entry point to Downtown La Puente, creating additional employment opportunities and increased tax revenue.
Economic Development
The Business/Employment corridor's close proximity to numerous industrial properties within the City of Industry is a significant advantage in attracting new tenants to available industrial properties. Underutilized sites offer the potential for new or expanded industrial businesses. Although many parcels are not located along a major highway and cannot accommodate large manufacturing processes, several sites offer good access to regional highways and freeways. The City supports efforts to reuse underutilized sites in this corridor, and seeks to capitalize on new business opportunities resulting from completion of the Alameda Corridor East project.
Goal	A vibrant industrial corridor providing high-quality development,
employment opportunities, and tax revenue, and serving as a gateway to
/I	Downtown.
Policy 4.1	Facilitate continued recycling of underutilized properties along Old Valley
Boulevard to high-quality, clean light industrial uses where appropriate.
Policy 4.2	Develop focused economic enhancement strategies for the Valley/Old Valley
Boulevard to leverage opportunities from the Alameda Corridor East project.

Residential Neighborhoods
La Puente's residential neighborhoods provide housing choices to meet varied needs. Older, established neighborhoods consist primarily of single-family residences. Newer areas also offer townhomes and planned unit developments. Apartments and senior housing are available throughout the City. Providing a wide range of housing opportunities allows residents of all incomes to live in La Puente.
	
Most of La Puente’s residential neighborhoods and housing stock date from the Post-World War 11 building boom.
Long-time residents and newcomers to the community value the range of housing choices available, and well-maintained neighborhoods exhibit the pride people place in calling La Puente home. Over time, the housing stock and residential neighborhoods have gradually changed, challenging the City to maintain and improve quality of life for La Puente residents.
In some neighborhoods, apartments and townhomes have replaced older single-family residences dating to the 1950s or earlier. This transition has generally improved neighborhoods with the introduction of higher-quality housing. However, it has also created neighborhoods where single-family residences are directly adjacent to apartments and condominiums. In these areas, the City will promote the creation of more uniform and compatible neighborhoods.
Maintaining housing conditions and protecting the privacy of singlestory homes are key challenges in established single-family residential neighborhoods. House sizes and heights have increased over time, leading to inconsistency within neighborhoods when newer homes are constructed adjacent to or between older homes. Many of the larger, taller homes have a line of sight that faces down and into an adjacent home or backyard. The City is committed to preserving established single-family neighborhoods by regulating development and
Page CD - 33

encouraging both property maintenance and rehabilitation.
Constructing new parks and recreation areas, safe and well-maintained roadways, and ensuring high levels of public safety can also enhance residential neighborhoods. The City is committed to increasing recreational opportunities through a variety of means, as they become available, including site
acquisition,	park
development, tmd joint-use agreements with school districts.

thoughtfully designed, new
housing development can adversely affect neighborhood character.
High-quality single-family and multi-family dwelling units should protect the privacy of adjacent residential units and complement other housing units within the same block. The following residential design guidelines will be applied to protect and enhance the quality of all neighborhoods. These strategies are further defined and implemented within the City's Design Guidelines and Zoning Ordinance.

Design Strategies
Single-Family Residential Development - "Protecting Neighborhoods"
Ensure that new single-family residential buildings or additions are designed and constructed with sensitivity tor the privacy of adjacent residential properties and the value and quality of existing homes.
Integrate residential developments with their built surroundings. In particular, encourage a strong relationship between dwelling and the street.
The bulk and mass of new single-family residential buildings or additions should not be overbearing or out of place in existing residential neighborhoods.
Communicate the single-family residential function of a building by encouraging the design of visually appealing residential dwellings that feature varied facades and pleasing compositions.
Single-family dwelling units should contain architectural elements oriented toward the street.
Design Strategies
Multiple-Family Residential Development - "Creating Quality Homes"
Reduce the bulk of multi-family buildings using scale transitions near adjacent single-family dwellings. Articulate building facades to portray a domestic scale and give identity to individual dwelling units.
Provide attractive, communal open space with functional amenities. The amount of open space should increase with the size of a multi-family development to meet the social and recreational needs of residents.
1 Iigh-qualit.y design elements for multi-family buildings can include such features as a landscaped trellis to define the entrance, or private ground-level entries for individual units.

&verafThn
Incorporate well-designed and adequately sized private open spaces, such as balconies, patios and porches, into multi-family development projects to improve the quality of the project and to create usable and pleasant outdoor private spaces for residents to enjoy.
Provide well-designed, safe parking areas. Maximize security and surveillance, and provide efficient access to building entrances.
Incorporate trees, shrubs, groundcover, and grass areas within multi-family development projects to create a lush and comfortable environment for residents and those viewing from public areas. Encourage lot consolidation to produce larger sites and greater project amenities
Building forms employing a variety of roof shapes, articulation, height variation, and inconsistent setbacks provide a visually attractive building, unlike large, box-like buildings with blank walls.

Economic and Employment Development
A healthy local economy consists of a trained and educated workforce,
diversified businesses, accessibility to housing, financial assistance to
businesses, and infrastructure ready to serve technologically advanced
businesses. Several sections in the Community Development Element
have addressed these issues. The following section discusses the major
economic development and employment challenges that affect the
economic vitality of the community and it identifies goals and policies
designed to address these challenges.
Economic Development
Although the City of La Puente occupies only 3.5 square miles and has
42,000 residents, its market area effectively includes the adjoining
unincorporated areas of Valinda, Bassett, and Avocado Heights and a
total population of about 105,000. The City captures commuter pass-
through business along its commercial "corridors of convenience",
principally Hacienda Boulevard and Amar Road. These corridors also
serve the local population, employees and businesses. To its
disadvantage, the City has no freeway frontage or visibility and relies
heavily on its convenience retail and service businesses for sales tax
generation. The City of La Puente also faces economic competition from
its neighbors. It has no large, high value general merchandise stores such
as those found in the regional retail centers of the nearby communities of
Covina, West Covina, Industry and Hacienda Heights. As a result, the
Page CD - 37
La Puente

Community Development Element "Z '* 1*” '5** * * —““—™-^—^——^—______———————.=±=_
^ieraPP^
City experiences substantial sales "leakage" to these surrounding communities. In addition to the retail centers along Hacienda Boulevard and Amar Road, the City's smaller retail centers have the potential to significantly expand and capture business from surrounding unincorporated communities with appropriate revitalization and marketing efforts. Supporting economic development means making space for both existing businesses to expand and for new businesses to locate in La Puente. New and existing businesses seek not only spaces to establish their businesses, but also adequate access and infrastructure in an attractive setting with sufficient amenities, resources and local government cooperation.
Employment Development
Employment development is crucial to La Puente's future economic health. The City has a larger proportion of residents 19 years of age or younger than Los Angeles County as a whole. This portion of the population will be entering the workforce during the timeframe of this General Plan. According to a jobs-housing balance analysis performed in 2003, there is a substantial imbalance between the number of jobs in the City (8,285) and the number of employed residents (16,760). The average household in the City (4.4 persons/household) is significantly larger that the average for the County as a whole (3.0 persons/household), and there is an average of 1.77 persons per household that are employed. To achieve a balance of at least one job per household in the City, 2,200 additional jobs would have to be created.
Economic growth can bring many benefits to the community, including jobs, housing, and new revenue. New growth will lead to higher tax revenue, thus benefiting residents and the community directly by enhancing many of the public services the City provides. The City will collaborate with the business community to facilitate growth, development, and infrastructure improvements that benefit residents and businesses alike. To achieve balance between the labor force and jobs and to insure and enhance the economic vitality of the community, the City will support economic development in two primary areas: business retention and business expansion/attraction.

Zoning and Community Development
Die City's zoning ordinance serves as the primary tool to implement
General Plan land use policies. Under California law, the zoning
ordinance must be consistent with the General Plan, meaning that each
land use category must have one or more corresponding zone districts,
and development standards and land use regulations in the Zoning
Ordinance must reflect the policies in the General Plan. While General
Plan discussion of permitted land uses and development intensities is by
nature somewhat general, the Zoning Ordinance provides the specificity
property owners and developers seek in identifying how particular
properties can be used and developed. Table CD-2 identifies the
relationships between land use categories and zone districts in La Puente.
Development Capacity
As property owners redevelop sites and as changes in land use or
intensity occur, the overall distribution of land uses will shift. Table CD-3
summarizes the distribution of land use and the corresponding level of
development anticipated to result from implementation of land use goals
and policies contained in this Element. As shown in the Table CD-3, La
Puente, including unincorporated County areas within its sphere of
influence has capacity for a population of approximately 62,333 persons
in 14,156 housing units. Of these, approximately 44,071 persons in 10,008
housing units are within the corporate limits (as of year 2004) of the City
of La Puente.

Circulation and Infrastructure Element
The ease with which people travel within and through La Puente depends on good circulation planning. People should be able to easily and safely get around within the City from home to school, work, or shopping. Moving people and goods between destinations within the region efficiently and effectively allows the City to benefit both economically and socially. Well-planned circulation is a high City priority since La Puente has six major transportation thoroughfares that serve as the City's key commercial corridors. Travel delays, hazards, and driving frustrations impact both public safety and the City7 s economic well-being.
La Puente enjoys easy access to Interstate 10, Interstate 605 and State Route 60 (SR-60). These freeways link City residents and businesses to destinations throughout Southern California and beyond. Six major highways in La Puente serve as the primary routes into and out of the City. Although these highways sometimes act as relief valves to the freeways, they also provide good alternative travel routes to destinations throughout the San Gabriel Valley. The City's local circulation system offers varied, convenient routes for both local and regional trips.
Scope and Content
The Circulation portion of this element addresses anticipated circulation needs and the ability of the road network and alternative transportation modes to meet future travel demands. New development will increase use of local and regional roadways, and the plan and policies presented in this element identify strategies the City will pursue to maintain good service levels. Because local circulation is linked with the regional system, the policies highlight La Puente's continued role in regional programs to alleviate traffic congestion through capacity enhancements and trip reduction. Reduced dependency on the automobile works toward these objectives and improves environmental quality. Because not everyone drives a car, this element examines the transportation options available to La Puente residents and establishes appropriate policies.
La Puente also depends upon a reliable and safe water supply system, a stormwater drainage system that protects properties from periodic

flooding,, a sewage collection system, and private utilities, such as electric power, natural gas, and telecommunications. These systems must be maintained to ensure that residents and businesses can reliably turn on a tap, run the washing machine, or use water for businesses. The Infrastructure portion of this element identifies service providers for La Puente and calls for inventory and maintenance of the City's infrastructure systems.
Measuring Traffic Flow
Within this Element, two traffic engineering concepts - volume to capacity (V/C) and Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU) ratios - are used to describe traffic flow on roadways and through intersections. Volume is established either by a traffic count (in the case of current volumes) or by a forecast for a future point in time. Capacity refers to the vehicle carrying ability of a roadway at free flow speed, and is a critical component of roadway design. For example, a roadway that carries 16,000 vehicles per day, with the capacity to accommodate 20,000 vehicles per day at free flow speed, has a V/C of 0.80.
The V/C measure is used in turn to establish Level of Service (LOS) categories describing the performance of roadways and intersections throughout the community. Six categories of LOS - the letter designations A to F - are used to identify traffic conditions, with LOS A representing excellent conditions and LOS F representing extreme congestion. For roadways, the LOS designations are based on directly upon V/C ratios calculated based on the roadway's capacity at LOS E (or design) conditions. Table CI-1 shows V/C ranges, the corresponding LOS, and a description of expected traffic conditions for roadways.
For intersections, LOS is based on Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU) ratios, which take into account the volume-to-capacity ratios of all of the critical turning movements that take place at an intersection. Table CI-2 shows ICU ranges, the corresponding LOS, and a description of expected traffic conditions for intersections.

A LOS A describes primarily free-flow operations at average travel speeds, usually about 0-0.60 90 percent of the fiee-flow speed for the arterial classification. Vehicles are completely unimpeded in their ability to maneuver within tire traffic stream. Stopped delays at signalized intersections is minimal.
B LOS B represents reasonably unimpeded operations at average travel speeds, usually 0.61-0.70 about 70 percent of die free-flow speed for the arterial classification. The ability to maneuver within the traffic stream is only slightly restricted and stopped delays are not bothersome. Drivers are not generally subjected to appreciable tension.
C LOS C represents stable operations; however, ability to maneuver and change lanes in 0.71-0.80 midblock locations may be more restricted than at LOS B, and longer queues, adverse signal coordination, or both may contribute to lower average speeds of about 50 percent of the average free-flow speed for the arterial classification. Motorists will experience appreciable tension while driving.
D LOS D borders on a range in which small increases in flow may cause a substantial 0.81-0.90 increase in delay and hence decreases in arterial speed. LOS D may be due to adverse signal progression, inappropriate signal timing, high volumes, or some combination of these factors. Average travel speeds are about 40 percent of free-flow speed.
E LOS E is characterized by significant delays and average travel speeds of one-third the 0.91-1.00 free-flow speed or less. Such operations are caused by some combination of adverse progression, high signal density, high volumes, extensive delays at critical intersections, and inappropriate signal timing.
F LOS F characterizes arterial flow at extremely low speeds below one-third to one-fourth Over 1.00 of the free-flow speed. Intersection congestion is likely at critical signalized locations, with high delays and extensive queuing. Adverse progression is frequently a contributor to diis condition.

Roadway Classifications
Development standards and names for each roadway classification are drawn from the Los Angeles County Code Book. Roadway design may deviate from the standards where physical constraints exist, where preservation of community character dictates special treatment, or on approaches to intersections. Bikeways, sidewalks, and on-street parking also may affect the specific standards applied to various roadways.
Freeways
Interstate 10 (3 miles north of La Puente) Interstate 605 (1 mile west of La Puente) State Route 60 (1,5 miles south of La Puente)
Freeways are controlled access, high-speed roadways	with	grade-separated
interchanges. A freeway is intended to carry high volumes of traffic from region to region. The planning, design, construction, and maintenance of freeways in California are the responsibility of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). While no freeway is located within the Planning Area, the three freeways listed above play an integral role in the City's mobility, and are thus considered a critical part of La Puente's Roadway Plan.
Freeways, including the SR-60 Pomona Freeway, provide regional access to La Puente.
Major
Highways
Amar Road Azusa Avenue Hacienda Boulevard
Puente Avenue Sunset Avenue Valley Boulevard
Major Highways carry traffic from Secondary Highways and collectors to other parts of the city, freeways, and adjacent major land uses. Major Highways also provide links between activity centers in the Planning Area, in other adjacent communities, and other parts of the region. Major Highways are designed to move

Secondary Highways serve as intermediate routes, carrying traffic between local streets, Collectors, and Major Highways. Secondary Highways are generally intended to provide unrestricted access to all types of land uses. Parking is generally allowed during all periods of the day or may be prohibited during morning or evening peak periods. Secondary Highways are designed to carry moderate levels of traffic, generally in the range of 15,000 to 25,000 vehicles per day.

Parking is typically allowed during all periods of the day or, if necessary, may be prohibited during peak hours on certain segments. Collectors are designed to carry moderate levels of traffic, generally in the range of 10,000 to 15,000 vehicles per day.

Local Streets Not included in Roadway Plan
Local streets provide direct vehicular, pedestrian, and bicycle access to adjacent land uses, and are intended to carry low volumes of traffic. Such roadways are typically narrow and allow unrestricted parking. Local streets in La Puente have a 30- to 36-foot curb-to-curb width within a 50-foot right-of-way, and consist of streets that do not fall into one of the previous four classifications. Local streets are not identified on the Roadway Plan.
Local Streets, like 5th Street, provide direct access to residences and businesses in La Puente.
Page CI - 8
Circulation and Infrastructure Element
Performance Standards
Evaluating the ability of the circulation system to serve La Puente residents and businesses requires establishing suitable performance standards. The performance standards used to evaluate volumes and capacities on the roadway system are based on average daily roadway volumes and peak hour intersection data. These performance standards establish a basis from which to evaluate the need to improve or replace roadway facilities within the City in response to increased traffic or congestion. The City strives to achieve LOS D for peak-hour operations and LOS C for non-peak hour operations along roadway segments throughout the City and at residential intersections. LOS E is the performance standard for commercial intersections.
General Plan Roadway System
The goals and policies in this Element emphasize the need for a circulation system capable of serving both current and future local and regional traffic. The Roadway Plan for the La Puente Planning Area is illustrated in Figure CI-2. Roadway improvements needed to achieve
(	performance criteria and avoid roadway and intersection impacts within
the Planning Area are prioritized, funded, and completed using the City's five-year Capital Improvement Plan process.
Addressing Traffic Congestion
Traffic congestion continues to be a key issue affecting the quality of life in La Puente. Although La Puente will experience only very limited growth, regional influences will continue to contribute to traffic congestion. Over time, the City will pursue two primary courses of action to improve congestion: (1) focused physical improvements that enhance the capacity of roadways and intersections, and (2) creative, technological solutions to improve mobility.
Physical Improvements
Proposed physical improvements include the following:
■ Lane additions on Hacienda Boulevard between Nelson Avenue and north of Francisquito Road1.
1 This roadway segment is either partially or wholly outside the City's jurisdiction.

■	Intersection improvements on Hacienda Boulevard at Francisquito .Avenue, Amar Road, Glendora Avenue and Valley Boulevard2.
■	Intersection improvements at Azusa Way/ Valley Boulevard2.
■	Intersection improvements on Puente Avenue at Amar Road2 and Valley Boulevard2.
The City's Capital Improvement Program (CIP) will continue to be the tool for identifying needed circulation improvements and for prioritizing funding.
Future intersection improvements, such as additional dedicated turn lanes, will be required to increase the capacity of La Puente’s roadway system.
Nearly every jurisdiction in southern California is faced with traffic congestion problems that can no longer be resolved by capacity enhancements such as lane restriping or roadway widening due to a variety of factors including lack of available roadway right-of-way, physical and cost constraints, and environmental problems. An alternate strategy is implementation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies, which allow the City to control traffic signals by using advanced computer and communication technologies. Proposed locations for ITS improvements include Azusa Avenue south of Main Street and Valley Boulevard west of Puente Avenue1.
Both of these locations are located just beyond the Planning Area boundary, but each has a direct effect on the overall transportation system in La Puente. The City will work with the City of Industry and County of Los Angeles to implement ITS systems at these locations to improve corridor traffic flow.
2 These intersections and roadway segments may be either partially or wholly outside the City's jurisdiction.

^■Circulation and Infrastructure Element
&enera(&fafl
The Union Pacific Railroad runs adjacent to La Puente’s southern boundary.
Regional Circulation
A network of freeways, railroads, and major highways connects La Puente to the larger San Gabriel Valley. Interstate 10 and State Route 60 provide access to Los Angeles and the Inland Empire, and Interstate 605 provides access to the Long Beach/ South Bay area. Running parallel to Valley Boulevard, the Union Pacific Railroad and Metrolink provide freight and commuter train service to Hie San Gabriel Valley and the larger Los Angeles metropolitan area.
La Puente depends on an efficient network of major highways to facilitate business activities along Hacienda Boulevard, allow residents to commute to and from work, and handle normal day-to-day traffic. To achieve this objective, the City will evaluate performance of regional roadways against the performance standards established within this Element, and complete intersection and roadway improvements as needed and feasible to maintain the integrity of the roadway system.
Truck Routes
Positioned between major freeways, the City experiences a high volume of truck traffic originating from industrial areas in neighboring communities. Trucks generate noise, pollution, and significant wear and tear on the City's pavement infrastructure. The majority of truck trips in the City originate elsewhere in the San Gabriel Valley, most often in the neighboring cities of Industry, Baldwin Park and West Covina. The California Vehicle Code regulates the use of local streets and roads by trucks and other heavy vehicles.
The City has designated a number of streets as truck routes to ensure the orderly movement of commercial vehicles through the community, minimize noise and pollution from truck traffic, and reduce wear on roadways. These truck routes connect with routes in adjacent cities to form an integrated surface street network for truck movement. Designated truck routes are Puente Avenue, Sunset Avenue, Hacienda Boulevard, Azusa Way, Azusa Avenue, Francisquito Avenue (west of Hacienda Boulevard), Amar Road, and Valley Boulevard (Figure CI-3).

Rail Transportation
The Union Pacific Railroad runs along the south side of the City, parallel to Valley Boulevard on the north side of the street Union Pacific provides freight service to industrial uses in the San Gabriel Valley. This railroad corridor also carries commuter trains, specifically the Metrolink Riverside County line. The Metrolink stop at the Industry Station, approximately five miles east of the City, links commuters to Downtown Los Angeles. Puente Avenue, Sunset Avenue, Hacienda Boulevard, and Azusa Avenue are the only north/ south roadways in La Puente that cross these railroad tracks. Presently, Hacienda Boulevard is the only grade-separated crossing.
A cargo train passes through La Puente parallel to Valley Boulevard.
Nearby railroad lines include a Union Pacific Railroad line running between Baldwin Park Boulevard and Vineland Avenue approximately one-half mile west of La Puente. The Metrolink San Bernardino County travels along this line. The nearest stop is located at the Baldwin Park Station, approximately three miles northeast of La Puente.
Major regional rail transportation projects such as the Alameda Corridor East (ACE) will impact traffic in La Puente. The ACE links Long Beach and central Los Angeles to the Inland Empire by rail. By 2020, the ACE may result in a 160 percent increase in rail traffic and 40 percent increase in road traffic. Sixteen grade separations in nearby jurisdictions will cross the tracks. The ACE may cause increased traffic on Valley Boulevard (which links many of the proposed crossings) and on north-south streets in La Puente where no grade separation is planned. Four ACE crossings located in the City of Industry will affect traffic in La Puente: at-grade crossings at the Valley Boulevard intersections with Orange Avenue and California Avenue, and grade-separated crossings at the Valley Boulevard intersections with Puente Avenue and Sunset Avenue. The City will work with adjacent jurisdictions and ACE to ensure that spillover effects of this project do not degrade roadway conditions in La Puente.

Local Circulation
La Puente's local street network operates on a traditional grid pattern: roads east of Hacienda Boulevard form a north-south grid, while roads west of Hacienda form a northeast/southwest grid. Puente Avenue, Sunset Avenue Hacienda Boulevard, and Azusa Avenue are the major north-south routes. Amar Road, Temple Avenue, and Valley Boulevard provide the main east-west routes.
As discussed in the Roadway Plan section of this Element, the local roadway system is comprised of Major Highways, Secondary Highways, Collectors, and local streets. Each roadway group serves a different purpose by carrying local or regional traffic, and thus speed limits and parking requirements vary accordingly. Major Highways carry the majority of traffic that passes through La Puente. Secondary Highways carry traffic between local streets, Collectors, and Major Highways, and provide access to all types of land uses within the community. Collectors provide access to local streets, which in turn carry traffic through residential neighborhoods.
Local roadways must provide safe, convenient access to and from neighborhoods, businesses, shopping, schools, and recreation areas. Planning safe and efficient roadways includes consideration of the intensity of use and condition of roadways. Streets must be periodically repaired and rehabilitated to maintain performance. Aware of the substantial capital investment in public roads, the City maintains a comprehensive street maintenance and rehabilitation program.
Neighborhood Traffic Safety
Several of La Puente's residential neighborhoods adjoin commercial and industrial business districts. Residents continually express concern about commercial traffic driving through the neighborhoods. In addition, the City's central location, surrounded by freeways and employment centers, create conditions whereby the City's local streets are used by drivers trying to avoid regional traffic and avoid congestion on Valley Boulevard, Hacienda Boulevard, and Glendora Avenue. Neighborhood concerns include excessive vehicle speed, high traffic volumes during peak evening hours, and associated dangers to pedestrians.
One approach to addressing this issue is a neighborhood protection plan. Such a plan aims to reduce the impacts of traffic on local residential
Page CI - 16
Circulation and Infrastructure Element
&mcra['P(on
streets by either slowing the speed of traffic or making it harder for passthrough vehicles to reach residential streets. To accomplish this, the City will estabhsh a Neighborhood Traffic Control Program, with the overall objective of improving the livability of neighborhoods. Specific impacts to be addressed by the program include cut-through traffic volumes, high speeds, truck traffic intrusion, demonstrated accident history, and school-related traffic congestion.
The Neighborhood Traffic Control Program process will ensure that every neighborhood with demonstrated problems and overall community support has equal access to traffic control measures. The program will require citizen involvement and may vary from year to year based upon funding available for neighborhood traffic control. The process includes the following nine steps;
(
Step 1 - Identify Candidate Streets/Neighborhoods Step 2 - Preliminary Screening and Evaluation Step 3 - Survey/Petition Affected Persons Step 4 - Engineering Analysis
Step 5 - Neighborhood Meetings
Step 6 - Prioritization and Funding Assessment Step 7 - Develop Demonstration Project Step 8 - Determination of Permanent Project Step 9 - Monitoring
The types of neighborhood traffic control devices that can be used to regulate, warn, and guide traffic in residential areas include:
■	Diverters
*	Semi-diverters or partial street closures
*	Chokers
*	Turn restrictions
*	Turn channelization
*	Stop signs
■	Traffic Circles

Certain types of traffic control devices, such as stop signs, require satisfaction of specific criteria to justify installation. The City will study conditions within a neighborhood to determine if installation of traffic control devices is warranted.
Implementation of a successful neighborhood protection plan requires consultation with neighborhood residents because the associated physical modifications often result in modified neighborhood travel patterns. To discourage cut-through traffic, neighborhood streets must be made less attractive as alternate routes. This typically means making the street more difficult to access and slower to drive on - changes which residents will also experience. As appropriate, measures may be implemented on a temporary basis to test their effectiveness and gauge community reaction.

School Traffic Impacts
Most schools in La Puente were designed with the assumption that most students would walk. Trends indicate that many parents will continue to prefer dropping off and picking up children from school in automobiles. This traffic results in unique traffic congestion problems on local streets that were not designed to safely handle large peak-hour loading queues.
The City will work with local school districts to implement a Safe Routes to School program to ensure that safe and accessible pedestrian routes are created to local schools from surrounding	neighborhoods.
Additionally/ the City will work with the school districts to coordinate busing programs and expand ridesharing opportunities to relieve congestion and improve safety conditions during school drop-off and pick-up times. The City will ensure
that all busing options be fully considered before substantial roadway improvements are made in the vicinity of schools to ease congestion.
Many local streets in La Puente provide access to schools and other community facilities.

Alternatives to the Automobile
Promoting the use of alternative modes of circulation such as transit, bicycling, and walking produces a number of benefits, including reduced traffic, reduced need for expensive roadway improvements, reduced energy consumption, and improved air quality. Several options are available in La Puente, including public transit and facilities for pedestrians and cyclists.
Public Transit
Use of public transit reduces the number of vehicles on freeways and major highways and offers mobility to those who cannot or do not wish to drive. According to the 2000 US Census, in La Puente, approximately five percent of residents use public f	transit, and approximately twenty-
\	five percent carpool to work. Many
elderly and disabled persons rely on public transit to visit doctors, go
shopping, or attend activities at community facilities. Students rely on public transit to attend local schools and colleges.
Public transportation in La Puente consists of fixed-route bus service and demand responsive shuttles. These modes of transportation provide viable alternatives to use of the private automobile. Figure CI-4 shows the inter-city transit routes in La Puente and the local routes operated by La Puente Link. The City is committed to providing reliable and affordable transportation options to residents for work, shopping, and recreational trips.
Public transit is an important mode of travel for many La Puente residents.

Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)
La Puente is within the jurisdiction of the MTA, which provides
countywide public transportation. The MTA 484 Express Route (Los
Angeles/La Puente/Pomona via Valley Boulevard) runs along Valley
Boulevard, providing service on both weekdays and weekends. MTA
also administers a paratransit service to assist people with mobility
limitations. This service is offered to individuals whose disabilities
prevent them from using regular buses or rail service. It is comparable to
fixed-route service and offers 24-hour-a-day curb-to-curb service.

Foothill Transit
La Puente is also served by six Foothill Transit bus lines providing transportation to major employment and activity centers throughout the San Gabriel Valley. Two of the routes, Lines 486 and 488, are Express Routes running Monday through Friday. The remaining routes are Line 178 (Puente Hills Mall/West Covina/El Monte), Line 185 (Azusa, West Covina/Hacienda Heights), Line 274 (West Covina/Covina/Whittier), and Line 281 (Puente Hills Mall/Glendora).
Foothill Transit operates six bus routes in La Puente.
MetroLink
The Southern California Regional Rail Authority provides MetroLink rail service from Riverside to Los Angeles, with easy access for La Puente residents provided at the Industry, Baldwin Park, and El Monte stations.
La Puente Link
As a further expression of the desire to develop a balanced circulation system, the City operates an increasingly popular local public transportation system which provides intra-city transit within La Puente. La Puente Link offers bus service through the entire City seven days a week. Headways are approximately one hour, and fares are kept low, especially for seniors. The Green Line travels in a clockwise pattern, and the Yellow Line travels in a counterclockwise direction within the City. La Puente Link ties into regional transit services offered by Foothill Transit, MTA, and MetroLink.

La Puente Dial-A-Ride
The City also sponsors the La Puente Dial-A-Ride, an advance reservation transit service available to La Puente residents 55 years old and older or who are disabled. The Dial-A-Ride service provides rides to any destination within the City limits and to medical appointments up to five miles outside of the City limits.
To encourage the use of public transit and to assist in reducing vehicle emissions, the City provides significant public transportation subsidies. The subsidy program, allows City residents to purchase Foothill Transit, MTA bus and Metrolink Rail passes at substantially reduced rates. La Puente will continue to work with MTA, Foothill Transit, and Metrolink to provide regional transit opportunities for City residents.
The City seeks to ensure that bicycles can continue to be safely operated on the roadway system.
Bicycle Routes
In Southern California, where temperatures are generally moderate and weather conditions favorable, cycling offers a real option for residents to commute to work or school, if safe routes are available.
To improve non-automotive modes of
transportation, the City of La Puente has adopted a Master Plan of Bikeways. Due to the degree to which La Puente has been developed, the City's Master Plan of Bikeways is comprised entirely of Class III bicycle routes, where bicycles share the road with vehicles. Routes are signed, but no striped lane is generally provided.
La Puente's bicycle routes extend along portions of Sunset Avenue, Temple Avenue, Amar Road, and portions of Stimson Avenue, Main Street and Glendora Avenue near Downtown (See Figure CI-5). These routes coordinate with the East San Gabriel Valley Bikeway Master Plan and support both intra- and inter-city bicycle travel. The City encourages longer bicycling trips by supporting public transit efforts to provide bike parking facilities and allow bicycles on buses.

Circu
ation and Infrastructure Element
Pedestrian Circulation
For some, walking represents the primary mode of getting around. Walkability, access, and connections are necessary components of a circulation system that easily and specifically accommodates pedestrians. A circulation system that supports pedestrians includes wide sidewalks, safe street crossings, features that encourage cautious driving, and a safe environment.
To enhance pedestrian movement within the community, the City requires the installation of sidewalks in new developments. Eight feet of width along both sides of all new roadways are reserved for sidewalks or landscaped parkways. City development
standards require that sidewalks not be less than four feet in width unless the available portion of the highway or street is less. Some older neighborhoods lack sidewalks, and the City is committed to identifying locations where sidewalks are needed and installing them, as funding is available. As part of a multi-year program, ADA-compliant sidewalk access ramps are being installed throughout the City.
In order for sidewalks to be used frequently and effectively, they need to be kept free of obstructions. When equipment such as utility
poles, fire hydrants, and traffic controls or street lighting must be placed on the sidewalk, it should be placed to minimize interference with pedestrian flow. When street furniture becomes an obstacle to pedestrian flow, it should be removed.
Sidewalks not less than four feet in width are required part of new development projects along City streets.

Goal
3
Diverse alternative modes of transportation that are safe, efficient for commuters, responsive, and available to persons of all income levels and disabilities.
Policy 3.1	Work with Foothill Transit and MT A to increase the use of public transit,
establish or modify routes, and improve connectivity to regional services.
Policy 3.2	Maintain, to the extent fiscally feasible, and regularly evaluate the efficiency
and effectiveness of the La Puente Link and Dial-a-Ride services for City residents.
Policy 3.3	Maintain and expand sidewalk installation and repair programs, particularly
in areas where sidewalks link residential neighborhoods to local schools, parks, and shopping areas.
Policy 3.4	Improve mobility for residents by improving streets, supporting special
transit services, and subsidizing transit fares.
Policy 3.5	Maintain a citywide bicycle route and maintenance plan that promotes
V	efficient and safe bikeways integrated with regional bicycle systems.

Infrastructure and Public Facilities
As infrastructure ages, isolated failures can lead to overall system deficiencies. Planning for ongoing maintenance and upgrades to all infrastructure is important for protecting the City's financial investments and maintaining the quality of life for La Puente residents and businesses. For new development, infrastructure must be able to support new needs and demands.
Service Providers
As a contract city, La Puente relies upon other government agencies, private utility companies, and contractors to maintain and upgrade many of the community's major infrastructure systems. Service providers in La Puente are listed in Table CI-3. The Community Resources Element discusses water supply and quality. The Community Safety Element discusses flood hazards and flood control.
Page CI - 27
Circulation and Infrastructure Element
Under a contract with the City, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works maintains City streets, traffic signals, street signs, traffic markings, street, sidewalk, curb and gutter repair, and storm drain cleaning. The Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts 15 and 21 construct, operate, and maintain facilities to collect, treat, recycle, and dispose of sewage and industrial wastes and manage the nearby Puente Hills Landfill. A private contractor provides solid waste collection services.

The City recently conducted a comprehensive sewer and water infrastructure study to identify deficiencies in the present systems and provide for a long-range capital improvement program to maintain the system. The City's Sewer Master Plan identified needed improvements to increase the capacity of the City's wastewater system to accommodate future growth, as well as to improve efficiency of the existing system. These improvements include the repair of deficient sewer lines and the establishment of a preventative maintenance program. Because most of the City is built out, the Master Plan does not project significant increases in wastewater flows. The City, in close cooperation with service providers, will continue to monitor the condition of the community infrastructure systems and establish a long-term finance plan to enable the City to maintain and rehabilitate the system.

Circulation and Infrastructure Element
Communications
Similar in many ways to traditional infrastructure such as roads and sewer lines, digital and communication infrastructure provides a vital framework for the community. Communication infrastructure links the community with the nation and the world. Expanding access to and the capability of technology improves livability, economic growth, and provision of services for residents. Improved communications infrastructure helps institutions provide distance learning opportunities and services and commercial products directly to residents. The City encourages the advancement of communication technologies for public and private organizations to deliver high-quality communication services to the community.
Communications infrastructure can be creatively combined with other community facilities, such as ball field lights.
Goal
4
Provision of public facilities and infrastructure that support the needs of City residents and businesses.
Policy 4.1	Periodically inventory and monitor the condition of sewer, drainage, streets, and support facilities.
Policy 4.2	Establish a comprehensive plan to finance the ongoing maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation of City infrastructure systems.
Policy 4.3	Work with service providers to ensure that infrastructure investments are protected.
Policy 4.4	Encourage creative integration of telecommunication facilities with adjacent facilities and land uses.
Policy 4.5	Encourage the advancement of communication technologies for public and private organizations.

Dear Mr. Yamachika:
RE: Review of City of La Puente’s Adopted Housing Element
Thank you for submitting the City of La Puente’s housing element, adopted August 12, 2008 and received for review on September 2, 2008. Pursuant to Government Code Section 65585(h), the Department is required to review adopted elements and report the findings to the jurisdiction.
As you know, the Department’s July 18, 2008 review found the City of La Puente’s revised draft housing element addressed the statutory requirements of housing element law. As the adopted element is substantially the same as the draft, the Department is pleased to find the element in full compliance with State housing element law (Article 10.6 of the Government Code).
The Department applauds La Puente’s efforts to promote housing choices and affordability by adopting incentives to promote recycling of underutilized sites and increased densities to accommodate the City’s share of the regional housing need, especially for low- and moderate-income families and workers. These and other programs in the housing element provide an important and meaningful framework to address La Puente’s housing needs.
The Department wishes the City’s success in implementing its housing element and looks forward to following its progress through the General Plan annual progress reports due pursuant to Government Code Section 65400. If the Department can provide any assistance in implementing La Puente’s housing and land-use strategies, please contact Janet Myles, of our staff, at (916) 445-7412.
Sincerely,

Environmental analysis will be required for all development projects on art individual basis.
RESOLUTION NO. 08-4725
PAGE 2 OF 3
AUGUST 12, 2008
(b)	The 2008-2014 Housing Element Update (GPA No. 08-01) is consistent with La Puente General Plan and the other elements of the City's General Plan in that in and of itself it does not amend or alter the existing land use patterns established in the Land Use Element nor does it increase residential densities. The 2008-2014 Housing Element Update (GPA No. 08-01) does however, suggest consideration of future amendments in the General Land Use patterns and zoning to allow more medium and high density residential development to encourage the construction of affordable housing. When such future amendments are considered, appropriate environmental analysis and amendment processes will be conducted and prepared in compliance with applicable laws.
(c)	The 2008-2014 Housing Element Update (GPA No. 08-01) complies with the Article 10.6 (Housing Elements), of the California Government Code, Sections 65580 et seq.
3.	The City Council hereby finds that an environmental assessment has been prepared and conducted with respect to the 2008-2014 Housing Element Update (GPANo. 08-01) in compliance with CEQA and CEQA Guidelines. Further, the Planning Commission, after independent review and consideration of the information contained in the environmental documents, including but not limited to the Initial Study, comments and responses, finds that the 2008-2014 Housing Element Update (PA No. 08-01) will not result in any significant or potentially significant environmental impacts and thereby recommends approval of the Negative Declaration.
4.	Based on the findings and conclusions set forth above, the City Council hereby approves 2008-2014 Housing Element Update (GPA No. 08-01).

Housing Element
General
Introduction
State law, in recognition of the role of land use planning in local governments' provision of affordable housing, requires inclusion of a Housing Element in the General Plan for every jurisdiction. Cities and counties in California prepare their Housing Elements by consulting State Law, the existing General Plan, and community stakeholders. The result is a comprehensive strategy for providing affordable housing over the next five-year planning period.
Purpose and Organization of the Housing Element
The Housing Element is one of the seven mandatory elements of the General Plan. Through policies, procedures, and incentives, it provides an action-plan for maintaining and expanding tire housing supply in the City of La Puente.
La Puente's Housing Element for the planning period of July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2014 describes policies and programs include:
■ identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs, resources and constraints;
■ a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, and scheduled programs for preservation, improvement and development of housing;
■ identification of adequate sites for housing; and ■ adequate provision for existing and projected needs of all
economic segments of the community.
State Requirements and Legislative
Changes
The California Legislature states that a primary housing goal for the State is ensuring every resident has a decent home and suitable living

environment. Section 65580 of the California Government Codes describes tire goal in detail:
a.	The availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every Californian, including farm-workers, is a priority of the highest order.
b.	The early attainment of this goal requires cooperative participation of government and the private sector in an effort to expand housing opportunities and accommodate the housing needs of Californians of all economic levels.
c.	The provision of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households requires the cooperation of all levels of the government.
d.	Local and state governments have a responsibility to use the powers vested in them to facilitate the improvement and development of housing to make adequate provision for housing needs of all economic segments of the community.
e.	The Legislature recognizes that in carrying out this responsibility, each local government also has the responsibility to consider economic, environmental, and fiscal factors and community goals set forth in tire general plan and to cooperate with other local governments and tire state in addressing regional housing needs.
Section 65581 of the California Government Code reflects tire Legislative intent for mandating drat each City and County prepare a Housing Element:
a.	To assure that counties and cities recognize their responsibilities in contributing to the attainment of the state housing goal.
b.	To assure that counties and cities will prepare and implement housing elements which, along with federal and state programs, will move toward attainment of the state housing goals.
c.	To recognize that each locality is best capable of determining what efforts are required by it to contribute to tire attainment of the state housing goal, provided such a determination is compatible with the state housing goal and regional housing needs.

d.
To ensure that each local government cooperates with other local governments in order to address regional housing needs.
State law requires housing elements to be updated every five years to reflect a community's changing housing needs, unless otherwise extended by State legislation. The Government Code also requires that each draft Housing Element be reviewed by the California Department of Housing and Community Development and that the Department's findings be incorporated prior to adoption, or that specified findings be made in response to the Department's comments.
In response to changing State law pertinent to housing elements, this updated Housing Element addresses new State laws that are intended to facilitate and expedite the construction of affordable housing.
■	Extremely Low Income - AB2635 requires local jurisdictions to assess the housing needs of extremely low-income households, in addition to the established requirement to examine the needs of very-low, low-, and moderate-income households. The extremely low-income is defined as 0 to 30 percent of the Area Median Income. The Population characteristics and Constraints Analysis includes extremely low income households in its discussions on housing need.
■	Land Inventory and Analysis - AB2348 (Chapter 724) amended housing element law to include more specific requirements for the content of the land inventory and analysis section. Specifically, the land inventory must include parcel-specific listing of available sites including tire parcel number or "unique" reference.
■	Emergency shelters - SB2, Chapter 633 requires that local government asses homeless need and identify opportunities for addressing this need through siting of emergency shelters. Implementation Program 2.B.3 is included in the Housing Plan to comply with State law.
Relationship to Other General Plan
Elements
The 2004 La Puente General Plan includes five elements: community development; circulation and infrastructure; housing; community resources; and community safety. This Housing Element is consistent with the General Plan's policies and proposals. The Housing Element, for example, draws upon the development capacity levels given in the Community Development Element to determine tire appropriate location for affordable housing development.
Page H - 3

The City will ensure consistency between tire Housing Element and the General Plan, and as new policies are introduced, they will be coherent with existing elements. If any General Plan elements are updated, the Housing Element can also be modified to maintain consistency within the General Plan.
Community Outreach and Input
Section 6553(c)(6)(B) of the Government Code states, "The local government shall make diligent effort to achieve public participation of all economic segments of the community in the development of the housing element, and the program shall describe this effort." This process not only includes residents of the community, but also coordinates participation among local agencies and housing groups, community organizations, and housing sponsors. The result is more informed policies and programs for providing affordable housing.
In La Puente, the public was invited to participate in the update process at the following meetings:
•	Planning Commission Hearing on March 4, 2008
•	Planning Commission Hearing on May XX, 2008
•	City Council Hearing on June XX, 2008
hr addition tire public was invited to review the Draft Housing element which was made available prior to the initial Planning Commissions Meeting (from February 20 to March 4, 2008 at the City's main counter) and for public review on the City's website and at the City's main counter subsequent to the initial Planning Commissions Meeting from May 2, 2008 to June 4, 2008.
To ensure that the housing concerns of low- and moderate-income and special needs residents were addressed, individual invitation letters were distributed via email to agencies and organizations that serve tire low-and moderate-income and special needs community in La Puente. These agencies were invited to review and comment on tire 2008-2014 Housing Element and to attend the Planning Commission Hearing on June 4, 2008. Included in the invitations were:
• Independent Living Center San Gabriel/Pomona Valleys- a community-based organization providing services and advocacy by and for persons with all types of disabilities

•	East Valley Community Health Center - provides quality medical, counseling, and preventive education services to the low income and underserved populations of the East San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys
•	East San Gabriel Valley Coalition for the Homeless - a nonprofit organization, helping the homeless find shelter and needed services
•	Center for Integrated Family and Health Services (The Family Center)- provides a continuum of care, both integrated and comprehensive to a population of vulnerable and generally underserved families and children in the San Gabriel, Pomona and Whittier areas of Los Angeles County
•	YWCA-WINGS (Women in Need Growing Strong) - a multi-purpose Domestic Violence helps approximately 1400 women annually through its residential and non-residential site

Feedback received from tire service provider agencies is reflected in the Housing Element. The identified agencies and entities will be invited to participate at future public events and meetings to solicit input on implementation of Housing Element Programs. In the future this list of agencies will include all agencies or non-profit groups that work with lower-income and special needs residents and that receive City funding.
Specific Programs in the Housing Element will include consultation with agencies or groups that are directly related to the Program. For example: Program 20: Reasonable Accommodation will include consultation with service agencies that work with disabled and other special needs population. The consultation will ensure that the City's ordinance

reflects the needs, concerns, and experiences of the disabled population. Program 16: Extremely Low-Income Housing Needs includes an objective to solicit input on the addition of zoning ordinance provisions for homeless shelters from service agencies that work with extremely-low income persons and the homeless or persons/families at-risk of homelessness such as the East San Gabriel Valley Coalition for the Homeless (ESGVCH).
Data Resources
Data from a variety of resources inform the crafting of the Housing Element. One of the most cited sources is the 2000 Census; the Census, though dated, provides consistent demographic characteristics that are widely accepted. California Department of Finance 2007 Population and Housing supplements the 2000 Census data Additional information has been drawn from tire 2004 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data, which is drawn from Census 2000 data. CHAS data is based on special tabulations for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) horn sample Census data.

Needs Assessment
The Housing Needs Assessment provides the foundation for establishing the objectives, policies, and programs for addressing housing needs in La Puente. This assessment addresses population characteristics, employment patterns, and income levels. The information illustrates how La Puente has grown and changed, and helps the City identify patterns and trends relevant to housing policies and programs. Projections show how the community demographics are expected to change over the coming years.
The following sources were used to generate this demographic and housing profile of La Puente:
■	• U.S. Bureau of the Census
■	Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
■	California State Department of Finance
■	Various other sources
Data from tire Census Bureau's yearly American Community Survey were not used, however, as they are not yet available for La Puente or many other small jurisdictions.
Population Trends
As with any other largely built-out city, La Puente will have to address housing needs through such tools as redevelopment, infill development, and neighborhood revitalization. To clarify the type of housing that will be needed to meet anticipated future demand, Housing Element law requires an assessment of population and employment trends. Characteristics such as age, ethnicity, and employment influence the type and cost of housing needed or in high demand. Tracking demographic changes helps the City better plan for, respond to, or anticipate changing housing demand.
Population Growth
Between the 1990 and 2000, as reported by the Census, the population of La Puente grew approximately 11 percent, from 36,995 to 41,063 residents. While 11 percent growth appears substantial, this 10-year growth rate was low compared to other decades of the City's history (since incorporation in 1958). Only in the 1970s, when the population actually contracted slightly, was the growth slower. In the 1960s, for example, the population increased 26 percent (to 31,092), and in the 1980s,
Page H - 7

&nerii/yPhW
the City experience nearly 20 percent growth. The most recent population increase is due to in-migration of new residents as well as natural growth (i.e., people having children).

State Department of Finance population estimates made since the 2000 Census report growth of less than one percent per year between 2000 and 2007. The Department of Finance's January 2007 population estimate for La Puente is 43,338 persons.
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) periodically publishes growth forecasts for all jurisdictions within the six-county SCAG region. The most recent growth forecast (from 2004) projects a 2010 population in tire City of 44,001, growing to 51,464 persons by 2020 and 58,426 by 2030.

bi addition to population projections, several other demographic characteristics and trends define housing needs. Among these characteristics are age composition, racial and ethnic composition, and household size.
Age Distribution
Population age distribution serves as an important indicator of housing needs, as housing needs and preferences change as individuals or households grow older. Young families tend to focus more on cost and the ability to become first-time homebuyers. Cost and access to services are important to seniors because they may be on fixed incomes and have mobility limitations. Table 3 shows the age distribution of La Puente residents, as reported by the 2000 Census.
In 2000, young adults 25-44 years old constituted the largest age group, at 31 percent, followed by the school age group of 5-17 year-olds. Comparing tire City's age distribution with that of California as whole, the data show that this latter group is relatively large in La Puente, making up 25 percent of the City's population compared to 20 percent statewide. Correspondingly, La Puente's older age groups, specifically middle aged (45-64 years old) and seniors (65 plus) are comparatively small - five and three percentage points less than statewide, respectively. The City's senior population has, nevertheless, grown two percentage points from 1990, which in turn was a two-percentage point gain from 1980. The large proportion of school-age children and the increase in the
Page H - 9

GeneralTian
senior population means that demand will likely continue to grow for larger units for young families and smaller housing units for seniors, as well as housing programs such as housing repair services for the City's older residents.

Racial and Ethnic Composition
Table 4 shows the racial/ethnic distribution of population in La Puente. The City primarily became more Hispanic and less white between Census years 1990 and 2000. The Hispanic population grew by nine percentage points to 83 percent in 2000. This growth slightly outpaced that in the County as a whole, which saw its Hispanic population grow from 38 percent in 1990 to 45 percent in 2000. The percentage of Whites in La Puente halved from 15 to 7 percent over the same time period. Whites and persons of Asian or Pacific Island heritage are now tied for the second most populous ethnic/racial group in the City. The share of the population that identified itself as Black has remained veiy low: three percent in 1990 and two percent 2000.

Hottsehold Income Among Racial Groups
Figure 1 shows that the breakdown of median household earnings for the various major ethnic/racial categories significantly differs from that of the County as a whole. The most extreme case is with Blacks, who earned a median household income of $59,306 in La Puente, or almost double the income of Black households in Los Angeles County as a whole. The median income for Latinos in the City is also higher, by more than $7,000. White and Asian La Puente residents, on the other hand, earned less than these groups in the County at large - Asians nearly $5,000 less and Waites over $14,000 less.

Household Characteristics
Household type and size, income level, the presence of persons with special needs, and other household characteristics may affect access to and demand for housing and housing programs. This section details tire various household characteristics in La Puente.
Hotisehold Type and Size
Household characteristics and types can impact the type of housing needed. For instance, single-person households often occupy smaller apartment units or condominiums. Married couples often prefer larger single-family homes, particularly if they have children. This underscores tire need to provide a diversity of housing opportunities to give households of different ages and types the opportunity to live in La Puente.
The U.S. Census Bureau defines a household as all of tire people who occupy a housing writ. A housing unit can be airy sort of officially recognized dwelling - a home, an apartment, a mobile home, etc.
According to the California Department of Finance, at tire beginning of 2007, an average of 4.56 people lived in a La Puente household. This represents a 5.53 percent increase over the 4.32 average in January 2000. Not only did the average per household size rise, the total number of households rose as well, from 9,019 to 9,461, a five percent jump. The increased average household size probably is the result of more frequent co-habitation of extended families. La Puente's average household size is much higher than that of Los Angeles County as a whole, which averaged 3.13 persons per household. The neighboring cities of El Monte and South El Monte, however, both had similar household sizes, with 4.46 and 4.81 respectively. On tire other hand, two other neighbors, West Covina (3.49) and Diamond Bar (3.35), are closer to the County average
The data in Table 5 indicate that La Puente appears to be a stable, family-oriented community, with 86 percent of all households classified as families. The City has a much liigher proportion of family households than the County (68 percent), the State (69 percent), and the nation (68 percent). This proportion remained very stable between 1990, when it was 85 percent, and 2000.

Perhaps the most striking figure in Table 5 is the 37 percent increase in families with no children, a jump of almost 1,000 families over the course of the decade. This was marked by corresponding decreases in families with children and single households.
Household size and composition are often two interrelated factors. Communities with a large proportion of families with children tend to have a large average household size. In La Puente, however, the proportion of families without children has dramatically increased, while at the same time the average family size has also increased since 1990. The increase in household size may be due to an increase the number of extended family members sharing the home, while the increase in families without children may be due to the rise in the senior population, who tend not to have children in the household.
Income and Employment
Income Profile
Household income is the most important, although not the only factor, affecting housing opportunity because it determines a household's ability to purchase or rent housing, and to balance housing costs with other necessities. Income levels can vary considerably among households, affecting preferences for tenure, location, and housing type. While higher-income households have more discretionary income to spend on housing,
Page H - 14
Housing Element

Puente"*

&eneraPPhM'
low- and moderate-income households have a more limited choice in the housing they can afford.
The median household income in La Puente in 2000 was $41,222, slightly below the median household income for Los Angeles County ($42,189). Figure 3 shows that, in comparison with the County, La Puente has a smaller proportion of the very poorest residents earning less than $15,000 per year. The middle class, on the other hand, makes up a larger percentage of La Puente than it does in the County as a whole. In every income category from $15,000 to $99,999 per year, the City has a proportion greater than that of the County. In the wealthiest categories where households are earning more than $100,000 per year, however, the trend reverses.
For housing planning and funding purposes, tire State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) uses five income categories to evaluate housing need based on the Area Median Income (AMI) for the metropolitan area:
■	Extremely Low-Income Households earn between 0 and 30 percent of AMI
■	Very Low-Income Households earn between 31 and 50 percent of AMI
■	Low-Income Households earn between 51 and 80 percent of AMI
■	Moderate-Income Households earn between 81 and 120 percent of AMI
■	Above Moderate-Income Households earn over 120 percent of AMI

Figure 3
Household Income Distribution, 2000
The CHAS special Census tabulations developed for HUD provide a specific breakdown of household income adjusted for family size. As shown in Table 6, moderate- and above-moderate-income households comprise the largest share of all households, though the percentage of this category (54.4 percent) is somewhat less than that of the County (59.9 percent). Low-income households comprise tire second largest category. According to the 2000 CHAS, over 11 percent of the City's total households are classified as extremely low income (0-30 percent of AMI), 14 percent are classified as very low income (31-50 percent of AMI), and nearly 20 percent were classified as low income (51-80 percent AMI). The County slightly outpaces La Puente at both ends of the income spectrum, with somewhat higher percentages of moderate/above-moderate incomes as well as of extremely low incomes. The trend is reverse in tire very low- and low-income categories, where the City has slightly larger proportions than the County.

Tenure is closely correlated with income, as those households with lower incomes usually cannot afford to buy a home. Consistent with this fact, renters in La Puente earned significantly lower incomes overall, with more than 40 percent earning 50 percent or less of the median income for the County. This was a major difference between renter and owner households, as the proportion of owners earning less than half the median income was only 16 percent. Elderly renters are shown to be in the most precarious financial situation, with nearly two-thirds earning less than 50 percent of the median income.

Employment Trends
The City of La Puente is primarily a bedroom community for businesses throughout the region. Residents who do work within La Puente are primarily employed by small industrial and manufacturing businesses, as well as locally oriented retail centers.
According to the 2000 Census, an estimated 15,032 employed persons resided in La Puente. This number was slightly down from 1990, when 15,750 residents reported having jobs. This drop is significant, especially considering that the City7s overall population grew by over 4,100. The drop may be partly due to the increase in school age and senior populations, which are less likely to be employed.
Table 8 shows the type of occupations held by La Puente residents. Between 1990 and 2000, there was an increase in the proportion of residents in service occupations and a decrease in construction and maintenance jobs. This is an important trend, as service occupations have the lowest earnings (Table 7). At the same time, there was a large increase in the number of Production/Transportation jobs, which may be a result of the tremendous expansion of the volume at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach during the 1990s. La Puente residents proportionally hold much fewer managerial/professional jobs than County residents as a whole (15 percent compared to 33 percent), and about the same amount of service occupations (16 percent compared to 17 percent).

Special Needs Groups
Certain groups have more difficulty finding decent, affordable housing due to their special circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to one's income earning potential, family characteristics, the presence of physical or mental disabilities, or age-related health issues. As a result, certain groups typically earn lower incomes and have higher rates of overpayment for housing, or overcrowding. A central goal of the Housing Element is to assist in the housing of persons with special needs. Elderly
According to the 2000 Census, 3,148 senior residents lived in La Puente, representing 8 percent of the population. This was a 931 person (42 percent) increase over the 1990 Census figures. The City had 1,236 senior households,2 of which nearly 30 percent were renters and just over 70 percent were homeowners.
Many elderly persons have limited income potential, as they are most often retired and have fixed incomes (retirement funds and Social Security income). This poses a special problem with regard to housing affordability. This fact is supported by the 2000 Census which reported that 9 percent of all elderly households, or 150 households, were below the poverty level. The proportion of elderly households in poverty dropped slightly, from 10 to 9 percent, between Census 1990 and 2000, though the actual number increased from 124 to 150.
Disabled
Both mentally and physically disabled residents face housing access and safety challenges. Disabled people, in most cases, are of limited incomes, often receiving Social Security income only, with housing costs taking the majority of their monthly income. Because people with disabilities spend a higher percentage of income on housing, overcrowding is frequent as housing expenses are shared with others, oftentimes live-in caretakers. In addition, the adults often have the problems of securing and paying for childcare. They may have the further burden of obtaining an education or training for themselves to increase their incomes and their ability to find affordable housing. In addition, disabled persons may face difficulty finding accessible housing (housing that is made accessible to people with disabilities through the positioning of appliances and fixtures, the heights of installations and cabinets, layout of unit to facilitate wheelchair movement, etc.).

California State Code Title 24 requires all multiple-family residential developments of three or more units, and stacked condominium developments of four or more units, to be accessible to disabled persons. However, because Title 24 regulations were not in effect at the time that many of the City's housing units were constructed, it is likely that there exists a shortage of housing units accessible to people with disabilities.
Many La Puente residents have personal disabilities that prevent them from working, restrict their mobility, or make it difficult for them to care for themselves. In 2000, 21 percent of the population reported a disability, similar to the proportion at the County level (20 percent). Most strikingly, over half of the senior population (51 percent) reported a disability.

Families
State law identifies two specific family groups as having special housing needs: large families/households and families with female heads of households. The reasons for their special need status varies and may include lower income status, the presence of children, and the need for financial assistance, as well as the available of suitably sized housing.

Large Households
In general, large households (with five or more members) are identified as a group with special housing needs based on the limited availability of adequately sized, affordable housing units. Large households are often of lower income, frequently resulting in the overcrowding of smaller dwelling units and in time, accelerating unit deterioration.
The 2000 Census reported 3,836 large households (five or more members) in La Puente, of which 65 percent owned a home. These households are usually families with more than two children or families with extended family members such as in-laws or grandparents living in the same housing unit. According to CHAS data, 72 percent of large-family owners and 91 percent of large-family renters experienced one or more housing problems. Housing problems include overcrowding, cost burden, and substandard conditions.
Female Headed Households
Single-parent households require special consideration and assistance because of the greater need for day care, health care, and other services. Female-headed households with children particularly tend to have lower incomes, thus limiting housing availability for this group. In addition, these households have a greater need for accessible daycare and other supportive services.
In 2000, 1,655 female-headed households lived in La Puente, representing 17 percent of all households. Female-headed households with children made up nine percent of all households.
Farmworkers
According to the 2000 Census, only 17 residents of La Puente have jobs in the "Farming, Forestry and Fishing" industries. Due to the limited opportunities for agriculture in and around the City, it is likely that these persons are not farmworkers but are instead employed in plant nurseries, landscaping, or gardening companies. The City of La Puente is urbanized; no farming operations exist in the City. As such, the City has no need for farmworker housing, and the affordable housing needs of those who hold "Farming, Forestry and Fishing" occupations can be accommodated under programs such as Section 8.
Homeless Persons
The 2007 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count conducted by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) revealed a population of approximately 73,000 homeless in Los Angeles on a single night survey. The study projected that 141,737 are homeless annually in Los Angeles
Page H - 21
Housing Element
County.3 In La Puente, LAHSA estimates that there are approximately 222 homeless persons on City streets on a given night. This statistic is an estimate and should be used with caution, as the potential margin of error is likely high, as recognized by LAHSA, whenever the data are presented at the city level.4
The most reliable source of information on homelessness in the City of La Puente is the East San Gabriel Valley Coalition for the Homeless (ESGVCH). This non-profit organization provides emergency shelter and other forms of assistance to homeless families and persons, as well as at-risk low-income persons in the East San Gabriel Valley, which includes the City of La Puente. The ESGVCH is an active partner in with the Continuum of Care of Homeless Services in the East San Gabriel Valley. According to ESGVCH, approximately 281 individual homeless persons citing La Puente as their place of residence have utilized their services during the past year.
The ESGVCH provides its services to the area's homeless and at-risk populations through a series of facilities. These facilities include a Homeless Emergency Assistance Center in the neighboring city of Covina, a Services Access Center housed in the West Covina Community Services Center, and emergency winter shelters established in local churches on a rotating basis. In addition, homeless persons in La Puente are provided with transportation to these facilities from pick-up point in La Puente Park.
Rather than attempting to establish its own competing programs and facilities, the City of La Puente relies upon the services provided by ESGVCH. The City has allocated CDBG funds to financially assist the operations of the ESGVCH, which appears to adequately serve the needs of the local homeless population.

Housing Stock
Residential construction activities in the City have remained relatively moderate since its incorporation in 1958, Due to its limited land area and the built-out nature of the community, the residential development which has taken place has primarily consisted of infill or replacement development. During the 1990s, when the residential real estate market had a significant decline, housing growth in La Puente, at 4.0 percent, nevertheless slightly outpaced that of surrounding communities and the County as a whole, at 3.4 percent (Table 11). In the overheated market from 2000 to 2007, however, the City's housing stock increased only 0.4 percent compared with 3.5 percent in the County. This trend illustrates the scarcity of developable residential land in the community.

Housing Types
La Puente was developed as a community of single-family dwelling units and has primarily remained such. Although multiple-family residential construction accelerated during the 1970s and 1980s it slowed from the 1990s on. Of the 39 units built in the City from 2000 to 2007, only five of them were multi-family. Single-family structures now make up 72% of the City7s housing stock, with multi-family comprising nearly 27% and mobile homes filling out the remaining one percent.
La Puente’s housing supply is somewhat different than that of Los Angeles County as a whole. As is illustrated by the census and DOF figures shown in Table 12, La Puente has a higher percentage of singlefamily dwellings (72 percent for the City as compared to 55 percent for the County) and a lower percentage of mobile homes (1 percent for the City as compared to 2 percent for the County).

Tenure
Housing tenure refers to whether a unit is occupied by its owner or by a renter. Table 13 shows that the ratio of owners to renters in La Puente remained steady between 1990 and 2000, with roughly two-thirds of La Puente residents owning the home in which they live. This speaks to the stability of the City's residential neighborhoods. The City's housing stock was developed with the intention of providing reasonably priced, detached single-family home ownership opportunities. It remains owner-predominate today, with only 39% of units in La Puente occupied by renters.

Vacancy
The vacancy rate indicates a relationship between supply and demand. Four percent is considered to be a healthy vacancy rate - one that permits sufficient choice among a variety of housing units - though a healthy rate can be as low as two percent for ownership units and as high as five to six percent for rental units. A limited vacancy rate is an indication that demand for housing is outpacing supply and usually results in higher housing costs, reducing housing opportunities for lower-income households.
The 2007 vacancy rate of 2.1% reported by the Department of Finance (Table 13) was lower than the 3.6% optimum vacancy rate (Table 14) for the ratio of owner to rental housing that exists in La Puente. This low rate may indicate a lack of housing choice for some individuals in the community.

Housing Issues
Housing Condition
The age and condition of La Puente's housing stock is an indicator of potential rehabilitation needs. Commonly, housing over 30 years of age needs some form of major rehabilitation, such as a new roof, foundation work, plumbing, etc. La Puente's housing stock is aging. The age of the housing stock, as defined by the year the units were built, is shown in Figure 4. As of 2007, approximately 86 percent of all the housing units in the City were built before 1980. Fifty-six percent were built prior to 1960.
Page H - 25
oustng Element

In other words, many housing units in the City are likely in need of major rehabilitation, if routine maintenance has not been performed over time. Only about six percent of the units in La Puente were built between 1990 and 2007. City staff has confirmed that there are no housing units in need of demolition due to housing conditions.
The City offers both deferred loans as well as outright grants to qualifying homeowners as part of its Housing Rehabilitation Program. In fiscal years 2005 through 2007, the City made $520,000 in construction loans to 26 people and gave out $170,000 in construction grants to 34 people. An additional 34 people were given $2,000 grants each for the testing, abatement and clearance of asbestos and lead hazards.

Overcrozvding
In response to a mismatch between household income and housing costs in a community, some households may not be able to buy or rent housing that provides a reasonable level of privacy and space. Residents may accept smaller-sized housing or double up with other families to afford housing costs. An overcrowded household is defined as one with more than one person per room, excluding bathrooms, kitchens, hallways and porches. Severely overcrowded households are those with more than 1.5 persons per room. Overcrowding contributes to increases in traffic and

on-street parking within a neighborhood and accelerates deterioration of homes and infrastructure.
Table 15 shows the high incidence of overcrowding in La Puente. As indicated by the 2000 Census, nearly 40 percent of all housing units in the City were overcrowded, with almost 25 percent severely so. Though rates of moderate overcrowding (1-1.5 persons per room) are roughly equal for renter- and owner-occupied units, severe overcrowding is much more pronounced for renter households. Nearly 37 percent of all renter-occupied units are severely overcrowded, while only 16.8 percent of owner-occupied units are.
According to the 1990 Census, 32,5 percent of all households in the City were overcrowded, which means that the problem worsened measurably between 1990 and 2000. The City's 2000 overcrowding rate of 39.5 percent was also significantly higher than the rate for the County as a whole, which was 23 percent. The City has resources in place to address overcrowded conditions. Because most new developments in La Puente consist of 3-and 4-bedroom units, encouraging overall residential development and removing constraints to development are important goals. The primary financial resource available to assist overcrowded households is funding through the residential rehabilitation programs. The programs can provide financial assistance for the construction of bedroom additions to eliminate overcrowding conditions. To further encourage the use of this valuable resource, the City will expand marketing of this program to target households living in crowded conditions.

Housing Costs
The cost of housing in a community is directly correlated to the number of housing problems and affordability issues. High housing costs can price low-income families out of the market cause extreme cost burdens, or force households into overcrowded or substandard conditions. Ownership Housing
The median La Puente home price in October 2007 was $400,000. This was over 13 percent lower than the median price in October 2006. (This figure reflects a sample size of 32 units sold.) While much of the region is expected to see home prices decline following the sub-prime mortgage market collapse of 2007, overall home sale prices throughout Southern California are expected to continue to be dramatically higher than in 2000. The median home price in Los Angeles County as a whole was $100,000 higher than in La Puente, and had only seen a drop of nearly five percent from the previous year, from $525,000 to $500,000.
According to DataQuick, only one condominium sold in La Puente in October, 2007, for $330,000.

Rental Housing
According to the Census, 39.1 percent of La Puente households live in rental housing. In December 2007, rents in La Puente ranged from $950 to $1,025 for a one-bedroom unit, between $1,135 and $1,300 for a two-bedroom unit, and between $1,495 and $1,850 for a three-bedroom unit.5 These rents generally fall within the range of HUD-determined fair market rents for the County of Los Angeles (Table 17).

Overpayment
State and federal standards specify that households spending more than 30 percent of gross annual income on housing experience a housing cost burden. Housing cost burdens occur when housing costs increase faster than household income. When a household spends more than 30 percent of its income on housing costs, it has less disposable income for other necessities such as health care. In the event of unexpected circumstances such as loss of employment or health problems, lower-income households with a burdensome housing cost are more likely to become homeless or double up with other households. Homeowners with a housing cost burden have the option of selling the homes and become renters. Renters, on the other hand, are vulnerable and subject to constant changes in the housing market.
Table 18 shows the connection between income, household type, and cost burden. The proportion of households experiencing cost burden declined significantly as income increased. Overall cost burden was more prevalent among renter households in all income categories. In particular, extremely-low-income large family renters (90 percent) and very-low-income large family renter households (85 percent) had the highest proportion of cost burden compared with the proportion experiencing cost burden citywide (34 percent) .Significantly, a lower proportion of extremely low-income renters experienced housing cost burden as compared to very-low- and low-income renters. This is likely due to increased subsidies available to those of extremely low income.

Affordability
Affordability is determined by comparing the cost of housing to the income of local households. High housing costs in Los Angeles County impact communities far beyond the affordability problem. The lack of affordable housing contributed to high levels of housing cost burden, overcrowding, and even homelessness. In assessing housing affordability, the California Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5 provides the following definition of affordable housing cost based on the area median income level (AMI) adjusted by family size and income level:
Calculation of Affordable Housing Cost
	Owner	Rental
Extremely Low (0-30% AMI) Very Low (0-50% AMI) Lower (51-80% AMI) Moderate Income (81-120% AMI)	30% of 30% AMI 30% of 50% AMI 30% of 70% AMI 35% of 110% AMI	30% of 30% AMI 30% of 50% AMI 30% of 60% AMI 30% of 110% AMI

Comparing housing costs and maximum affordable prices for low-income households shows that low-income households are being priced out of the Los Angeles County rental and ownership market. Given the median home prices presented in Table 16, single-family home ownership is beyond the reach even of most moderate-income households. Even condominiums are likely to be too expensive to be bought without incurring a cost burden.
In the rental market, extremely low-income households generally cannot afford the market rents in La Puente without paying more than 30 percent of their income. While some low-income households may be able to afford one- bedroom units in the City, such units are too small for large households. Moderate-income large families may be able to afford a modestly priced three-bedroom home without incurring a cost burden. Affordable Hotising in La Puente
Project-based Section 8
The only subsidized affordable housing in La Puente is funded primarily through "project-based" Section 8. Project-based funding is provided by HUD through its New Construction, Substantial Rehabilitation, and/or Loan Management Set-Aside (LMSA) Programs. This funding, which generally is in the form of a subsidized mortgage, comes with the requirement that a percentage of the units in the building be affordable for a contractually determined period. While many of these contracts were long term (15 to 20 years) at the beginning of the project-based Section 8 program, now they are mostly one to two years in length. Though these contracts are usually renewed by the building owner, the fact that they do not have to be renewed means that many project-based Section 8 subsidized units face the ever-present possibility of conversion to market rate.
In order for an owner of a project-based subsidized building to opt out of the Section 8 program, he or she is required to provide at least one-year's notice to residents, the local HUD contract administrator, and the local jurisdiction. According to the Los Angeles LOMOD Corporation,6 the HUD contract administrator for the Los Angeles area, none of the owners of the four project-based Section 8 buildings in La Puente had given notice of intent to withdraw from the program as of December 2007.
6 The Los Angeles LOMOD Corporation is a non-profit corporation founded by the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA). Los Angeles LOMOD operates independently of HACLA and its mission is to provide and support good quality housing for low-income families, seniors, and people with disabilities.

None of the four subsidized properties listed in Table 20 is owned by a non-profit/ increasing the eventual risk of conversion to market rate. Three of them are owned by for-profit companies and the fourth/ Amar Plaza/ is a cooperative/ jointly owned by the tenants of the property. According to the manager of Amar Plaza, each prospective tenant has to put up just under $20,000 per household/ in exchange for which they receive a share in the corporation that owns the building/ as well as the right to rent a two- or three-bedroom unit at a rate significantly below market. In addition to the Section 8 funding/ the building's mortgage is also subsidized under Section 236. This portion of the mortgage is close to being paid off/ however, meaning that affordability of the units in the building would only be guaranteed by the short-term Section 8 contract. The coining expiration of the Section 236 restrictions and tire building's cooperative ownership structure make it quite possible that it will be converted to condominiums in the near future. The tenants/ as owners of the corporation/ would of course have to approve any such conversion/ but such approval seems likely given the probable buyout amount to be offered by a converter/ especially when compared with an initial investment of $20/000.

At-Risk Units
Over the next ten years (2008-2018), all four federally assisted developments in La Puente, which provide 333 affordable units, have expiring affordability covenants (Table 20). Three of these projects - La Villa Puente Apartments, La Puente Park Apartments, and Nantes Manor
Page H - 33
Housing Element

- are owned by for-profit corporations (La Villa Puente is a limited-dividend corporation). It is unknown at this time whether the owners will renew the Section 8 contracts for these properties or not The fourth development/ Amar Plazaz is cooperatively owned by its tenants/ as described above. This development is very likely to convert to market-rate units over the next decade.
Preservation and Replacement Options
Preservation of at-risk projects can be achieved in a variety of waysz with adequate funding availability. These include:
■	Transfer of ownership to nonprofit developers and housing organizations
■	Providing rental assistance to renters through other funding sources
■	Purchase affordability covenants
■	Refinance mortgage revenue bonds
Alternatively/ units that are converted to market rate may be replaced with new, assisted/ multi-family units with specified affordability timeframes.
Transfer of Ownership
Transferring ownership of the affordable units to a nonprofit housing organization is a viable way to preserve affordable housing for the long term and increases the number of government resources available to the project. The feasibility of this option depends upon the willingness of the owner to sell/ funding sources to actually buy the property/ and the existence of a nonprofit organization with sufficient administrative capacity to manage the property. Additionally/ projects in which all of the units are affordable/ rather than just a portion/ are more likely to be feasible because they can participate in ownership transfers more simply.
The City will consult annually with property owners of affordable housing in the City to gauge the likelihood of conversion of affordable units and discuss opportunities for the preservation of affordable housing units at risk of converting to market rents. If any properties indicate plans to convert to market rate, the City will contact qualified entities to explore transfer of ownership options. The entities will be select from the State's list of qualified entities to acquire/manage affordable housing and may include Jamboree Housing Corporation which is identified by the State as a qualified entity/ have knowledge of La Puente based on previous developments.

Rental Assistance
State, local, or other funding sources can also be used to provide rental subsidies to maintain the affordability of at-risk projects. These subsidies can be structured to mirror the Section 8 program, whereby the subsidy covers tire cost of the unit above what is determined to be affordable for the tenant's household income (including a utility allowance) up to the fair market value of the apartment. Given the mix of unit sizes of the at-risk developments, the total annual subsidy to maintain the 333 at-risk units is estimated at between $900,000 and $4.1 million, depending on the level of affordability of the units. Table 22 shows the calculation, assuming that all units are affordable to moderate-income households, while Table 23 shows the calculation for very low-income households.

Purchase Affordability Covenants
Another option to preserve the affordability of at-risk projects is to provide an incentive package to the owners to maintain tire projects as low-income housing. Incentives could include writing down the interest rate on the remaining loan balance and/or supplementing the Section 8 subsidy received to market levels. The feasibility of this option depends on whether the complexes require rehabilitation, or are too highly leveraged. By providing lump-sum financial incentives or on-going subsidies in rents or reduced mortgage interest rates to the owner, the City can ensure that some or all of the units remain affordable.

Construction of Replacement Units
The construction of new low-income housing can be a means to replace at-risk units. The cost of developing new housing depends on a variety of factors, including density, size of units, construction quality and type, location, and land cost. Assuming a development cost of $200,000 for a multi-family unit, the cost of replacing all 333 affordable, at-risk units would be approximately $67 million.
Estimates of Housing Need
Several factors influence the degree of demand, or "need," for housing in La Puente. The four major needs categories considered in this element are:
■	Housing needs resulting from population growth, both in the City and the surrounding region;
■	Housing needs resulting form the overcrowding of units;
■	Housing needs that result when households pay more than they can afford for housing; and
■	Housing needs of "special needs groups" such as 1116 elderly, large families, female-headed households, households with a disabled person, farmworkers, and the homeless.

CHAS data, developed by the Census for HUD, provides detailed information on housing needs (e.g. housing cost burden) by income level for different types of households in La Puente. The CHAS defines housing problems to include:
■	Units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom)
■	Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room)
■	Housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 30% of gross income
■	Severe cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50% of gross income

Specific households in La Puente had disproportionate housing needs. In general, renter-households had a higher level of housing problems (69.9 percent) compared to owner households (52.6 percent). Among the 370 elderly renter-households in the City, 291 or 79 percent are at or below 80 percent of Area Median Income. Nearly 58 percent of this category has one or more housing problems. Large renter families, which are by far the category most affected by housing problems, constitute about 14 percent of all households in the City. Over 91 percent of large renter families reported having some housing problems.
Projected Housing Need
California General Plan law requires each city and county to have land zoned to accommodate its fair share of the regional housing need. The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), in conjunction with the SCAG, determine a projected housing need for the region covered by SCAG, including the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura and Imperial. This share, known as the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), is 504,758 new housing units for tire 2008-2014 planning period. SCAG has, in turn, allocated this share among its constituent jurisdictions, distributing to each its own RHNA divided along income levels. The City of La Puente has a RHNA of 807 housing units to accommodate in the housing element period. The income distribution is as shown in Table 26.

Constraints Analysis
While the City of La Puente recognizes the need for the development of sound, affordable housing for all its residents, this goal is not easy to achieve. The built-out nature of La Puente leaves few opportunity areas for new development. The key factors constraining hoirsing development include land availability, the economics of development, and governmental regulations, all of which may impact the cost and amount of housing produced. These constraints may result in housing that is not affordable to low- and moderate-income households, or may make new residential construction economically difficult for developers. Constraints to housing production significantly impact households with lower incomes and special needs. State law requires that Housing Elements analyze potential and actual governmental and non-governmental constraints to the production, maintenance, and improvement of housing for all persons of all income levels and disabilities. In La Puente, constraints to housing are often related to the overall housing market and are part of regional trends over which the City has no control.
This section discusses potential constraints on the provision and cost of housing development in La Puente. According to State Housing Element Law, the constraints analysis must also demonstrate local efforts to remove barriers to achievement of goals for housing production and housing for persons with disabilities. Should constraints preclude the achievement of housing goals, jurisdictions are required to address and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing. Where constraints to housing production related to the City's regulations or land use controls are identified, appropriate programs to mitigate these constraints are included in the Housing Plan.
Market Constraints
Many factors affecting housing costs are related to the larger housing market. The availability of land, the cost and availability of financing the price of land, and the cost of construction all contribute to the cost of housing, and can hinder the production of affordable housing. Additionally, the availability of financing can limit access to homeownership for some low-income households.
Page H - 41
Housing Element
&?neral%fa&
Development Costs
A significant cost factor associated with residential building is the cost of building materials, which can comprise a significant portion of the sales price of a home. An indicator of construction costs is Building Valuation Data compiled by the International Code Council (ICC). The unit costs compiled by the ICC include structural, electrical, plumbing, and mechanical work, in addition to interior finish and normal site preparation. The data are national and do not take into account regional differences, nor do the data include the price of the land upon which the building is built. The national averages for costs per square foot unit of apartments and single-family homes are as follows:
■	Type I or II, Multi-Family: $111.73 to $126.43 per sq. ft.
■	Type V Wood Frame, Multi-Family: $86.28 to $90.83 per sq. ft.
■	Type V Wood Frame, One and Two Family Dwelling: $94.06 to $99.79 per sq. ft
The unit costs for residential care facilities generally range between $109 and $150 per square foot. These costs are exclusive of the costs of land and soft costs, such as entitlements, financing, etc. The City's ability to mitigate high construction costs is limited without direct subsidies.
A reduction in amenities and quality of building materials (above a minimum level of acceptability for health, safety, and adequate performance) could result in lower sales prices. Additionally, manufactured housing (including both mobile homes and modular housing) may provide for lower priced housing by reducing construction and labor costs. The cost per square foot of a mobile home ranges from $45 to $55. A modular single family dwelling typically costs approximately 85 percent of what a typical wood-frame dwelling would cost.
Another factor related to construction cost is development density. With an increase in the number of units built in a project, overall costs generally decrease as builders can benefit from the economies of scale. This reduction in costs is of particular benefit when density bonuses are utilized for the provision of affordable housing.
The price of land is can be the most significant component of housing development costs. Land costs may vary depending on whether the site is vacant or has an existing use that must be removed. Similarly, site constraints such as environmental issues (steep slopes, soil stability, seismic hazards, or flooding) can also be factored into the cost of land. The cost of land in La Puente and surrounding cities has risen
Page H - 42
Housing Element
substantially over the past decade due to a decrease in the availability of vacant or otherwise developable land in the greater Los Angeles region. Current land costs in La Puente are similar to land costs in the neighboring cities of Covina, West Covina, Baldwin Park, and in County unincorporated areas. The land prices in Table 27 are based on sales of vacant residential land in December 2007.

Source: MLS Listings, December 2007
Vacant land in La Puente and surrounding areas generally averages around $20.00 per square foot; vacant land with full entitlement approvals averages over $50.00 per square foot. The high cost of land is a contributing factor to the lack of affordable housing in Southern California, particularly in cities lacking vacant residentially zoned parcels, such as La Puente.
Land Availability
The City of La Puente is nearly built-out. There are few remaining parcels that have not been previously developed, and those that do remain are generally less than an acre in size. A survey of MLS listings in December 2007 revealed only one 0,36 acre vacant residentially zoned parcel in the City for sale. Therefore, the City will have to rely heavily on the recycling and intensification of existing residential uses in the future. This lack of
Page H - 43

Housing Element
raw land is a significant constraint on the development of new housing. The costs and other complexities associated with the creation of new housing through the recycling of currently developed properties makes the provision of affordable housing even more difficult. However, smaller infill projects, as well as higher-density mixed-use development in the Downtown Business District, may be feasible projects to explore.
Labor Cost
The California Labor Code applies prevailing wage rates to public works projects exceeding $1,000 in value. Public works projects include construction, alteration, installation, demolition, or repair work performed under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of public funds. State law exempts affordable housing projects from the prevailing wage requirement if they are financially assisted with only redevelopment housing set-aside funds. However, if other public funds are involved, which is often the case, prevailing wage rates may still apply. While the cost differential in prevailing and standard wages varies based on the skill level of the occupation, prevailing wages tend to add to the overall cost of development. In the case of affordable housing projects, prevailing wage requirements could effectively reduce the number of affordable units that can be achieved with public subsidies.
Availability of Mortgage and Rehabilitation Financing
The availability of financing affects a person's ability to purchase or improve a home; the cost of borrowing money for residential development is incorporated directly into the sales price or rent. Interest rates are determined by national policies and economic conditions, and there is virtually nothing a local government can do to affect these rates. Jurisdictions can, however, offer interest rate write-downs to extend home purchasing opportunities to a broader economic segment of the population. In addition, government-insured loan programs are an option available to some households to reduce mortgage requirements.
Under the federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to disclose information on the disposition of loan applications and the income, gender, and race of loan applicants. The availability of financing for a home greatly affects a person's ability to purchase a home or invest in repairs and improvements.
As shown in Table 28, a total of nearly 300,000 households applied for conventional mortgage loans to purchase homes in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale MSA during 2006, of which La Puente is a part. The data includes purchases of one- to four-unit homes, as well as manufactured

homes. Close to 90 percent of the loan applications were received from households that reported their income as above moderate-income (earning greater than 120 percent of Median Family Income [MFI]). Moderate-income households (80 to 120 percent of MFI) and lower-income households (less than 80 percent MFI) accounted for four percent and one percent,, respectively. More than half of the applications were originated (approved by lenders and accepted by applicants) and nearly 23 percent were denied, with the remaining 26 percent of the applications withdrawn, closed for incompleteness, or not accepted by the applicants (see Table 28). As expected, the denial rate was lowest for the moderate-and upper-income groups.

Origination rates can be expected to contract further, as a recent national survey conducted by the Federal Reserve found that 60 percent of banks responding reported they had tightened their lending standards for subprime mortgages. Additionally, 40 percent of responding banks said they had tightened lending standards for prime mortgages in the prior three months for people with the best credit records, while none reported easing standards.10
Government-backed lending represents a significant, although underutilized, alternative financing option for La Puente residents. Only 332 Los Angeles-area households applied for government-backed lending

in 2006. Surprisingly, very few lower-income households took advantage of government-backed lending such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the denial rate for low-income applicant households was higher than that for moderate- and upper-income applicants. Usually, low-income households have a much better chance of getting a government-assisted loan than a conventional loan. However, the recent lending market offered other loan options such as zero percent down, interest-only, and adjustable loans. As a result, government-backed loans have been a less attractive option for many households.

Interest rates substantially impact home construction, purchase, and improvement costs. A fluctuation in rates of just 2.5 percent can make a drastic difference in the annual income needed to qualify for a loan. In the recent past, La Puente and the country as a whole have experienced interest rates at historically low levels, enabling many households to purchase a home. These rates have risen over the past few years, and many households - particularly households with adjustable rate mortgages - have realized that they are unable to pay new mortgage rates. However, as the Federal Reserve lowered rates in September and October 2007, options for refinancing are again becoming an option. Even so, the availability and cost of capital required for pre-development costs for new housing, such as land purchase option money and project design and entitlement processing, as well as uncertainty in the larger housing market, remain a deterrent to development of affordable multi-family housing.

The recent increases in interest rates have also resulted in an increase in the number of foreclosures for households with sub-prime loans. In many cases, financing for these homes was made through the sub-prime credit market. Sub-prime loans are characterized by higher interest rates and fees than prime loans, and are more likely to include prepayment penalties. Los Angeles County reported the lowest overall increase in notices of default of any area in Southern California; however, this still represented an increase of 126 percent from the second quarter in 2006. The median increase for Southern California was 151 percent.

Governmental Constraints
Housing affordability can be affected by factors in both the private and public sectors. Actions by the City can have an impact on the price and availability of housing. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, building codes, fees, and other local programs intended to improve the quality of housing may serve as a constraint to housing development. Public pohcies can affect overall housing availability, adequacy, and affordability. Consistent with State law (Section 65583) this section addresses six potential constraints to housing development:
■	Land use controls
* Building codes and their enforcement
■	Site improvements (on and off-site)
■	Fees and exactions
■	Processing and permit procedures
■	Housing for people with disabilities

Land Use Controls
Development and growth in La Puente are issues of critical importance to City government and residents. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, building codes, fees, and other local programs to improve the overall quality of housing may serve as a constraint to housing development. Land use controls set forth by the General Plan and Municipal Code Chapter 10 (Zoning) could have direct effects on tire availability and affordability of housing in the City. Controls currently in place in La Puente are described below.
General Plan Community Development Element
The City completed a comprehensive update of its General Plan in 2004. The Community Development Element sets forth the City's policies for guiding local development and growth. These policies, together with zoning regulations, establish the amount and distribution of land uses within the City. The Community Development Element provides residential development opportunities consistent with those allowed under the City's existing R-E, R-l, R-2, R-3, and R-4 zones.12 It also introduced a new mixed-use development category that promotes development of mixed commercial, office, and residential uses in the downtown business district, consistent with the goals of the Downtown Business District Specific Plan.
The Community Development Element includes a projection of the number of housing units that will exist at build out pursuant to the Land Use Plan. At build-out, 10,459 housing units can be accommodated in La Puente. According to the Census, 9,660 units existed in 2000. Department of Finance estimates indicate that the current housing stock is approximately 9,699 (reported in May of 2007). Thus, current land use policy allows for a maximum potential of another 760 units, although this number is flexible, depending upon the actual density yields of individual development projects.
12	The City of La Puente is undergoing a Comprehensive Zoning Regulations update. Initial draft changes to the Zoning Regulations have been incorporated as much as possible, including changes in development standards for all zones and the consolidation of the R-S (Residential Suburban) Zone into R-l, and the R-VL (Multiple Residential) Zone into R-2.

Note 1: The General Plan and Comprehensive Zoning Regulations allow for higher densities based on the type of development proposed. See discussion below.
Source: City of La Puente General Plan
Residential land use designations are dispersed throughout the City. Densities range from one to seven units per acre for Low Density areas and to up to 26 units per acre in the High Density Residential areas. Much of the land designated for residential development is already built out. Additional residential development/ however/ can be accommodated through the development of the few remaining parcels of vacant land and recycling of uses on underutilized properties.
The Community Development Element designates over two-thirds of the City's land for residential use. In addition/11 acres are designated Mixed-Use (MIX)/ which allows residential uses to be integrated with

vertically, with residential dwellings above street-level office and retail businesses in all areas designated for mixed use, and stand-alone multiple-family developments are allowed in certain subareas of the designation. The higher densities allowed in the MIX designation creates opportunities for providing affordable housing. Since adoption of the General Plan, the City has approved one mixed-use project, located on First Street. The project includes 48 units at a density of approximately 49 units per acre.
Residential Development Standards
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development primarily through the Title 10 - Zoning of the Municipal Code. Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of residents, as well as implement the policies of the City's General Plan. The zoning regulations also serve to preserve the character and integrity of existing neighborhoods.

Open Space
To improve the living environment of residential neighborhoods, communities typically require housing to have a certain amount of open space, such as yards, common space, and landscaping. In La Puente, open space is reflected in setbacks and lot coverage requirements for single-family developments and minimum required open space areas for multifamily developments. For single-family homes in any district, buildings may cover up to between 40 and 50 percent of the lot, leaving the remaining 60 to 50 percent for open space. Most of this open space is located within the required front and back yards.
Zones R-2, R-3, and R-4 require 100 square feet of open space for each one-bedroom dwelling unit, with the minimum dimension for the open yard or patio being 10 feet If, however, the open space is provided through balcony space, the minimum dimension is 7 feet. For each dwelling unit with more than one bedroom, an additional one hundred square feet of open space per bedroom must be provided. The PUD zone requires a minimum of 200 feet for private open space. Zoning regulations also require that multi-family projects including eight or more units provide additional space for community recreation (common open space), at 200 square feet per dwelling unit. In the PUD zone, community recreation facilities must comprise at least 20 percent of the net project area.
La Puente7s open space standards mirror those of similar suburban communities and are not considered a constraint to development Parking
City parking standards for residential developments are tailored to the vehicle ownership patterns associated with different residential uses. The Zoning Ordinance requires parking based on the number of units on the property. Parking requirements for residential uses are listed in Table 33 13
13	Public notice (and notice of the impending two-story building mailed to all owners within a 250 foot radius of subject site) is required for buildings exceeding one story in the R-E and R-l zone.

For single-family developments, Tide 10 requires two parking spaces within an enclosed garage or carport. Multi-family residential requirements vary based on the number of bedrooms in each unit, and also require guest parking. These parking standards are comparable to those found in other Southern California cities.

Planned Residential Unit Developments
The planned residential unit development (PUD) zone is intended to allow greater design flexibility and to encourage well-planned developments. An unclassified use permit, tentative tract map, and final tract map are required to develop a planned residential unit development. The PUD zone permits single-family residential dwellings, accessory buildings and structures, similar community facilities related to a planned residential unit development, and the planned residential unit development. Public and private parks, open space, and recreational facilities are also permitted by right.
Mixed-use Development Standards
The City's overriding constraint with regard to residential development is the lack of vacant land. With the introduction of a mixed-use designation into the General Plan in 2004 to be consistent with the mixed-use areas provided for in the Downtown Business District Specific Plan, the City has provided expanded opportunities for different types of housing and increased densities. Table 34 identifies the development standards for the two areas of the Downtown Business District that permit residential uses.
14	According to Title 10, multi-family housing containing eight or more units must provide an additional guest space for each eight dwelling units in the development.

Setback requirements are also tailored for the DBD to reflect the commercial nature of the ground floor of developments within the mixed-use areas. On each of the primary streets (Main Street, Glendora Avenue, First Street, Second Street, and Third Street), a 10-foot setback from the right-of way is required for sidewalks. No sideyard is required, and rear yards must be a 12 feet in depth at a minimum, unless a reduced

yard is necessary to accommodate required on-site parking, circulation aisles, and dedication of alley rights-of-way.
In addition to allowing decreased parking requirements for senior residential developments in the DBD specific plan area, at the discretion of the Planning Commission, payment of fees may be paid in lieu of providing parking spaces. Criteria used to determine if parking should be reduced, and payment of in lieu fees, includes pedestrian orientation of commercial uses, incompatibility of parking areas with adjacent uses, and efficiency in site planning. The Specific Plan allows for flexibility in design and density in the City's Downtown area. However, Title 10 provisions for the DBD area differ on some development standards, including height restrictions. The City will revise Title 10, as part of a comprehensive update process recently initiated, to make the development standards for the Downtown Business District (DBD) consistent with the Downtown Business District Specific Plan. Alternatively, the City may eliminate the DBD zone and let the Specific Plan regulate development in the area.
Providing for a Variety of Housing Types
The Community Development Element and Title 10 contain the basic standards that allow for the development of a variety of housing types. Title 10 development standards are considered standard for suburban communities in Los Angeles County and Southern California and do not impede the ability to develop housing at appropriate densities. Table 34 lists the allowed location of specific uses. To better facilitate the understanding of housing types permitted in zones in the City, a matrix of approved uses in residential zones will be incorporated into the comprehensively updated Title 10.

Multi-Family Housing
Multi-family housing is permitted by right in the R-3 and R-4 zones and
all areas designated as mixed-use on the General Plan Land Use Policy
Map. Multi-family developments in residential zones are subject to
regulations related to the distance between buildings, as this distance is
not permitted to be less than 15 feet. Additional privacy standards related
to the placement of windows are also required in all multi-family housing
projects.
Second Units
As indicated in Table 36, La Puente permits the creation of second units
on all residential sites containing an existing single-family home,
consistent with State law. Conditions of approval for second units are
Page H - 55

Housing Element
standard and do not impede the creation of second units. These conditions include:
■	A maximum of one second unit on each lot.
■	The gross floor area for the accessory dwelling unit must not exceed 35 percent of the existing residence.
■	Separate utility hookups are prohibited.
■	The second unit must be compatible with the existing primary residence in terms of form, material, and architectural design.
■	The unit must be attached to the primary residence; however, the entrance to the second unit must be located on a different building elevation than the main entrance of the primary residence.
■	Second units must include one off-street parking space in a garage or carport. If there is more than one bedroom in an accessory dwelling unit, two parking spaces must be provided.
Section 10.60.020 of the Zoning Ordinance lists unclassified uses that are permitted with an unclassified use permit (akin to a conditional use permit) in La Puente. This section indicates that accessory dwelling units, or second units, require an unclassified use permit. However, as noted above, second units are permitted by right in all residential zones that permit single family homes. Because the section, which has not been modified to comply with current State law, may contribute to misunderstandings regarding City policy on second units, the City shall modify Title 10 to remove second units as a unclassified use from this section.
Senior Citizen Housing
To facilitate the development of affordable senior citizen housing (multi-family housing units that are restricted to elderly persons of lower income), the City allows the development of senior citizen housing in the PUD, P-3, P-4, C-l, and C-2 zoning districts, subject to the preparation of a specific plan. The senior citizen housing project development standards are intended to provide a greater flexibility in design to promote a more desirable living environment and to encourage, due to the unique needs of senior citizens, a more creative and efficient approach to land development. The intent of requiring a specific plan is to foster flexibility to encourage efficient utilization of property and thereby reduce costs to the senior citizen resident. However, these aims could be achieved through a less onerous permitting process than a specific plan, and this issue will be addressed as part of the City's current comprehensive update of Title 10 (Program 13).
Developers have used this option to approve two large-scale senior housing developments in La Puente: the completed Sunny Garden
Page H - 56
Housing Element
* ./W........................................' .r*’-

Specific Plan (1988) and the proposed Unruh Specific Plan-Pueblo Bonito (2007). Sunny Garden Specific Plan consists of 95 residential units (94 senior units and one manager unit) on 1.67 acres, yielding a density of 56.9 dwelling units per acre. Two parking areas are located on the site, with 44 uncovered parking spaces (for a parking ratio of 0.5 spaces per unit).
The Unruh Specific Plan was approved in June 2007 and will provide 74 units (73 senior units and one manager unit) on a 1.13-acre lot, at a density of 65.4 dwelling units per acre. Eighteen of these units will be reserved for low-income seniors. The project also received substantial concessions for parking, with a parking ratio of 0.7 spaces per unit, only 18 of which were required to be covered. The development is also permitted to be up to four stories tall, a full story taller than the underlying zoning would have permitted.
These developments were able to achieve substantially higher densities and concessions through the use of the specific plan process. However, the specific plan process can be expensive for developers of smaller parcels that will yield fewer units and thus can be considered a constraint to the development of smaller affordable senior housing projects. As noted above, the City will revise Title 10 to remove the requirement that senior housing projects prepare a specific plan. As an alternative, the City may add density bonus provisions to Title 10 that provide incentives to develop senior housing in the R-3 and R-4 zones.
In addition, the Downtown Business District Specific Plan conditionally permits senior housing. While the intent of the conditional use permit is to revise development standards to allow more density, the added requirement of a conditional use permit may be seen as discriminatory and a fair housing issue. The City will amend the Specific Plan to remove the requirement of a conditional use permit for senior citizen housing in the Downtown Business District and include specific development standards in the amended Specific Plan (Program 4)
Community Care Facilities
Title 10 does not define residential or community care facilities, nor indicate areas that they may be permitted. However, consistent with State law, the City facilitates the development of residential care facilities by treating licensed facilities that serve six or fewer persons as standard residential uses. The City also permits rest homes by right in the R-3, R-4, and Downtown Business District Specific Plan multi-family areas. As part of the comprehensive update of Title 10, the City will permit residential care facilities with more than six persons in the R-3 and R-4 zones, subject to some level of discretionary review.

Emergency and Transitional Housing
Emergency shelters provide short-term shelter (usually for up to six months of stay) for homeless persons or persons facing other difficulties/ such as domestic violence. Title 10 does not currently address emergency housing. To facilitate the development of emergency housing and comply with State law, Title 10 will be amended to identify zone(s) to permit emergency shelters by right. Potential zones may include Commercial Manufacturing (CM) and/or Office Business Park (OBP) zones Combined, the CM and OBP zones encompass 21.5 acres of land. The properties in the CM zone are currently zoned for Light Manufacturing (M-l) but are being amended as part of the City's comprehensive zoning update currently underway. The change from M-l to CM is in recognition that many uses in this area are transitioning to lighter manufacturing uses that include a commercial component. The proximity of the original M-l zone to residential uses was also a consideration in the proposed zone change. The Office Business Park zone (located adjacent to the CM zone) was established to provide areas in the city within which administrative, professional, and business uses may be conducted with appropriate development standards to ensure high-quality developments and to minimize adverse impacts to adjacent uses. Due to the age of many businesses in these zones, the areas are ripe for recycling of uses. Emergency shelter conditions for approval will be clearly specified in Title 10, consistent with state law, and will be similar to conditions required for similar uses in the same zones.
Transitional housing provides longer-term housing (up to two years), coupled with supportive services such as job training and counseling, to individuals and families who are transitioning to permanent housing. Consistent with State law, transitional housing serving six or fewer people is considered a standard residential use and is permitted in all zones where residential uses are permitted. Transitional housing for more than seven people that is operated as a single-room occupancy development (SRO) is conditionally permitted in the Downtown Business District Mixed-Use and multi-family zones. Transitional housing that functions as a regular multi-family use (such as apartments) is permitted by right where multi-family uses are permitted (R-2, R-3, R-4 and Downtown Business District Specific Plan Mixed-Use and Multi-family areas).
Manufactured and Mobile Homes
Manufactured housing is permitted by right on all lots which permit single-family houses, pursuant to State law. Mobile homes on a permanent foundation are conditionally permitted in all zones and are permitted by right in the R-l district, subject to certain restrictions. These restrictions include the following:
Page H - 58
Housing Element
r'^s*wY*^ >yz
■	The mobile home must be certified pursuant to the National Mobilehome Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974.
■	The mobilehome must be installed on a permanent foundation.
■	The minimum net floor area of the mobilehome is at least 1,250 square feet.
■	Roof overhang, roofing material, and exterior siding must not be in variance with the existing or proposed neighborhood.
The R-l zone may be revised, as part of the comprehensive update process, to remove the minimum floor area requirement for single-family homes. If this occurs, similar treatment will be afforded to mobile homes and manufactured housing.
Farmworker Housing
As indicated in the Community Needs Assessment only 17 La Puente residents have "Farming, Forestry, and Fishing" occupations, according to the 2000 Census. City records indicate that there are no agricultural operations in La Puente, and the only parcel that was historically zoned for agriculture will be rezoned open space as part of the comprehensive Zoning Ordinance update. (The existing use is a golf course.) Upon completion of the comprehensive zoning update, the City will no longer have an agricultural zone. As La Puente is a completely urbanized community and does not permit large-scale commercial agricultural activities, there is no need for land use regulations to address the State Employee Housing Act (Section 17000 of the Health and Safety Code). Single-Room Occupancy Facilities
Single-room occupancy (SRO) buildings house people in single rooms, with tenants often sharing bathrooms and kitchens, SROs are not specifically identified in Title 10 but are conditionally permitted in the Downtown Business District Specific Plan Mixed-Use and Multi-family residential districts, consistent with established development standards. The density and services available in the Downtown Business District make this an ideal location for permitting SROs. The unclassified use permit criteria for the review of SROs pertain to performance standards such as hours of operation, security, and parking, etc.
Supportive Housing
In a supportive housing development, housing can be coupled with social services such as job training, alcohol and drug abuse programs, and case management for populations in need of assistance, such as the homeless, those suffering from mental illness or substance abuse problems, and the elderly or medically frail. A supportive housing development in the form of a residential care facility serving six or fewer persons is treated as a residential use, consistent with State law, but is subject to development

standards for the zoning district in which it is located. Institutions for the treatment of alcoholics and mental hospitals are permitted with an unclassified use permit in various zones of the City. Rest homes, boarding homes, and group homes are all permitted by right in the R-3, R-4, and DBDSP multi-family zones.
Specific Plan Areas
The City of La Puente has adopted a number of specific plans to facilitate a diversity of development types. The La Puente Downtown Business District Specific Plan was developed in 1994 to encourage and provide guidelines for the intensification and redevelopment of the Downtown Business District. The Plan introduced a mixed use district, as well as incorporating residential-only uses, business park uses, and office uses. The mixed use district intends for commercial uses to be developed on the ground floor, with residential uses above. Two other specific plans, the Sunny Garden Specific Plan and the Unruh Avenue Specific Plan-Pueblo Bonito Specific Plan, were prepared to provide high-density senior housing in two different areas of the City (discussed above). Density Bonus
Consistent with State law, developers in La Puente can receive density bonuses of 20 to 35 percent, depending on the amount and type of affordable housing provided, and concessions or exceptions from normally applicable zoning and other development standards. As part of the City's Zoning Ordinance update, the City will adopt the density bonus provisions of State Law.
Table 36
Density Bonus Opportunities

Group	Minimum Percent of Units	Bonus Granted	Additional Bonus for Each 1% Increase in Target Units	Units Required For Maximum 35% Bonus
Very Low-Income	5%	20%	2.5%	11%

development meeting the density bonus criteria. The developer must show that the waiver or modification is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible.
Consistent with State law the City also offers incentives and concessions. A developer can receive an incentive or concession based on the proportion of affordable units for target groups. Incentives or concessions may include, but are not limited to, a reduction in setback and square footage requirements and a reduction in the ratio of vehicular parking spaces. These concessions must demonstrably result in financially sufficient and actual cost reductions. The Unruh Specific Plan, providing 18 units of affordable housing to low-income seniors and 56 market rate units, utilized the density bonuses and received a building height concession.
Building Codes and Enforcement
In addition to the previously mentioned land use controls, La Puente has adopted the Los Angeles County Building Code as amended, which is based on the California Uniform Building, Housing, Plumbing, Mechanical, and Electrical Codes. The City has made some minor amendments to address unique needs within the community. Specifically, the Building Code has been amended to place a minimum floor area requirement in residential rooms. All residences must have at least one room that is at minimum 120 square feet of floor area, and other habitable rooms (except kitchens) must have an area of at least 70 square feet. Bedrooms are required to be at least 70 square feet, and where more than two persons occupy that room, the required floor area must be increased by 50 square feet for each occupant in excess of two. With an average household size of 4.34, the City is seeking to address overcrowded conditions by requiring larger rooms.
The City utilizes its code enforcement powers in a manner that does not constrain housing development or improvement. The goal of the Community Preservation Division is to find solutions to problems resulting from violations of the City's Municipal Code. To assist neighborhoods and businesses in preserving an appealing appearance, the City has established property maintenance standards. These standards are part of the La Puente Municipal Code and establish the minimal maintenance standards for properties.
To ensure that the Municipal Code is followed, three Community Preservation Officers assist individuals in keeping their properties in compliance. The Community Preservation Officers have the authority to expeditiously abate problems that may endanger the health, safety, and welfare of the community, which helps preserve the housing stock by
Page H - 61

ffenerat$te&
requiring owners to maintain their properties in sound condition. The abatement process typically requires the clean-up or repair of properties that are found to be in violation of City Code. City staff promptly responds to property maintenance complaints and is available to work with property owners in preventing and correcting Code violations. In addition/ the City offers financial assistance programs to assist homeowners in helping maintain the safety and quality of their residences. The local enforcement of these codes does not add significantly to the cost of housing.
Energy Conservation
Title 24 of the California Administrative Code mandates uniform energy conservation standards for new construction. Minimum energy conservation standards implemented through Title 24 may increase initial construction costs throughout the State, but reduce operating expenses and expenditure of natural resources over the long run and contribute to the abatement of global warming.
ON' and OfrSite Improvements
Site improvements are a necessary component of the new development process. Improvements can include the laying of sewer and water lines and new streets for use by a community when that infrastructure is lacking, and these improvements make the development feasible. All residential areas in La Puente are served by sufficient infrastructure, due to the built-out nature of the City. The 2004 Sewer Master Plan outlines the condition of the sewers and the need for capital improvements throughout the City. The Master Plan identifies a number of deficiencies within the existing sewer system such as line collapses, inadequate capacity in some areas, minimum flow velocity, and aging pipes. In 2006, tTie City began collecting a sewer rate charge from all property owners to help fund sewer upgrades. In 2007, the City Council voted to proceed with the issuance of sewer revenue bonds to fund the construction of Phase I of the sewer upgrade project.
In La Puente, required site improvements vary depending on the existing condition of each project Typically, site improvements include the under grounding of all utility lines, landscaping, replacement of any broken or substandard curbs, gutters, and sidewalks, and the provision of adequate outdoor lighting.

Fees and Exactions
Development and Planning Fees
Various fees are collected by the City to cover costs of processing development permits. Table 37 includes a comparison of La Puente permit fees with those of neighboring jurisdictions. Application fees can pose a constraint on the production of housing units and adversely affect housing affordability, especially when they are higher than those found in surrounding communities. A survey of entitlement fees imposed by surrounding communities was conducted to determine how they compare to the development fees charged in La Puente. Fees in La Puente are comparable to, and often less than, those of surrounding communities, and do not represent a constraint on the production or preservation of housing, including affordable housing.

In addition to planning application fees, many municipal jurisdictions charge development impact fees, and developers in turn incorporate those fees into housing costs, which can reduce the affordability of housing. These fees can include park fees, police and fire fees, and sewer and waterline fees imposed in accordance with new development. A 2007 National Impact Fee Survey surveyed 38 California jurisdictions and estimated an average total impact fee of $26,392 for single-family residences and $17,558 for multi-family units within the state.16
In 2006, the City began collecting a sewer rate charge from all property owners to help fund sewer upgrades. For fiscal year 2006-2007, the revenue received amounted to $822,000. Unlike many municipalities, the City has not previously charged capacity charges. Capacity charges are a common source of capital funding. Under California Government Code Section 66000, public agencies are allowed to charge capacity chargers at the time a new customer connects for the first time. The genesis for the sewer charges and upgrades was the 2004 Sewer Master Plan The 2004 Sewer Master Plan outlines the condition of the sewers and the need for capital improvements throughout the City. The Master Plan identified a number of deficiencies within the existing sewer system such as line collapses, inadequate capacity in some areas, minimum flow velocity, and aging pipes. The purpose of the sewer rate charge is to recover the reasonable cost of facilities attributable to development. Funds from this capacity charge will be used for replacing and renewing exiting facilities and for upgrading and constructing facilities required to expand the system to build-out. The sewer fees were followed in 2007 by the issuance of sewer revenue bonds to fund the construction of Phase I of the sewer upgrade project.

Processing and Permit Procedures
The processing time required to obtain approval of development permits is often cited as a contributing factor to the high cost of housing. For some proposed development projects,, additional time is needed to complete the environmental review process before an approval can be granted. Unnecessary delays add to the cost of construction by increasing land holding costs and interest payments.
The review process in La Puente involves up to three levels of reviewing bodies: Planning Staff, Planning Commission, and the City Council. Certain projects are also subject to review by the Design Review Board (DRB); the Planning Commission sits separately as the DRB to review applicable projects.
The majority of residential developments in the City are single-family homes or small subdivisions which do not require an additional or extended period of processing time. All new multi-family residential developments must complete a development plan application, which is then reviewed and approved, conditionally approved, or rejected by the Development Review Board. Table 38 provides a list of average processing times for the various permits or procedures that may be required prior to the final approval of a project. As can be seen in this table, the processing times required for the various entitlement applications Eire reasonable and do not represent a constraint to, or contribute to the cost of, the development or preservation of housing. These timeframes are approximate and depend on the scope of the project, number of corrections in plan check, and timeliness of the applicant7s resubmittals. In addition, projects requiring environmental review and/or appeals may take substantially longer to process.

The City's development timeframes are designed to accommodate development The average processing times for single-family and multifamily projects vary depending upon the size of the development and if a subdivision map is involved. For example, small homes constructed on existing lots of record could be issued permits within five to six weeks, including Planning and Building and Safety review. Apartment developments require Development Review Board approval. As such, the development process is increased by approximately two months. Larger projects with many corrections required during Building review typically take longer to process.
The City's average development processing times are typical of those for surrounding jurisdictions. They allow for State-mandated review periods for environmental documents as well as for legally advertised and noticed public hearings. In addition, the City of La Puente, like surrounding jurisdictions, is required to adhere to the development review timeframes mandated by the State Permit Streamlining Act. Unclassified Use Permit17
An unclassified use permit is an entitlement application which requires a public hearing and the adoption of specific findings, including:
■	The proposed use is in conformance with the General Plan and any applicable specific plan.
■	The nature, condition, and development of adjacent uses, buildings, and structures are considered, and do not adversely affect adjacent uses.
■	The site is adequate in size and shape for the proposed use.
■	The site is served by highways adequate in capacity to carry the kind and quantity of traffic the use would generate.
■	The site is provided with adequate sewerage, water, fire protection, and storm drainage facilities.
The purpose and intent of the unclassified use permit is to ensure that these uses which are not permitted by right are located, planned, and used in such a manner as not to be detrimental to the abutting properties and to the community as a whole. Conditions of approval are utilized to preserve the integrity and character of the zoning district, the utility and value of adjacent property, and the general welfare of the neighborhood and the public. Conditions can include such requirements as special yards and fencing, specific parking and circulation requirements, street
17 The "Unclassified Use Permit" will be renamed "Conditional Use Permit."

and/or alley dedications/ landscaping/ regulations of noise and other nuisances/ and height and residential density limitations. Residential uses requiring an unclassified use permit include mobile home parksz drug and alcohol treatment facilities/ mental hospitals/ planned residential unit developments/ and motels and hotels. As part of the comprehensive update of Title 10/ the City will revise the unclassified use permit to be a conditional use permit/ and list specific zones in which each of these uses may be conditionally permitted.
Housing for Disabled Persons
State law requires localities to analyze potential and actual constraints upon housing for persons with disabilities/ demonstrate efforts to remove governmental constraints/ and include programs to accommodate housing designed for people with disabilities. The City has no special zoning or land use restrictions that regulate the siting of housing for persons with disabilities.
In accordance with State law, La Puente permits State-licensed residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons in all of its residential zoning districts by right. Several housing types for persons with disabilities are permitted by right or require a discretionary permit that is no more stringent than those for other conditional uses. Rest homes and boarding homes are permitted by right in the R-3Z R-4Z and Downtown Business District Specific Plan multi-family areas. Twenty-four hour foster care homes are permitted in all residential zones of the Cityz and SROs are conditionally permitted in the Downtown Business District Specific Plan mixed-use areas.
Inclusion of an overly restrictive definition of a "family" in the zoning code may have the potential of discriminating against group homes or other housing for persons with disabilities on the basis of familial status. The La Puente Municipal Code defines family as "an individual/ or two or more persons related by blood or marriagez or a group of not more than five persons who are not related by blood or marriagez excluding servants/ living together as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit." In recognition of legal standards related to fair housing and civil right/ the City of La Puente does not use this definition. The City acknowledges that the definition of "family" is outdated and may cause the misperception by the public that development can be restricted to blood related families. To prevent this misperception/ the City will amend Title 10 as part of the comprehensive update to remove the definition of family.
As stated abovez the City has adopted a revised version of the California Building Code. Standards within the Code include provisions to ensure
Page H - 67
..	Housing Element
accessibility for persons with disabilities. These standards are consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act. No local amendments that would constrain accessibility or increase the cost of housing for persons with disabilities have been adopted. To accommodate disabled persons in public facilities, the City defers to Title 24 of the California Handicap Accessibility Code.
Reasonable Accommodation
The Fair Housing Act, as amended in 1988, requires that cities and counties provide reasonable accommodation to rules, policies, practices and procedures where such accommodation may be necessary to afford individuals with disabilities equal housing opportunities. While fair housing laws intend that all people have equal access to housing, the law also recognizes that people with disabilities may need extra tools to achieve equality. Reasonable accommodation is one of the tools intended to further housing opportunities for people with disabilities. For developers and providers of housing for people with disabilities who are often confronted with siting or use restrictions, reasonable accommodation provides a means of requesting from the local government flexibility in the application of land use and zoning regulations or, in some instances, even a waiver of certain restrictions or requirements because it is necessary to achieve equal access to housing. Cities and counties are required to consider requests for accommodations related to housing for people with disabilities and provide the accommodation when it is determined to be "reasonable" based on fair housing laws and the case law interpreting the statutes.
State law allows for a statutorily based four-part analysis to be used in evaluating requests for reasonable accommodation related to land use and zoning matters and can be incorporated into reasonable accommodation procedures. This analysis gives great weight to furthering the housing needs of people with disabilities and also considers the impact or effect of providing the requested accommodation on the City and its overall zoning scheme. Developers and providers of housing for people with disabilities must be ready to address each element of the following four-part analysis:
■	The housing that is the subject of the request for reasonable accommodation is for people with disabilities as defined in federal or state fair housing laws;
■	The reasonable accommodation requested is necessary to make specific housing available to people with disabilities who are protected under fair housing laws;
■	The requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the local government; and
Page H - 68
Housing Element
■ The requested accommodation will not result in a fundamental alteration in the local zoning code.
To create a process for making requests for reasonable accommodation to land use and zoning decisions and procedures regulating the siting/ funding/ development and use of housing for people with disabilities/ the City will create and adopt a reasonable accommodation procedure and provide information to residents via their public counters and website.
Environmental Constraints
Significant environmental and infrastructure constraints often hamper development of sufficient housing for all economic segments. The paragraphs below address potential environmental and infrastructure constraints to residential development in La Puente. Both issues are discussed in more detail in the Circulation and Infrastructure/ Community Resources/ and Community Safety Elements of the General Plan.
Federal and State regulations require environmental review of proposed discretionary projects (e.g., subdivision maps, use permits/ etc.). Costs resulting from the environmental review process are bundled into the cost of housing and are passed on to the consumer. These costs include fees charged by local government and private consultants needed to complete the environmental analyses and from delays caused by the mandated public review periods. However, the presence of these regulations helps to preserve the environment and ensure environmental safety for La Puente residents.
Environmental constraints can significantly affect the creation of new housing in a community. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, La Puente is not located within either a 100- or 500-year flood zone. However, La Puente lies within a region with several active faults and therefore is subject to the risks and hazards associated with earthquakes. Discovered in 2003, die Puente Hills fault system is comprised of three sections that run under downtown Los Angeles, through La Puente, and into the Coyote Hills of north Orange County. No active faults have been identified at the ground surface within the City limits, nor have any Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault zones been designated.
However, the City overlies the Puente Hills segment of the Elysian Park blind thrust fault. The fault is referred to as blind because it does not intercept the ground surface and therefore cannot be detected visually. These faults are all capable of movement that could produce substantial ground shaking, which can in turn, result in ground failure or
Page H - 69
Houslng Element

liquefaction in larger quakes. According to the California Geological Survey, most of La Puente is subject to liquefaction. The high water table in certain portions of the City can also contribute to liquefaction in an earthquake. A few small areas of the City are also subject to earthquake-induced landslides due to steep slopes. Within both of these areas, geologic studies must be completed and countermeasures undertaken in the design and construction of buildings for human occupancy. This process can contribute to the already high cost of construction in the City, but is required to ensure adequate safety in construction.
In addition, residential parcels located near or adjacent to the Southern Pacific Railroad right-of-way may not be suitable for development because of noise-related issues. While none of the above hazards or environmental-related circumstances are expected to prevent the City from obtaining its housing goals, they must be seriously considered when attempting to site new residential development in environmentally sensitive or otherwise hazardous areas.
In addition to considering environmental conditions, before a development permit is granted, it must be established that public service and facilities systems are adequate to accommodate any increased demand generated by a proposed project. As a contract city, La Puente relies upon other government agencies, private utility companies, and contractors to maintain and upgrade many of the community's major infrastructure systems. The 2004 Sewer Master Plan included a comprehensive sewer and water infrastructure study to identify needed upgrades in the present systems and provide for a long-range capital improvement program to maintain the system. These improvements include the repair of sewer lines and the establishment of a preventative maintenance program. Because most of the City is built out, the Master Plan does not project significant increases in wastewater flows. In 2006 the City began collecting sewer charges from all property owners to help fund sewer upgrades and in 2007 the City issued sewer revenue bonds to fund the construction of Phase I of the sewer upgrade project. For fiscal year 2006-2007, the revenue received from sewer charges amounted to $822,000. Estimated cost of the entire five-year project is $15.9 million, making the project the single largest capital improvement project in the City's 50-year history. The sewer construction project is designed to both increase capacity and repair cracks and breaks in the City's aging system, which includes some 63.2 miles of pipeline, most of which was installed in the 1950s and 1960s. Because the City is actively addressing the sewer infrastructure insufficiencies and will be increasing capacity related to planned growth, the current deficiencies within service and facility infrastructure is not considered to be an obstacle to the provision of additional housing in La Puente.

Housing Element Resources
This section analyzes the resources available for the development/ rehabilitation/ and preservation of housing in La Puente. This analysis includes an evaluation of the availability of land resources for future housing development. The City's ability to satisfy its share of the region's future housing needs, the financial resources available to support housing activities, and the administrative resources available to assist in implementing the City's housing programs and policies. Additionally, this section examines opportunities for energy conservation.
Availability of Sites for Housing
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA)
State law requires that the community provide an adequate number of sites to allow for and facilitate production of the City's regional share of housing. To determine whether tire City has sufficient land to accommodate its share of regional housing needs for all income groups, the City must identify "adequate sites." Under State law (California Government Code section 65583[cJ[l]), adequate sites are those with appropriate zoning and development standards, with services and facilities, needed to facilitate and encourage the development of housing for all income levels. La Puente's Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) for the 2008-2014 planning period has been determined by SCAG to be 807 units. This total includes 201 units for very low-income households, 124 units for low-income households, 136 units for moderate-income households, and 346 units for upper-income households.
Progress towards RHNA
Since the RHNA process establishes January 1, 2006 as the baseline for growth projections for the Housing Element planning period of 2008-2014, jurisdictions may count toward the RHNA any new units built or approved since January 1,2006.
The City of La Puente has met 189 units of the RHNA with credits. This includes:
•	171 units that have been constructed, are under construction, or have been approved since January 1, 2006 (including 4 second units built or entitled since 2006); and
•	18 projected new second units to be constructed during the planning period, for a total of 189 units.

based on market rents in the City. In February 2008, rents in La Puente ranged from $600 to $800 for a studio apartment, $530 to $1,050 for a one-bedroom unit, between $1,100 to $1,695 for a two-bedroom unit, and between $1,495 and $1,850 for a three-bedroom unit.18 These rents generally fall within the range of HUD-determined fair market rents for the County of Los Angeles.
Affordable housing units are provided at the 1040 Unruh Avenue Apartments. These apartments are part of the Unruh Specific Plan, approved in June 2007 and built at a density of 65 units per acre (74 units on a 1.3 acres) Eighteen of these units will be reserved for low-income seniors. The project also received substantial concessions for parking, with a parking ratio of 0.7 spaces per unit, only 18 of which were required to be covered. The development is also permitted to be up to four stories high, a full story taller than the underlying zoning would have permitted.
Second Units
Second Units Built
Also included in die RHNA credits are 4 second units built or entitled since 2006. These units are anticipated to be affordable to low-income households given their comparable size and rent relative to small rental units in La Puente (0- to 1-bedroom units). Based on a survey from December 2007, average rents for one-bedroom rental units ranged from $530 to $1,025, which meets the affordability criteria for moderate-income persons (1-person households) set forth in Table 40 of the Community Needs Assessment.19 Using this as a baseline, smaller 0-bedroom or studio units such as second units would be affordable to low-income persons (1 person households).
Projected Second Units
The City projects that during the planning period, approximately 18 second units will be developed (3 per year). These 18 second units are included as credits consistent with HCD guidelines.
Total Credits
The City of La Puente has met 189 units of the RHNA with credits. This includes:

Residential Sites Inventory
The analysis below indicates the sites available in La Puente to accommodate the remaining RHNA.
Vacant Land
State law requires that jurisdictions demonstrate in the housing element that the land inventory is adequate to accommodate that jurisdiction's share of the region's projected growth. The inventory of vacant residential land in La Puente totals 6.54 acres. Based on this inventory, it is clear that tire City is fully developed, with limited opportunities for development on vacant land. Of these vacant parcels, 4.55 acres are designated Low Density Residential, 1.27 acres are designated Medium Density Residential, and 0.72 acres are designated for mixed-use development within the Downtown Business District. These vacant properties have the potential to yield 65 units.

* Expected dwelling units do not reflect straight application of maximum density to vacant land. The number of dwelling units has been reduced to reflect expected densities and in many cases due to topographic constraints. Within the mixed-use areas in the Downtown Business District, expected densities are based on approved mixed-use projects and on the City7s intent to establish a minimum density. Recyclable Land
In addition to vacant sites, future housing units can be accommodated on
underutilized lots currently developed at less than the maximum
permitted density. Given the scarcity of developable land in the City and
the continuing demand for new housing, nearly all of the recent
residential construction in the City has involved infill development on
underutilized properties.
The analysis of residential capacity on recyclable land included in this
section focuses on residentially zoned land and mixed-use sites in the
Downtown Business District (DBD), where achievement of densities of 40
units per acre is expected.
Residentially Zoned Land
The analysis of underutilized residentially zoned land reveals that
underutilized properties in La Puente have the potential for development
of at least 407 residential units on 30 acres of land. Infill trends in the City
indicate that multi-family developments such as apartment and
condominium developments are the most likely residential product to be
produced. Recycling to higher-intensity uses is very probable given that
the scarcity of land in La Puente makes higher-density development most
cost effective in these higher density areas. Table 41 presents a summary
of residential capacity on underutilized residential land. A detailed listing
Page H - 75
Housing Element
&ftera{‘Pfan
of the underutilized properties is included in Appendix A. The densities that can be achieved in the MHDR and HDR areas are appropriate to facilitate the production of housing that is affordable to moderate-income households. The moderately sized properties in MHDR and HDR areas consist of a mix of multi-family and single-family units.
Table 41
Summary of Residential Capacity on Underutilized Residential Land
General Plan	Zoning	Maximum Density	Acres	Existing Units	Realistic Capacity (80% of maximum allowed density)	Affordability Level
LDR	R1	7 du/ac	0.83	2	4	Above Moderate
MDR	R2	14 du/ ac	13.52	56	156	Above Moderate
MHDR	R3	18 du/ac	13.79	66	199	Moderate
HDR	R4	26 du/ac	2.28	17	48	Moderate
Total			30.42	141	407	
Most properties included in the underutilized land inventory are properties over a third of an acre in size. For properties containing less than a third of an acre, realistic capacity (80 percent of maximum density) must be more than twice the number of existing housing units. The City acknowledges that small lot development may be more difficult; thus, the City has included only those smaller properties that have the potential for sufficient added capacity to make recycling of land economically feasible.
As further evidence of the recycling potential in the City, since 2006, 82 percent of all units built or approved have involved recycling of land to achieve additional units.

These developments have resulted in 156 new units as compared with the original use of the site which totaled only 10 units. This represents a fifteen-fold increase in the number of units on limited land area, a remarkable achievement in a small city with limited public resources to assist with housing development, and this demonstrates that incentives that the City has in place today work well to facilitate and encourage recycling.
The City has initiated a process to re-zone sites located north of Amar Road, and between Sierra Vista Street and E. Temple Avenue, to reflect General Plan land use designations. The increased densities that will be allowed in this area as a result of achieving General Plan consistency will provide incentive to property owners to maximize housing potential. The City does not charge processing fees for rezoning to achieve General Plan consistency, and the City will be initiating broad-based rezoning as part of the current Zoning Code rewrite program. This effort will include property owner notification, which will alert owners of increased development potential. This will further contribute to the common trend in La Puente of owners of R3-zoned properties initiating replacement of single-family homes on larger lots with multiple units. The trend is also assisted by lower housing prices in La Puente as compared to the surrounding region (Table 16). The lower cost of properties and the additional units that can be added (more than twice the number of existing units) will support and encourage redevelopment of smaller sites to higher densities.
To further encourage recycling of land in underutilized areas, the City has initiated a comprehensive update of the Zoning Ordinance. As part of this effort, properties that are zoned for densities lower than those allowed in the General Plan will be re-zoned to achieve General Plan consistency. This change will serve as an incentive to property owners to recycle land to achieve the most efficient use of land. In addition, zone changes to achieve General Plan consistency will be accomplished at no cost to property owners. Most General Plan/Zone inconsistencies have zoning that allows densities below those allowed by the General Plan. These zone changes will facilitate development at appropriate densities. Of the 407 units, zoning will be adjusted on 269 units by December 2008, consistent with the City7s comprehensive zoning code update (Program 13).
Dozontown Mixed-Use Opportunity Areas
One of the greatest opportunities for infill development is found in the City's Downtown Business District (DBD), where an adopted Specific Plan allows residential development as both freestanding and mixed-use configurations. The potential for creation of residential units in mixed-use areas is predicated on the interest from developers - expressed to tire City
Page H - 77
Housing
Element

- and on the limited opportunities for higher-density development elsewhere in the City or the immediate surrounding area. In addition, location of the Downtown Business District within the City's Redevelopment Project Area (see Figure 5), provides the City additional tools to assist with property acquisition for developers as well as lot consolidation assistance. The City formed the Redevelopment Agency in 2004. Because of its recent formation, the Agency has not yet generated significant tax increment funds. While resources are limited, the Agency is committed to assisting in the acquisition of properties and lot consolidation to create larger properties for mixed-use projects in the downtown area.
Consistent with the Land Use Element, the City encourages residential uses in Downtown as a catalyst for revitalization and economic development. The Downtown Business District Specific Plan provides for mixed-use districts within portions of Downtown. Creating opportunities for residents to live in high-quality housing side by side with retail, entertainment, and civic uses will help establish a sense of place and give Downtown an attractive, unique feel. Mixed residential and commercial uses in Downtown La Puente offer several benefits:
■	Mixed use attracts private investment in the form of residential and commercial development.
■	Mixed use increases patronage within Downtown and can convey substantial economic benefits to businesses.
■	Mixed use helps streets, public spaces, and commercial areas again become places where people meet and interact.
Development within the DBD is expected to achieve densities of 40 units per acre or more. This expected density level is based on the approval of a 48-urdt mixed-use development on a 42,300~square-foot property in Downtown. Yielding 49.4 units per acre, approval of this development is the result of the City7s commitment to pursuing high-quality, mixed-use development that contribute to the overall vision for the Downtown area.
The Downtown Business District Specific Plan (DBD SP) currently does not include a density range for mixed-use developments. In omitting density ranges in the DBD SP, the City7 s intent was for market forces to dictate the density, with the assumption that higher-density developments would contribute to the City's housing stock and provide much-needed economic development benefits. While the City's intent of allowing great flexibility in density ranges as a means to achieving higher-density developments is still applicable, as a further demonstration of the City's commitment to mixed use in Downtown, the
Page H - 78
Housing Element
Generate fan
Housing Element includes a program to adopt guidance on density
ranges in the mixed-use areas.
The sites inventory for Downtown identified 8 sites with the potential
combined capacity for 257 units. Of these units, 209 are expected to
achieve densities of at least 40 units per acre. A detailed listing of parcels
is included in Appendix A and Figure 5.
The sites chosen are significantly underutilized given their size and
location. In addition, a proposed new mixed-use development in Area 1
will serve as a catalyst for more intense development of the Downtown
area. As market forces continue to push toward higher densities,
recycling of underutilized land is expected to occur at an increasing rate.
If the trend continues, the City can anticipate increased recycling of land,
particularly in higher-density areas where economies of scale can be
realized. The City has- in place incentives to facilitate recycling activities
that are included in the DBD SP. These include: 1) a density bonus for
affordable housing, 2) administrative, technical, and financial support for
mixed-use projects, 3) incentives to encourage lot consolidation and
shared parking, and 3) relaxation of development standards.

To further encourage and facilitate the development, redevelopment, restoration, and intensification of the desired uses within the Downtown Business District, the City will review the Specific Plan and make any amendments necessary to assure that the development standards, incentives, and overall vision for mixed-use in Downtown La Puente comports with market demand. The City will also expand mixed-use opportunities through an amendment to the Downtown Business District Specific Plan to encourage and facilitate mixed-use developments on these sites (Program 13). Of the 257 mixed-use units indicated in Table 42, 29 units will be available by December 2008, consistent with the City's comprehensive zoning code update and amendment to the Downtown Business District Specific Plan.
Sites Infrastructure
Currently infrastructure is in place to accommodate all development identified in the site inventory. The sewer system has sufficient capacity to accommodate ah housing developments and is undergoing maintenance upgrades to address aging facilities. In 2004 the City adopted the Sewer Master Plan which outlines the condition of the sewers and the need for capital improvements throughout the City. In 2006, the City began collecting a sewer rate charge from all property owners to help fund the sewer upgrades. In 2007, the City Council voted to proceed with the issuance of sewer revenue bonds to fund the construction of Phase I of the sewer upgrade project. In 2007, the City initiated construction of Phase I of the sewer upgrade project. The sewer upgrade project is a proactive and ongoing project that does not target specific site deficiencies but responds to the age of the City's infrastructure and to requirements imposed on all jurisdictions by the regional water quality board. Phase I spans from 2007 to 2012 with additional phases to follow. During Phase I the City will replace at least 37,895 feet of sewer, or 11 percent of the entire City System. Data provided by the Public Works Department indicates that the planned citywide upgrades will not limit or in any way constrain potential development in the City during tire Housing Element planning period. These Citywide sewer maintenance and upgrades are not considered to be an obstacle to the provision of additional housing in La Puente.
Comparison of Sites Inventory and RHNA
Identified properties have the combined capacity to accommodate 729 additional housing units on vacant and underutilized residential and mixed-use land (Table 42). These sites and the associated land use regulations can facilitate the production of 491 moderate-income and above moderate-income units. Public services and facilities are available to adequately serve all of the potential housing sites. Lateral water and

Housing Element
sewer lines would be extended onto the properties from the adjoining
public rights-of-way as development occurs. Any missing public
improvement (e.g., curbs, gutters, sidewalks, etc.) along the property
frontages would also be constructed at that time.
Table 43
Comparison of Sites Inventory and RHNA
Under-	Difference:
Income Category	RHNA	RHNA Credits	Remaining RHNA	Vacant Sites	utilized Residential Sites	Mixed Use Sites	Remaining RHNA minus Sites
Very Low	201	0	201	29	0	172	0
Low	124	40	84	0	0	37	47
Moderate	136	58	78	0	188	0	0
Above Moderate	346	91	255	36	219	48	0
Total Units	807	189	618	65	407	257	47
The analysis of available sites indicates that these sites can accommodate most of the remaining RHNA, with the exception of 47 low-income units. To accommodate these remaining 47 units, the City is committed to identifying sites at appropriate densities as required by law. The State, through AB 2348, has established "default" density standards for local jurisdictions. State law assumes that a density standard of 30 units per acre for urban jurisdictions such as La Puente, as being able to facilitate the production of housing affordable to lower income households. Within this Housing Element planning period, the City will undertake an in-depth analysis of all properties in La Puente to identify the most appropriate location to change land use policy to accommodate an additional 47 units for lower-income households.

Housing Resources
Financial Resources
A variety of existing and potential funding sources are available for affordable housing activities in La Puente. Primary sources include the City's Redevelopment Set-Aside Fund, the State's CalHome Program, and the federal Community Development Block Grant program.
Redevelopment Set-Aside
The Redevelopment Set-Aside fund is one of the primary sources of financing used for the preservation, improvement, and development of affordable housing. The La Puente Redevelopment Agency sets aside 20 percent of the tax increment revenue generated from its Redevelopment Project Area for the purpose of increasing and improving the supply of housing for low- and moderate-income households. This set-aside is placed in a separate Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Fund. According to the City's Finance Department, as of February 2008, the balance of the Low- and Moderate-Income Fund was $166,807.34. Over the five-year period of this Housing Element, the Agency expects to generate close to $837,000 in Low- and Moderate-Income funds. CalHome Program
The California Department of Housing and Community Development CalHome Program provides grants to local public agencies and nonprofit developers to assist individual households through deferred-payment loans. In January 2008, La Puente was awarded a grant for $325,575 to be used over a three-year time period on loans for low- and moderate-income home rehabilitation in the City.
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds
Through the CDBG program, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides funds to local governments for funding a wide range of community development activities for low-income persons. The CDBG program is very flexible in that the funds can be used for a wide range of activities. The eligible activities include: acquisition and/or disposition of real estate or property; public facilities and improvements; relocation, rehabilitation and construction (under certain limitations) of housing; homeownership assistance; and clearance activities. For the 2008-2009 Program Year, the City received $587,595 in CDBG funds. The majority of these funds are utilized for the City's
Page H - 85
Housing Element
T* " rj;?: •><LOiLL~'fT-iy~r' ''
housing rehabilitation and other community development projects that benefit lower-income residents in La Puente.
Section 8 Rental Assistance
The federal Section 8 program provides rental assistance to very low-income households in need of affordable housing. The Section 8 program assists a very low-income household by paying the difference between 30 percent of the gross household income and the cost of rent. Most Section 8 assistance today is structured as vouchers; this allows the voucher recipients to choose housing that may cost above the fair market rent as long as the recipients pay for the additional cost. In La Puente, 361 households receive rental assistance under the HUD Section 8 program. Industry Funds
City of Industry Funds (Industry Funds) are a financing resource for the development of affordable housing. Industry Funds are tax increment set-aside funds administered by the Los Angeles County Housing Authority (HACoLA). Proposals or applications for affordable and special needs rental housing are only accepted following the Housing Authority's issuance of a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA). A development proposal to use Industry Funds for an affordable rental housing development must set aside a minimum of 20 percent of the units for rental purposes by households earning at or less than 50 percent of the Los Angeles County median income. Proposals for special needs housing must be designed to serve one of the following special needs populations: victims of domestic violence; persons with HIV/AIDS; transition age youth; developmentally disabled persons; frequent users of Department of Mental Health and Department of Health Services emergency facilities; families that are homeless or at risk of homelessness; and mentally ill persons. Each proposal must incorporate a component on how the specific Special Needs population will be served. To date, no project in La Puente has used Industry Funds.
East San Gabriel Valley Coalition for the Homeless (ESGVCH)
The East San Gabriel Valley Coalition for the Homeless provides homeless and transitional housing assistance for people in the East San Gabriel Valley. Since 2000, the City has provided approximately $39,200 in financial assistance to ESGVCH, paid for by the General Fund.

Administrative Resources

City of La Puente Community Development Department
The department functions include planning, building and safety, engineering, code compliance, community development grant administration, public transit services, and central permit operations.
The Planning Division provides comprehensive land use services. The Division's primary goal is to ensure and enhance the quality of life in the community through the administration of the La Puente Municipal Code relative to zoning and subdivisions, the General Plan, the California Environmental Quality Act; and a variety of interrelated laws involving public health, safety, and welfare.
The Community Preservation Division finds solutions to problems resulting from violations of the Municipal Code. If left unattended, Code violations can detract from the positive appearance of neighborhoods and the business community. To assist neighborhoods and businesses preserve an appealing appearance, the City has established property maintenance standards. These standards are part of the La Puente Municipal Code and establish the minimal maintenance standards for properties. Code enforcement efforts help preserve the housing stock by requiring owners to maintain their properties in a sound condition.
Additionally, the City offers financial assistance to homeowners through its Housing Rehabilitation Program, This program offers grants and deferred loans to maintain the safety and quality of residences occupied by low-income residents through a Deferred Loan Program and a Grant Program.
La Puente Redevelopment Agency
The La Puente City Council adopted the City7s first redevelopment ordinance in July 2004, founding the La Puente Redevelopment Agency to "reinvent" the City through redevelopment of the business districts. One of the major goals of the Redevelopment Agency is to support the City's housing efforts to increase, improve, and preserve the community's supply of affordable housing for persons of low and moderate income. Non-Profit Developers
Due to the high cost of housing development in Southern California, many communities have found that partnerships with non-profit housing developers are an effective tool for creating affordable housing units. A previous affordable housing project involving local non-profit developers

is the renovation of the La Puente Park apartments in 2002 by the Jamboree Housing Corporation and Preservation Partners Development.
Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Energy-related housing costs can directly impact the affordability of housing. While state building code standards contain mandatory energy efficiency requirements for new development, the City and utility providers are also important resources to encourage and facilitate energy conservation and to help residents minimize energy-related expenses.
The City's General Plan and Downtown Business District Specific Plan contain various programs related to energy conservation and reduction of greenhouse gases. Because reduction in vehicle trips is the most effective strategy to reduction of greenhouse gases, land use and circulation policies encourage alternatives to the automobile through more compact and pedestrian friendly development. The most significant addition to the General Plan updated in 2004 is the establishment of a Mixed Use land use designation that is implemented by tire Downtown Business District Specific Plan. Mixed use development in La Puente will encourage walking due to more compact development patterns and housing development that is in close proximity to services and retail businesses. Citywide design policies encourage development with pedestrian amenities and walkable connections between developments. Because of the built out nature of the City, future development in the City will be infill development that will maximize existing land and infrastructure resources and as a result promote housing affordability. To reduce vehicle trips and to accommodate lower-income residents who may not own vehicles, policies in the Circulation Element aim to maintain and expand, if feasible, municipal transit services, maintain sidewalks and install sidewalks in neighborhoods where none currently exist, and encourage cycling. Policies and programs in the Community Resources Element encourage energy conservation and alternative modes of transportation as well as increase awareness of energy conservation programs sponsored by the City or local utility companies.
Residents can apply for energy efficiency upgrades as part of the City's existing CDBG and CalHome programs that fund rehabilitation projects for low- and moderate-income homeowners.
Southern California Edison (SCE) offers a variety of energy conservation services as part of its Customer Assistance Programs (CAP). The Energy Assistance Fund helps income-qualified residential customers facing financial hardship manage their electricity bills during the months of February and March. These services are designed to help low-income

households/ senior citizens/ permanently disabled/ and non-English speaking customers control their energy use. The 2007 Residential Multifamily Energy Efficiency Rebate Program offers property owners and managers incentives on a broad list of energy efficiency improvements in lighting/ HVAC, insulation/ and window categories. These improvements are to be used to retrofit existing multi-family properties of two or more units.
Additionally/ the Southern California Gas Company offers various rebate programs for energy-efficient appliances and makes available to residents energy efficient kits at no cost The Gas Company also offers no-cost weatherization and furnace repair or replacement services for qualified limited-income customers. The Comprehensive Mobile Home Program provides qualifying mobile home customers with no-cost energy conservation evaluations/ installations of low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators/ and gas energy efficiency improvements/ such as duct test and seal of HVAC systems. The Designed for Comfort program provides energy efficiency design assistance/ training/ and incentives for housing authorities/ owners of multi-family affordable and supportive housing projects (which offer homes to persons with special needs).

Housing Plan
The Housing Plan provides direction for City decision makers to achieve the long-term housing objectives set forth in hie La Puente Housing Element. This Plan identifies goals, policies, and programs aimed at providing additional housing opportunities, removing governmental constraints to affordable housing, improving the condition of existing housing, and providing equal housing opportunities for all residents. These goals, policies, and programs continue the City7s efforts to expand the local supply of housing while improving quality and affordability.
As used here, a goal is a statement defining a desired end result; for example: Create greater housing options for low- income residents. A policy is a plan of action to guide decisions and actions; for example: Provide density bonuses for housing development that includes dwelling units for low-income residents. The program identifies the method, agencies, officials, funding sources, and time frame the City will undertake to implement the policies and achieve the goals set forth in this Housing Element. Together, goals, policies, and programs establish the framework for making decisions that affect the availability of housing in La Puente.
In adopting this updated element, the City Council has translated and expanded the goals, policies, quantified objectives, and housing program of the prior Housing Element. The goals, policies, and program contained in the prior Element have been reintroduced, augmented, or eliminated as appropriate, based on input from the constraints analysis in this Element, input from City staff, and comments received at public meetings and hearings.
Housing Goals, Policies, and Programs
Housing Conservation and Improvement
Protecting and preserving the established residential neighborhoods of La Puente is a key priority for LHe City. Maintenance activities prevent deteriorating housing conditions, improve neighborhoods, and promote higher property values. The City looks to improve the visual character of residential neighborhoods to improve value and create neighborhood pride. Toward these ends, the City has created several home rehabilitation and code enforcement programs.
Page H - 90
Housing Element

Goal
1
Preserve and improve the conditions of the City's established housing stock.
Policy 1.1:	Continue to offer rehabilitation programs that provide financial and technical
assistance to low- and moderate-income households for the repair and rehabilitation of housing with substandard conditions.
Policy 1.2:	Continue to provide proactive code enforcement activities to maintain and
improve housing and neighborhood qualities.
Policy 1.3:	Prevent the encroachment of incompatible commercial and industrial uses into
residential neighborhoods.
Policy 1.4:	Facilitate the removal of housing units that poses serious health and safety
hazards to residents and adjacent structures.
Policy 1.5:	Eliminate housing conditions that contribute to overcrowding.
Program 1: Residential Rehabilitation Program
Most housing units in La Puente were built in the 1950s and '60s. Major home components such as roofing/ windows/ and heating and ventilation systems are nearing or have reached their life expectancy and may need replacing/ if property owners have not already done so. The City administers the Residential Rehabilitation Program/ a financial assistance program for low-income La Puente residents in need of home rehabilitation. This comprehensive property improvement program provides loans and grants for both interior and exterior improvements to owner-occupied single-family homes. Eligible improvements and repairs include roofing/ plumbing/ heating/ windowsz flooring/ electrical systems/ interior/exterior painting/ bathroom and/or kitchen remodels/ energy conservation improvements/ and bedroom additions. The City has budgeted roughly $232/000 in state CalHome funds for the rehabilitation loan program and $96/000 in federal funds (CDBG) for the rehabilitation grant program for fiscal year 2008-09. Funding levels are contingent on federal funding of tide CDBG program and varies from year to year. The City has been successful over the past 8 years in receiving over $1/320,000 in CalHome grants, and in May, 2008 the city applied for an additional $520,000 grant which, if awarded, will provide funding for thirteen $40,000 loans over 3 years.

Housing Availability and Production
Given La Puente7 s built-out character,, developers and homebuilders may
find it difficult to pursue new housing development in La Puente. Large
swaths of vacant land are no longer available to support large residential
subdivisions or multi-family complexes. As a result, La Puente must
focus its resources on the existing limited land availability for additional
housing opportunities in the coming years to accommodate both local
and regional growth. This includes finding creative housing plans for the
limited vacant lands remaining in the City, and finding innovative
solutions for adding additional housing units on underutilized residential
land.
Goal 2	Promote and encourage housing development that adequately meets the needs of all socioeconomic segments of the community and region.
Policy 2.1:	Utilize the Land Use Element, Zoning Ordinance, and other land use controls to provide housing sites that can facilitate and encourage the development of a variety of housing consistent with the City's identified local needs and its regional housing responsibilities.
Policy 2.2:	Establish incentives and regulatory concessions to promote the development of housing for very low-, low- and moderate-income persons, and especially those with special needs.
Policy 2.3:	Encourage the infilling of vacant residential land and the recycling of underutilized residential land, particularly in Downtown
Policy 2.4:	Address the housing needs of special populations and extremely low income households through emergency shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, and single-room occupancy units.
Policy 2.5:	Address the housing needs of special populations and extremely low-income households through emergency shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, and single-room occupancy units.
Program 3: Adequate Sites Program 3 articulates the City's strategies for meeting the RHNA shortfall.	
Page H - 93
Housing Element

Based on units developed and approved/ the City has met a portion of its RHNA and has a remaining RHNA of 618 housing units, including 201 units for extremely-low/very low-income households, 84 units for low-income households, 78 units for moderate-income households, and 255 units for above moderate-income households. The sites inventory capacity analysis conducted for this Element indicates that existing land use policy can accommodate most of the remaining RHNA, with the exception of the 47 low-income units. To provide opportunities for an additional income-targeted 47 units, the City is committed to identifying sites at appropriate densities as required by law. The City has two strategies to identify 47 low-income sites. California Code 65583.2(h) requires site shortfalls to be accommodated on properties that permit by right owner occupied and rental multi-family residential uses. California Code 65583.2(h) also requires these sites to be zoned with minimum density and development standards that permit at least 16 units per site at a density of at least 20 units per acre and at least 50 percent of the very low and low-income housing need shall be accommodated on sites designated for residential use and for which nonresidential uses or mixed-uses are not permitted. Because the RHNA shortfall is for low income units, at least 32 units must be accommodated on sites designated for residential use and for which nonresidential uses or mixed-uses are not permitted. Consistent with this requirement, increasing the maximum density of the High Density Residential (HDR) properties to at least 30 units per acre will be the City's primary strategy for accommodating the 47 low-income unit RHNA shortfall. Potentially the City may combine this strategy with a second strategy that expands the City's Mixed Use District in the Downtown Business District Specific Plan. The strategies are presented below:
Strategy 1: The City will increase the maximum density for properties in the High Density Residential (HDR) district to at least 30 units per acre. Residential land use designations in the City allow densities that range from one to seven units per acre for Low Density areas and to up to 26 units per acre in the High Density Residential areas. While much of the land designated for residential development is already built out, additional residential development can be accommodated by recycling of uses on underutilized properties. The greatest potential for meeting the 47 unit low income RHNA shortfall is through increase in maximum densities in the High Density Residential (HDR) designation. Currently the designation allows up to 26 units per acre for development of higher-intensity apartments, planned unit developments, condominiums and townhomes. Consistent with California Code 65583.2 an increase in the maximum density for the HDR designation to at least 30 units per acre will provide opportunities to accommodate housing for lower income households. The HDR designation encompasses 76 acres of the City (84
Page H - 94
Housing Element
tenera/Pfan
parcels). Parcel sizes range in size from 0.1 acres to over 6 acres with an average size of just less than 1 acre. The inventory of underutilized sites includes 2.29 acres of HDR properties with a realistic capacity for 48 units at a density of 26 units per acre. With an increase to a maximum density of at least 30 units per acre this realistic capacity is increased to 55 units that can accommodate housing for lower income households based on California Code 65583.2.
V
Strategy 2: The City will increase the maximum density for properties in the High Density Residential (HDR) district to at least 30 units per acre together with expansion of the Mixed Use District in the Downtown Business District Specific Plan(DBD)
As stated above, an increase to a maximum density of at least 30 units per acre in the HDR designation can accommodate the remaining 47 units of lower income housing. To expand opportunities for lower income housing the. City will, in conjunction with an increased HDR density, consider expanding the Mixed Use District in the DBD. State law (California Code 65583.2(h)) requires that 50 percent of the sites shortfall be in residential zones. As a result, expansion of mixed use in the DBD can not wholly fulfill the City's RHNA (only about 15 units of the RHNA shortfall), but can expand potential opportunities for lower income housing to complement the sites accommodation in the HDR areas. Consistent with the Land Use Element, the City encourages residential uses in Downtown as a catalyst for revitalization and economic development, The Downtown Business District Specific Plan (DBD) provides for mixed-use districts within portions of Downtown. Development within the DBD is expected to achieve densities of 40 units per acre or more and Program 4 commits the City to establishing a minimum density standard of at least 40 units per acre in the Mixed Use District of the DBD. The DBD encompasses 23.6 acres of properties, 47% (11 acres) of which is in the mixed use district (60 parcels). Parcel sizes range in size from 0.1 acres to just over 2.0 acres with an average size 0.2 acres. To accommodate the remaining RHNA of 47 low income units, the City must rezone just over 1 acre of land in the remaining areas of the DBD to mixed use. In these rezoned areas, owner occupied and rental multi-family residential uses will be permitted by right consistent with California Code 65583.2(h).
In addition, to these strategies, the City will adopt regulatory incentives for lot consolidation (Program 6).

by combining increased densities in the HDR districts (to at least 30 units per acre) together with rezoning additional properties to mixed use in the Downtown Business District Specific Plan. The newly identified sites will be zoned with minimum density and development standards that permit at least 16 units per site at a density of at least 20 units per acre and at least 50 percent of the very low and low-income housing need shall be accommodated on sites designated for residential use and for which nonresidential uses or mixed-uses are not permitted consistent with California Code 65583.2(h).
■	Maximize the density potential of limited land resources by promoting residential densities that achieve the highest allowable density for specific properties.
■	Update the vacant and underutilized residential sites inventory every two years to maintain accurate information and provide technical assistance and information on available City-owned parcels for lower-income developments to private or non-profit housing providers.
■	Create a marketing brochure that provides information on available development incentives, technical/financial assistance availability, and highlight the City7 s assets such as proximity to major regional corridors and ongoing infrastructure upgrades.

Update: December 2008
Program 4: Review of Downtown Business District Specific Plan Downtown La Puente offers significant opportunities for broader use, coordinated development, improved appearance, and a complementary mix of commercial and residential uses to create a more vibrant and economically productive area. To achieve these objectives, the City Council adopted a Downtown Business District Specific Plan (DBD) in 1994 to revitalize Downtown and preserve the neighborhood's small town charm. Because interest in mixed-use development has increased, the City will review the Specific Plan and make any amendments necessary by January 2009 to assure that the development standards, incentives, and overall vision for mixed-use in Downtown La Puente comports with market demand.
Page H - 96

\,

As part of the Specific Plan review, the City will establish clear guidance on densities for future mixed-use development based on previously approved projects. The DBD currently does not include density minimums or maximums for mixed-use developments. In omitting density ranges in the DBD, the City7s intent was for market forces to dictate the density, with the assumption that higher-density developments would contribute to the City's housing stock and provide much-needed economic development benefits. While the City's intent of allowing greater flexibility in density ranges to achieve higher density developments is still applicable, as a further demonstration of City commitment to mixed use in Downtown, the City will adopt a density minimum of at least 40 units per acre in the mixed-use areas. The feasibility of this density is confirmed by a previously approved project in the Downtown area (Star Theater site) that consisted of 48-unit mixed-use development on a 42,300-square-foot property (49 units per acre).
■	Review and revise as necessary the Downtown Business District Specific Plan.
■	As part of the review, establish minimum densities of at least 40 units per acre for mixed-use development consistent with densities used to calculate sites to meet regional housing need (RHNA).
■	Establish an incentive program for developers to stimulate mixed-use development. Include technical, administrative, and financial support (as delineated in the Resources section of the Housing Element and Program 6 of this Housing Plan), as well as flexibility in development standards.
■	Remove the requirement of a conditional use permit for senior citizen housing in the Downtown Business District and include specific development standards, including increased density allowances.

Program 5: Downtown Mixed-Use Sites
Mixed-use development will add more residential units in the downtown area. Such development is expected to enhance the market for downtown businesses and provide significant opportunities for affordable housing development. Elderly, less-mobile residents, as well as employees of downtown business, will particularly benefit from such opportunities. The sites inventory indicates a potential for 254 new residential units in downtown. Of these units, 208 are expected to achieve densities of at least

40 units per acre. To assure that development opportunities are provided to meet the City's regional housing need, the City will:
■	Encourage the construction of residences, both mixed use and freestanding, in the downtown area, as allowed by the Downtown Business District Specific Plan. Generate marketing materials for mixed-use developers that delineate site opportunities for mixed-use, technical assistance for interested developers, financial resources (local, private, and government), and development incentives.
■	Establish a protocol to monitor development interest, inquiries and, progress towards mixed-use development.

Program 6: Recycling of Underutilized Properties
Production of new affordable housing can be facilitated by providing up-to-date information on potential sites and assisting prospective developers with the assembly of project sites. City assistance and incentives to encourage residential and mixed-use projects will facilitate and encourage development in La Puente. The City will:
■	Facilitate the assembly and recycling of underutilized properties for new affordable housing construction through technical and/or financial assistance to developers and property owners. Technical assistance includes land development counseling by City planners, marketing brochure that provides information on available development incentives (see Program 3), coordination with agencies required to be involved in the development process such as the Los Angeles County Fire, Hazardous Waste, and Health Departments, and access to a list of sites available for residential development (such as properties that are vacant and underutilized - see Program 3) for local real estate agents. The primary source of financial assistance available to developers and property owners in the City of La Puente are Redevelopment Low and Moderate Income Funds. According to the City's Finance Department, as of February 2008, the balance of the Low- and
Page H - 98

Moderate-Income Fund was $166,807.34. Over the five-year period of this Housing Element the Agency expects to generate close to $837,000 in Low- and Moderate-Income funds. As an additional financial resource, developers interested in developing low income or special needs housing will be directed to funding available from the City of Industry Funds. The City of Industry Funds are tax increment set-aside funds administered by the Housing Authority of the County of Los Angeles (HACOLA). If interest is expressed by developers or development organizations, the City will assist in the application for funds. CalHome and CDBG Funds are available low- and moderate-income home rehabilitation and acquisition. For the 2008-2009 Program Year, the City received $587,595 in CDBG funds. In January 2008, La Puente was awarded a grant for $325,575 to be used over a three-year time period on loans for low- and moderate-income home rehabilitation in the City.
■	Waive or reduce fees for affordable projects, including sewer impact fees.
■	Consistent with Program 3: Adequate Sites, create a marketing brochure that provides information on available development incentives, technical/financial assistance availability, and highlight the City's assets such as proximity to major regional corridors and ongoing infrastructure upgrades.
■	As part of the Zoning Ordinance update, the City will encourage lot consolidation by providing regulatory incentives in the R-2, R-3 and R-4 district. The City of La Puente encourages the consolidation of property as a means to maximize development and redevelopment potential. This provision is intended to make full use of the City's limited land resources and promote larger residential developments that can facilitate a wide range of housing types and affordability levels. Incentives will include:

Housing Affordability
Affordable housing helps create a diverse community where people can share similar neighborhood experiences. Throughout Los Angeles County, residents face increasing challenges in finding affordable housing due to high housing demand at all levels. High demand and short supply have driven property values to levels that have shut many families and individuals out of not just the ownership market but affordable rental housing as well. Lower-income families in particular find it difficult to secure decent, safe housing.
Goal
3
Maximize the use of available financial resources and pursue creative and resourceful methods to reduce the overall cost of housing.
Policy 3.1:	Pursue programs and funding sources designed to maintain and improve the
affordability of existing housing units and for the construction of new housing to very low-, low-, and moderate-income households.
Policy 3.2:	Create collaborative partnerships with non-profit agencies and for-profit
developers to maximize resources available for the. provision of housing affordable to lower-income households. Support the efforts of non-profit organizations and private developers to obtain State and/ or Federal funds for the construction/preservation of affordable housing for lower-income households.

Program 7: Section 8 Assistance
The Housing Choice Voucher Program helps extremely-low/ very low-income families, elderly, and tire disabled afford safe, decent, and sanitary housing in the private market. The program is funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Tenant and property owners enter into a lease agreement, in which the tenant pays no more than 40 percent of his or her adjusted income directly to the property owner as rent. In a separate agreement, the Los Angeles County Housing Authority pays the remaining portion of the contract rent directly to the property owner. Participants are able to select any housing that meets the requirements of the program, and is not limited to units located in subsidized housing projects.
■	Support the Los Angeles County Housing Authority7 s efforts to maintain, and possibly increase, the current level of Section 8 rental assistance (361 households) to fund housing assistance for extremely low, very low- , and low-income households.
■	Direct eligible households to the program through direct referrals and the City website.

Program 9: Density Bonus
State law requires that cities offer density bonuses to home builders and developers to encourage affordable housing opportunities for extremely low-, very low-, low-and moderate-income households. Density bonuses and financial incentive or regulatory concessions are granted when a developer proposes to construct affordable housing. The qualifying thresholds for a density bonus are as follows:
■	Ten percent of the total units of a housing development for lower-income households; or
■	Five percent of the total units of a housing development for very low-income households; or
■	A senior citizen housing development as defined in Sections 51.3 and 51.12 of the Civil Code, or a mobile home park that limits residency based on age requirements for housing for older persons; or
■	Ten percent of the total dwelling units in a common interest development as defined in Section 1351 of the Civil Code for persons and families of moderate-income.
Consistent with State law, developers in La Puente can receive density bonuses of 20 to 35 percent, depending on the amount and type of affordable housing provided, and concessions or exceptions from normally applicable zoning and other development standards.

Program 10: Preservation of Affordable Housing
Over the next 10 years (2008-2018), all four federally assisted developments in La Puente which provide 333 affordable units have expiring affordability covenants. Three of these projects - La Villa Puente Apartments, La Puente Park Apartments, and Nantes Manor - are owned by for-profit corporations. (La Villa Puente is a limited-dividend corporation.) It is unknown at this time whether the owners will renew the Section 8 contracts for these properties. The fourth development, Amar Plaza, is cooperatively owned by its tenants, and is very likely to convert to market-rate units over the next decade. The City will track the at-risk status of these properties annually. If any properties indicate plans to convert to market rate, the City will contact qualified entities to explore transfer of ownership options.
■	Consult annually with property owners of affordable housing in the City to gauge the likelihood of conversion of affordable units and discuss opportunities for the preservation of affordable housing units at risk of converting to market rents.
■	If any property owners indicate plans to convert to market rate, the City will contact qualified entities to explore transfer of ownership options. The entities will be selected from the State's list of qualified entities to acquire/manage affordable housing. Developers such as Jamboree Housing Corporation which is identified by the State as a qualified entity, have knowledge of La Puente based on previous developments and may be a viable resource for acquisition of at-risk units. Additional qualified local developers May include TELACU, LINC, and Southern California Housing Development Corporation. The City will make this list available to interested residents, developers, or property owners.

Alleviate any potential governmental constraints to housing production and affordability.
Policy 4.1:	Review and adjust as appropriate residential development standards/
regulations/ ordinances/ departmental process procedures/ and residential fees related to rehabilitation and construction that are determined to be a constraint on development of housing/ particularly for lower- and moderate-income households and for persons with special needs.

of time spent in this process/ and where appropriate/ reduce direct cost in fees of developing new affordable housing opportunities.
Program 13: Land Use Regulations (Title 10 and General Plan)
Housing affordability can be affected by factors in both the private and public sectors. Actions by the City can have an impact on the price and availability of housing. To remove constraints to the development of housing/ the following actions will be taken by the City by December 2008/ as part of the comprehensive update to Title 10 of the Municipal Code (Zoning Code):
■	Finalize Zoning Code updates and any necessary General Plan amendments necessary to facilitate recycling of land. Specifically for properties that are zoned for densities lower than those allowed in the General Plan/ re-zone to achieve General Plan consistency.
■	The City will review and revise if necessary development standards for second units. To eliminate misunderstandings regarding City policy on second unitsz the City shall modify Title 10 to remove second units as an unclassified use from this section.
■	Section 10.60.020 of Title 10 lists unclassified uses that are permitted with an unclassified use permit (akin to a conditional use permit) in La Puente. The City will revise the unclassified use permit to be a conditional use permit/ and list specific zones in which each of these uses may be conditionally permitted.

■	Inclusion of an overly restrictive definition of a " family" in the zoning code may have the potential of discriminating against group homes or other housing for persons with disabilities on the basis of familial status. In recognition of legal standards related to fair housing and civil right the City of La Puente does not use this definition. To prevent misperception by the public that development can be restricted to blood related families, the definition of family will be removed from Title 10.
■	The City allows the development of senior citizen housing subject to the preparation of a specific plan. The intent of requiring a specific plan is to foster flexibility to encourage efficient utilization of property and thereby reduce costs to the senior citizen resident Review and revise as necessary Title 10 senior citizen housing project development standards.
■	Increase the building height standards for the R-3 and R-4 district to 40 feet and 3 stories maximum (an increase from the current 25 feet and 2 stories maximum).

Program 14: Manufactured Housing
Manufactured housing is permitted by right on all lots which permit single-family houses, pursuant to State law. In La Puente, mobile homes on a permanent foundation are conditionally permitted in all zones and are permitted by right in the R-l zone, subject to certain restrictions. Facilitating the use of manufactured homes can decrease construction costs and contribute to the affordability of housing in the community.
In accordance with State law, amend the City's zoning ordinance to specifically allow manufactured housing in all residential zones. Similar to other residential uses in the same zone, manufactured housing will be compatible in style and construction materials utilized with existing housing in the community.

Program 15: Extremely Loxv-Income Housing Need
Extremely low-income households and households with special needs have limited housing options in La Puente. Housing types appropriate for these groups include emergency shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, and single-room occupancy (SRO) units. The La Puente Zoning Ordinance does not specifically address the provision of such housing. The City has initiated a comprehensive update of the Zoning Ordinance. As part of the update, the City will address provisions for housing for extremely low-income persons.
■ Emergency Shelters: Update the Zoning Ordinance to identify a zone or zone (s) to permit emergency shelters by right consistent with SB2. Develop objective standards for emergency shelters to regulate the following, as permitted under SB2, including; o The maximum number of beds/persons permitted; o Parking based on demonstrated need but that does not exceed
parking requirements for other uses in the same zone; o The size/location of exterior and interior onsite waiting and
client intake areas;
o The provision of onsite management;
o The proximity of other emergency shelters, provided that emergency shelters are not required to be more than 300 feet apart;
o The length of stay; o Lighting; and
o Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation.
o Facilitate housing opportunities for extremely low-income persons by updating the Zoning Ordinance to establish definitions, performance standards, and siting regulations for transitional and supportive housing development, and SRO developments.
o Continue to allow the establishment of transitional and supportive housing that functions as residential uses in residential zones consistent with similar residential uses.
o Solicit input on the zoning ordinance provisions for homeless shelters from service agencies that work with extremely-low income persons and the homeless or persons/families at-risk of homelessness such as the East San Gabriel Valley Coalition for the Homeless (ESGVCH).

Program 16: Second Units
Second units (granny flats) provide an important source of affordable housing. By promoting the development of second units, a community may ease a rental housing deficit, maximize limited land resources and existing infrastructure, and assist low- and moderate-income homeowners with supplemental income. Second units can increase the property tax base and contribute to the local affordable housing stock.
• To encourage second units as a resource for increasing housing resources and alleviating overcrowding, the City will develop information packets to market second-unit construction that can include materials for a second-unit application, explain the application process, and describe incentives to promote their development. The City will also advertise second-unit development opportunities to homeowners on the City's web site, at the community and senior centers. Following the comprehensive zoning update, the City will establish a preapproved design prototype to encourage and stimulate the development of second-units by June 2009. The prototype will reflect typical lot sizes and applicable development regulations.

Equal Housing Opportunity
When it comes to buying, selling, or leasing a home or renting an apartment, several state and federal laws were enacted to ensure the equal opportunity in housing for all people. The Civil Rights Act of 1966 prohibits all racial discrimination in the sale or rental of property. Moreover, the Fair Housing Act declares a national policy of fair housing throughout the United States, making illegal any discrimination in the sale, lease or rental of housing, or making housing otherwise unavailable, because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national

origin. This includes the right to expect equal professional service, the opportunity to consider a broad range of housing choices, no discriminatory limitations on communities or locations of housing, no discrimination in the financing, appraising, or insuring of housing, reasonable accommodations in rules, practices and procedures for persons with disabilities, and to be free from harassment or intimidation for exercising your fair housing rights.
Goal
5
Promote equal opportunity for all residents to reside in the housing of their choice.
Policy 5.1:	Promote fair housing practices throughout the community.
Policy 5.2:	Prohibit practices that restrict housing choice by arbitrarily directing prospective
buyers and renters to certain neighborhoods or types of housing.
Policy 5.3:	Publicize fair housing programs and services offered to the community by the
City and other agencies.
Program 18: Fair Housing
Through implementation of the Housing Element, the City works towards assuring fair housing choice for all residents. The City also collaborates with other Los Angeles County municipalities to regularly develop and complete a comprehensive Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice.
■ Continue to provide outreach material on state and federal fair housing laws and direct complaints of housing discrimination to appropriate enforcement agencies (i.e., State Department of Fair Employment and Housing, Fair Housing Council of the San Gabriel Valley, and Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development).

individuals with disabilities equal housing opportunities. Reasonable accommodation is one of the tools intended to further housing opportunities for people with disabilities. Reasonable accommodation provides a means of requesting from the local government flexibility in the application of land use and zoning regulations or, in some instances, even a waiver of certain restrictions or requirements because it is necessary to achieve equal access to housing.
■	Draft and adopt a program addressing reasonable accommodation to land use and zoning decisions and procedures regulating the siting, funding, development and use of housing for people with disabilities for persons with disabilities.
■	Conduct a consultation with service agencies that work with disabled and other special needs population. The consultation will ensure that the City's ordinance reflects the needs, concerns, and experiences of the disabled population. Include entities such as Independent Living Center San Gabriel/Pomona Valleys, the La Puente Senior Center, and the Center for Aging Resources Heritage Clinic Pasadena.

Review of Past Accomplishments
State law (California Government Code Section 65588[a]) requires jurisdictions to review their housing elements to evaluate:
■	The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to the attainment of the state housing goal;
■	The effectiveness of the housing element in attainment of the community's housing goals and objectives; and
■	The progress in implementation of the housing element.
The evaluation helps a jurisdiction identify the extent to which adopted programs have been successful in achieving stated objectives and addressing local needs, and how such programs continue to be relevant in addressing current and future housing needs. The evaluation provides the basis for recommended modifications to policies and programs in the updated element, and provides meaningful guidance for establishing new objectives.
This section summarizes La Puente's accomplishments toward implementing the 2000-2005 Housing Element. Table 45 summarizes the quantified objectives contained in the City's 2000 Housing Element, and evaluates the progress toward fulfilling these objectives. A program-byprogram review is presented in Table 45.

The 2000 objective for new construction (375 units) was based on a rate of 50 housing starts per year over the previous 7-Vi year planning period. Based on a review of Building Department records, the analysis indicates that between 1998 and 2005, the City fulfilled 15 percent of its quantified objective for new housing construction. The shortfall in production relative to the stated objective is not unexpected, given that La Puente is largely built out, and further, knowing that the high cost of land requires that affordable housing projects receive significant subsidies or development incentives.
In June of 2007, the La Puente City Council approved development of 18 low-income senior housing units as part of the Unruh Specific Plan. These units have been credited toward the 2008-2014 SCAG Housing Element cycle.
The rehabilitation objective for the Housing Rehabilitation Program was 262 units. The Housing Rehabilitation Program offers grants and deferred loans to improve the exterior and interior of homes occupied by very low-and low-income residents. Between 2000-2006, the CalHome-funded rehabilitation program assisted 95 applicants; between 2002-2006, the CDBG-funded rehabilitation program assisted 228 applicants. Together, the CalHome and CDBG rehabilitation programs assisted 323 households, surpassing the objective (131 units) in the 2000 Housing Element.

During the previous planning period, of the 159 units that were identified as being at risk of conversion to market-rate units, 119 were converted to market-rate housing.
Table 46 summarizes progress to date in implementation of previous programs, and the continued appropriateness of identified programs. The results of this analysis form the basis for developing the comprehensive housing program strategy for the 2008-2014 Housing Element.

City of La Puente
Housing Element 20BB-2014
Community Resources Element
Community Resources Element
The Community Resources Element sets forth goals and policies that build on current recreation, social service, and resource conservation programs. La Puente7s community resources include parks, recreational programs, social services, and important environmental conservation programs. Policies focus on the creation of new pocket parks, provision of joint-use playground facilities, reduction in urban runoff, and continuation of waste management and air quality programs.
Scope and Content
State General Plan law requires every jurisdiction to address preservation of open space and conservation of natural resources. As a result, communities often prepare elements that emphasize physical open spaces or natural resources. However, social resources of a community are also important assets. Given that La Puente is largely urbanized, the General Plan provides a more flexible consideration of community resources that combines the City's physical assets with the community's cultural and social offerings.
La Puente has a strong family focus and has tailored cultural, recreational, educational, and social programs to respond to families' needs. Given the City's longstanding policy of providing quality community services, this element broadly defines La Puente's resources to include the following:
■ Parks and Recreation. The provision of City parks and recreational facilities, and building opportunities to create additional parks are high City priorities.
■ Human/Social Services. Ensuring provision of quality education and children and youth services at facilities within the community is desired to promote quality of life.
■ Resource Conservation. Preserving air and water quality, and ensuring responsible treatment of refuse, energy conservation, and a reliable water supply are required to comply with State and federal laws and improve the natural environment.

Parks and Recreation
Parks and recreational facilities provide opportunities for both recreation and leisure, and parks enhance the beauty and character of La Puente. Moreover, as a family-oriented community, the City desires to offer a variety of recreational, educational, and social activities to residents of all ages. Providing adequate parks and open spaces is one of the primary challenges the City faces in improving the quality of life for residents.
The City has a single large park that provides facilities for active and passive recreation. La Puente Regional Park contains lighted baseball fields, picnic areas, lighted tennis courts, lighted basketball courts, handball courts, and a multi-use turf area for soccer and other field sports. The City sponsors recreational, educational, and cultural programs geared toward all ages, including youth and adult sports leagues, recreation classes, and special events.
The City has a significant shortage of park space to serve its population. While many cities in the San Gabriel Valley look to and succeed in providing 2 to 5 acres of park land per 1,000 residents, La Puente Park, results in only 0.57 acres of park space for every 1,000 residents. While Allen J.
Martin County Park, located within the City's sphere of influence, does offer additional park space, as a County park it serves a population beyond La Puente. Providing additional park and recreation sites presents a significant challenge. No large sites in the community are available or suitable for an additional community park. Moreover, La Puente's built-out neighborhoods have limited vacant land available for parks. The City continues to seek opportunities to create additional parks to provide recreational options, beautify La Puente, and enhance property values with pocket parks and joint use schools/parks presenting the only options.
Pocket Parks
Despite limited land resources for new parks, the City will work with landowners to create new parks within residential neighborhoods. Due to La Puente's original subdivision pattern, many older neighborhoods
Page CR - 2
Community Resources Element
contain single residences on large, deep lots. Creating smaller neighborhood or “pocket" parks is a popular and cost-effective way to increase local park resources. Pocket parks are designed primarily to meet the recreation needs of residents within the immediate area, while also beautifying the neighborhood. Creation of such parks will require either purchase of properties by the City or property donations by private landholders.
Joint Use Agreements
Public school facilities in La Puente also offer opportunities to expand active recreational options. The two high school and nine elementary/secondary schools in the City have diverse recreational facilities, including ball fields, soccer fields, and tot lots. Many of
these school facilities are underutilized and gated to prevent or restrict public use during non-school hours. Working collaboratively with the school districts, La Puente will seek out opportunities to allow for recreational use of school facilities by residents. In this manner, schools become more than just places where children are educated, but also focal points which bring the community together for family activities.
Other Regional Recreation Facilities
Recreation facilities in surrounding communities, such as the Babe Zaharias Golf Course, and County regional parks located within adjacent unincorporated areas and the City of Industry, provide additional recreational opportunities for City residents. Private open spaces are also provided within planned unit development areas within the City, and as part of larger multiple-family development projects.
Figure CR-1 identifies La Puente Park, the Babe Zaharias golf course, an open space area within a private development, and the school sites that have potential to serve as joint-use recreation sites. Creative land use planning, collaboration with school districts and the private sector, and creative financing mechanisms will help the City achieve the long-term vision of providing ample park and recreation opportunities to residents.

Policy 1.5	Ensure and expand opportunities for equal access to recreational facilities and programs by making accessibility improvements and subsidizing recreational activities, as feasible, for those in need.
Education	
Education is the foundation of a community and is at the heart of economic prosperity and security. A community that values and promotes education and learning reaps benefits for residents and businesses. Public and private schools, adult education centers, and continued educational resources are most successful when they have the support of students, families, and City officials. High-quality schools and libraries provide a positive learning environment for youth, as well as job training opportunities for adults. Figure CR-2 shows the location of educational resources within La Puente.

Gabriel Valley. The Center is one of the few adult education programs in the State providing extensive customized training programs and services for businesses. La Puente is also home to the Willow Adult School, the main vocational school of the Hacienda-La Puente School District. The school offers job training and placement; academic coursework in technology, health, business and trades; and vocational training for people with disabilities. The school also runs the Grow Program and offers activities for individuals receiving General Relief, focusing on entering full-time unsubsidized employment. The La Puente Valley Regional Occupational Program (ROP) also offers students and adults the opportunity for vocational training.
Libraries
Library services in La Puente are provided by the Los Angeles County Public Library. La Puente Library, located in the Civic Center, holds over 70,000 volumes and features an adult section, children's area, periodical area, and meeting room. Sunkist Library, in west La Puente, also offers 70,000+ volumes and features an adult section, children's area, periodical area, and meeting room. This library also serves as an employment reference center for residents. In addition, local high schools and elementary schools provide limited collections of books and learning materials.

Children and Youth Services
Children and youth represent our future. As such, the availability of affordable child care and meaningful educational activities for youth are essential. These programs provide the opportunity to build self esteem, teach respect and responsibility, and give our children and youth a foundation to succeed. Moreover, after-school and summertime programs are critical for adolescents, providing positive alternatives to gangs and criminal activity. Such programs are essential for families, where oftentimes both parents must work.
Local nonprofit and for-profit organizations offer numerous childcare options in the City. Fifty-three child care centers within the Planning Area serve up to 2,000 children, with many centers offering care for several age groups. The City supplements these services with a tiny tot program offered at affordable rates. Local elementary schools and nonprofit organizations offer after-school programs for children while their parents complete the work day. Tire City also sponsors after-school programs at three elementary schools and at the La Puente Community Center. The City-sponsored STARS Club offers supervised recreation activities during and after-
school hours for children in first through sixth grades. Activities include softball, basketball, crafts, excursions, homework assistance, and special events.
Afterschool programs are an. important part of the community strategy to provide children and youth services.
The City is committed to providing meaningful youth services. Local school districts operate summer camps. La Puente Park provides a venue for sports leagues and other recreational opportunities. The La Puente Park Community Center Gymnasium offers recreational activities for youth, teens, and adults. The City's Youth Activities Grant Program helps pay for up to half of the registration cost of qualified youth activities. The City is also developing a new youth learning center at La Puente Park offering computer labs, classrooms, and vocational and life skills training opportunities for middle and high school students.
The quality, amount and availability of children's and youth services improve the overall health and well-being of La Puente. Thus, the City remains committed to ensuring that a variety of recreational programs and facilities are made available to meet the changing needs and interests of residents.

Resource Conservation
Resource conservation contributes to a higher quality of life for La Puente residents. Resource conservation issues include solid waste management, air quality, and energy conservation.
Solid Waste Management
Since the late 1970s, an increasing shortage of refuse disposal sites and diminishing landfill capacity led the State Legislature to implement the Integrated Waste Management Act (AB 939) to reduce, recycle, and reuse solid waste generated in California. Specifically, the Act requires jurisdictions to divert 50 percent of solid waste horn landfill disposal through recycling or source reduction programs, as well as to oversee the disposal of household hazardous wastes. The State has continued to refine program goals and work toward preserving land resources for productive uses, not landfills.
The City has adopted a Source Reduction and Recycling Plan that details the City's commitment to waste management. Private contractors provide waste management services. La Puente offers residential and commercial recycling programs, yard waste programs, hazardous
Page CR - 11
Community Resources Element
YwalW
household waste recycling, and bulky item pickups. Funded through an Integrated Waste Management Board grant, La Puente also sponsors a comprehensive used oil recycling program. La Puente remains committed to achieving a waste diversion goal of 50 percent.
Air Quality
Every day, the average person breathes 3,400 gallons of air. Yet our air is contaminated by smog resulting from automobiles, industrial processes, and daily activities. Common air pollutants include ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (Nth), sulfur dioxide (SD2), fine particulate matter (PM10/PM2.5), and lead (Pb). These pollutants are responsible for a range of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, reduced tolerance for exercise, impairment of mental functions, reduced plant growth, and formation of acid rain.
Smog is the most visible evidence of air pollution in the Los Angeles basin.
Although air quality has localized Impacts, it is a regional problem created throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Every city must accept a portion of responsibility for addressing air quality problems. La Puente is located within the South Coast Air Basin, a geographic area that extends from the Pacific Ocean north to the San Gabriel Mountains and east to the San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mountains. Due to topography, climate, and daily pollutant emissions, the Basin is a "nonattainment" area for ambient air quality for ozone, carbon monoxide, and fine particulate matter. Although continued reductions in pollutant concentrations are expected, the Basin is not expected to meet air quality standards in the foreseeable future.
Page CR - 12
Community Resources Element

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) works to improve regional air quality and to achieve federal and State standards for various air pollutants. According to SCAQMD, air quality has improved since the latter decades of the last century, due to lower energy consumption, improved auto emission standards, and use of alternative modes of transportation.
Due to La Puente's location adjacent to two freeways and an industrial corridor, local air quality is affected most by vehicle emissions, railway transportation, and industry uses located in adjacent communities. Although the City has no direct ability to manage programs for emissions control, La Puente can support the following regional Air Quality Management Plan measures to help reduce air pollution:
■	Continued collaborative efforts with Foothill Transit and MT A to facilitate and encourage options for non-automobile travel
■	Coordination with the Alameda Corridor East project to implement programs reducing pollutants from trains moving through the San Gabriel Valley
x	■ Improving traffic flow through and within the City by making
(	needed roadway improvements, and synchronized signaling
■	Continue to provide programs that encourage the use of mass transit such as bus and rail pass subsidies and local transit such as the La Puente Link and Dial-a-Ride.
Energy Conservation
Energy conservation is another important strategy to improve air quality and preserve natural resources. Pollutants are generated by fossil fuels and natural gas used to produce electricity. Conserving energy contributes to improvements in air quality. Buildings are one of the major contributors to electricity demand. Energy requirements and pollutants associated with energy generation can be reduced through architectural designs, building construction, and landscaping. The City promotes energy conservation through the implementation of State of California Title 24 energy performance requirements in building codes. The mandatory State Title 24 measures require minimum ceiling, wall, and raised floor insulation; minimum heating, ventilating, air conditioning and water heating equipment efficiencies; and other requirements.

Water Supply and Quality
Water is one of our most precious resources, yet is often taken for granted. In many areas, groundwater levels have declined as water use continues to exceed recharge through rainfall and stream flow. In addition to domestic and commercial use and irrigation, the water system must be capable of providing adequate pressure for fire suppression purposes. Limiting activities that pollute water supplies is also of great importance.
Water Suppliers
Due to poor groundwater quality underlying La Puente, the City purchases water supplies from three agencies: Suburban Water Systems (SWS), the La Puente Valley County Water District, and the San Gabriel Valley Water Company (Figure CR-3).
Page CR - 14

ement
Approximately 80 percent of SWS water comes from company-owned groundwater wells, the remainder from wholesalers such as the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. SWS provides water to La Puente in sufficient quantity and quality to satisfy State and federal standards. La Puente Valley County Water District provides water from three groundwater wells in the San Gabriel Basin. The District has a three-million-gallon reservoir located on Main Street and plans pipeline, tank, pump, and well refurbishments in the immediate future. The District foresees relatively slow and modest population growth within La Puente and does not anticipate demand shortfalls. The San Gabriel Valley Water Company (SGVWC) serves La Puente and 11 cities in the San Gabriel Valley. SGVWC has 34 wells in the San Gabriel Basin and it purchases surface water from MWD and reclaims water to sell for irrigation to cemeteries and golf courses.
The City7 s location in arid Southern California underscores the importance of continued education and water conservation technologies. The City remains committed to water conservation strategies that ensure a healthy, clean and reliable supply of water remains available for residents. The City encourages the use of simple water conservation measures in homes, proactive inspections and reporting of water leaks, and efficient watering practices for landscaping.

Water Quality
The San Gabriel Valley once was home to numerous industries whose
past activities contaminated soils and groundwater. In La Puente, the San
Jose Creek area has been contaminated with volatile organic compounds
that make groundwater wells unusable. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency has designated four Superfund sites in the San Gabriel
Valley to reduce the health risks created from previous chemical disposal
practices. A variety of government and private agencies coordinate
cleanup activities including the control of contamination sources, soil
remediation to prevent further contamination, and control/cleaning of
contaminated plumes.
Although the federal government is responsible for cleanup of the San
Jose Creek area, La Puente is committed to reducing the further
contamination of underground water. The City participates with Los
Angeles County in the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) program to reduce the amount of water polluted by pesticides,
engine oil, and household chemicals that run into the storm drain system
and pollute groundwater. As part of this effort, the City must comply
with the County's Stormwater Quality Management Program and
implement Best Management Practices (BMPs) in several areas including:
public outreach, planning and construction, public agency activities,
business inspections, and illicit connection and flow. The City requires
development projects to implement the most effective BMPs for
stormwater and urban runoff pollution prevention and source control.
Goal

Adequate water for La Puente residents and businesses, and a clean underground aquifer.
Policy 5,1	Work with water suppliers to ensure that adequate water resources continue
to be available to meet the needs of La Puente residents and business.
Policy 5.2	Encourage residents and businesses in La Puente to reduce unnecessary
consumption of water and educate residents to avoid or minimize activities that pollute urban runoff.
Policy 5,3	Work with local, regional, and State agencies to provide a cost-effective and

Community Safety Element
Community Safety Element
La Puente's urban environment contains a variety of hazards, both natural and related to human activity that can potentially endanger community safety. Residents and businesses look to City and County agencies to protect the community from threats to public safety. People recognize that a low crime rate, fire prevention, and reliable emergency response services contribute to the overall livability of La Puente. Equally important contributors to community safety are the safe handling, transport, and disposal of hazardous materials, and reduction of excessive noise. As described in the Community Vision, residents feel that creating and maintaining a safe environment is one of the City's most important objectives.
Scope and Content
The Community Safety Element addresses hazards in La Puente and presents goals and policies to reduce the potential risks of death, injuries, property damage, and economic and social disruption associated with hazards. Hazards affecting La Puente include earthquakes; excessive noise; hazardous materials associated with commercial, industrial and residential uses; criminal activity; and urban fires.
Within this chapter, community safety issues are organized into four broad themes:
■	Hazard Mitigation. Addresses seismic hazards, flooding, and human activity hazards, such as the use, transport and disposal of hazardous materials.
■	Emergency Response. Emergency response efforts are essential to prevent or minimize potential loss of life or property damage and to respond effectively to safety hazards, accidents and natural disasters.
" Noise. Noise affects our health and quality of life.
■	Safety Services. Police and fire protection services create a safe community for residents and businesses. Low crime, foresight in the development process, and adequate enforcement lead to a safe environment.

Hazard Mitigation
Seismic Activity
Southern California lies on the edge of the Pacific Plate, one of the many jigsaw puzzle pieces that fit together to comprise the Earths crust. The constant shifting, pushing, and shoving of these crustal plates - together with the complex interfacing of many varied geological structures -creates ruptures and crustal weaknesses known as faults. Movement along a fault releases stored energy and tension, thereby producing earthquakes. Powerful and widespread rupture or shaking ground can cause buildings to move off their foundations or collapse; damage buildings and other structures, roads and other public infrastructure; damage utility lines and set off fires; and threaten the lives of people and animals. The damage to structures presents the greatest risk to life and property. Issues relevant to La Puente include the potential for earthquakes and secondary hazards related to earthquakes that may occur in the region.

Earthquakes
La Puente lies within a region of several active faults and therefore is subject to the risks and hazards associated with earthquakes. Eleven major faults impact the Los Angeles region. The California Geological Survey classifies seven of these faults as "active." Several major faults within a 50-mile radius of La Puente are capable of producing substantial effects from ground shaking. These faults include the San Andreas, Whittier-Elsinore, Chino, Sierra Madre-Cucamonga, and San Fernando faults. A major earthquake produced along any of these faults has the potential to produce strong ground shaking in La Puente.
Faults
Discovered in 2003, the Puente Hills fault system is comprised of three sections that run under downtown Los Angeles, through La Puente, and into the Coyote Hills of north Orange County. Research continues to examine whether this fault also extends into the San Jose Hills area. Figure CS-1 shows the geographic relationship of the
City to immediately surrounding active and potentially active faults. No active faults have been identified at the ground surface within the city limits, nor have any Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault zones been designated. However, the City overlies the Puente Hills segment of the Elysian Park blind thrust fault. The fault is referred to as blind because it does not intercept the ground surface and therefore cannot be detected visually. These faults are all capable of movement that could produce substantial ground shaking.
The newly discovered Puente Hills Fault has been credited with causing the 1987 Whittier Narrows Earthquake.
The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (Public Resources Code, Section 2621, et seq.) was adopted by the State legislature following the 1971 San Fernando Earthquake to establish a statewide program to map surface traces of known active faults, and to restrict development in areas adjacent to faults, known as Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones.
Expansive Soil
As in much of California, expansive type soils are prevalent in La Puente. Expansive soils act much like a sponge. As they absorb water, they swell and as they lose water, they shrink. Expansive soils may become unstable during ground shaking, and are one of the most prevalent causes of earthquake damage to buildings. Damage caused by expansive soils includes disfiguring and structural damage due to cracking walls, ceilings, driveways, sidewalks and basement floors. Minor damage to doors and windows may cause them to function erratically. To minimize damage to wood frame structures foundations can be made more flexible, through the use of reinforced or post-tensioned slabs.

Site preparation may include prewetting, removal of the expansive soil and replacement with non-expanding soils, chemical treatments of the soil or other methods. Grading and drainage should be designed so that excess surface water is collected and safely discharged off the building pad. Structural design of new buildings should consider the potential effects of expansive soils on selected building materials. If for instance, the structure contains masonry walls, which are intolerant to even small movements, a rigid foundation or one that will isolate the structure should be used.
During an earthquake, the ground can shake violently. Rapid back-and-forth motion can cause buildings to fall off foundations, resulting in major structural damage and sometimes total collapse of buildings. Seismic risk associated with the regional fault system, expansive soils, and the blind thrust fault underlying La Puente emphasizes the need to ensure that all development projects - and the retrofit of existing structures - incorporate appropriate design features to guard against widespread property damage and loss of life in the event of an earthquake.
Seismic Retrofitting
Residential seismic retrofitting strategies focus on strengthening house-to-foundation connections using specially designed hardware and construction methods. Retrofitting allows a structure to withstand greater earthquake force with less structural damage. Older houses are especially susceptible to earthquake damage, and therefore prime candidates for retrofitting, because they were built before homes were required by law to be earthquake-resistant. Seismic retrofitting of an older home typically deals with four components of the structure: cripple walls, shear walls, connections, and foundation. Retrofitting reinforces each of these elements to strengthen the force-resisting strength of a building. However, the most beneficial efforts focus on strengthening cripple walls because seismic forces in a building accumulate all the way down to the ground, and they are greatest at the base of the building.
Page CS - 5
Community Safety Element

A cripple wall is less than a full story high, usually found between the first floor and the foundation o structure. It is generally the weakest part of older buildings.
Design of new seismic retrofit systems, whether hidden or exposed, should respect the character and integrity of the building being retrofitted, as well as buildings in the surrounding area. The City will continue to encourage earthquake preparedness in newer homes through simple home protection such as bolting furniture and water heaters and creating emergency supply kits.
Page CS - 6
Community Safety Element

Earthquake-Related Hazards
Local geological conditions may create additional hazards associated with seismic activity. Earthquakes produce ground-shaking effects that, in larger quakes, may result in ground failure. In locations where groundwater levels intersect with loose, unconsolidated soils, a condition called liquefaction can occur, whereby soils lose cohesion - and the ability to support structures - when subjected to strong ground motion.
Liquefaction presents the most prominent secondary ground failure effect of earthquakes. According to the California Geological Survey, most of La Puente is subject to liquefaction. A few areas of the City close to the Industry Hills Recreation Center and portions of the Babe Zaharias Golf Course are subject to earthquake-induced landslides because the area includes steep hill slopes.
California law requires identification of liquefaction zones, where the stability of foundation soils must be investigated, and landslide zones, where the stability of hill slopes must be evaluated. Figure CS-2 shows areas susceptible to seismically induced liquefaction and landslides in La Puente. Within these areas, geologic studies must be completed and countermeasures undertaken in the design and construction of buildings for human occupancy. California law also requires disclosure of liquefaction or landslide zone status as a part of all real estate transactions within identified areas.
Flood Hazards
According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, La Puente is not located within either a 100- or 500-year flood zone. Regional drainage infrastructure adequately protects the City from flooding associated with storm events. The City's distance from the Pacific Ocean minimizes exposure to tidal wave (tsunami) hazards resulting from offshore earthquakes.
Dam Inundation Zones
A 100-year flood is defined as a major flood event that has a 1% or greater chance of occurring during any one year. Flood hazard planning practices addresses such storms, as well as 50-year and 500-year events.
La Puente is located south of the Santa Fe Dam and northeast of the Whittier Narrows Dam, both of which pose minimal flood threats.
The Santa Fe Dam and Reservoir are located on the San Gabriel River east of La Puente and the Whittier Narrows Dam and Legg Lake are located near the intersection of the Pomona Freeway (SR-60) and Interstate 605.

Both are owned and operated by the Los Angeles District Army Corps of Engineers. The Santa Fe Dam's downstream floodplain includes a very small portion of the La Puente Planning Area. In the unlikely event of a dam failure, floodwaters would extend to the northwest corner of the West Puente Valley area within one and one-half hours. In the event of a dam failure at Whittier Narrows Dam, upstream floodwaters would reach portions of unincorporated Los Angeles County adjacent to the Planning Area, just west of Puente Avenue. Due to high inflows to the Whittier Narrows dam, widespread flooding in areas west of the Planning Area would be expected.
Another inundation hazard arises from the Puddingstone Reservoir, located in the City of San Dimas near the junction of SR-57 and 1-10. In the unlikely event of catastrophic failure or breach of the Puddingstone Dam, floodwaters would extend
throughout most of north and west La Puente within two to three hours.
Failure of Puddingstone Dam, located in San Dimas, would result in potential inundation of parts of La Puente.
Figure CS-3 shows the location of Dam Inundation Zones within the La Puente Planning Area.

Human Activity Hazards
The California Health and Safety Code defines a hazardous material as any material that, due to quantity, concentration, physical, or chemical characteristics, poses a significant potential hazard to public health and safety or to the environment. The manufacturing, use, and transport of hazardous materials are considered potential human activity hazards.
Commercial and industrial businesses located in La Puente and nearby communities use hazardous materials, including such businesses as dry cleaners, film processors, auto service providers, landscape contractors, and paint shops. Larger businesses, primarily in industrial areas, can generate, use, and/or store large quantities of hazardous products. The current regulatory environment provides a high level of protection from the hazardous materials manufactured, transported to businesses, and stored within La Puente. Federal, State, and County agencies enforce regulations for hazardous waste generators and users. Approximately 100 hazardous waste generators exist in the vicinity of La Puente. Most are located in the City of Industry and adjacent unincorporated areas.
In the 1990s, the State of California's Department of Toxic Substances Control aggressively pursued a program to identify and force remediation of leaking underground storage tanks throughout the state. Fuel leaks from these storage tanks can result in substantial soil and groundwater contamination. The majority of the contaminated sites identified in La Puente are gasoline stations.
Leaking underground storage tanks at gasoline stations are a common source of hazardous materials in La Puente.
The Los Angeles County Fire Department, Health Hazardous Materials Division tracks hazardous materials handlers to ensure appropriate reporting and compliance. The Division inspects businesses that generate hazardous waste, conducts
criminal investigations, provides site mitigation oversight, and undertakes emergency response operations. Such inspections reduce risks associated with exposure to hazardous materials and adverse effects on the environment.
La Puente's land use pattern separates industry from residential uses. However, commercial freight carriers transporting hazardous substances along the Pomona Freeway or along the railways present potential hazards. The City contracts with the County Fire Department's Emergency Operations Section for 24-hour emergency response services to hazardous materials incidents. Emergency responders identify unknown substances, monitor spills and releases for safe and immediate

mitigation, and identify responsible parties for payment of cleanup costs. The Inspection Division of the Fire Department7 s Emergency Operation section inspects hazardous material handling and hazardous wastegenerating businesses to assure compliance with federal, State, and local laws and regulations. Additionally, Inspection Division staff responds to medical waste emergencies, assists law enforcement agencies with response to illegal drug labs, and investigates resident and business complaints.
Residents also use a range of household hazardous products. To address household hazardous wastes,	the City
cooperates with the County to sponsor programs that raise awareness of proper use, storage, and disposal of household hazardous wastes. These efforts also support the City's commitment to minimize pollutants in urban runoff.
Goal

Safe use, transport, and disposal of hazardous materials.
Policy 2.1	Cooperate with federal, State, and County agencies to reduce risks to
residents associated with the use or transport of hazardous materials.
Policy 2.2	Develop and maintain a coordinated emergency operations plan, and
educate the community on emergency procedures to respond to natural and human activity hazards.
Policy 2.3	Continue to educate the community regarding the safe use and disposal of
household hazardous wastes.

Community Safety Element
Emergency Response
Businesses and residents in La Puente are subject to potential hazards associated with earthquakes, hazardous materials incidents, fires, and other conditions that may impact infrastructure and impede emergency response. Each type of disaster requires clean up, recovery, and planning to prevent future damage. The period after a disaster is often very difficult for communities and at times as devastating as the disaster itself. Cities that prepare ahead of time can reduce the fear, confusion, and loss that comes with disaster. Planning that ensures access to critical facilities such as utilities, freeways, roadways, schools, and emergency care facilities can minimize the loss of life and property damage should a disaster occur.
La Puente participates in the Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) that provides a statewide framework for coordinating multi-agency responses to emergencies and disasters. The City7s SEMS incorporates mutual aid agreements with other jurisdictions, establishes lines of communication during emergencies, and standardizes incident command structures.
Local emergency services providers include the Los Angeles County Sheriff and Fire Departments. To provide an additional level of readiness and protection, the City also offers a program to train volunteers to provide basic emergency response skills. The City will continue to work toward establishing a comprehensive Emergency Operations Plan to coordinate efforts of residents, businesses, and service providers.
Emergency response services are provided in La Puente by the Los Angeles County Fire and Sheriffs Departments.

Noise
Excessive noise can be considered an environmental pollutant that can damage hearing and affect general well-being. Noise in La Puente results primarily from auto and truck traffic along major arterials, particularly Valley Boulevard and Amar Road. Noise nuisances can also include loud music and noise generated from parties and other large gatherings. Local noise sources include typical residential neighborhood sounds such as lawnmowers, children at play, and barking dogs. Noise becomes a concern when it consistently interferes with a person's ability to conduct everyday work and recreation activities.
Measuring Noise
Noise generally is defined as unwanted or intrusive sound. Because noise consists of pitch, loudness, and duration, describing noise with a single unit of measure presents a challenge. The A-weighted decibel scale (dB[A]) has been developed to describe the loudness of a sound or sound environment based on the sensitivity of the human ear.
The dB(A) descriptor only reports noise from a single source or combination of sources at a point in time. To allow a more comprehensive description of the noise environment, federal and State agencies have established noise and land use compatibility guidelines that use averaging approaches to noise measurement. Two measurement scales commonly used in California are the Community Noise Equivalent
Page CS - 14
Community Safety Element
&rtera£'Pfon
Level (CNEL) and the day-night level (Ldn). To account for increased human sensitivity at night, the CNEL level includes a 5-decibel penalty on noise during the 7:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M. time period and a 10-decibeI penalty on noise during the 10:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M. time period. The Ldn level includes only the 10-decibel weighting for late-night noise. These values are nearly identical for all but unusual noise sources.
Baseline Noise Environment
To establish a baseline against which to measure changes in the community noise environment over time, a noise modeling effort was conducted, with 2003 serving as the baseline year. Because traffic noise represents the dominant noise source in La Puente, the model focuses on traffic noise the 24-hour ambient noise conditions resulting from roadway travel, as well as noise impacts associated with the Union Pacific Railway. Figure CS-4 shows noise exposure contours for baseline year 2003.
Principal and Minor Highways represent the major sources of traffic noise. As Figure CS-4 illustrates, major highways in La Puente represent the major source of traffic noise. Although noise levels are lower for secondary highways, they are also a significant source of traffic noise. Almost all commercial areas in the City are affected by traffic noise since they are located adjacent to the main thoroughfares. Given the significant impact of traffic noise within the planning area, many large residential areas are affected, and the majority of the City's high-density residential areas are located within the noise contours. Nine of the twelve schools in the City are located within the 60-70 db(A) CNEL noise contours.
The City has little direct control over noise produced by transportation sources because State noise regulations for motor vehicles preempt local regulations. Because the City cannot control noise at the source, City noise programs focus on reducing the impacts of transportation noise on the community.
Year 2025 Noise Environment
The Community Development Element indicates that La Puente will accommodate limited residential and commercial growth through the year 2025. Accompanying regional growth will contribute to increased traffic volumes citywide and along major roadways, and could lead to elevated traffic noise levels and noise impacts associated with the Union Pacific Railway and major regional rail transportation projects such as the Alameda Corridor East (ACE).
Page CS - 15
Community Safety Element

By 2020, the ACE may result in an increase of noise associated with increased rail traffic and increase in road traffic particularly as truck traffic will be diverted onto Valley Boulevard. At two intersections, Valley Boulevard intersections with Puente Avenue and Sunset Avenue, the ACE will eliminate grade crossings and depress the roadway, which may result in a reduction of railroad operations noises by elimination the need for crossing alarms and train horns.
The City's land use policies do not encourage development of heavy industrial uses that produce noise and plans to work with the Alameda Corridor East Joint Powers Authority, when feasible, to ensure that noise impacts associated with development of the ACE project do not adversely impact La Puente.
Potential future ambient noise levels can be estimated by modeling. Figure CS-5 displays projected year 2025 noise contours based upon future traffic levels and railroad operations. The City will experience very little change in ambient noise levels due to traffic. For planning purposes, the change will be imperceptible.

Community Safety Element
The City's primary goal with regard to community noise is to minimize the exposure of residential neighborhoods, schools, and similar land uses to excessive or unhealthy noise levels, to the extent possible given built-out conditions. Toward this end, the Community Safety Element establishes noise / land use compatibility guidelines based upon cumulative criteria for outdoor noise. Figure CS-6 outlines the criteria the City will use when reviewing development proposals. New residential development will comply with Title 24 standards. For existing residential development along Minor Highways and Collectors experiencing high noise exposure, the City can implement the Neighborhood Traffic Control Program process outlined in the Circulation and Infrastructure Element to reduce noise impacts. Devices such as turn restrictions, traffic circles, and speed humps can reduce traffic noise within residential neighborhoods. Nuisance noises associated with loud, frequent parties that may include amplified music are disruptive to La Puente neighborhoods. Proactive measures such as educating residents on allowable noise levels and on time restrictions for amplified music consistent with the City's Municipal Code can reduce this nuisance. Vigorous enforcement of the City Noise Ordinance can also improve noise conditions within La Puente.

New construction or development should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of noise reduction requirements is made and needed noise insulation features included in design. Conventional construction, but with closed windows and fresh air supply systems or air conditioning, will normally suffice.
New construction or development should generally be discouraged. If new construction or development does proceed, a detailed analysis of noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise insulation features included in design.

The Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and Day-Night Noise Level (Ldn) are measures of the 24-hour noise environment. They represent the constant A-weighted noise level that would be measured if all the sound energy received over the day were averaged. In order to account for the greater sensitivity of people to noise at night, the CNEL weighting includes a 5-decibel penalty on noise between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. and a 10-decibel penalty on noise between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. of the next day. The Ldn includes only the 10-decibel weighting for late-night noise events. For practical purposes, the two measures are equivalent for typical urban noise environments.

Public Safety Services
La Puente residents and businesses depend on fire protection and law enforcement to provide a safe living and working environment. The City7 s commitment to a safe community is reflected, in part, in the significant financial resources dedicated to this cause.
Fire Services
Structural fires represent the primary fire hazard in La Puente. Structural fires are generally caused by faulty equipment or lack of knowledge of fire prevention precautions. The potential for fire hazards increases when flammable and explosive materials are improperly stored, handled, or used. Planning for adequate fire protection and suppression in a densely built community like La Puente becomes increasingly
The community is served by three Los Angeles County Fire Department stations located in La Puente and Industry.

important due to aging buildings and proximity to commercial and industrial uses.
Fire suppression is provided by the County of Los Angeles Fire Protection District. Three fire stations have jurisdiction within the Planning Area:
■	Station 26, located at 15336 E. Elliot Ave in La Puente
■	Station 43, located at 921 S. Stimson Ave. in the City of Industry
■	Station 118, located at 17056 Gale Ave. in the City of Industry
In addition, any County fire unit may respond to incidents within the Planning Area depending on need and availability. The City will coordinate with the County Fire Department to implement fire hazard education and fire protection programs. In addition, the City will coordinate with local water districts to ensure water pressure is adequate for fire fighting purposes.
In 2002, the average first unit response time was 4 minutes, 27 seconds. According to the County of Los Angeles, fire protection serving the area appears to be adequate for the existing development and land uses. The County plans no upgrades to the stations listed above.
To minimize fire hazards, the City requires new construction to comply with the Uniform Fire Code, and Fire Department staff inspects properties for compliance. Requirements in the Fire Code include minimum road widths for fire vehicle access and fire protection flows of at least 1,500 gallons per minute.
In La Puente, residential/business interface areas may face higher fire risks than other neighborhoods. Buffers or land use controls may be appropriate for commercial properties located near residential areas.

Law enforcement services within the Planning Area are provided by the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department. In addition to providing patrol and investigative services, the Sheriffs Department offers a broad range of support services that are readily available from nearby Industry Station. Local control is facilitated through close cooperation between the Station Captain and City officials. La Puente7s Police and Community Relations Committee keeps an open dialogue between residents and the Sheriffs Department to provide the highest level of public safety for residents, businesses, and visitors.
Gang-related crime
Ensuring the safety of La Puente residents is a high priority for the City. Although considered a safe community, La Puente, like many urban communities across the Los Angeles metropolitan area, is affected by gang activity. Gang-related crimes are a key issue of concern for residents. A significant factor contributing to a climate of fear and intimidation in schools is the presence of youth gangs in the community and at school. Graffiti, vandalism, and violence reduce property values, stifle a sense of community, and create an atmosphere of distrust that may lead to further violence. For businesses, the cost of painting over graffiti and repairing vandalism is passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Graffiti and vandalized property remain eyesores in the community and can induce further destructive acts.
(
Vandalism associated with gang activity, including graffiti, results in the destruction of public and private property.

La Puente is committed to providing a safe environment for residents and businesses. Working through the Sheriffs Department, the City spends more than $1 million annually on gang suppression, juvenile delinquency, and graffiti control programs. The Industry Station also provides special assignment officers for gang suppression activities.
La Puente also provides programs to improve public safety. The City assists in funding the Volunteers on Patrol program, through which volunteers patrol the streets and refer concerns to the Sheriffs Department. After-school education programs provided at elementary and secondary schools in La Puente help encourage youth not to participate in criminal activity. The Police and Community Relations Committee keeps an open dialogue between residents and the Sheriffs Department. Working together with our partners will provide the highest level of public safety for residents, businesses and visitors alike.

Implementation
Summary
The purpose of the implementation actions presented at the end of each General Plan section is to ensure the overall direction provided in the General Plan for growth and development is translated from general terms to specific actions. The implementation actions ensure effective implementation of the General Plan by coordinating General Plan priorities with the city's budget and capital improvement decisions. This approach ensures that the General Plan remains a dynamic, responsive document and that the City's budget decisions are consistent with the long-term goals of the General Plan. The La Puente General Plan includes an ambitious list of policies and implementation actions. Given the large number of policies and actions and the limited resources that are available to the City annually, it may not be possible to fund every action and program in the General Plan at once.
Implementation Summary Table
The Implementation Summary Table (Table A-l) lists all of the implementation actions presented at the end of each General Plan section. The table summarizes the implementation action by type of implementation action and by the subsections of the General Plan. Implementation actions fall under the following categories:
•	City Plans, Ordinances, and Programs
•	Physical Improvements
•	Development Conditions and Requirements
•	Planning and Outreach Initiatives
•	Inter-Jurisdictional Coordination
Each implementation action is represented using a distinct color that identifies the responsible City department, and a primary potential funding source Is identified. The Housing Element Implementation Summary Table (Table A-2) is based on the city's 2000-2005 Housing Element.
