CHAPTER	ONE	–	INTRODUCTION	
The	 State	 of	 California	 has	 declared	 that	 "the	 availability	 of	 housing	 is	 of	 vital	 statewide	
importance	 and	 the	 early	 attainment	 of	 decent	 housing	 and	 a	 suitable	 living	 environment	 for	
every	 California	 family	 is	 a	 priority	 of	 the	 highest	 order."	 	 Recognizing	 the	 importance	 of	
providing	adequate	housing,	the	State	has	mandated	a	Housing	Element	within	every	General	
Plan	since	1969.	This	Housing	Element,	which	addresses	the	2014-2023	Regional	Housing	Needs	
Allocation,	 was	 created	 in	 compliance	 with	 State	 General	 Plan	 law	 pertaining	 to	 Housing	
Elements.		
Broad	 based	 community	 participation	 is	 important	 in	 preparing	 an	 implementable	 and	 locally	
meaningful	 housing	 policy	 and	 action	 program.	 The	 programs	 included	 in	 this	 document	
evolved	through	collaborative	workshops	with	local	residents	and	representatives	of	agencies	
which	provide	housing	and	other	social	service	assistance	to	city,	county	and	regional	residents,	
as	well	as	analysis	of	local	population	characteristics,	households,	housing	stock,	and	economic	
conditions.	
CONTENTS	
Consistent	with	state	law,	this	Housing	Element	consists	of	the	following	major	components:	
    •   Evaluation	of	the	2010	Housing	Element.		The	Evaluation	of	the	2010	Housing	Element	
        chapter	 evaluates	 accomplishments	 under	 the	 2010	 Housing	 Element	 in	 order	 to	
        determine	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 previous	 housing	 element,	 the	 City’s	 progress	 in	
        implementing	 the	 2010	 Housing	 Element,	 and	 the	 appropriateness	 of	 continuing	 the	
        housing	goals,	objectives,	and	policies.			
    •   Population	 and	 Housing	 Data.	 	 The	 Population	 and	 Housing	 Data	 chapter	 includes	 an	
        analysis	of	population	and	employment	trends,	the	City’s	fair	share	of	regional	housing	
        needs,	household	characteristics,	and	the	condition	of	the	housing	stock.	Housing	needs	
        of	special	needs	groups	are	described.	
    •   Land	 and	 Infrastructure.	 	 The	 Land	 and	 Infrastructure	 chapter	 identifies	 resources	
        available	for	the	production	and	maintenance	of	housing,	including	an	inventory	of	land	
        suitable	 for	 residential	 development.	 This	 chapter	 also	 discusses	 availability	 of	
        infrastructure	 and	 environmental	 constraints	 associated	 with	 development	 of	 the	
        inventory	of	land.	
    •   Constraints.		The	Constraints	chapter	reviews	governmental	constraints,	including	land	
        use	 controls,	 fees,	 and	 processing	 requirements,	 as	 well	 as	 non-governmental	
        constraints,	 such	 as	 construction	 costs,	 availability	 of	 land	 and	 financing,	 physical	
        environmental	 conditions,	 and	 units	 at-risk	 of	 conversion,	 that	 may	 impede	 the	
        development,	preservation,	and	maintenance	of	housing.	This	chapter	describes	federal,	
        state,	and	local	financial	resources	and	programs	available	to	address	the	City’s	housing	
        needs	and	goals.	
Housing	Element	                                   	                                                   1-1	

	
    •    Housing	Plan.		The	Housing	Plan	chapter	identifies	the	City’s	housing	goals	and	provides	
         policies	and	implementation	programs	to	address	the	City’s	housing	needs.			
    •    Community	Participation.		The	Community	Participation	chapter	describes	how	the	City	
         engaged	 the	 public,	 including	 City	 residents,	 businesspeople,	 and	 interested	 parties,	
         including	housing	and	special	needs	advocates,	in	development	of	the	Housing	Element.	
RELATIONSHIP	TO	THE	GENERAL	PLAN		
State	 Law	 requires	 that	 "…the	 general	 plan	 and	 elements	 and	 parts	 thereof	 comprise	 an	
integrated,	 internally	 consistent,	 and	 compatible	 statement	 of	 policies…".	 The	 purpose	 of	
requiring	internal	consistency	is	to	avoid	policy	conflict	and	provide	a	clear	policy	guide	for	the	
future	 maintenance,	 improvement	 and	 development	 of	 housing	 within	 the	 City.	 	 The	 City’s	
General	Plan	requires	that	it	be	an	internally	consistent	document	and	provides	the	following	
guidance	(General	Plan	Introduction,	Page	1-4):	
         “The	 General	 Plan	 must	 be	 internally	 consistent.	 This	 requirement	 means	 that	 the	
         General	 Plan	 must	 fully	 integrate	 its	 separate	 parts	 and	 relate	 them	 to	 each	 other	
         without	conflict.	The	internal	consistency	requirement	has	five	dimensions:	equal	status	
         among	elements,	consistency	between	elements,	consistency	within	elements,	area	plan	
         consistency	and	text	and	diagram	consistency.”	
Each	 update	 or	 amendment	 to	 the	 General	 Plan	 is	 reviewed	 for	 internal	 consistency,	 as	
required	 by	 the	 General	 Plan	 and	 State	 law.	 	 All	 elements	 of	 the	 General	 Plan	 have	 been	
reviewed	 for	 consistency	 in	 coordination	 with	 this	 update	 to	 the	 Housing	 Element.	 The	
following	paragraphs	outline	the	relationship	of	the	Housing	Element	and	its	policies	to	other	
elements	 of	 the	 City	 of	 Escalon’s	 adopted	 General	 Plan.	 	 Development	 of	 housing	 consistent	
with	 the	 City’s	 housing	 needs	 and	 programs	 as	 identified	 in	 this	 Housing	 Element	 would	 be	
required	to	be	consistent	with	all	relevant	policies	and	programs	of	the	other	elements	of	the	
General	Plan.	
LAND	USE	
The	 Housing	 Element	 is	 most	 affected	 by	 development	 policies	 contained	 in	 the	 Land	 Use	
Element	 of	 the	 General	 Plan.	 	 The	 Land	 Use	 Element	 establishes	 the	 location,	 type,	 intensity,	
and	distribution	of	land	uses	throughout	the	City.		As	such,	the	Land	Use	Element	sets	the	upper	
limit	 of	 acreage	 which	 will	 be	 used	 for	 housing.	 	 The	 standards	 set	 in	 the	 Land	 Use	 Element	
determine	the	density	to	which	residential	areas	can	be	developed	and	sets	the	upper	limit	for	
the	number	of	housing	units	which	can	be	developed	in	the	City.		The	Land	Use	Element	also	
addresses	the	development	of	other	land	uses	such	as	industrial,	commercial	and	professional	
offices	which	create	demand	for	housing	in	the	City.	The	housing	sites	identified	in	Chapter	4,	
Land	and	Infrastructure,	are	consistent	with	the	sites	identified	in	the	Land	Use	Element.		The	
Land	 Use	 Element	 was	 reviewed	 to	 determine	 if	 there	 was	 a	 need	 to	 update	 the	 element	 to	
address	disadvantaged	unincorporated	communities.		No	revisions	to	the	Land	Use	Element	are	
needed	 as	 there	 are	 no	 disadvantaged	 unincorporated	 communities	 in	 the	 City’s	 Sphere	 of	
Influence.	
Housing	Element	                                   	                                                     1-2	

	
URBAN	BOUNDARY	
The	Urban	Boundary	Element	defines	the	limits	for	extending	City	services	and	infrastructure	in	
order	 to	 accommodate	 new	 development	 anticipated	 within	 the	 20-year	 time	 frame	 of	 the	
General	 Plan.	 The	 Urban	 Boundary	 Element	 is	 also	 intended	 to	 provide	 guidance	 related	 to	
future	annexation	of	land	from	the	City’s	Sphere	of	Influence.	This	Housing	Element	does	not	
provide	for	growth	outside	of	the	Urban	Boundary	limit.	
TRANSPORTATION		
The	Transportation	Element	describes	the	general	location	and	extent	of	existing	and	proposed	
major	 thoroughfares,	 transportation	 routes,	 terminals,	 and	 other	 local	 public	 utilities	 and	
facilities.		The	purposes	of	the	Transportation	Element	are	to	coordinate	the	transportation	and	
circulation	 system	 with	 planned	 land	 uses;	 promote	 the	 efficient	 transport	 of	 goods	 and	 the	
safe,	 effective	 movement	 of	 all	 segments	 of	 the	 population;	 make	 efficient	 use	 of	 existing	
transportation	 facilities;	 and	 promote	 and	 protect	 environmental	 quality	 and	 the	 wise	 and	
equitable	 use	 of	 economic	 and	 natural	 resources.	 	 In	 carrying	 out	 these	 purposes	 the	
Transportation	 Element	 attempts	 to	 create	 a	 convenient	 living	 environment	 for	 residents	 of	
Escalon.	 	 The	 City’s	 Transportation	 Element	 discusses	 issues	 for	 the	 City	 and	 its	 Sphere	 of	
Influence.	
COMMUNITY	DESIGN		
A	Community	Design	Element	was	developed	for	the	City	of	Escalon	because	of	its	anticipated	
population	growth.		The	challenge	will	be	to	maintain	the	City’s	quality	of	life	and	small	town	
character	 as	 this	 change	 occurs.	 	 The	 Community	 Design	 Element	 is	 concerned	 with	 how	 the	
City	looks	and	feels,	and	how	to	maintain	a	sense	of	place	during	a	period	of	rapid	growth.	
The	 City	 strives	 to	 preserve	 and	 enhance	 the	 historic	 and	 cultural	 resources	 of	 the	 city,	 and	
ensure	that	new	development	demonstrates	quality,	excellence	of	design	and	sensitivity	to	the	
character	of	the	surrounding	neighborhood.	
ECONOMIC	DEVELOPMENT		
The	Economic	Development	Element	provides	guidance	for	economic	development	to	attain	an	
economically	 viable	 and	 self-sustaining	 community.	 In	 this	 sense,	 economic	 viability	 means	
providing	 a	 range	 of	 housing	 and	 employment	 opportunities	 that	 meet	 the	 needs	 of	 both	
residents	 and	 workers,	 attracting	 families	 and	 businesses	 to	 create	 demand	 for	 planned	 land	
uses	 and	 establishing	 and	 funding	 public	 service	 levels	 that	 preserve	 and	 enhance	 Escalon’s	
quality	of	life.		The	Housing	Element	would	provide	for	a	variety	of	housing	types	with	a	broad	
range	of	affordability,	including	units	affordable	to	the	workforce.	
OPEN	SPACE,	CONSERVATION,	AND	RECREATION	
The	Open	Space,	Conservation	and	Recreation	Element	focuses	on	the	method	by	which	water,	
soils,	rivers,	beaches	and	mineral	resources	may	be	used	and	preserved.		The	purposes	of	this	
element	are	as	follows:		To	promote	the	protection,	maintenance	and	use	of	the	community’s	
natural	 resources,	 with	 special	 emphasis	 on	 scarce	 resources	 and	 those	 that	 require	 special	
control	and	management;	prevent	the	wasteful	exploitation,	destruction,	and	neglect	of	natural	
Housing	Element	                                 	                                                        1-3	

	
resources;	 and,	 recognize	 that	 the	 natural	 resources	 of	 the	 community	 should	 be	 maintained	
for	 their	 ecological	 value	 as	 well	 as	 for	 their	 direct	 benefit	 to	 people.	 Additionally,	 the	 Open	
Space,	Conservation	and	Recreation	Element	assure	that	open	space	be	recognized	as	a	scarce	
resource	 to	 be	 preserved;	 coordinate	 state	 and	 regional	 conservation	 plans	 at	 the	 local	 level;	
preserve	 unique	 or	 strategic	 natural	 resources	 for	 future	 generations;	 and,	 preserve	 land	
uniquely	suited	to	the	production	of	food	and	fiber.		The	interrelationship	between	the	Open	
Space	 Element	 and	 other	 elements	 of	 the	 General	 Plan	 is	 one	 of	 the	 clearest.	 	 Among	 other	
things,	state	law	specifies	that	building	permits,	subdivision	maps	or	other	projects	may	not	be	
approved	if	they	are	not	consistent	with	the	Open	Space	Element.		In	addition,	the	Open	Space	
Element	 also	 includes	 requirements	 for	 the	 dedication	 of	 land	 or	 payment	 of	 in-lieu	 fees	 to	
provide	 needed	 open	 space.	 	 These	 requirements	 can	 increase	 the	 cost	 of	 residential	
development.		The	sections	relative	to	parks	emphasizes	preservation	and	recognizes	the	City’s	
need	to	provide	parks	and	recreation	opportunities	to	meet	the	needs	of	the	community.					
NOISE	
The	purpose	of	the	Noise	Element	is	to	identify	the	location	and	relative	intensity	of	noise	in	the	
environment	 and	 to	 identify	 land	 use	 policies	 and	 other	 controls	 to	 restrict	 the	 exposure	 of	
sensitive	 receptors	 to	 excessive	 levels	 of	 ambient	 noise.	 	 Policies	 exist	 in	 the	 Noise	 Element	
which	limit	the	development	of	residential	land	uses	to	areas	of	existing	or	projected	noise	level	
less	than	65	dB(A).		In	areas	where	this	is	not	possible,	proposed	residential	uses	are	required	to	
include	 noise	 attenuation	 features	 which	 reduce	 the	 level	 of	 interior	 ambient	 noise	 to	 a	
maximum	of	45	dB(A).		These	policies	will	mitigate	the	impact	of	noise	sources	on	residential	
development	 and	 create	 a	 more	 pleasant	 living	 environment	 in	 the	 City.	 	 However,	 they	 also	
decrease	the	land	available	for	residential	development	and	increase	the	cost	of	construction.	
SAFETY		
The	 Safety	 Element	 of	 the	 General	 Plan	 identifies	 hazards	 to	 public	 safety	 and	 appropriate	
mitigation	 measures	 to	 mitigate,	 to	 the	 fullest	 degree	 possible,	 the	 loss	 of	 property	 and	 life	
resulting	 therefrom.	 	 The	 Safety	 Element	 identifies	 hazards	 related	 to	 fire,	 geologic	 hazards,	
flooding,	 crime	 and	 storage	 of	 hazardous	 materials.	 	 The	 Safety	 Element	 identifies	 hazards	
resulting	 from	 earthquake	 activity,	 and	 appropriate	 mitigation	 measures.	 	 The	 affect	 of	 the	
Safety	 Element	 on	 the	 Housing	 Element	 is	 an	 indirect	 one	 related	 to	 the	 increase	 in	 cost	 of	
housing	due	to	the	required	mitigation	measures.	
AIR	QUALITY	
The	purpose	of	the	Air	Quality	Element	is	to	identify	air	quality	problem	areas	and	implement	
policies	 and	 standards	 to	 address	 those	 problem	 areas.	 Without	 the	 implementation	 and	
maintenance	 of	 appropriate	 air	 quality	 standards,	 threats	 to	 public	 health	 and	 a	 declining	
quality	 of	 life	 may	 result.	 The	 Air	 Quality	 Element,	 although	 not	 mandated	 by	 state	 planning	
law,	has	been	included	in	Escalon’s	General	Plan	to	ensure	a	healthy	environment	through	the	
management	of	our	air	resources.	
Housing	Element	                                     	                                                       1-4	

	
PUBLIC	SERVICES	AND	FACILITIES	
The	 Public	 Services	 and	 Facilities	 Element	 addresses	 the	 community	 need	 for	 public	 services	
and	 facilities.	 The	 majority	 of	 Escalon	 is	 developed	 and	 sufficiently	 served	 by	 existing	 public	
services	 and	 facilities.	 Future	 development	 of	 the	 remaining	 vacant	 land	 within	 the	 City	 will	
require	expansion	of	public	services	and	facilities	to	meet	the	increase	in	demand	for	service.	
Planning	for	this	future	increase	in	demand	will	ensure	that	the	needs	of	future	residents	for	
public	 services	 and	 infrastructure	 are	 met,	 while	 avoiding	 adverse	 impacts	 to	 the	 existing	
community.		The	purpose	of	the	Public	Services	&	Facilities	Element	is	to	ensure	that	sufficient	
levels	of	public	services	are	provided	as	Escalon	develops.	Working	in	conjunction	with	the	Land	
Use	and	Economic	Development	Elements,	the	Public	Services	&	Facilities	Element	plans	for	the	
needed	 expansion	 and	 funding	 of	 public	 services	 and	 infrastructure	 to	 coincide	 with	 new	
development.	
APPLICATION	AND	FLEXIBILITY	OF	THE	DOCUMENT	
This	 Housing	 Element	 is	 a	 dynamic	 document	 that	 may	 be	 subject	 to	 change	 as	 a	 result	 of	
significant	 shifts	 in	 demographics	 and/or	 housing	 needs	 during	 the	 planning	 period.	 	 It	 is	 the	
intent	 of	 the	 City	 of	 Escalon	 to	 achieve	 the	 fair	 share	 allocation	 and	 estimated	 quantified	
objectives	 through	 the	 implementation	 of	 some	 or	 all	 of	 the	 Housing	 Element	 programs,	 as	
deemed	appropriate	by	the	City	staff	and	City	Council.		The	City	will	monitor	implementation	on	
an	 annual	 basis.	 	 Specific	 programs	 are	 identified	 that	 would	 achieve	 the	 desired	 objectives;	
however,	 the	 City	 recognizes	 that	 funding	 and	 resource	 allocations	 may	 change	 over	 the	
planning	period	and	other	options	may	need	to	be	explored	to	achieve	the	identified	goals	and	
objectives.	
Community	Participation	
To	 be	 effective,	 housing	 policy	 must	 reflect	 the	 values	 and	 priorities	 of	 the	 community.		
Escalon’s	 Housing	 Element	 Update	 program	 included	 a	 housing	 survey	 distributed	 to	 local	
residents	and	businesses,	two	public	workshops,	one	Planning	Commission	public	hearing,	and	
one	City	Council	public	hearing	to	provide	the	community	and	interested	parties	with	multiple	
opportunities	and	venues	for	comment.		The	public	workshops	were	advertised	through	a	flyer	
delivered	to	various	locations	throughout	the	community	and	media	releases.			
Future	Housing	Needs	
HCD	 is	 required	 to	 allocate	 each	 region’s	 share	 of	 the	 statewide	 housing	 need	 to	 Councils	 of	
Governments	 (COG)	 based	 on	 Department	 of	 Finance	 (DOF)	 population	 projections	 and	
regional	 population	 forecasts	 used	 in	 preparing	 regional	 transportation	 plans.	 	 HCD	 provided	
the	 San	 Joaquin	 Council	 of	 Governments	 (SJCOG)	 with	 the	 allocation	 for	 San	 Joaquin	 County.		
SJCOG	then	allocated	housing	needs	by	income	group	to	each	of	the	incorporated	cities	in	the	
county	and	the	unincorporated	county.			
Regional	Housing	Needs	Allocation	
A	 Regional	 Housing	 Needs	 Plan	 (RHNP)	 is	 mandated	 by	 the	 State	 of	 California	 for	 regions	 to	
address	housing	issues	and	needs	based	on	future	growth	projections	for	the	area.	The	intent	
of	the	RHNP	is	to	ensure	that	local	jurisdictions	address	not	only	the	needs	of	their	immediate	
Housing	Element	                                    	                                                    1-5	

	
areas	but	also	their	fair	share	of	housing	needs	for	all	economic	segments.	The	regional	housing	
needs	allocation	(RHNA)	is	developed	to	ensure	that	adequate	sites	and	zoning	are	provided	to	
address	existing	and	anticipated	housing	demands	during	the	planning	period	and	that	market	
forces	are	not	inhibited	in	addressing	the	housing	needs	for	all	facets	of	a	particular	community.		
Escalon	was	allocated	a	new	construction	need	of	425	housing	units	in	the	San	Joaquin	County	
Regional	Housing	Needs	Plan	prepared	by	SJCOG	for	the	2014	to	2023	planning	period.		Of	the	
allocated	housing	units,	60	are	identified	for	extremely	low	income	households,	43	for	very	low	
income	households,	66	for	low	income	households,	64	for	moderate	income	households,	and	
192	for	above	moderate	income	households.		As	discussed	in	Chapters	3,	4,	and	5,	the	City	has	
adequate	 sites	 to	 accommodate	 its	 identified	 housing	 needs	 for	 all	 income	 levels	 as	 well	 as	
housing	for	special	needs	groups.	
Sources	
Several	sources	of	information	have	been	used	to	document	recent	demographic	and	housing

CHAPTER	TWO	-	EVALUATION	OF	THE	2010	HOUSING	ELEMENT	
Accomplishments	 under	 the	 2010	 Housing	 Element	 are	 evaluated	 in	 this	 chapter	 in	 order	 to	
determine	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 the	 previous	 housing	 element,	 the	 City’s	 progress	 in	
implementing	 the	 2010	 Housing	 Element,	 and	 the	 appropriateness	 of	 the	 housing	 goals,	
objectives,	 and	 policies.	 	 This	 evaluation	 is	 conducted	 pursuant	 to	 Government	 Code	 Section	
65588.	
EFFECTIVENESS	OF	THE	PREVIOUS	HOUSING	ELEMENT	
The	 2010	 Housing	 Element	 program	 strategy	 focused	 on	 the	 accomplishment	 of	 policies	 and	
implementation	of	programs	in	the	following	six	categories:	
Goal	1:	     Preserve	and	Improve	Escalon’s	Housing	and	Neighborhoods	
Goal	2:	     Facilitate	and	Encourage	Development	of	Housing	to	Meet	the	City’s	Housing	Needs		
Goal	3:	     Provide	Adequate	Sites	for	Housing		
Goal	4:	     Expand	 Housing	 Opportunities	 for	 the	 Elderly,	 Handicapped	 Persons,	 Households	
             with	Very	Low	to	Moderate	Incomes	and	for	Persons	with	Special	Housing	Needs	
Goal	5:	     Eliminate	Housing	Discrimination	
Goal	6:		    Encourage	 Energy	 Efficient	 Resources	 in	 New	 Residential	 Development	 as	 well	 as	
             the	Existing	Housing	Stock	
The	2010	Housing	Element	included	25	policies	and	26	programs	to	assist	in	achieving	its	goals.		
Progress	 in	 achieving	 the	 quantified	 objectives	 of	 the	 2010	 Housing	 Element	 is	 identified	 in	
Tables	 2-1	 and	 2-2.	 Table	 2-1	 identifies	 the	 2007-2014	 Regional	 Housing	 Needs	 Allocation	
(RHNA)	 and	 the	 City’s	 progress	 in	 meeting	 the	 allocation.	 Table	 2-2	 summarizes	 the	
implementation	 programs	 associated	 with	 each	 overall	 goal/objective	 and,	 where	 applicable,	
the	 quantified	 objectives	 associated	 with	 the	 implementation	 programs.	 	 Table	 2-1	 also	
identifies	 whether	 each	 implementation	 program	 was	 implemented,	 the	 result,	 if	 it	 was	
successful,	and	whether	it	should	be	kept,	modified,	or	removed	in	this	update	to	the	Housing	
Element.			
The	2010	Housing	Element	identified	a	variety	of	programs	to	provide	a	range	of	housing	types,	
promote	housing	affordability,	improve	existing	neighborhoods	and	housing	stock,	and	reduce	
housing	discrimination.		The	City	implemented	many	of	the	programs	identified	in	the	Housing	
Element	and	approved	a	significant	amount	of	affordable	units	(significant	in	comparison	to	the	
existing	inventory).		
HOUSING	PRODUCTION	DURING	RHNA	PERIOD	
The	 2010	 Housing	 Element	 specifically	 addressed	 housing	 needs	 for	 the	 City	 of	 Escalon	 from	
2007	through	2014.		Table	2-1	shows	the	total	number	of	housing	units	built	in	the	City	during	
the	 4th	 RHNA	 cycle	 and	 compares	 these	 units	 with	 the	 units	 required	 to	 be	 accommodated	
under	 the	 Regional	 Housing	 Needs	 Allocation	 (RHNA)	 provided	 by	 the	 San	 Joaquin	 Council	 of	
Housing	Element	                                    	                                                2-1	

	
Governments.	During	the	2007-2014	RHNA,	90	units	were	constructed	in	the	City,	including	7	
unrestricted	 moderate	 income	 units	 and	 83	 market	 rate	 single	 family	 units.	 The	 2007-2014	
RHNA	time	period	saw	less	variety	in	housing	types	than	the	previous	cycles	due	to	economic	
conditions.		The	downturn	in	the	economy	during	the	2007-2014	RHNA	caused	many	potential	
projects,	 including	 those	 with	 an	 affordable	 or	 multifamily	 component,	 to	 not	 be	 developed.	
One	of	the	primary	developments	anticipated	to	provide	20	very	low	and	22	low	income	units,	
Heritage	Park,	was	approved	by	the	City	during	the	3rd	Housing	Element	cycle,	but	subsequently	
litigated	 and	 placed	 on	 hold.	 	 The	 Heritage	 Park	 project	 was	 a	 large	 487-unit	 single	 family	
subdivision	 that	 required	 annexation	 and	 the	 issues	 associated	 with	 the	 subdivision	 were	 not	
specific	 to	 the	 affordable	 housing	 component;	 the	 litigation	 associated	 with	 it	 should	 not	 be	
construed	as	a	significant	constraint	to	affordable	projects.	With	the	downturn	in	the	economy,	
the	Heritage	Park	project	was	not	pursued	by	the	developer.			During	the	2007-2014	period,	the	
City	 also	 approved	 a	 residential	 care	 home	 for	 six	 developmentally	 disabled	 persons,	 but	 the	
project	has	not	yet	been	constructed.

APPROPRIATENESS	AND	EFFECTIVENESS	OF	HOUSING	GOALS,	POLICIES,	AND	PROGRAMS	
The	 overarching	 goals	 and	 policies	 of	 the	 2007-2014	 Housing	 Element	 continue	 to	 be	
appropriate	 to	 encourage	 the	 City’s	 housing	 goals	 and	 will	 be	 kept	 in	 the	 Housing	 Plan.	 As	
discussed	in	Table	2-2,	the	majority	of	housing	programs	have	been	implemented	or	continue	
to	 be	 appropriate	 and	 necessary	 to	 encourage	 housing,	 including	 lower	 income	 and	 special	
needs	housing.		In	most	cases,	the	intent	of	the	programs	that	continue	to	be	applicable	will	be	
retained	 in	 the	 Housing	 Element,	 with	 revisions	 to	 address	 identified	 specific	 housing	 needs,	
constraints,	or	other	concerns	identified	as	part	of	this	update.			
As	 described	 above	 in	 the	 Housing	 Production	 discussion	 and	 shown	 in	 Table	 2-1,	 during	 the	
2007	 through	 2014	 Housing	 Element	 cycle,	 a	 total	 of	 90	 housing	 units,	 including	 7	 units	
affordable	to	moderate	income	households,	were	developed.	Overall	housing	development	in	
the	 City	 was	 extremely	 limited	 during	 the	 2007-2014	 Housing	 Element	 cycle	 due	 to	 the	
downturn	in	the	housing	market.		As	previously	discussed,	the	City	approved	projects	with	very	
low	 and	 low	 income	 units,	 as	 well	 as	 a	 special	 needs	 project,	 but	 these	 units	 were	 not	 built	
during	the	2007-2014	period.	
The	Housing	Plan	included	in	this	2014-2023	Housing	Element	includes	modifications	to	make	
programs	more	effective,	clarify	objectives,	and	ensure	that	the	programs	are	implementable.		
See	Chapter	6,	Housing	Plan,	for	the	goals,	policies,	and	programs	of	this	Housing	Element.

    CHAPTER	THREE	-	POPULATION	AND	HOUSING	DATA	
    In	order	for	the	City’s	housing	strategy	to	be	successful,	the	City’s	demographics	and	housing	
    trends	 must	 be	 assessed	 to	 identify	 current	 conditions	 and	 needs.	 This	 section	 discusses	 the	
    components	of	housing	need,	which	include	recent	trends	in	Escalon’s	population,	households,	
    employment	base	and	the	type	of	housing	units	available.		In	most	instances,	countywide	data	is	
    included	for	comparative	analysis.		
    The	 analysis	 that	 follows	 is	 divided	 into	 four	 major	 subsections.	 Population	 Characteristics	
    examines	the	City	of	Escalon	in	terms	of	individual	persons	and	identifies	population	trends	that	
    may	 affect	 future	 housing	 needs.	 Household	 Characteristics	 explores	 Escalon	 by	 families,	
    households,	or	living	groups,	to	see	how	past	and	expected	household	changes	will	affect	housing	
    needs.	Employment	denotes	primary	income	sources	and	levels	by	occupation.		A	review	of	the	
    Housing	Stock	discloses	the	housing	environment	in	Escalon	as	a	whole	and	details	availability,	
    affordability,	and	condition.		Such	information	is	invaluable	to	help	identify	needed	programs	
    that	ensure	that	existing	and	future	housing	stock	meets	the	shelter	needs	of	every	segment	of	
    the	 City’s	 population.	 	 Analysis	 in	 each	 of	 these	 subsections	 provides	 a	 database	 upon	 which	
    decisions	concerning	programs	and	policies	for	the	provision	of	adequate	housing	in	the	City	are	
    made.	
    It	is	noted	that	the	2016	Department	of	Finance	(DOF)	E-5	Report	identified	lower	numbers	for	
    the	City’s	2015	population	and	households	than	were	identified	in	the	2015	DOF	E-5	Report	and	
    in	the	US	Census	2010-2014	American	Community	Survey	data	for	the	City.		Therefore,	there	are	
    discrepancies	in	the	City’s	population	and	household	data	in	the	following	tables	based	on	the	
    data	source	(US	Census	2010-2014	ACS	versus	the	2016	DOF	E-5	Report.

HOUSEHOLD	TYPE	
Information	collected	on	household	type	provides	a	good	base	for	the	analysis	of	a	community’s	
housing	needs.	The	U.S.	Census	Bureau	defines	a	household	as	all	persons	who	occupy	a	housing	
unit.	This	may	include	single	persons	living	alone,	families	related	by	blood	or	marriage,	as	well	
as	 unrelated	 individuals	 living	 together.	 Persons	 living	 in	 retirement	 or	 convalescent	 homes,	
dormitories	or	other	group	living	situations	are	enumerated	separately	and	are	not	counted	in	
household	population.	
Table	3-6	shows	household	characteristics	for	the	City	of	Escalon	and	San	Joaquin	County.		As	
Table	 3-6	 indicates,	 family	 households	 represented	 67.1	 percent	 of	 households	 in	 Escalon	 in	
2014.		Of	the	family	households,	the	majority	are	married	couple	families	(51.7	percent)	and	15.4	
percent	 are	 male	 or	 female	 householders	 with	 no	 spouse	 present.	 Non-family	 households	
represent	 32.9	 percent	 and	 are	 mostly	 single	 person	 households	 (26.3	 percent).	 	 San	 Joaquin

HOUSEHOLD	SIZE	
Trends	in	household	size	can	indicate	the	growth	pattern	of	a	community.		Average	household	
size	will	increase	if	there	is	an	influx	of	larger	families	or	a	rise	in	the	local	birth	rate	and	also	may	
be	attributed	to	more	children	in	a	single	family	or	teenage	parents	living	at	home.		Household	
size	will	decline	where	the	population	is	aging,	or	when	there	is	an	immigration	of	single	residents	
outside	childbearing	age.	
As	shown	in	Table	3-7,	the	average	household	size	in	Escalon	was	2.79	persons,	which	is	a	slight	
decrease	from	the	average	household	size	of	2.89	persons	in	2000.	Table	3-7	shows	Escalon’s	
household	sizes	for	owner,	renter,	and	all	households.		The	average	household	size	is	higher	for	
renters	 (2.95	 persons),	 however,	 renters	 also	 have	 the	 most	 single	 person	 households	 (29	
percent)	and	have	no	reported	households	with	more	than	five	persons.		Owner	households	have	
an	average	size	of	2.74	persons,	with	the	majority	of	owner	and	renter	households	having	two	
persons	or	less	(59.2	percent	for	owners,	55	percent	for	renters).		Approximately	37	percent	of	
both	owner	and	renter	are	three	to	five	persons	in	size.

HOUSEHOLD	INCOME	CHARACTERISTICS	
Household	 income	 level	 is	 probably	 the	 most	 significant	 factor	 limiting	 housing	 choice.		
Therefore,	income	patterns	have	been	examined	carefully	to	assess	the	extent	of	housing	need.		
Certain	 population	 groups	 (elderly,	 female	 householders,	 farmworkers,	 etc.)	 fall	
disproportionately	 into	 low-income	 groups,	 so	 they	 have	 been	 given	 special	 attention.	 	 Three	
different	income	measures	are	relevant	to	the	analysis.		They	are	median	income,	income	groups	
(extremely	low,	very	low,	low,	moderate,	and	above	moderate),	and	poverty	level	income.
Median	Income	
Median	income	is	the	amount	that	divides	the	income	distribution	into	two	equal	groups:	one	
group	 having	 incomes	 above	 the	 median,	 and	 the	 other	 having	 incomes	 below.	 	 Median	
household	income	indicates	the	income	of	all	individuals	in	a	household,	including	persons	living	
alone	or	with	unrelated	individuals.		Per	capita	income	indicates	the	average	annual	earnings	of	
an	individual.	
The	median	income	and	per	capita	data	provides	a	comparison	of	current	income	levels	in	the	
City	of	Escalon	and	the	County.		Other	data,	such	as	lower	income,	which	is	defined	as	80	percent	
of	the	median	income	level,	and	poverty	level	income,	add	insight	as	they	relate	to	households	
in	the	bottom	one-half	of	the	income	distribution.		Calculations	based	on	these	two	measures	
are	used	to	determine	eligibility	for	most	housing	subsidy	programs.		Table	3-8	identifies	ACS	
2010-2014	per	capita	and	median	household	income	for	Escalon	and	San	Joaquin	County.

 Income	Groups	
 The	California	Department	of	Housing	and	Community	Development	(HCD)	publishes	household	
 income	data	annually	for	areas	in	California.	Table	3-9	shows	the	maximum	annual	income	level	
 for	each	income	group	adjusted	for	household	size	for	San	Joaquin	County.	The	maximum	annual	
 income	data	is	then	utilized	to	calculate	the	maximum	affordable	housing	payments	for	different	
 households	(varying	by	income	level)	and	their	eligibility	for	federal	housing	assistance.		Each	
 income	category	is	described	below.		Table	2-10	identifies	the	income	range	by	household	income	
 size	for	1,	2,	and	4	person	households.

 median	 income	 (AMI),	 as	 established	 by	 the	 state	 Department	 of	 Housing	 and	 Community	
 Development	(HCD).	
 Very	Low	Income	Households	have	a	combined	income	between	30	and	50	percent	of	AMI,	as

 While	Census	data	does	not	provide	information	regarding	households	categorized	by	the	State	
 income	limits,	HUD	has	aggregated	ACS	2008-2012	data	to	identify	the	number	of	households	in	
 Extremely	Low,	Very	Low,	Low,	Median,	and	Above	Median	income	groups	as	shown	in	Table	3-
 10.	As	shown	in	Table	3-10,	the	majority	of	households	(58	percent)	are	above	median	income.		
 While	the	extremely	low	income	group	represents	11.1	percent	of	households,	a	much	higher	
 proportion	 are	 renters	 (210)	 than	 owners	 (90).	 	 The	 very	 low	 income	 group	 represents	 7.5	
 percent	of	households	and	the	low	income	group	represents	15.5	percent	of	households.

Poverty	Level	Income	
Poverty	level	incomes	are	computed	on	a	national	basis	as	a	part	of	the	
                                                                                              Almost	10%	of	
U.S.	Census.		An	index	of	poverty	has	been	developed	that,	by	established	
and	 complex	 formulas,	 considers	 factors	 such	 as	 family	 size,	 number	 of	                families	in	
children,	farm/non-farm	residences	and	income.		The	definition	assumes	                         Escalon	live	
that	a	family	is	classified	at	poverty	level	if	its	total	income	amounts	to	less	                below	the	
than	 approximately	 three	 times	 the	 cost	 of	 an	 economic	 food	 plan	 as	                poverty	line.	
determined	by	the	U.S.	Department	of	Agriculture.	
Table	3-11	identifies	the	number	of	Escalon	and	San	Joaquin	County	families	and	individuals	with	
incomes	below	the	poverty	level.		Families	and	individuals	experiencing	the	most	severe	income	
deficiencies	are	those	with	incomes	that	fall	below	this	poverty	level	and	those	most	likely	to	
need	some	form	of	housing	assistance.	
The	 2010-2014	 ACS	 data	 indicates	 that	 161	 or	 9.3	 percent	 of	 all	 Escalon	 families	 and	 979	
individuals,	13.5	percent,	had	poverty	level	incomes	or	less	in	2014.		Approximately	15.3	percent	
of	all	San	Joaquin	County	families	were	classified	at	or	below	the	poverty	level	in	2014.			
Larger	families,	low-wage	employment,	and	higher	costs	of	goods	and	services	have	fueled	the	
rise	in	number	of	families	and	individuals	falling	below	the	level	of	poverty.		Some	of	the	nation’s	
impoverished	choose	to	live	in	typically	less	expensive	unincorporated	areas.		However,	living	
within	a	City	allows	closer	access	to	goods,	services,	schools	and	employment,	lessening	the	need	
for	added	transportation	and	associated	costs.

EMPLOYMENT	CHARACTERISTICS	
One	of	the	factors	that	can	contribute	to	an	increase	in	demand	for	housing	is	expansion	of	the	
employment	base.		The	2010-2014	ACS	data	identified	3,354	employed	persons	in	the	Escalon	
labor	 force.	 	 Table	 3-12	 shows	 2014	 employment	 by	 industry	 for	 the	 City	 of	 Escalon	 and	 San	
Joaquin	County.		In	Escalon,	the	“Educational,	Health	and	Social	Services”	industry	employed	the	
most	people	at	29.6	percent.		The	second	largest	employment	industry	was	the	“Retail	Trade”	
industry,	which	had	12.4	percent	of	the	total	employed	persons	in	Escalon.		The	top	employment	
categories	in	San	Joaquin	County	were	the	same	as	Escalon’s.

VACANCY	
The	 vacancy	 rate	 in	 a	 community	 indicates	 the	 percentage	 of	 units	 that	 are	 vacant	 and	 for	
rent/sale	at	any	one	time.		It	is	desirable	to	have	a	vacancy	rate	that	offers	a	balance	between	a	
buyer	and	a	seller.		The	state	uses	five	percent	as	a	rule-of-thumb	for	a	desirable	total	vacancy	
rate.		A	total	vacancy	rate	of	less	than	four	percent	could	represent	a	shortage	of	housing	units.

AGE	OF	HOUSING	STOCK	
As	illustrated	in	Table	3-18,	in	2015,	24	percent	of	Escalon’s	housing	stock	was	built	prior	to	1970.

percent).		Over	54	percent	of	homes	in	Escalon	were	built	after	1980,	indicating	that	the	housing	
stock	is	relatively	young	when	compared	to	other	communities.

BUILDING	PERMIT	TRENDS	
From	2001	through	2009,	the	City	issued	building	permits	for	418	new	residential	units,	416	of	
which	were	single	family	detached	homes	and	two	were	duplex	units	(see	Table	3-19).		From	
2010	through	2015,	the	City	issued	50	building	permits,	all	for	single	family	homes.		In	June	2005,	
the	City	adopted	its	new	General	Plan	which	identifies	multiple	sites	for	medium	and	high	density	
residential	 development	 within	 the	 City	 (see	 Figure	 4-1)	 and	 provided	 new	 opportunities	 for	
multifamily	development.		However,	the	economy	began	to	decline	around	this	same	period	and	
the	 demand	 for	 multifamily	 decreased.	 	 While	 multifamily	 development	 was	 approved	 and	
received	a	growth	allocation	during	the	4th	cycle	planning	period,	the	developer	did	not	construct	
the	 multifamily	 units	 due	 to	 the	 decline	 in	 the	 economy.	 	 The	 City	 had	 also	 received	 a	
development	proposal	that	would	include	an	affordable	senior	development	(HUD	Section	202),	
but	this	project	required	annexation	and	was	placed	on	hold	by	the	proponent.

CONDITION	OF	HOUSING	STOCK	
The	U.S.	Census	provides	limited	data	that	can	be	used	to	infer	the	condition	of	Escalon’s	housing	
stock.	 The	 Census	 reports	 on	 whether	 housing	 units	 have	 complete	 plumbing	 and	 kitchen	
facilities	and	whether	units	lack	a	source	of	household	heat.		Since	only	a	very	small	percentage	
of	all	housing	units	in	Escalon	lack	complete	plumbing	facilities,	kitchen	facilities,	or	a	household	
fuel	 source	 (see	 Table	 3-20),	 these	 indicators	 do	 not	 reveal	 much	 about	 overall	 housing	
conditions.		Further,	these	indicators	may	overlap	meaning	that	units	that	lack	complete	kitchen	
facilities	may	also	lack	complete	plumbing	or	a	heating	source.

Since	housing	stock	age	and	condition	are	generally	correlated,	one	Census	variable	that	provides	
an	indication	of	housing	conditions	is	the	age	of	a	community’s	housing	stock.		As	show	in	Table	
3-20,	as	of	2014,	the	median	year	built	for	all	housing	units	in	Escalon	was	1983.	Over	20	percent	
of	Escalon’s	housing	stock	was	built	after	2000	and	another	23.7	percent	was	built	between	1990	
and	1999.		These	statistics	reflect	tremendous	growth	in	the	area	during	the	1990s	and	2000s.		
The	 age	 of	 housing	 stock	 often	 indicates	 the	 potential	 for	 a	 unit	 to	 need	 rehabilitation	 or	
significant	maintenance.		Most	of	Escalon’s	housing	stock	is	less	than	40	years	old	and	likely	only	
Housing	Element	                                            	                                        3-12	

	
needs	minimal	repairs	and	typical	levels	of	maintenance.		However,	units	that	are	over	50	years	
old	(approximately	18	percent)	may	need	moderate	to	significant	rehabilitation.	
OVERCROWDED	HOUSING	UNITS	
Although	there	is	more	than	one	way	of	defining	overcrowded	housing	units,	the	definition	used	
in	the	Housing	Element	is	1.01	or	more	persons	per	room,	the	same	definition	used	in	the	2000	
U.S.	Census.		It	should	be	noted	that	kitchenettes,	strip	or	Pullman	kitchens,	bathrooms,	porches,	
balconies,	foyers,	halls,	half-rooms,	utility	rooms,	unfinished	attics,	basements,	or	other	space	
for	storage	are	not	defined	as	rooms	for	Census	purposes.	
Overcrowded	 households	 are	 usually	 a	 reflection	 of	 the	 lack	 of	
affordable	 housing	 available.	 	 Households	 that	 cannot	 afford	               6.2	percent	of	
housing	units	suitably	sized	for	their	families	are	often	forced	to	live	             Escalon’s

contained	16	units	of	overcrowded	housing	in	2014	or	6.2	percent	                   overcrowded	
of	the	total	occupied	housing	units	(reference	Table	3-21).		All	of	the	             conditions.

HOUSING	COSTS	
Several	 types	 of	 data	 are	 available	 that	 can	 be	 used	 to	 assess	 changing	 housing	 prices.	 	 They	
include	median	housing	value,	rental	cost	and	rental	cost	in	terms	of	available	income.	Other	
types	of	data	include	costs	of	housing	production	(including	land	and	materials,	development	
costs,	City	fees,	etc.),	housing	sale	prices	for	new	and	existing	homes,	the	cost	of	financing,	and	
financing	options.		Escalon’s	housing	costs	are	discussed	later	in	this	chapter.	
HOUSING	VALUE	
Table	3-22	indicates	median	housing	value	for	homes	in	Escalon	and	San	Joaquin	County.		Value	
is	defined	as	the	amount	for	which	property,	including	house	and	lot,	would	sell	if	it	were	on	the	
market	at	a	given	point	in	time.		As	shown	in	Table	3-21,	the	median	value	for	housing	units	in	
Escalon	during	2000	was	$141,182.		San	Joaquin	County	had	a	lower	median	($139,756).		In	2008,

  HOUSING	AFFORDABILITY	
  Table	3-25	identifies	the	maximum	monthly	housing	costs	affordable	to	households	in	Escalon	by	
  income	group.		Affordability	is	based	on	a	household	paying	up	to	30	percent	of	their	monthly	
  income	toward	housing.			
  Table	3-26	shows	the	maximum	rents	and	sales	prices,	respectively,	that	are	affordable	to	very	
  low,	 low,	 moderate,	 and	 above	 moderate-income	 households.	 	 Affordability	 is	 based	 on	 a	
  household	spending	30	percent	or	less	of	their	total	household	income	for	shelter.			
  Affordability	of	a	home	purchase	is	based	on	the	maximum	household	income	levels	established	
  by	HCD	(Table	3-9).	Maximum	affordable	sales	price	is	based	on	the	following	assumptions:	4.5%	
  interest	rate,	30-Year	Fixed	loan,	downpayments	of	$5,000	to	$25,000,	1.025%	property	tax,	2%	
  closing	costs,	and	homeowners	insurance.		Comparing	affordable	home	prices	in	Table	3-26	to	
  the	2015	median	sales	price	in	Chart	3-1,	the	median	sales	price	is	affordable	to	large	moderate	
  income	households	and	to	above	moderate	income	households.		The	2015	median	sales	price	is	
  not	affordable	to	extremely	low,	very	low,	or	low	income	households.		A	survey	of	homes	for	sale	
  identified	on	Zillow.com	in	March/April	2016	identified	several	homes	for	sale	in	the	$240,000	to	
  $290,000	price	range	that	would	be	affordable	to	moderate	income	households	of	three	persons	
  or	more,	but	the	majority	of	homes	for	sale	were	priced	at	$300,000	and	above	and	would	be	
  affordable	 primarily	 to	 above	 moderate	 income	 households	 or	 larger	 moderate	 income	
  households.	
  Compared	 to	 the	 rental	 rates	 in	 Table	 3-24,	 the	 median	 rents	 in	 Escalon	 are	 not	 generally	
  affordable	to	extremely	low	income	households	and	very	low	income	households.			The	majority	
  of	available	rental	units	in	Escalon	are	three	bedroom	units,	with	rents	from	$1,200	to	$1,750.		
  These	units	are	generally	affordable	for	low	income	households	with	four	or	more	persons	and	
  moderate	and	above	moderate	income	households.		The	2014	median	rent	reported	by	the	2010-
  2014	ACS	is	affordable	to	lower	income	households	of	two	persons	and	more,	as	well	as	moderate	
  and	above	moderate	income	households.

  OVERPAYMENT	
  As	with	most	communities,	the	location	of	the	home	is	one	of	the	biggest	factors	with	regards	to	
  price.		Compared	to	the	rest	of	the	state,	housing	in	Escalon	is	still	relatively	affordable.		However,	
  housing	 is	 not	 affordable	 for	 all	 income	 levels,	 particularly	 the	 very-low	 and	 low-income	
  households.		As	previously	discussed,	in	2009	the	median	sales	price	of	a	home	in	Escalon	was	
  $254,900.	
  As	 shown	 in	 Table	 3-27,	 62	 percent	 of	 renters	 in	 Escalon	 overpay	 for	 housing.			
  All	renters	that	overpay	are	in	the	lower	income	groups,	with	nearly	50	percent	of	renters	in	the	
  extremely	low	income	group	severely	overpaying	for	housing	(over	50	percent	of	their	monthly	
  income).		33.8	percent	of	all	home	owners	in	Escalon	overpay	for	housing,	with	the	majority	of	
  lower	income	homeowners	overpaying	for	housing.		While	no	moderate	and	above	moderate	
  income	renters	overpay	for	housing,	over	one-quarter	of	moderate	and	above	moderate	income	
  homeowners	 overpay.	 	 Almost	 half	 of	 all	 very	 low,	 low,	 and	 moderate	 income	 households	
  overpay	for	housing.

While	there	has	been	a	decrease	in	senior	households	from	2010	(587	senior-headed	households)	
to	2014	(524	senior-headed	households),	this	is	not	indicative	of	a	decline	in	the	need	for	senior	
housing.	 	 The	 senior	 population	 has	 increased	 by	 124.6%	 since	 2000	 (Table	 3-29)	 and	 is	
anticipated	 to	 continue	 to	 increase	 during	 the	 planning	 period,	 as	 shown	 in	 Table	 3-31.	 	 It	 is	
anticipated	that	the	need	for	senior	housing	during	the	planning	period	will	be	proportionate	to	
the	existing	ratio	of	senior	households	to	total	households.				There	is	a	lack	of	housing	for	seniors,	
particularly	assisted	housing	or	housing	that	provides	independent	living	options	in	a	supported	
environment.		
Senior	Housing	and	Resources	
There	is	increasing	variety	in	the	types	of	housing	available	to	the	senior	population.		This	section	
focuses	on	three	basic	types.	
        Independent	Living	–	housing	for	healthy	seniors	who	are	self-sufficient	and	want	the	
        freedom	and	privacy	of	their	own	separate,	apartment	or	house.		Many	seniors	remain	in	
        their	original	homes,	and	others	move	to	special	residential	communities	which	provide	
        a	greater	level	of	security	and	social	activities	of	a	senior	community.	
        Group	Living	–	shared	living	arrangements	in	which	seniors	live	in	close	proximity	to	their	
        peers	and	have	access	to	activities	and	special	services.	
        Assisted	Living	–	provides	the	greatest	level	of	support,	including	meal	preparation	and	
        assistance	with	other	activities	of	daily	living.			
There	is	one	senior	assisted	living	facility	in	Escalon,	Golden	Acres	Home	and	Care,	which	has	26	
beds.	Heritage	House	provides	42	units	of	affordable	apartment	units	for	seniors	and	disabled	
persons	 in	 an	 independent	 living	 environment.	 	 There	 are	 no	 other	 independent	 living	 or	
group/congregate	residential	developments	for	seniors	in	Escalon.		
Classes	 and	 activities	 for	 seniors	 are	 available	 at	 the	 Escalon	 Community	 Center.	 	 Community	
Action	Resources	of	Escalon	(CARE)	provides	services	for	the	seniors	including	the	Senior	Brown	
Bag	 food	 program	 and	 the	 federal	 Government	 Commodities	 program.	 	 Regional	 programs	
available	to	seniors	in	Escalon	are	described	in	Chapter	5.	
LARGE	FAMILIES	
Large	families	are	defined	as	those	families	containing	five	or	more	persons.		Income	is	a	major	
factor	that	constrains	the	ability	of	families	to	obtain	adequate	housing.		Larger	units	are	more	
expensive	and	most	of	the	units	with	more	than	three	bedrooms	are	single-family	homes,	instead	
of	multi-family	rental	units,	and	not	usually	abundantly	available.	
Table	3-32	provides	information	on	large	families	by	household	size	and	tenure.		Approximately	
19.3	percent	of	households	(501	of	2,587	households)	in	Escalon	are	considered	large	families.		
The	majority	of	large	families	own	their	home,	61.9	percent,	and	38.1	percent	of	households	rent.

In	 Escalon,	 there	 are	 adequate	 large	 renter	 and	 owner	 units	 to	 meet	 the	 needs	 of	 large	
households.		The	City’s	1,782	large	owner	units	greatly	exceed	the	City’s	501	large	households,	a	
surplus	of	1,281	large	owner	units.		While	there	are	322	large	rental	units,	there	are	310	large	
renter	 households,	 indicating	 a	 surplus	 of	 only	 12	 large	 rental	 units.	 	 Further,	 there	 is	 the	
possibility	that	some	portion	of	the	City’s	larger	rental	units	are	occupied	by	smaller	households.		
The	2010-2014	ACS	reports	that	there	are	191	five-person	households,	yet	there	are	only	51	four-
bedroom	rental	units	and	no	five-bedroom	rental	units.		While	no	renter	households	reported	
overcrowded	 conditions	 in	 the	 2010-2014	 ACS,	 there	 is	 a	 potential	 need	 for	 additional	 large	
renter	units	due	to	the	limited	surplus.			
Based	on	the	proportion	of	large	families	to	total	households,	approximately	77	housing	units	of	
the	City’s	2014-2023	RHNA	should	be	for	larger	households,	including	33	lower	income	units.

greater	than	those	of	male-headed	households,	it	is	important	to	recognize	the	housing	needs	of

FARM	WORKERS	
There	is	no	specific	Census	data	available	for	the	job	category	of	"Farm	Worker."		The	Census	
groups	"Agriculture,	Forestry,	Fishing	and	Hunting,	and	Mining"	are	lumped	together;	and	there	
is	no	method	for	separating	those	classifications	from	the	grouping.			
Farm	workers	traditionally	are	defined	as	persons	whose	primary	incomes	are	earned	through	
permanent	or	seasonal	agricultural	labor.		Permanent	farm	workers	work	in	the	fields,	processing	
plants,	 or	 support	 activities	 on	 a	 year-round	 basis.	 	 When	 workloads	 increase	 during	 harvest	
periods,	the	labor	force	is	supplemented	by	seasonal	or	migrant	labor.		Farm	workers’	special	
housing	needs	typically	arise	from	their	limited	income	and	the	unstable,	seasonal	nature	of	their	
employment,	according	to	the	California	Institute	for	Rural	Studies.		Because	of	these	factors,	
farm	worker	households	have	limited	housing	choices	and	are	often	forced	to	double	up	to	afford	
rents.	
Most	data	related	to	the	farmworker	population	is	collected	at	the	County	and	regional	levels	
and	does	not	identify	farmworker	data	at	the	City	level.		The	San	Joaquin	Fair	Housing	and	Equity	
Assessment	(California	Coalition	for	Rural	Housing,	2014)	indicates	that	the	8-County	San	Joaquin	
Valley	has	more	farm	workers	than	any	other	region	of	the	state	and	that	the	majority	of	the	
Valley’s	nearly	190,000	workers	are	foreign	born	from	Mexico,	receive	very	low	wages,	and	have	
limited	 access	 to	 education,	 housing,	 and	 healthcare.	 	 The	 Assessment	 indicates	 that	 in	 San	
Joaquin	County	there	were	23,037	farmworkers,	of	which	20.5%	are	foreign	born	and	18.4%	are	
linguistically	isolated.			
The	2012	US	Agricultural	Census,	reported	by	the	US	Department	of	Agriculture,	indicates	that	
there	were	3,580	farms	in	San	Joaquin	County	totaling	787,015	acres.		Of	the	3,850	farms,	there	
are	 1,748	 farms	 with	 hired	 labor,	 which	 collectively	 hire	 a	 total	 of	 24,872	 workers.	 	 Of	 the	
workers,	 15,723	 worked	 less	 than	 150	 days	 and	 13,134	 workers	 were	 migrant	 workers.	 	 This	
information	is	consistent	with	the	farmworker	data	provided	in	the	SJCOG	data	package.	
While	US	Census	data	is	available	at	the	City	level;	there	is	no	specific	Census	data	available	for	
the	job	category	of	"Farm	Worker."		The	Census	groups	“agriculture,	forestry,	fishing	and	hunting,	
and	 mining”	 together	 (see	 Table	 3-12);	 and	 there	 is	 no	 method	 for	 separating	 individual	 job	
classifications	from	the	grouping,	meaning	that	farm	owners	and	operators,	fishers,	hunters,	and	
miners	 are	 grouped	 in	 with	 the	 farm	 labor.	 	 There	 are	 230	 workers	 reported	 in	 Escalon’s	
Housing	Element	                                         	                                             3-23

ACS.			
The	 City’s	 Zoning	 Code	 and	 General	 Plan	 do	 not	 designate	 any	 land	 for	 agricultural	 uses.		
However,	the	City	has	actively	farmed	lands	that	are	planned	for	urban	uses,	including	residential,	
commercial,	and	industrial,	approximately	364.7	acres	of	the	undeveloped	land	is	farmland	or	
orchard	land.		Farmland	within	the	City	limits	accounts	for	0.04%	of	the	agricultural	land	in	San	
Joaquin	County	based	on	data	from	the	California	Department	of	Conservation	2014	Important	
Farmlands	Map	for	San	Joaquin	County.		Applying	the	City’s	proportion	of	farmland	(0.04%)	to	
the	2012	USDA	farmworker	county	data,	there	are	approximately	10	farmworkers	in	the	City.		
Based	on	the	USDA	data	for	the	County,	approximately	six	of	these	workers	worked	less	than	150	
days	and	approximately	five	workers	are	migrant	workers.		The	most	recent	wage	data	released	
by	EDD	indicates	that	in	San	Joaquin	County,	the	average	farm,	fishing,	and	forestry	occupations	
wage	was	$10.33	per	hour	in	the	first	quarter	of	2015.		The	average	wage	per	hour	for	fruit	and	
tree	nut	labor	was	$9.28	and	the	average	annual	wage	was	$19,315.			
The	Housing	Authority	of	San	Joaquin	County	currently	manages	three	migrant	family	farm	labor	
housing	 developments	 within	 the	 County,	 with	 the	 capacity	 to	 accommodate	 288	 individuals.		
Two	of	the	farm	labor	housing	centers	are	located	in	French	Camp	and	one	is	located	in	Lodi.		
Each	has	96	units.	
Some	of	the	migrant	farmers	who	formerly	moved	from	state	to	state	or	from	other	countries	to	
California	 to	 pursue	 agricultural	 employment	 may	 have	 now	 become	 permanent	 residents	 of	
Escalon.		As	such,	the	housing	needs	of	farm	workers	may	need	to	be	addressed	through	both	
permanent	housing	and	migrant	farm	labor	camps.		Their	housing	need	may	be	comparable	to	
other	households	and	large	families	who	are	in	need	of	affordable	housing	with	three	or	more	
bedrooms.	
The	 marked	 decline	 in	 grower-provided	 worker	 shelter	 resulted	 in	 the	 State	 government	
directing	resources	to	farmworker	housing	through	State-owned	and	local	government-operated	
migrant	labor	camps.	The	Housing	Authority	of	San	Joaquin	County	operates	three	of	these	State-
owned	 migrant	 camps	 totaling	 288	 units.	 This	 housing	 is	 available	 annually	 from	 mid-March	
through	the	end	of	October.	Day	care	centers	are	provided	for	farmworkers,	as	well	as	services	
from	 the	 Employment	 Development	 Department,	 the	 Social	 Security	 Administration,	 and	
education	and	health	care	services.	During	the	off-season	one	of	the	French	Camp	facilities	is	
made	available	to	the	homeless	or	the	migrant	camps	in	French	Camp	are	used	as	a	cold	weather	
overflow	homeless	shelter	for	families	(from	mid-December	through	mid-March).	
The	Federal	government	established	self-help	farmworker	housing	for	homeownership,	and	non-
profit	owned	farmworker	rental	housing	programs	to	address	reduced	supply	of	housing.		Despite	
these	 efforts,	 statistics	 indicate	 that	 the	 availability	 of	 housing	 for	 migrant	 and	 seasonal	
farmworkers	in	the	County	is	not	better	than	it	was	thirty	or	forty	years	ago,	and	the	trend	is	
toward	fewer	available	units.	
The	City	does	not	have	land	designated	for	agricultural	uses	and,	thus,	does	not	have	a	zoning	
districts	that	are	subject	to	State	law	requirements	regarding	permitting	farmworker	housing	is	
required	 to	 be	 permitted	 by	 right.	 	 However,	 in	 order	 to	 provide	 increased	 opportunities	 for	
Housing	Element	                                  	                                                  3-24	

	
farmworker	 housing,	 the	 Housing	 Plan	 includes	 a	 program	 to	 permit	 employee	 housing	 as	 a	
permitted	use	in	accordance	with	Health	and	Safety	Code	Section	17021.5.	
Escalon	is	anticipated	to	continue	to	urbanize	in	the	future	and	additional	farming	operations	are	
not	 projected	 within	 City	 limits.	 	 The	 majority	 of	 farmworkers	 in	 San	 Joaquin	 County	 are	
employed	in	the	unincorporated	area	and	their	needs	will	be	addressed	in	the	San	Joaquin	County	
Housing	Element.		It	is	therefore	anticipated	that	the	need	for	farmworker	housing	in	Escalon	will	
not	increase	in	the	coming	years.	
DISABLED	POPULATION	
A	 "disability"	 includes,	 but	 is	 not	 limited	 to,	 any	 physical	 or	 mental	 disability	 as	 defined	 in	
California	Government	Code	Section	12926.	A	"mental	disability"	involves	having	any	mental	or	
psychological	 disorder	 or	 condition,	 such	 as	 mental	 retardation,	 organic	 brain	 syndrome,	
emotional	 or	 mental	 illness,	 or	 specific	 learning	 disabilities	 that	 limits	 a	 major	 life	 activity.	 A	
"physical	 disability"	 involves	 having	 any	 physiological	 disease,	 disorder,	 condition,	 cosmetic	
disfigurement,	 or	 anatomical	 loss	 that	 affects	 body	 systems	 including	 neurological,	
immunological,	 musculoskeletal,	 special	 sense	 organs,	 respiratory,	 speech	 organs,	
cardiovascular,	reproductive,	digestive,	genitourinary,	hemic	and	lymphatic,	skin,	and	endocrine.	
In	addition,	a	mental	or	physical	disability	limits	a	major	life	activity	by	making	the	achievement	
of	major	life	activities	difficult	including	physical,	mental,	and	social	activities	and	working.	
The	 2010-2014	 ACS	 provided	 data	 for	 six	 types	 of	 disabilities:	 hearing,	 vision,	 cognitive,	
ambulatory,	self-care,	and	independent	living.		A	disability	is	defined	as	a	mental,	physical,	or	
health	condition	that	lasts	over	six	months	and	persons	may	have	more	than	one	disability.	The	
ACS	disability	categories	are	detailed	below:	
    •   Hearing	difficulty	-	deaf	or	having	serious	difficulty	hearing	
    •   Vision	difficulty	-	blind	or	having	serious	difficulty	seeing,	even	when	wearing	glasses.	
    •   Cognitive	difficulty	-	Because	of	a	physical,	mental,	or	emotional	problem,	having	difficulty	
        remembering,	concentrating,	or	making	decisions		
    •   Ambulatory	difficulty	-	Having	serious	difficulty	walking	or	climbing	stairs		
    •   Self-care	difficulty	-	Having	difficulty	bathing	or	dressing		
    •   Independent	living	difficulty	-	Because	of	a	physical,	mental,	or	emotional	problem,	having	
        difficulty	doing	errands	alone	such	as	visiting	a	doctor’s	office	or	shopping		
Physical,	mental,	and/or	developmental	disabilities	could	prevent	a	person	from	working,	restrict	
a	person’s	mobility,	or	make	caring	for	oneself	difficult.	Therefore,	disabled	persons	often	require	
special	housing	needs	related	to	potential	limited	earning	capacity,	the	lack	of	accessible	and	
affordable	housing,	and	higher	health	costs	associated	with	disabilities.	Additionally,	people	with	
disabilities	require	a	wide	range	of	different	housing,	depending	on	the	type	and	severity	of	their	
disability.	 Housing	 needs	 can	 range	 from	 institutional	 care	 facilities	 to	 facilities	 that	 support	
partial	or	full	independence	(i.e.,	group	care	homes).	Supportive	services	such	as	daily	living	skills	
and	employment	assistance	need	to	be	integrated	in	the	housing	situation.	The	disabled	person	
with	a	mobility	limitation	requires	housing	that	is	physically	accessible.	Examples	of	accessibility	
in	 housing	 include	 widened	 doorways	 and	 hallways,	 ramps,	 bathroom	 modifications	 (i.e.,

including	smoke	alarms	and	flashing	lights.			
According	to	the	2010-2014	ACS,	there	were	762	persons	with	one	or	more	disabilities	in	Escalon.	
Of	the	disabled	population,	55.4	percent	are	aged	5	to	64	and	44.6	percent	percent	are	aged	65	
and	over.	No	disabilities	were	reported	in	the	population	aged	five	and	under.	Of	the	disabled	
persons	in	the	16	to	64	age	bracket,	62	percent	were	employed	and	the	remaining	38	percent	
were	unemployed.		Table	3-36	identifies	disabilities	by	type	of	disability	and	Table	3-37	identifies	
disabled	persons	by	age	and	employment	status.	
The	2010-2014	ACS	indicated	that	for	individuals	between	the	ages	of	5	and	64,	approximately	
239	persons	had	some	form	or	type	of	disability	and	were	not	in	the	labor	force.		This	indicates	
that	their	disability	may	impede	their	ability	to	earn	an	adequate	income	or	find	suitable	housing	
accommodations	to	meet	their	special	needs.		Therefore,	many	in	this	group	may	be	in	need	of	
housing	assistance.

While	recent	Census	data	does	not	provide	income	levels	or	overpayment	data	for	persons	with	
a	disability,	the	2010-2014	ACS	survey	indicates	that	129	persons	with	a	disability	are	below	the	
poverty	level	and	101	persons	with	a	disability	have	incomes	only	double	the	poverty	level.		It	is

likely	that	a	portion	of	these	disabled	persons	are	in	households	that	overpay	for	housing	due	to	
their	limited	income.	
While	the	US	Census	reports	on	a	broad	range	of	disabilities,	the	Census	does	not	identify	the	
subpopulation	that	has	a	developmental	disability.	The	California	Department	of	Developmental	
Services	(DDS)	maintains	data	regarding	people	with	developmental	disabilities,	defined	as	those	
with	severe,	life-long	disabilities	attributable	to	mental	and/or	physical	impairments.		The	DDS	
data	is	reported	by	zip	code,	so	the	data	reflects	a	larger	area	than	the	City	of	Escalon,	however	
approximately	57	percent	of	the	population	within	the	zip	code	resides	in	Escalon.		The	DDS	data	
indicates	that	75	developmentally	disabled	persons	reside	in	zip	code	95320;	this	correlates	to	
approximately	43	of	the	developmentally	disabled	persons	living	in	Escalon	(Table	3-38).	Table	3-
39	breaks	down	the	developmentally	disabled	population	by	residence	type.		Of	these	persons,	
the	majority	(39)	live	at	home	with	a	parent	or	guardian	and	less	than	10	live	independently	or	in

Housing	for	Individuals	with	Mental	Illness	
The	typical	housing	need	for	individuals	with	mental	illness	apart	from	traditional	single	family	
and	multifamily	housing	types	includes	group	homes,	single	occupancy	units	(SROs),	or	shared	
housing.	 	 Each	 type	 of	 housing	 also	 requires	 supportive	 services.	 	 The	 San	 Joaquin	 County	
Behavioral	 Health/Mental	 Health	 Services	 (SJCMHS)	 provides	 mental	 health	 services	 ranging	
from	24-hour	emergency	crisis	clinic,	to	inpatient	and	outpatient	services.		The	County	operates	
a	 40-bed	 psychiatric	 health	 facility	 that	 provides	 intensive	 therapeutic	 psychiatric	 services.		
SJCMHS	operates	a	transitional	care	facility	that	provides	temporary	supportive	care	to	abused,	
endangered,	 or	 abandoned	 older	 adults	 in	 transitional	 care	 housing	 and	 also	 operates	 two	
transitional	care	homes	that	provide	transitional	housing	and	care	for	adults.	Those	categorized	
as	 disabled	 due	 to	 mental	 disorder	 of	 some	 nature	 do	 not	 necessarily	 require	 physical	
improvements	to	housing.		Social	Services	organizations	offer	assistance	with	medical	attention	
and	counseling	for	those	in	need	of	these	types	of	services.	
Housing	Element	                                         	                                                      3-27	

	
Housing	for	the	Physically	Disabled	
Current	 building	 codes	 incorporate	 the	 requirements	 of	 the	 Housing	 Act	 of	 1988	 and	 the	
Americans	with	Disabilities	Act.	Thus,	newer	housing	will	meet	minimum	standards	for	disabled	
access.	One	of	the	key	needs	for	disabled	persons	is	assistance	in	retrofitting	older	homes.		
There	are	no	group	homes	in	Escalon	specifically	for	physically	disabled	individuals.	ACS	2010-
2014	data	indicated	that	for	individuals	between	the	ages	of	5	and	64,	approximately	3.1	percent	
of	the	total	population	of	Escalon	has	an	ambulatory	difficulty,	0.8	percent	have	vision	difficulty,	
0.8	percent	have	a	hearing	difficulty,	and	7.2	percent	have	an	independent	living	difficulty.		These	
types	of	disabilities	may	impede	their	ability	to	find	suitable	housing	accommodations	to	meet	
their	 special	 needs.	 	 Therefore,	 many	 in	 these	 groups	 may	 be	 in	 need	 of	 housing	 assistance.		
Households	 containing	 physically	 handicapped	 persons	 may	 also	 need	 housing	 with	 special	
features	to	allow	better	physical	mobility	for	occupants.	
Housing	for	the	Developmentally	Disabled	
Developmentally	 disabled	 individuals	 live	 with	 mental	 retardation,	 cerebral	 palsy,	 autism	 or	
other	forms	of	learning	or	cognitive	disabilities.		The	Valley	Mountain	Regional	Center	(VMRC),	
which	 serves	 San	 Joaquin	 County	 from	 its	 Stockton	 office,	 provides	 free	 diagnosis,	 and	
assessment	services	are	available	to	any	person	suspected	of	having	a	developmental	disability,	
such	as	intellectual	disability,	cerebral	palsy,	epilepsy,	or	autism.	To	qualify	for	ongoing	support	
and	services,	a	person	must	be	found	to	have	a	developmental	disability	which	began	before	the	
age	of	18	and	is	a	substantial	handicap.	
In	 Escalon,	 there	 is	 one	 community	 care	 facility	 specifically	 for	 the	 developmentally	 disabled	
population.		VMRC	offers	in-home	care	services	for	clients	that	live	at	home	with	family	or	in	an	
independent	setting.		VMRC	reports	that	96.6	percent	of	its	clients	under	18	live	with	families.		
Almost	75	percent	of	its	adult	clients	either	live	with	families	or	in	an	independent	or	supported	
environment.		10	percent	of	all	clients	are	children	and	adults	living	in	community	care	facilities.		
Only	 a	 small	 portion	 of	 the	 children	 and	 adult	 clientele	 (0.3	 percent)	 live	 in	 developmental	
centers.		Housing	with	supportive	services	and	community	care	facilities	are	specific	needs	for	
the	County’s	developmentally	disabled	population.		Currently,	VMRC	works	with	several	adult	
residential	facilities	in	its	multi-county	area	to	place	its	developmentally	disabled	clients.	In	San	
Joaquin	 County,	 VMRC	 coordinates	 with	 clients	 for	 placement	 in	 the	 following	 residential	
settings:	
     •   Group	 Home	 or	 Small	 Family	 Home	 for	 children	 with	 mild	 to	 moderate	 behaviors	 and	
         some	medical	needs	(Male	&	Female,	Ambulatory	&	Non-Ambulatory).	
     •   Group	Home	or	Small	Family	Home	for	children	with	severe	behaviors	(Male	&	Female,	
         Ambulatory	&	Non-Ambulatory).	
     •   Adult	 Residential	 Facility	 able	 to	 provide	 services	 for	 adults	 that	 are	 deaf/hearing	
         impaired.
New	housing	for	the	developmentally	disabled	should	be	located	within	a	convenient	walking	
distance	of	key	destinations	like	bus	stops	and	retail,	as	opposed	to	being	located	on	the	rural	
fringes,	as	most	walk	or	take	transit.

HOMELESS	
The	federal	definition	of	a	homeless	person	per	the	McKinney	Act,	P.L.	100-77,	Sec.	193(2),	101	
Sat.	485	(1987)	is	cited	as:	
     	“a	person	is	considered	homeless	when	the	person	or	family	lacks	a	fixed	regular	night-
     time	 residence,	 or	 has	 a	 primary	 night-time	 residence	 that	 is	 a	 supervised	 publicly-
     operated	shelter	designated	for	providing	temporary	living	accommodations	or	is	residing	
     in	a	public	or	private	place	not	designated	for,	or	ordinarily	used	as,	a	regular	sleeping	
     accommodation	for	human	beings.”	
The	City	of	Escalon	does	not	keep	data	regarding	the	counted	or	estimated	number	of	homeless	
persons	within	the	City	at	any	given	time.	However,	based	on	conversations	with	the	Escalon	
Police	Department	and	various	service	providers,	the	number	of	homeless	persons	in	Escalon	is	
estimated	 to	 be	 lower	 than	 5	 persons	 at	 any	 given	 time,	 which	 is	 consistent	 with	 the	 2010	
Housing	Element	data.		Local	police	officials	have	stated	that	they	believe	that	the	homeless	who	
pass	through	Escalon	are	transient	and	do	not	remain	in	the	City	due	to	a	lack	of	support	services.		
There	does	not	appear	to	be	seasonal	fluctuation	in	the	number	of	homeless	in	the	City.		The	
homeless	 in	 San	 Joaquin	 County	 are	 provided	 shelter	 primarily	 in	 Stockton,	 Lodi,	 Tracy,	 and	
Manteca.	Homeless	from	Escalon	and	are	referred	to	Stockton,	as	Stockton	provides	the	most	
comprehensive	range	of	services	and	shelter.		
Countywide,	 there	 has	 been	 a	 decrease	 in	 the	 homeless	 population	 since	 the	 2011	 homeless	
surveys	 (see	 Table	 3-40).	 	 During	 this	 time	 frame,	 the	 number	 of	 homeless	 in	 shelters	 has	
decreased	 by	 approximately	 50	 percent	 (-1,120	 homeless),	 while	 the	 unsheltered	 homeless	
increased	 by	 116.6	 percent	 (288	 homeless).	 	 The	 2011	 survey	 did	 not	 identify	 any	 homeless	
persons	in	Escalon.		The	2013	and	2015	surveys	only	provided	Countywide	information	and	did	
not	identify	homeless	persons	by	place	within	the	County.

CHAPTER	FOUR	–	LAND	AND	INFRASTRUCTURE	
Government	 Code	 Section	 65583	 requires	 local	 governmental	 agencies	 to	 undertake	 a	
comprehensive	 review	 of	 their	 land	 base	 in	 order	 to	 inventory	 vacant	 sites,	 and	 to	 assess	
service	 and	 infrastructure	 capacities.	 This	 chapter	 includes	 an	 inventory	 of	 vacant	 and	
underutilized	residential	housing	sites	that	provide	housing	opportunities	for	all	income	levels	
in	the	City	of	Escalon	in	accordance	with	the	Government	Code.		
The	ability	to	provide	suitable	housing	that	meets	the	needs	of	residents	from	all	income	levels	
is	 largely	 dependent	 on	 opportunities	 within	 the	 community.	 These	 opportunities	 are	
determined	 primarily	 by	 the	 availability	 of	 vacant	 sites	 that	 can	 accommodate	 a	 range	 of	
housing	 unit	 types.	 Housing	 opportunities	 are	 also	 affected	 by	 infrastructure	 availability	 and	
capacity.	Lastly,	land	use	controls,	environmental	constraints,	and	market	conditions,	which	are	
addressed	in	Chapter	Five,	also	affect	housing	opportunities.	
LAND	AVAILABILITY	
The	 Regional	 Housing	 Needs	 Allocation	 (RHNA)	 for	 the	 City	 of	 Escalon	 includes:	 169	 lower	
(extremely	low,	very	low,	and	low)	income	units,	192	moderate	income	units,	and	224	above	
moderate	income	units.	To	date,	7	moderate	and	24	above	moderate	income	units	have	been	
constructed.		The	remaining	housing	need	in	Escalon	is	396	new	units	(see	Table	3-29).	
The	 amount	 of	 land	 available	 for	 new	 housing	 development	 is	 the	 crucial	 first	 step	 in	
determining	 whether	 an	 agency	 can	 accommodate	 their	 housing	 needs.	 There	 must	 be	
sufficient	vacant	parcels	within	the	City	limits	or	areas	to	be	annexed	that	are	already	zoned	for	
residential	 uses.	 The	 City’s	 GIS	 and	 parcel	 database	 was	 reviewed	 in	 order	 to	 identify	 vacant	
parcels	 with	 residential	 zoning	 designations,	 as	 well	 as	 sites	 that	 have	 the	 potential	 for	
redevelopment	 or	 additional	 housing	 units.	 These	 parcels	 are	 illustrated	 in	 Figure	 4-1	 and	
summarized	in	Table	4-1.		A	detailed	list	of	parcels	is	provided	in	Appendix	A.	
The	 City	 has	 61.12	 acres	 of	 vacant	 and	 underdeveloped	 land	 with	 land	 use	 designations	 and	
zoning	that	allow	residential	uses	as	a	permitted	use.		The	City’s	inventory	of	residential	sites	
will	accommodate	898	to	1,160	units,	as	shown	in	Table	4-1.		The	City’s	inventory	exceeds	the	
land	needed	to	accommodate	the	City’s	remaining	RHNA	of	396	units.

  Historically,	 projects	 that	 are	 between	 50	 and	 100	 units	 are	 more	 desirable	 in	 smaller	 cities	
  such	 as	 Escalon.	 As	 shown	 in	 Figure	 4-1,	 many	 of	 the	 R-2,	 R-3,	 and	 C2	 vacant	 parcels	 are	
  contiguous	and	large	enough	to	provide	flexibility	in	design	and	economies	of	scale	that	do	not

  LOWER	INCOME	HOUSING	
  Affordable	 housing	 for	 multi-family	 and	 special	 needs	 groups	 (low-income,	 disabled,	 elderly,	
  etc.)	can	be	best	accommodated	in	the	R-3	zones	and	C-2	zones.	The	R-3	and	C-2	zones	allow	
  densities	 of	 15	 to	 29.0	 units	 per	 acre,	 which	 exceed	 the	 minimum	 density	 of	 20	 units/acre	
  assumed	 to	 accommodate	 lower	 income	 units	 pursuant	 to	 Government	 Code	 Section	
  65583.2(c)(3)(B)(iii).	 Both	 the	 R-3	 and	 C-2	 allow	 multifamily	 development	 as	 a	 permitted	 use;	
  however,	the	City	requires	a	PD	overlay	district	for	all	residential	developments	larger	than	one	
  acre	as	discussed	in	Chapter	5.	It	is	noted	that	R-2	also	allows	densities	of	up	to	a	maximum	of	
  15	 units	 per	 acre,	 which	 could	 accommodate	 affordable	 housing	 for	 multi-family	 and	 special	
  needs	groups.		
  As	shown	in	Table	4-3,	the	parcels	in	the	R-3	zone	have	a	realistic	capacity	of	developing	with	
  225	units	and	the	C-2	zone	parcels	have	a	realistic	capacity	of	404	units.	This	anticipates	that	20	
  percent	 of	 each	 parcel	 may	 be	 needed	 for	 roadways,	 infrastructure/utilities,	 setbacks,	 and	
  other	requirements.		As	shown	in	Table	4-3,	there	is	a	single	R-3	parcel	that	can	accommodate	
  110	 units,	 a	 C-2	 parcel	 that	 can	 accommodate	 117	 units,	 and	 a	 C-2	 parcel	 that	 can	
  accommodate	 73	 units.	 	 There	 is	 also	 an	 assortment	 of	 smaller	 R-3	 and	 C-2	 parcels	 that	 can	
  accommodate	 smaller	 projects,	 with	 capacities	 of	 the	 individual	 parcels	 ranging	 from	 8	 to	 56	
  units.	 	 As	 described	 in	 Table	 4-3,	 there	 is	 the	 potential	 to	 consolidate	 up	 to	 five	 of	 the	 R-3	
  parcels,	which	would	accommodate	approximately	93	units.		These	parcels	provide	more	than	
  enough	capacity	to	accommodate	the	City’s	extremely	low,	very	low,	and	low	income	housing	
  need	of	169	units.				
  Four	 of	 the	 R-3	 parcels	 are	 nonvacant/underutilized;	 these	 parcels	 have	 a	 winery	 and	
  outbuildings	 as	 well	 as	 vineyards	 and	 have	 not	 been	 in	 use	 since	 prior	 to	 the	 2010	 Housing	
  Element.		These	sites	are	designated	for	multifamily	development	and	four	of	the	five	parcels	
  are	 under	 single	 ownership,	 so	 the	 potential	 to	 consolidate	 the	 parcels	 and	 develop	 a	 single	
  Housing	Element	                                           	                                                 4-2	

	
project	is	realistic.	As	these	parcels	are	not	currently	in	use	and	are	not	planned	to	be	used	for	
nonresidential	 purposes,	 the	 development	 on	 the	 sites	 does	 not	 present	 an	 impediment	 to	
residential	development.

MODERATE	INCOME	HOUSING	
The	 R-2	 parcels	 identified	 in	 Table	 4-4	 have	 the	 capacity	 to	 best	 accommodate	 the	 City’s	
remaining	 moderate	 income	 need	 of	 185	 units,	 as	 the	 densities	 accommodated	 will	 allow	 for	
development	of	moderate	income	small	lot	single	family	homes,	duplexes,	condominiums,	etc.	
Vacant	land	within	the	R-2	zone	could	accommodate	a	maximum	of	223	units,	with	a	realistic	
yield	 of	 178	 units.	 	 The	 City’s	 moderate	 income	 need	 may	 also	 be	 accommodated	 by	 market

ABOVE	MODERATE	INCOME	HOUSING	
The	 City’s	 above	 moderate	 income	 housing	 needs	 are	 anticipated	 to	 be	 accommodated	
primarily	 by	 parcels	 in	 the	 R-1	 zoning	 districts.	 As	 shown	 in	 Table	 4-1,	 the	 City	 has	
approximately	 18.61	 acres	 of	 vacant	 R-1	 parcels	 that	 will	 accommodate	 approximately	 91	 to	
150	 units	 of	 the	 City’s	 allocation.	 	 The	 remaining	 portion	 of	 the	 City’s	 above	 moderate	
allocation	will	likely	be	accommodated	through	mixed	income	development	of	some	of	the	R-2,	
R-3,	or	C-2	sites,	which	have	the	capacity	to	737	units,	which	will	accommodate	the	need	for	
169	lower	income	and	185	moderate	income	units	and	still	have	a	surplus	of	383	units,	which	is	
more	than	adequate	to	meet	the	remaining	above	moderate	income	housing	need.		
APPROVED	AND	PENDING	PROJECTS	
A	residential	care	home	serving	the	residentially	disabled	population	has	been	approved	at	the	
Escalon	Covenant	Church	site.		The	residential	care	home	would	have	rooms	for	6	clients	as	well	
a	room	and	office	for	an	on-site	caretaker.		The	project	was	approved	in	2013	and	in	2015	the	
City	 approved	 the	 project’s	 request	 to	 extend	 the	 approvals	 for	 an	 additional	 two	 years,	
through	 August	 2017,	 to	 provide	 the	 applicant	 with	 additional	 time	 to	 secure	 additional	
funding.	
UTILITIES	AND	SERVICES	
The	ability	to	provide	adequate	infrastructure	and	services	(roads,	water,	sewer,	drainage,	etc.)	
for	 new	 housing	 developments	 is	 an	 essential	 element	 in	 meeting	 future	 housing	 needs.	 The	
cost	of	providing	significant	infrastructure,	when	weighed	with	other	development	costs	such	
as	property,	construction,	and	carry	costs,	can	prohibit	the	ability	of	a	developer	to	achieve	a	
profitable	 return	 on	 investment	 in	 today’s	 market	 climate.	 Infrastructure	 development	 is	
obtained	 in	 two	 ways:	 1)	 through	 direct	 installation	 by	 a	 developer;	 or	 2)	 through	 impact	 fee	
payments	by	the	developer	to	fund	installation	by	the	City	or	a	developer	at	a	later	date.		
An	 assessment	 of	 the	 utility	 infrastructure	 and	 the	 public	 services	 available	 to	 operate	 and	
maintain	the	infrastructure	is	provided	below.	The	assessment	discusses	infrastructure/service	
limitations	for	current	and	future	development	as	well	as	infrastructure	fees.	This	discussion	is	
based	on	information	that	was	obtained	from	the	City’s	Water	Master	Plan,	Sewer	Master	Plan,	
and	Storm	Drain	Master	Plan.		
INFRASTRUCTURE	CONSTRAINTS	
Water	
As	of	February	2016,	the	City	of	Escalon	provides	water	service	for	approximately	7,413	people	
with	approximately	2,495	water	service	connections.	Historically,	water	supply	within	the	City	
has	 been	 from	 groundwater	 wells.	 Service	 was	 initially	 provided	 by	 the	 Escalon	 Water	
Company,	which	was	a	private	company	established	in	the	early	1900’s.	In	the	late	1960s,	the	
City	 took	 over	 the	 operation	 of	 a	 well	 and	 distribution	 system	 serving	 a	 small	 residential	
subdivision	 from	 a	 developer.	 In	 the	 early	 1980s	 the	 City	 purchased	 the	 Escalon	 Water	
Company	and	took	over	the	operation	of	the	entire	water	system.

Permitting.		The	City’s	domestic	water	system	operated	under	State	Water	Resources	Control	
Board	(SWRCB)	Division	of	Drinking	Water,	Domestic	Water	Supply	Permit	Public	Water	System	
No.	3910003	(Permit).		The	City	was	issued	a	Citation	for	violation	of	permit	requirements	on	
July	23,	2015	related	to	nitrate	levels	at	Well	1.		The	Citation	required	the	City	to	not	use	Well	1	
without	 addressing	 the	 nitrate	 levels.	 	 If	 the	 City	 elected	 to	 not	 install	 nitrate	 removal	
equipment,	the	Citation	required	the	City	to	submit	a	detailed	Corrective	Action	Plan	detailing	
nitrate	sampling	demonstrating	acceptable	levels	prior	to	requesting	authorization	to	operate	
Well	1.	
In	 February	 2016,	 the	 City	 completed	 a	 Water	 System	 Evaluation	 (Blackwater	 Consulting	
Engineers,	February	2016)	that	included	a	review	of	the	City’s	water	system	and	operations	to	
prioritize	improvements	in	order	to	1)	comply	with	SWRCB	Permit	requirements,	2)	address	the	
requirements	of	the	Citation	to	provide	a	plan	and	schedule	for	Well	1,	3)	improve	operations	
and	increase	efficiency	of	the	system,	and	4)	meet	maximum	day	water	system	demands.		The	
information	 in	 the	 following	 assessment	 of	 the	 City’s	 water	 supply	 is	 based	 primarily	 on	 the	
2016	Water	System	Evaluation.	
Existing	 Water	 Supply.	 Water	 supply	 for	 domestic	 service	 and	 fire	 flow	 is	 currently	 supplied	
from	four	active	wells	(Wells	1,	3A,	9,	and	10)	that	provide	day-to-day	domestic	water	and	fire	
flow	supply.		There	is	one	500,000-gallon	storage	tank	located	at	the	Well	1	site.	
The	combined	capacities	of	the	City’s	water	system	wells	are	approximately	3,800	gallons	per	
minute	 (gpm).	 With	 Well	 1	 inactive	 and	 Well	 9	 inactive/marginally	 operational	 as	 discussed	
below,	the	system’s	maximum	capacity	is	reduced	to	2,400	gpm.		It	is	noted	that	the	Blackwater	
study	identified	the	reliable	capacity	as	1,900	gpm;	however,	this	appears	to	be	an	error	that	
anticipates	only	Wells	3A	and	9	are	running	rather	than	Wells	3A	and	10.	Table	4-5	summarizes	
each	well	pump	capacity,	facilities,	operation,	and	status.

Well	 1	 has	 been	 equipped	 with	 two	 granular	 activated	 carbon	 (GAC)	 contactors	 that	 remove	
Dibromochloropropane	(DBCP).	Each	vessel	is	rated	for	700	gpm	of	capacity.	The	treated	water	
from	 the	 contactors	 enters	 the	 0.5-million	 gallon	 storage	 tank	 and	 is	 then	 pumped	 into	 the	
system	through	the	booster	pump	station.	Nitrate	levels	exceeding	the	maximum	contaminant	
level	 (MCL)	 are	 detected	 prior	 to	 start-up	 during	 the	 summer	 months	 after	 Well	 1	 has	 been	
inactive	during	the	winter.		The	City	pumps	the	well	to	waste	for	several	weeks	until	the	nitrate	
levels	drop	to	acceptable	levels.	This	process	uses	approximately	1,000,000	gallons	of	water	to	
ready	the	well	for	operation.	The	pumping	equipment	at	Well	1	was	damaged	during	repairs	in	
2012/2013	 and	 needs	 to	 be	 upgraded	 to	 meet	 the	 nitrate	 MCL.	 	 The	 City	 opted	 to	 not	 place	
Well	1	in	service	in	2015	as	Well	1	was	not	needed	to	meet	demands,	since	demands	had	been	
reduced	as	a	result	of	conservation	efforts	during	the	drought.		
No	other	treatment	is	necessary	throughout	the	system,	although	the	City	treats	all	wells	with	
calcium	hypochlorite	to	disinfect	as	a	preventative	measure.	
System	Capacity	and	Operation.		The	City’s	maximum	daily	water	use	has	declined	from	2,191	
gpm	 in	 2009	 to	 1,591	 gpm	 in	 2015.	 The	 current	 system	 has	 sufficient	 capacity	 to	 continue	
meeting	 maximum	 day	 demand	 as	 long	 as	 conservation	 measures	 remain	 in	 place.	 	 During	 a	
‘normal’	 year	 when	 conservation	 measures	 are	 not	 required,	 the	 system	 capacity	 would	 be	
insufficient	to	meet	maximum	day	demands	with	Well	1	inactive.	
Distribution	 System.	 The	 existing	 distribution	 system	 consists	 of	 approximately	 33	 miles	 of	
piping.	 Pipeline	 diameters	 range	 from	 three	 to	 16	 inches.	 The	 original	 system	 was	 built	 with	
small	diameter	steel	pipe,	which	was	inadequate	to	convey	flows	at	adequate	pressures.	Due	to	
the	dilapidated	condition	of	the	system,	the	City	applied	for	and	was	awarded	a	state	loan	and	
federal	 grant	 in	 1983.	 To	 date,	 almost	 all	 of	 the	 old	 pipelines	 have	 been	 replaced,	 and	 as	 a	
result,	the	distribution	system	is	in	excellent	condition.		
The	 system	 pressure	 is	 maintained	 automatically	 with	 a	 supervisory	 control	 and	 data	
acquisition	 system	 (SCADA).	 Operators	 enter	 the	 desired	 system	 pressure	 and	 configure	 the	
wells	 in	 a	 lead/lag	 configuration.	 If	 the	 well	 set	 in	 the	 primary	 position	 cannot	 maintain	 the	
system	pressure,	the	second	well	in	the	series	will	start.		
Water	 Supply	 Improvements.	 Improvements	 are	 needed	 to	 replace	 Well	 1	 and	 expand	 the	
system’s	capacity.		Expansion	of	water	capacity	will	follow	the	pattern	of	actual	development	
within	 each	 growth	 area.	 The	 2016	 Water	 System	 Evaluation	 identifies	 four	 improvements	 to	
the	City’s	water	supply	system	in	order	to	meet	existing	demand	under	normal	conditions	and	
to	provide	capacity	to	accommodate	growth.

Capital	Improvement	Costs.	The	total	cost	of	all	Phase	I	water	improvements	is	approximately	
$1.2	million.		Phase	1	will	be	constructed	in	2016	through	2018.		The	remaining	phases	will	be	
constructed	in	phases	as	they	are	warranted.	The	funding	for	these	improvements	could	come	
from	 various	 federal	 and	 state	 loan	 programs,	 bank	 loans,	 special	 assessment	 districts	 (i.e.	
assessment	 districts,	 community	 facilities	 districts,	 etc.),	 and	 development	 impact	 fees.	 	 The	
City	 is	 reviewing	 several	 funding	 sources,	 including	 USDA	 grants	 and	 loans	 and	 the	 Drinking	
Water	 State	 Revolving	 Fund	 as	 potential	 funding	 sources	 for	 Phase	 1	 improvements.	 	 Both	
funding	sources	provide	low-interest,	long-term	loans	that	could	be	repaid	with	a	combination	
of	 utility	 rates,	 water	 connection	 fees,	 and	 other	 City	 sources.	 	 The	 City	 currently	 charges	 a	
connection	fee	for	all	residential	units	that	are	approved.	The	fee	is	based	on	the	Water	Master	
Plan,	which	provides	the	nexus.

System	Capacity.		During	peak	normal	year	use	in	2009,	2012,	and	2013,	the	average	per	capita	
water	 demand	 was	 approximately	 approximately	 0.341	 gpm,	 which	 yields	 a	 base	 ‘normal’	
demand	 of	 2,529	 gpm	 for	 the	 City’s	 existing	 population	 and	 connections	 (including	 non-
residential)	in	2016.		The	base	‘normal’	demand	is	used	rather	than	the	reduced	demand	that	
occurred	 in	 2015	 because	 water	 conservation	 measures	 may	 not	 be	 required	 in	 future	 years.	
Based	 on	 the	 average	 per	 capita	 demand	 of	 0.341	 gpm,	 accommodating	 the	 City’s	 remaining	
RHNA	of	396	units	would	require	an	increase	in	the	City’s	water	system	capacity	of	398.5	gpm	
(396	 (remaining	 RHNA)	 x	 2.95	 (average	 household	 size)	 x	 0.341	 gpm	 (average	 per	 capita	
demand).	 	 The	 first	 phase	 of	 improvements	 to	 Well	 1	 would	 provide	 adequate	 capacity	 to	
accommodate	the	City’s	RHNA.	
Wastewater		
The	 City	 of	 Escalon	 provides	 sewer	 service	 to	 City	 residents	 and	 businesses.	 The	 City	 has	 two	
sewer	 systems,	 the	 domestic	 sewer	 system	 and	 the	 industrial	 sewer	 system.	 Wastewater	
collected	 in	 these	 systems	 is	 conveyed	 separately	 to	 two	 separate	 treatment	 and	 disposal	
facilities	located	near	McHenry	Avenue	immediately	north	of	the	Stanislaus	River.	The	domestic	
sewer	system	provides	service	to	residential	users	(94	percent	of	treated	wastewater)	as	well	as	
commercial	and	“dry”	industrial	users	(6	percent	of	treated	wastewater).		
The	City	has	addressed	its	sewer	infrastructure	needs	in	two	recent	reports:	the	Phase	1	and	2	
Sewer	 Constraints	 Study	 Report	 (West	 Yost	 Associates,	 May	 2014)	 and	 the	 City	 of	 Escalon	
Wastewater	Rate	Study	(Hanford	Economic	Consulting,	January	2016).		The	2007	Sewer	Master	
Plan	continues	to	provide	direction	regarding	ultimate	facilities	needed	to	address	sewer	needs	
for	the	City	at	buildout	of	the	General	Plan.	
Existing	Sewer	Service.	The	City’s	existing	wastewater	system	produces	approximately	0.53	to	
0.60	 million	 gallons	 per	 day	 (MGD)	 on	 an	 average	 dry	 weather	 day	 and	 1.12	 MGD	 or	 more	
during	wet	weather.		The	City’s	domestic	customer	base	includes	2,567	residential	units	(2,233	
detached	and	334	attached)	as	well	as	schools,	a	hotel,	and	various	commercial	and	industrial	
customers.		The	Wastewater	Rate	Study	reported	that	the	average	daily	use	for	residential	uses	
is	200	gallons	per	day	(GPD)	for	residential	detached	units	and	150	GPD	for	residential	attached	
units.			
Projected	Sewer	Service	Needs.		The	2007	Sewer	Master	Plan	projected	that	influent	flows	are	
anticipated	 to	 increase	 to	 approximately	 2.8	 MGD	 as	 development	 occurs	 within	 the	 2035	
growth	 boundary.	 The	 Phase	 1	 and	 2	 Sewer	 Constraints	 Study	 reviewed	 projected	 flows	
anticipated	to	occur	with	development	at	buildout	and	the	capacity	of	the	existing	system	and	
provided	alternative	alignments	and	interim	improvements	appropriate	to	improve	the	capacity	
of	the	wastewater	system.		The	Phase	1	and	2	Sewer	Constraints	Study	indicated	that	flows	at	
buildout	of	the	City’s	service	area	are	anticipated	to	reach	6.78	MGD.	The	Phase	1	and	2	Sewer	
Constraints	 Study	 identified	 that	 the	 existing	 sewer	 system	 has	 a	 full	 pipe	 capacity	 of	
approximately	1.4	MGD	and	can	convey	up	to	1.65	MGD	if	surcharged	and	that	the	WWTP	has	a	
capacity	 for	 an	 average	 dry	 weather	 flow	 of	 0.9	 MGD,	 although	 the	 hydraulic	 capacity	 is	
approximately	 1.15	 MGD	 at	 the	 influent	 pump	 station	 and	 1.6	 MGD	 internal	 to	 the	 plant.		
Housing	Element	                                  	                                                       4-9	

	
However,	 the	 City’s	 wastewater	 system	 can	 reliably	 convey	 only	 approximately	 0.7	 MGD,	
because	it	is	constrained	by	the	capacity	of	the	McHenry	Pump	Station.		
Sewer	 Service	 Expansion.	 	 The	 Sewer	 Master	 Plan	 identified	 four	 phases	 of	 proposed	
infrastructure	 improvements	 for	 both	 the	 sewer	 collection	 system	 and	 wastewater	 treatment	
facility	for	the	2035	growth	projections.			
The	Phase	1	and	2	Improvements	are	interim	improvements	that	address	additional	municipal	
sewer	capacity	for	the	City’s	residential	and	commercial	growth	in	the	near	future.	The	Phase	1	
and	2	Improvements	would	provide	for	upgrading	and	replacing	the	McHenry	Lift	Station	and	
associated	 gravity	 pipeline	 conveying	 wastewater	 flow	 from	 the	 lift	 station	 south	 to	 the	
wastewater	treatment	plant.		
The	 City	 prepared	 a	 Phase	 1	 and	 2	 Sewer	 Constraints	 Study	 in	 2014	 to	 evaluate	 existing	
conditions,	 identify	 alternative	 alignments	 to	 convey	 projected	 flows,	 and	 to	 assess	 needed	
interim	improvements	to	the	McHenry	Lift	Station.		The	study	recommended	that	the	McHenry	
Lift	Station	be	replaced	with	a	new	pump	station	with	a	capacity	of	approximately	1.4	MGD,	to	
accommodate	 existing	 connections	 plus	 in-fill	 development.	 	 The	 first	 phase	 of	 interim	
improvements	is	to	rehabilitate	existing	sewer	lines	to	increase	capacity	to	1.4	MGD	(although	
an	improved	capacity	of	1.65	MGD	could	be	reached,	this	capacity	would	increase	potential	for	
a	 spill	 so	 an	 interim	 capacity	 of	 1.4	 MGD	 was	 recommended).	 	 The	 second	 phase	 of	
improvements	would	involve	replacement	of	the	McHenry	Lift	Station			
Funding	 and	 Construction	 Sewer	 System	 Improvements.	 	 The	 City's	 current	 approach	 for	
expanding	 sewer	 systems	 for	 new	 development	 is	 to	 require	 that	 such	 new	 development	
extend	the	sewer	system	and	to	"oversize"	the	facility	to	accommodate	future	flows	within	or	
beyond	the	development.		
However,	for	larger-scale	projects	such	as	the	Phase	1	and	2	Improvements,	the	City	will	collect	
connection	fees	and	will	finance	certain	project	components	through	long-term	debt.	The	cash	
pay-as-you	 go	 financing	 basis,	 whereby	 connection	 fees	 collected	 by	 the	 City	 are	 used	 to	
construct	 facilities	 as	 they	 are	 needed,	 does	 not	 provide	 sufficient	 funding	 for	 the	 phased	
improvements.	 	 Fees	 collected	 for	 the	 Phase	 1	 and	 2	 Improvements	 are	 proportionate,	 with	
future	users	paying	their	fair-share.		In	order	to	provide	financing	for	the	remaining	balance	of	
the	project,	the	City	could	consider	a	number	of	different	long-term	debt	financing	alternatives,	
including:	 State	 Revolving	 Fund	 Loans,	 State	 Infrastructure	 Bank	 Loans,	 bonds	 or	 assessment	
district	financing,	federal	infrastructure	financing,	and	commercial	bank	loans.			
Ability	to	Accommodate	RHNA.		The	City	has	funded	and	is	implementing	the	first	phase	of	the	
McHenry	 Avenue	 Lift	 Station	 replacement	 (preparation	 of	 construction	 of	 the	 new	 lift	 station	
and	 sliplining	 the	 existing	 sewer	 trunkline	 from	 the	 lift	 station	 to	 the	 WWTP)	 and	 the	 second	
phase	is	planned	for	2016/17.		The	improvements	will	accommodate	approximately	520	single	
family	dwelling	units	(based	on	a	conservative	factor	of	250	GPD	per	dwelling	unit).		If	the	City’s	
RHNA	of	169	lower	income	units	are	developed	as	multifamily,	this	would	result	in	a	capacity	of	
553	units	(169	multifamily	units	and	384	single	family	units).		Upon	completion	of	Phase	2	of	
Housing	Element	                                   	                                                     4-10	

	
the	 interim	 improvements,	 the	 City	 will	 have	 adequate	 capacity	 to	 accommodate	 the	 City’s	
remaining	RHNA.	
Chapter	 6	 includes	 a	 program	 identifying	 the	 timing	 of	 the	 necessary	 sewer	 improvements	 in	
order	to	ensure	adequate	sewer	capacity	to	accommodate	the	RHNA.	
Storm	Drainage	
The	 City	 of	 Escalon’s	 storm	 drainage	 system	 depends	 on	 SSJID’s	 existing	 system	 of	 irrigation	
laterals	to	transport	storm	drain	runoff	from	the	City.	These	laterals	run	south	and	west,	to	the	
Stanislaus	 River	 and	 the	 Lone	 Tree	 Creek	 respectively.	 The	 City	 is	 divided	 into	 ten	 drainage	
sheds,	 each	 of	 which	 contains	 a	 storm	 drain	 system	 that	 collects	 runoff	 from	 within	 the	
drainage	 shed	 and	 transports	 the	 flows	 to	 a	 City	 maintained	 storm	 drain	 basin.	 The	 basins	
within	 the	 existing	 systems	 are	 designed	 to	 reduce	 the	 peak	 flow	 rates	 released	 to	 the	 SSJID	
laterals.	Runoff	is	temporarily	stored	in	the	basins	then	is	pumped	into	the	SSJID	laterals	at	the	
reduced	flow	rate.	Storm	Drain	System	4	is	the	only	system	that	does	not	discharge	to	a	SSJID	
lateral.	Runoff	collected	by	Storm	Drain	System	4	is	pumped	directly	to	the	industrial	ponds	at	
the	City’s	waste	water	treatment	plant.	
Storm	Drain	Collection	System.	The	storm	drain	collection	system	includes	inlets,	manholes	and	
piping.	 The	 system	 collects	 storm	 drainage	 from	 the	 surrounding	 streets	 through	 inlets,	 and	
transports	the	drainage	via	a	piping	network	to	basins	and/or	pump	stations.	
Basins.	Detention	basins	are	used	to	temporarily	store	runoff	from	the	drainage	sheds	in	order	
to	 reduce	 the	 flow	 rates	 that	 are	 pumped	 into	 the	 SSJID	 laterals.	 SSJID	 requires	 the	 flows	
entering	the	lateral	be	regulated	to	ensure	that	the	capacities	of	the	laterals	are	not	exceeded.	
Basins	allow	the	use	of	smaller	pumps	that	reduce	capital	expense	and	energy	costs.	Detention	
basins	are	typically	joint	use	facilities	providing	recreation	and	other	uses	when	not	occasionally	
being	used	for	stormwater	storage.	There	are	currently	ten	existing	basins	within	the	City	and	
thirteen	future	detention	basins	proposed	to	accommodate	future	growth.	
Pump	Stations.	With	the	exception	of	runoff	from	Storm	Drain	System	4,	storm	drainage	from	
the	 City	 is	 pumped	 into	 the	 SSJID	 laterals.	 Pumps	 are	 sized	 according	 to	 the	 City’s	 design	
criteria,	and	their	operation	is	controlled	by	water	levels	in	the	pump	station	sump	and	in	the	
downstream	 SSJID	 laterals.	 There	 are	 ten	 existing	 drainage	 pump	 stations	 in	 the	 City	 with	 an	
additional	thirteen	pump	stations	planned	for	each	of	the	thirteen	future	detention	basins.	
Capital	Improvement	Costs.	The	total	cost	of	all	storm	drainage	capital	improvements	needed	
within	the	existing	drainage	areas	is	estimated	at	over	$3.2	million.	The	total	cost	of	all	storm	
drainage	capital	improvements	needed	in	the	13	new	drainage	areas	is	estimated	at	over	$41	
million.	 The	 funding	 for	 these	 improvements	 could	 come	 from	 various	 federal	 and	 state	 loan	
programs,	 bank	 loans,	 special	 assessment	 districts	 (i.e.	 assessment	 districts,	 community	
facilities	districts,	etc.),	and	development	impact	fees.		
Improvements.	As	individual	development	projects	are	approved,	they	are	required	to	connect	
to	the	storm	drain	system.		Projects	pay	a	storm	drain	connection	fee	to	contribute	their	fair-
share	of	storm	drainage	improvements.

Traffic	and	Roads	
The	City’s	street	system	is	composed	of	a	general	pattern	of	state	highway,	arterial,	collectors,	
and	local	streets,	each	of	which	provide	varying	degrees	of	direct	access	to	abutting	property.		
Highways.	 Highways	 function	 to	 provide	 high	 speed/high	 volume	 routes	 between	 major	
population	 centers.	 Currently,	 one	 State	 Highway	 exists	 within	 the	 City	 of	 Escalon;	 Highway	
120,	 which	 runs	 east-west.	 This	 facility	 provides	 interregional	 travel	 within	 and	 through	 the	
City.	 Improvements	 on	 this	 facility	 are	 subject	 to	 State	 (Caltrans)	 approval	 in	 terms	 of	
alignment,	 right-of-way,	 and	 lane	 configurations.	 All	 State	 facilities	 must	 be	 designed	 and	
constructed	according	to	current	State	design	standards.	
Arterials.	 The	 primary	 function	 of	 an	 arterial	 is	 to	 provide	 efficient	 through	 and	 cross-town	
traffic.	 Direct	 access	 to	 abutting	 property	 is	 minimized,	 where	 possible,	 to	 maintain	 free	
movement	 of	 potentially	 high	 traffic	 volumes.	 The	 City	 of	 Escalon’s	 current	 standard	 for	 a	
typical	 arterial	 roadway	 is	 100	 feet	 of	 right-of-way	 with	 80	 feet	 of	 pavement.	 Arterials	 within	
Escalon	 have	 a	 design	 capacity	 of	 approximately	 16,500	 (2-	 lane	 undivided)	 to	 34,500	 (4-lane	
divided)	 Average	 Daily	 Traffic	 (ADT).	 Arterials	 in	 the	 City	 of	 Escalon	 include	 the	 Escalon-
Bellota/McHenry	Avenue	and	Highway	120.	
Collectors.	 Collector	 streets	 provide	 the	 traffic	 movement	 between	 arterial	 and	 local	 streets,	
carrying	 a	 large	 share	 of	 the	 intra-city	 traffic.	 They	 also	 provide	 the	 primary	 link	 between	
different	neighborhoods	and	to	the	downtown	area.	In	addition,	collectors	may	serve	as	truck	
routes,	 especially	 for	 the	 delivery	 and	 pick-up	 of	 goods	 where	 arterials	 do	 not	 abut	 that	 land	
use.	Collectors	in	Escalon	typically	have	a	design	capacity	in	excess	of	15,000	(2-	lane	undivided)	
to	29,500	(4-lane	divided)	ADT.	The	City	of	Escalon’s	current	standard	for	major	collectors	is	80	
feet	of	right	of	way	with	64	feet	of	pavement.	The	standard	for	a	minor	collector	is	60	feet	of	
right-of-way	with	40	feet	of	pavement.	
Local	Street.	The	primary	function	of	local	streets	is	to	provide	access	to	collector	streets	from	
abutting	 lands.	 They	 are	 designated	 to	 minimize	 through	 traffic	 movements,	 typically	
terminating	at	their	intersection	with	collectors	and	frequently	curved	or	terminated	in	cul-de-
sacs.	Local	streets	vehicular	capacities	in	the	City	of	Escalon	are	less	than	1,000	ADT.	The	City	of	
Escalon	standard	for	local	streets	is	50	feet	of	right-of-way	with	32	feet	of	pavement.	
Improvements.	As	individual	development	projects	are	proposed	in	Escalon,	they	are	reviewed	
for	their	potential	to	result	in	project-level	traffic	impacts	or	contribution	to	cumulative	adverse	
traffic	 conditions.	 Where	 appropriate,	 individual	 development	 projects	 are	 conditioned	 to	
provide	 traffic	 improvements	 for	 project-specific	 impacts	 and	 to	 pay	 fees	 to	 contribute	 to	
planned	City	and	regional	improvements.				
ENVIRONMENTAL	CONSTRAINTS	
Agricultural	Soils	
The	Escalon	area	has	the	following	soils	types:	Honcut	Sandy	Loam,	Veritas	Fine	Sandy	Loam,	
Delhi	Loamy	Sand,	Manteca	Fine	Sandy	Loam,	and	Tinnin	Loamy	Coarse	Sand.	Agricultural	soil	
capacity	 is	 classified	 according	 to	 a	 number	 of	 criteria	 including	 prime	 farmland,	 farmland	 of	
Housing	Element	                                    	                                                    4-12	

	
statewide	 importance	 and	 unique	 farmlands.	 The	 Honcut	 Sandy	 Loam	 and	 Veritas	 Fine	 Sandy	
Loam	are	considered	prime	farmland	soils.	The	Delhi	Loamy	Sand,	Manteca	Fine	Sandy	Loam,	
and	 Tinnin	 Loamy	 Coarse	 Sand	 are	 considered	 farmland	 of	 statewide	 importance	 soils.	 These	
soils	 do	 not	 have	 any	 major	 limitation	 for	 normal	 building	 activities,	 but	 conversion	 of	 these	
higher	quality	agricultural	soils	to	urban	development	is	highly	scrutinized	throughout	the	San	
Joaquin	Valley	and	mitigation	is	usually	required	to	offset	the	impact.		
Williamson	Act	Lands	
The	Williamson	Act	is	a	non-mandated	State	program,	administered	by	counties	and	cities,	for	
the	 preservation	 of	 agricultural	 land.	 Participation	 in	 the	 program	 is	 voluntary	 on	 the	 part	 of	
both	 landowners	 and	 local	 governments,	 and	 is	 implemented	 through	 the	 establishment	 of	
Agricultural	 Preserves	 and	 the	 execution	 of	 Williamson	 Act	 contracts.	 Individual	 property	
owners	enter	into	a	contract	which	restricts	or	prohibits	development	of	their	property	to	non-
agricultural	 uses	 during	 the	 term	 of	 the	 contract	 in	 return	 for	 lower	 property	 taxes.	 Initially	
signed	for	a	minimum	ten-year	period,	the	contracts	are	automatically	renewed	each	year	for	a	
successive	 minimum	 ten-year	 period	 unless	 a	 notice	 of	 nonrenewal	 is	 filed	 or	 a	 contract	
cancellation	is	approved	by	the	local	government.	None	of	the	sites	included	in	the	Inventory	of	
Residential	Sites	are	under	a	Williamson	Act	contract.		
Special	Status	Species	
The	distribution	of	wildlife	in	the	Escalon	area	is	somewhat	limited,	due	to	urbanization.	Typical	
of	 small	 urban	 communities	 surrounded	 by	 intensive	 agricultural	 uses	 are	 various	 forms	 of	
small	 mammals,	 including	 mice,	 gophers,	 moles,	 ground	 squirrels,	 jack	 rabbits,	 skunks	 and	
opossums,	 together	 with	 medium-sized	 predators	 such	 as	 gray	 foxes	 and	 coyotes.	 Robins,	
finches,	sparrows,	crow,	black	birds,	valley	quail,	ringneck	pheasants	and	mourning	doves	are	
representative	 of	 avian	 species	 common	 to	 the	 region.	 Predator	 avian	 species,	 including	 owls	
and	hawks,	are	also	relatively	common	in	this	portion	of	the	County.		
The	local	vegetation	associations	support	a	variety	of	wildlife	and	plant	species	and	subspecies	
indigenous	to	California.	However,	the	conversion	of	native	and	naturalized	plant	communities	
in	 the	 State	 to	 urban	 land	 uses,	 agriculture,	 and	 industrial	 facilities	 has	 significantly	 reduced	
available	 wildlife	 habitat.	 As	 a	 result	 of	 this	 conversion,	 several	 species	 of	 both	 plants	 and	
animals	have	been	displaced	from	California,	or	their	populations	have	declined	significantly.	As	
a	 result,	 the	 California	 Department	 of	 Fish	 and	 Game	 (CDFG)	 and	 the	 United	 States	 Fish	 and	
Wildlife	Service	(USFWS)	have	listed	some	species	as	threatened	or	endangered.	Of	the	special	
status	 species	 documented	 within	 the	 region,	 only	 Swainson’s	 hawk	 and	 valley	 longhorn	
elderberry	 beetle	 have	 been	 documented	 within	 the	 Escalon	 area.	 As	 future	 areas	 develop,	 a	
biological	 study	 could	 reveal	 the	 presence	 of	 additional	 special	 status	 species	 within	 Escalon.	
Development	projects	that	may	impact	special	status	species	generally	require	mitigation	and	
permits.		
San	Joaquin	County	Multi-Species	Habitat	Conservation	and	Open	Space	Plan	(SJMSCP)	
San	 Joaquin	 County	 and	 the	 cities	 of	 Escalon,	 Lathrop.	 Lodi,	 Manteca,	 Ripon,	 Stockton,	 and	
Tracy	developed	the	SJMSCP	to	conserve	open	space	for	wildlife	while	addressing	the	effects	of	
development	and	other	activities	that	affect	special-status	species	and	convert	habitat	lands	for	
Housing	Element	                                    	                                                      4-13	

	
species	 to	 other	 uses.	 	 The	 SJMSCP	 facilitates	 development	 by	 providing	 pre-approved	
mitigation	measures	and	streamlining	the	permitting	process	to	address	special-status	species.		
The	 SJMSCP	 allows	 specific	 permittees,	 including	 Escalon	 and	 SJCOG,	 to	 issue	 incidental	 take	
permits	 and	 allows	 project	 applicants	 to	 mitigate	 for	 impacts	 to	 SJMSCP	 covered	 species	
resulting	 from	 development	 projects	 as	 well	 as	 other	 specified	 activities.	 	 Project	 applicants	
have	four	options	to	receive	coverage	under	the	HCP:	1)	pay	appropriate	fees	(based	on	habitat	
type),	 2)	 conserve	 habitat	 lands,	 3)	 purchase	 mitigation	 bank	 credits,	 or	 4)	 propose	 an	
alternative	mitigation	plan.	
The	SJMSCP	identifies	six	different	land	use	categories,	including	A	–	Exempt,	B	–	Other	Open	
Spaces,	C	–	Agricultural	Habitat	Open	Spaces,	D	–	Natural	Lands	Habitat,	E	–	Vernal	Pools,	F	–	
Prior	 Agreement.	 	 The	 majority	 of	 residential	 sites	 in	 the	 City	 are	 in	 Categories	 A	 and	 F	 and	
there	are	several	sites	in	Categories	C	and	D.		None	of	the	lands	are	in	Categories	D	and	E.		
Geology	
The	 San	 Joaquin	 Valley	 is	 a	 geologic	 structural	 trough	 with	 its	 axis	 oriented	 northwest	 and	
southwest.	 The	 valley	 is	 bounded	 to	 the	 east	 by	 the	 granitic	 and	 metamorphic	 rocks	 of	 the	
Sierra	 Nevada,	 and	 to	 the	 west	 by	 the	 folded	 and	 faulted	 sedimentary,	 volcanic,	 and	
metamorphic	 rocks	 of	 the	 Coast	 Ranges.	 The	 crystalline	 rocks	 of	 the	 Sierra	 Nevada	 extend	
westward	 beneath	 the	 valley.	 These	 rocks	 are	 overlain	 by	 a	 westward-thickening	 wedge	 of	
marine	 and	 continental	 deposits	 about	 10,000	 feet	 thick	 in	 the	 Escalon	 area.	 The	 marine	
deposits	 are	 siltstone,	 shale,	 and	 sandstones.	 The	 thicker	 continental	 sediments	 overlie	 the	
marine	 deposits.	 These	 consist	 of	 unconsolidated	 alluvium,	 lacustrine,	 and	 flood	 plain	
sediments	derived	from	the	Sierra	Nevada.	
Faults.	 Earthquakes	 originate	 as	 movement	 or	 slippage	 occurring	 along	 an	 active	 fault.	 These	
movements	generate	shock	waves	that	result	in	ground	shaking.	Structures	of	all	types,	if	not	
designed	 or	 constructed	 to	 withstand	 ground	 shaking,	 may	 suffer	 severe	 damage	 or	 collapse.	
Faults	 located	 within	 San	 Joaquin	 County	 include	 the	 Tracy-Stockton	 Fault,	 the	 Black	 Butte	
Fault,	the	Tesla	Fault,	the	Patterson	Pass	Fault,	and	the	Midland	Fault.		
The	 Tracy-Stockton	 Fault	 passes	 near	 Tracy	 to	 directly	 beneath	 (and	 beyond)	 Stockton	 in	 a	
northeasterly	direction.	Subsurface	data	indicates	that	no	appreciable	movement	has	occurred	
on	this	fault	since	Mid-Pliocene	time,	perhaps	five	million	years	ago	or	more,	however,	there	is	
a	 serious	 question	 as	 to	 the	 inactivity	 of	 this	 fault	 since	 three	 known	 epicenters	 have	 been	
located	near	this	fault	in	the	central	part	of	San	Joaquin	County.		
The	 Black	 Butte	 and	 the	 Tesla	 Faults	 are	 located	 in	 the	 extreme	 southwest	 corner	 of	 San	
Joaquin	County.	There	is	no	recorded	evidence	of	any	activity	on	either	of	these	faults.		
The	 Patterson	 Pass	 Fault	 extends	 northwest	 from	 the	 San	 Joaquin-Alameda	 County	 boundary	
toward	Livermore.	It	seems	unlikely	that	this	small	fault	presents	a	significant	seismic	threat	to	
San	Joaquin	County	in	comparison	with	the	San	Andreas	system.		
Housing	Element	                                    	                                                     4-14	

	
The	 Midland	 Fault	 crosses	 a	 small	 portion	 of	 the	 northwest	 part	 of	 the	 County.	 This	 fault	 is	
relatively	inactive	and	the	effects	of	earthquakes	on	the	San	Andreas,	Calaveras,	Hayward,	or	
Tracy-Stockton	Faults	are	considered	far	more	significant.		
According	to	the	California	Division	of	Mines	and	Geology	Bulletin	198,	“Urban	Geology	Master	
Plan	 for	 California,”	 the	 Escalon	 area	 is	 shown	 to	 be	 in	 a	 low	 severity	 zone	 with	 a	 probable	
maximum	intensity	of	VI	or	VII	on	the	Modified	Mercalli	Scale	of	1931.		
Building	Safety.	New	buildings	in	Escalon	are	constructed	to	prevent	loss	of	life	as	a	result	of	an	
earthquake.	 Older	 buildings,	 however,	 especially	 un-reinforced	 masonry	 buildings	 could	
collapse	causing	injury	and	loss	of	life.	In	order	to	eliminate	these	problems,	reconstruction	is	
necessary	to	at	least	provide	for	the	adequacy	of:	(a)	un-reinforced	masonry	bearing	walls,	(b)	
the	 anchorage	 of	 exterior	 parapets	 and	 ornamentation,	 (c)	 the	 anchorage	 of	 un-reinforced	
bearing	walls	to	the	floors	and	roof,	(d)	floor	and	roof	diaphragms,	and	(e)	the	development	of	
a	complete	bracing	system	to	resist	horizontal	wind	and	earthquake	forces.	The	City	does	not	
currently	have	a	requirement	to	retrofit	older	buildings.		
Flooding	
Flood	 prone	 areas	 are	 restricted	 to	 the	 failure	 of	 the	 New	 Melones	 Dam,	 localized	 ponding	
during	 intense	 rainstorms	 and	 dam	 failure	 on	 the	 upper	 reaches	 of	 rivers	 that	 traverse	 the	
County.		
Dam	Failure.	There	are	a	number	of	dams	on	upper	reaches	of	rivers	that	traverse	the	County	
that	could	produce	flooding	should	they	fail.	There	are	requirements	that	the	owners	of	dams	
prepare	maps	showing	areas	that	would	be	flooded	should	a	dam	fail.	Dam	failure	inundation	
maps	are	available	for	the	dams	on	the	Stanislaus	River.	These	maps	indicate	that	the	City	of	
Escalon	will	flood	if	the	dam	fails.	For	planning	purposes,	the	U.S.	Army	Corps	of	Engineers	has	
estimated	that	it	would	take	about	three	hours	for	the	water	to	reach	Escalon.	The	San	Joaquin	
County	Office	of	Emergency	Services	has	prepared	a	County	and	Cities	Dam	Failure	Evacuation	
Plan,	June	1992,	and	a	Flood	Evacuation	Plan,	June	1995.	
Storm	 Water.	 Flood	 zone	 mapping	 prepared	 by	 the	 Federal	 Emergency	 Management	 Agency	
(FEMA)	indicates	that	there	are	no	areas	in	and	around	Escalon	that	are	in	the	100-year	or	500-
year	flood	zones.	Because	of	the	comparative	isolation	of	the	community	from	major	streams	
and	 rivers	 (Stanislaus	 River),	 the	 City	 of	 Escalon	 is	 not	 subject	 to	 flooding	 by	 such	 sources.	
Studies	 conducted	 by	 the	 FEMA	 in	 the	 community	 have	 determined	 that	 rainfall	 related	
ponding	and	consequent	flood	hazard	potential	represent	minimal	risk	to	Escalon.	The	City	has	
prepared	 a	 Master	 Storm	 Drain	 Plan	 that	 addresses	 storm	 drainage	 collection,	
detention/retention,	and	pumping	to	minimize	any	impacts	associated	with	storm	events.		
Summary.	 	 While	 the	 above-described	 constraints	 are	 typical	 of	 development	 in	 Escalon	 and	
the	region,	none	of	the	available	sites	for	housing	described	in	this	section	are	anticipated	to	be	
subject	 to	 environmental	 constraints	 that	 would	 impede	 the	 development	 of	 the	 property	 at	
the	allowed	zoning.		None	of	the	sites	in	the	City	are	zoned	for	agricultural	use.		The	SJMSCP	
provides	project	applicants	for	a	streamlined,	efficient	method	of	mitigating	potential	impacts	
to	 special-status	 species,	 consistent	 with	 the	 requirements	 of	 state	 law.	 	 Development

consistent	with	the	City’s	Building	Code	and	adopted	Storm	Drainage	Master	Plan	will	minimize	
risks	 associated	 with	 geological	 and	 flooding	 hazards	 and	 allow	 development	 of	 property	
consistent	 with	 uses	 and	 densities	 allowed	 in	 the	 Zoning	 Code.	 	 No	 additional	 programs	 are	
necessary	to	address	environmental	constraints.

CHAPTER	FIVE	–	CONSTRAINTS	TO	HOUSING	AND	HOUSING	RESOURCES	
New	housing	development	can	be	affected	by	economic	forces	in	the	private	market	as	well	as	
regulations	and	policies	imposed	by	public	agencies.	These	constraints	can	limit	the	production	
of	housing	and	increase	its	cost,	and	can	also	affect	the	maintenance	and/or	improvement	of	
existing	housing.	Governmental	and	non-governmental	constraints	that	can	affect	the	housing	
market	 and	 stock	 in	 Escalon	 are	 discussed	 below.	 The	 Housing	 Program	 will	 identify	 ways,	
where	 feasible,	 to	 reduce	 or	 overcome	 constraints	 to	 the	 maintenance,	 improvement,	 and	
development	of	housing	for	all	income	levels.		
GOVERNMENTAL	CONSTRAINTS	
Governmental	regulations,	while	intentionally	regulating	the	quality	and	safety	of	development	
in	the	community	can	also,	unintentionally,	increase	the	cost	of	development	and	thus	the	cost	
of	 housing.	 These	 governmental	 constraints	 include	 land	 use	 controls,	 such	 as	 policies,	
standards,	codes,	requirements,	development	fees,	processing	procedures,	and	other	exactions	
required	of	developers.	
Land	use	controls	may	limit	the	amount	or	density	of	development,	thus	increasing	the	cost	per	
unit.	They	may	also	require	improvements	and/or	off-site	mitigation	that	increase	the	cost	of	
development.	 Processing	 procedures,	 including	 review	 by	 multiple	 agencies	 and	 permitting	
requirements,	may	delay	the	approval	process	and	increase	the	cost	of	development.	
FEDERAL	AND	STATE	
Federal	 and	 state	 programs	 and	 agencies	 play	 a	 role	 in	 the	 imposition	 of	 non-local	
governmental	constraints.	Federal	and	state	requirements	are	generally	beyond	the	influence	
of	local	government,	and	therefore	cannot	be	effectively	addressed	in	this	document.	
California	Environmental	Quality	Act	
The	 California	 Environmental	 Quality	 Act	 (CEQA)	 was	 developed	 to	 protect	 the	 quality	 of	 the	
environment	 and	 the	 health	 and	 safety	 of	 persons	 from	 environmental	 effects.	 Discretionary	
projects	are	required	to	be	reviewed	consistent	with	the	requirements	of	CEQA	to	determine	if	
there	 is	 potential	 for	 the	 project	 to	 cause	 a	 significant	 adverse	 effect	 on	 the	 environment.	
Depending	 on	 the	 type	 of	 project	 and	 its	 potential	 effects,	 technical	 traffic,	 noise,	 air	 quality,	
biological	resources,	and	geotechnical	reports	may	be	needed.	If	potential	adverse	effects	can	
be	mitigated,	a	mitigated	negative	declaration	is	required.	If	potentially	adverse	effects	cannot	
be	 mitigated,	 an	 environmental	 impact	 report	 is	 required.	 These	 documents	 have	 mandated	
content	requirements	and	public	review	times.	Preparation	of	CEQA	documents	can	be	costly	
and,	 despite	 maximum	 time	 limits	 set	 forth	 in	 the	 Public	 Resources	 Code,	 can	 extend	 the	
processing	time	of	a	project	by	a	year	or	longer.	
Water,	Wastewater,	and	Stormwater	Standards	
The	 State	 establishes	 water	 quality	 requirements	 and	 standards	 that	 affect	 the	 City’s	 water	
system,	 wastewater	 system,	 and	 stormwater	 system.	 Drinking	 water	 standards	 (Maximum	
Contaminant	 Levels)	 established	 by	 Title	 24	 of	 the	 California	 Code	 of	 Regulations	 require	 the	
City	 to	 test	 and	 treat	 the	 City’s	 municipal	 water	 supply	 to	 ensure	 safe	 drinking	 water.		
Housing	Element	                                  	                                                         5-1	

	
Wastewater	 standards	 enforced	 by	 the	 Central	 Valley	 Regional	 Water	 Quality	 Control	 Board	
through	discharge	permits	require	the	City	to	test	and	treat	wastewater	to	ensure	that	effluent	
meets	 health	 standards.	 	 Municipal	 stormwater	 discharge	 standards	 require	 the	 City	 to	 meet	
stormwater	 quality	 standards	 through	 the	 Phase	 II	 Municipal	 Separate	 Storm	 Water	 Sewer	
(MS4)	permit	program.				These	State	requirements	and	standards	increase	the	cost	of	providing	
water,	sewer,	and	stormwater	services	to	the	City.		These	fees	affect	the	cost	of	development	
and	housing	as	the	City’s	cost	to	plan	for	and	provide	services	is	reflected	in	the	development	
impact	fees	paid	by	new	construction	projects	and	the	City’s	cost	to	provide	on-going	services	is	
reflected	in	the	service	fees	paid	by	residents,	businesses,	and	property	owners.			
Prevailing	Wage	Laws	
Public	 works	 projects	 and	 affordable	 housing	 financed	 through	 the	 use	 of	 public	 funds	 are	
required	to	pay	prevailing	wages,	which	create	a	significant	cost	impact	on	the	construction	or	
rehabilitation	 of	 affordable	 housing	 units	 for	 low	 or	 moderate-income	 persons	 and	 the	
infrastructure	 to	 support	 such	 housing.	 The	 rehabilitation	 of	 certain	 qualifying	 affordable	
housing	units	for	low	or	moderate-income	persons	is	exempted	from	this	requirement.	SB	972	
provided	 for	 exemptions	 from	 prevailing	 wage	 requirements	 for	 the	 construction	 or	
rehabilitation	of	privately	owned	residential	projects.	
LOCAL	
Land	use	controls	are	minimum	standards	included	within	the	General	Plan,	and	implemented	
through	 the	 Zoning	 and	 Subdivision	 Ordinances.	 General	 Plan	 land	 use	 designations	 are	 a	
means	of	ensuring	that	the	land	uses	in	the	community	are	properly	situated	in	relation	to	one	
another	 and	 providing	 adequate	 space	 for	 each	 type	 of	 development.	 Zoning	 regulations	 are	
designed	 to	 implement	 the	 intentions	 of	 the	 General	 Plan	 land	 use	 designations.	 They	 also	
control	 such	 features	 as	 height	 and	 bulk	 of	 buildings,	 lot	 area,	 yard	 setbacks,	 population	
density,	the	building	use,	etc.	If	zoning	standards	are	significantly	more	rigid	than	private	sector	
design	standards	and	do	not	allow	sufficient	land	use	flexibility,	then	development	costs	could	
increase	and	housing	production	may	decrease.	
Escalon	General	Plan	
The	Escalon	General	Plan	provides	a	range	of	residential	building	types	and	densities	in	various	
areas	of	Escalon.	Densities	range	from	a	low	of	2	units	per	acre	in	the	Estate-Residential	areas	
to	 29	 units	 per	 acre	 in	 High-Density	 Residential	 areas.	 Below	 is	 a	 brief	 description	 of	 each	
General	Plan	residential	land	use	district.	
Residential	Development	
Estate	Residential.	Estate	Residential	areas	provide	opportunities	for	residential	dwellings	in	a	
semi-rural	 setting,	 or	 in	 conjunction	 with	 small-scale	 farming	 and	 animal	 husbandry.	 Estate	
Residential	densities	are	two	dwelling	units	per	acre	(6	persons	per	acre).		
Low	 Density	 Residential.	 Low	 Density	 Residential	 areas	 provide	 opportunities	 for	 residential	
dwellings	at	a	density	of	2	to	10	dwelling	units	per	acre	(up	to	21	persons	per	acre).	Duplex	and	
halfplex	units	are	encouraged	to	increase	overall	densities	when	they	are	compatible	with	the	
Housing	Element	                                 	                                                      5-2	

	
development.	 Developments	 in	 excess	 of	 7	 units	 per	 acre	 require	 a	 Planned	 Development	
review	process.	
Medium	 Density	 Residential.	 Medium	 Density	 Residential	 areas	 provide	 opportunities	 for	
residential	dwellings	at	a	density	of	10	to	15	dwelling	units	per	acre	(up	to	40	persons	per	acre).	
Duplex,	 triplex	 and	 four-plex	 units	 are	 encouraged	 for	 inﬁll	 or	 new	 developments	 located	 at	
collector	roadway	intersections.	Sites	that	are	3.5	to	5	acres	are	allowed	up	to	50	units	in	one	
contiguous	development	and	sites	with	less	than	3.5	acres	may	be	considered	when	they	are	
located	at	arterial/collector	roadway	intersections.	This	use	may	be	permitted	on	corner	lots	in	
single-family	 zones	 where	 they	 conform	 to	 the	 General	 Plan	 policies	 for	 Medium	 Density	
Residential.	 This	 use	 may	 also	 be	 permitted	 in	 inﬁll	 areas	 through	 a	 Planned	 Development	
review	process.	
High	 Density	 Residential.	 High	 Density	 Residential	 areas	 provide	 opportunities	 for	 residential	
dwellings	at	a	density	of	15	to	29	dwelling	units	per	acre	(up	to	58	persons	per	acre).	This	use	is	
allowed	throughout	the	city	at	arterial	and	collector	roadways.	Sites	that	are	3.5	to	5	acres	at	
arterial	 intersections	 allow	 up	 to	 100	 units.	 Sites	 that	 are	 2	 to	 5	 acres	 at	 arterial/collector	
intersections	 allow	 up	 to	 75	 units.	 Sites	 that	 are	 1	 to	 3	 acres	 at	 mid-block	 arterial	 roadways	
allow	up	to	50-units.	This	use	is	also	allowed	on	downtown	infill	sites.		
General	Plan	Policies	
In	 accordance	 with	 the	 Government	 Code	 and	 various	 environmental	 laws,	 the	 General	 Plan	
sets	 forth	 policies	 related	 to	 Open	 Space,	 Conservation,	 Economic	 Development,	 Air	 Quality,	
Land	Use,	Public	Services	and	Facilities,	and	Urban	Growth.	These	policies	seek	to	protect	and	
preserve	 important	 values	 of	 the	 community,	 but	 some	 tend	 to	 conflict	 with	 the	 ability	 to	
develop	 certain	 land	 for	 housing.	 Such	 conflicts	 can	 be	 considered	 a	 constraint.	 The	 General	
Plan	policies	that	could	serve	as	a	constraint	to	housing	development	are	presented	below.	
Open	Space,	Conservation,	and	Recreation	Element:	There	are	policy	provisions	in	the	General	
Plan	 that	 seek	 to	 protect	 and	 enhance	 open	 space,	 natural	 resources,	 and	 recreational	
resources	to	ensure	a	high	quality	living	environment	in	Escalon.	Open	Space	Policy	1	through	4,	
for	 instance,	 require	 the	 City	 to	 create	 and	 protect	 open	 space	 and	 agricultural	 land	 for	 the	
preservation	 of	 natural	 resources,	 outdoor	 recreation,	 and	 agricultural	 production.	 Natural	
Resources	Policy	2	prohibits	urban	level	development	in	the	City	unless	the	development	is,	or	
can	 be	 served	 by	 the	 City	 sewer	 system.	 To	 maximize	 farmland,	 open	 space,	 and	 wildlife	
habitat,	Natural	Resource	Policy	8	establishes	a	greenbelt	on	all	lands	that	are	not	designated	
for	future	annexation	on	the	General	Plan	Land	Use	diagram.	
Economic	 Development	 Element.	 There	 are	 policy	 provisions	 in	 the	 General	 Plan	 that	 seek	 to	
maintain	 a	 balance	 of	 jobs	 to	 housing	 within	 the	 city.	 Commercial,	 Industrial	 and	 Residential	
Balance	Policy	2	and	3	requires	between	four	and	nine	acres	of	residential	land	for	each	acre	of	
commercial	and	industrial	space.		
Air	Quality	Element.	The	General	Plan	includes	policies	that	are	designed	to	mitigate	or	improve	
air	 quality	 within	 the	 region.	 Air	 Quality	 Policies	 1	 and	 2	 promotes	 the	 air	 quality	 mitigation	
Housing	Element	                                    	                                                      5-3	

	
measures	 such	 as	 EPA-certified	 wood	 stoves,	 energy	 efficient	 designs,	 and	 project	 review	
procedures	based	on	regional	air	plans.		
Land	 Use	 Element.	 The	 City	 has	 adopted	 a	 Growth	 Management	 Ordinance	 that	 limits	 the	
yearly	 number	 of	 residential	 building	 permits	 within	 the	 City.	 Residential	 Land	 Use	 Policy	 20	
reinforces	 the	 requirement	 that	 future	 growth	 in	 the	 city	 shall	 conform	 to	 the	 Growth	
Management	Ordinance.	
Public	Services	and	Facilities	Element.	The	General	Plan	includes	policy	provisions	to	ensure	that	
sufficient	 levels	 of	 public	 services	 are	 provided	 for	 existing	 and	 future	 development.	 Public	
Facility	 Improvement	 Policy	 13	 requires	 new	 development	 to	 demonstrate	 that	 adequate	
sewerage	capacity	and	sewage	treatment	capacity	exist	prior	to	development	or	that	conditions	
of	project	approval	will	ensure	adequate	capacity	will	be	created	as	part	of	the	project	prior	to	
the	 issuance	 of	 building	 permits.	 Public	 Facility	 Improvement	 Policies	 14	 and	 17	 require	 the	
installation	of	new	water	wells	for	new	development,	and	connection	of	all	existing	and	future	
uses	to	the	City’s	water	system.		
Urban	 Growth	 Boundary	 Element.	 There	 are	 policy	 provisions	 in	 the	 General	 Plan	 that	 define	
the	limits	for	extending	City	services	and	infrastructure	for	planned	growth.	Urban	Boundaries	
Policy	4	prohibits	the	premature	conversion	of	agricultural	lands	where	agricultural	preserves	
are	 present.	 Urban	 Boundaries	 Policy	 6	 discourages	 new	 or	 expanded	 urban	 development	
outside	of	the	city’s	Urban	Growth	Boundaries.	
Summary.	The	General	Plan	sets	forth	policies	related	to	Open	Space,	Conservation,	Economic	
Development,	 Air	 Quality,	 Land	 Use,	 Public	 Services	 and	 Facilities,	 and	 Urban	 Growth	 in	
accordance	 with	 the	 Government	 Code	 and	 various	 environmental	 laws.	 While	 these	 policies	
can	 be	 viewed	 as	 a	 constraint	 to	 housing	 development,	 they	 seek	 to	 protect	 and	 preserve	
important	values	of	the	community,	and	are	necessary	to	maintain	the	quality	of	life	within	the	
City	of	Escalon.	
Zoning	Code	
The	 Zoning	 Code	 identifies	 four	 residential	 zones,	 and	 five	 non-residential	 zones	 that	 allow	
residential	development.	Table	5-1	summarizes	the	uses	allowed	under	each	zone	and	Table	5-
2	 provides	 the	 development	 standards	 for	 each	 zone.	 All	 residential	 projects	 over	 one	 acre,	
except	 in	 the	 downtown	 area,	 are	 required	 to	 have	 a	 Planned	 Development	 (PD)	
overlay/combining	district	designation.	
Residential	Zones	
Estate	–	Residential	District	(R-E).	The	R-E	zoning	district	provides	very	low	density	residential	
areas	 for	 single-family	 development	 where	 lot	 sizes	 and	 densities	 are	 designed	 to	
accommodate	large	areas	of	open	space	for	recreational	activities	compatible	with	a	more	rural	
residential	environment.		While	the	Zoning	Ordinance	provided	for	this	district,	there	is	no	land	
in	the	City	zoned	R-E.	
Low	 Density	 Residential	 District	 (R-1).	 The	 R-1	 zoning	 district	 provides	 low	 density	 residential	
areas	 for	 single-family	 development	 where	 lot	 sizes	 and	 densities	 are	 designed	 to	
Housing	Element	                                  	                                                     5-4	

	
accommodate	large	areas	of	open	space	for	recreational	activities	compatible	with	a	residential	
environment.	
Medium	 Density	 Residential	 District	 (R-2).	 The	 R-2	 zoning	 district	 provides	 medium	 density	
residential	areas	for	single-family,	two-family,	and	multiple-family	dwelling	units.		
Multi-Family	Residential	District	(R-3).	The	R-3	zoning	district	provides	higher	density	residential	
areas	for	multiple-family	residential	dwelling	units.		
Other	Zones	that	Allow	Residential	
Neighborhood	 Commercial	 District	 (C-1).	 The	 C-1	 zoning	 district	 provides	 small-scale	
commercial	centers	in	which	certain	convenience	goods	and	related	services	typically	used	on	a	
daily	basis	are	made	available	within	walking	distance	of	residential	neighborhoods.	The	zoning	
code	 also	 includes	 provisions	 for	 single	 family	 residential,	 two	 family	 residential,	 residential	
condominiums,	multi-family,	and	convalescent	homes	within	this	zone.		
Community	 Commercial	 District	 (C-2).	 The	 C-2	 zoning	 district	 is	 intended	 to	 encourage	 the	
continuance	of	a	viable	and	predominantly	pedestrian-oriented	central	business	district	for	the	
city.	 The	 zone	 allows	 a	 wide	 variety	 of	 retail,	 service,	 entertainment	 and	 administrative	
activities	which	are	necessary	to	serve	a	larger	trading	area	than	the	city	itself.	The	zoning	code	
also	 includes	 provisions	 for	 single	 family	 residential,	 two	 family	 residential,	 residential	
condominiums,	 multi-family,	 convalescent	 homes,	 large	 residential	 care	 facilities,	 and	 small	
residential	care	facilities	within	this	zone.	
Commercial-Industrial	 District	 (C-M).	 The	 C-M	 zoning	 district	 provides	 areas	 that	 can	
accommodate	high	intensity	commercial	and	light	industrial	uses	that	would	not	be	suitable	for	
neighborhood	 or	 downtown	 locations,	 but	 that	 provide	 both	 commercial	 and	 very	 light	
industrial	 services.	 The	 zoning	 code	 also	 includes	 provisions	 for	 single	 family	 residential,	 two	
family	 residential,	 residential	 condominiums,	 multi-family,	 convalescent	 homes,	 large	
residential	 care	 facilities,	 small	 residential	 care	 facilities,	 and	 emergency	 shelters	 within	 this	
zone.	
Limited	 Manufacturing	 District	 (M-1).	 The	 M-1	 zoning	 district	 provides	 for	 small	 scale	 light	
industrial,	repair	and	service-oriented	activities	that	provide	services	primarily	to	city	residents.	
The	 zoning	 code	 also	 includes	 provisions	 for	 convalescent	 homes,	 large	 residential	 care	
facilities,	and	small	residential	care	facilities	within	this	zone.	
General	 Manufacturing	 District	 (M-2).	 The	 M-2	 zoning	 district	 provides	 larger	 sites	 for	 large	
scale	light	and	heavy	industrial	uses.	The	zoning	code	also	includes	provisions	for	convalescent	
homes	and	large	residential	care	facilities	within	this	zone.	
Zoning	Definitions	
The	Zoning	Code	provides	the	following	definitions	relative	to	residential	uses:		
    •    Condominium	 development	 means	 a	 structure	 or	 an	 appurtenant	 premise	 divided	 in	
         ownership	by	the	existence	of	condominiums	and	includes	instances	where	ownership	is	
         divided	following	prior	single	ownership	of	the	entire	structure	and	premises.	
Housing	Element	                                    	                                                     5-5	

	
    •   Residential	care	facility,	large	means	any	use	of	a	residential	unit	serving	seven	or	more	
        persons	on	a	24-hour	per	day	basis.

        persons	on	a	24-hour-per-day	basis.	
    •   Residential,	 manufactured	 structure	 means	 a	 residential	 unit	 constructed	 off-site	 and	
        delivered	and	installed	on	a	lot.	State	law	mandates	that	cities	allow	the	installation	of	
        manufactured	homes	certified	under	the	National	Manufactured	Housing	Construction	
        and	Safety	Standards	Act	of	1974	on	a	foundation	system	on	lots	zoned	for	conventional	
        single-family	residential	dwellings.	
    •   Residential,	 mobile	 home	 means	 a	 trailer	 coach	 that	 is	 used	 as	 a	 dwelling	 all	 the	 year	
        round,	has	water	faucets	and	shower	or	other	bathing	facilities	that	may	be	connected	
        to	a	water	distribution	system,	and	has	facilities	for	washing	and	a	water	closet	or	other	
        similar	facility	that	may	be	connected	to	a	sewerage	system.

        attached	residential	units.	
    •   Residential	 secondary	 dwelling	 unit	 means	 an	 additional	 separate	 living	 unit	 with	
        kitchen	and	full	bathroom	facilities,	whether	within	the	main	structure	or	as	a	separate

        independent	and	attached	residential	units.	
    •   Residential,	single-family	detached	means	a	detached	residential	unit.	
Zoning	for	a	Variety	of	Housing	Types	
The	 City’s	 Zoning	 Code	 accommodates	 a	 variety	 of	 housing	 types	 and	 does	 not	 constrain	
occupancy	 of	 housing	 units.	 	 The	 Zoning	 Code	 defines	 a	 “family”	 as	 one	 or	 more	 persons	
occupying	 a	 premises	 and	 living	 as	 a	 single	 housekeeping	 unit,	 as	 distinguished	 from	 a	 group	
occupying	 a	 hotel,	 club,	 fraternity	 or	 sorority	 house.	 	 This	 definition	 is	 consistent	 with	 fair	
housing	practices	and	is	not	a	constraint.	
Manufactured	Homes	
A	residential,	manufactured	structure	is	a	home	that	is	constructed	off-site	and	delivered	and	
installed	on	a	lot.	State	law,	Government	Code	Section	65852.3,	mandates	that	cities	allow	the	
installation	 of	 manufactured	 homes	 subject	 to	 the	 same	 development	 standards	 as	 a	 single	
family	 dwelling	 on	 the	 same	 lot	 as	 long	 as	 they	 are	 on	 a	 foundation	 and	 certified	 under	 the	
National	Manufactured	Housing	Construction	and	Safety	Standards	Act	of	1974.		Under	this	law,	
a	 mobile	 home	 that	 meets	 the	 National	 Manufactured	 Housing	 Construction	 and	 Safety	
Standards	Act	of	1974	would	be	required	to	permitted	in	the	same	manner	as	a	manufactured	
home.	 	 The	 City’s	 Zoning	 Code	 defines	 manufactured	 homes	 as	 including	 mobile	 homes.	 The	
Housing	Element	                                  	                                                         5-6	

	
Zoning	Code	is	consistent	with	the	State	Law,	and	allows	manufactured	homes	within	each	of	
the	residential	zoning	districts.		
Secondary	Units	
Government	Code	Section	65852.2	allows	jurisdictions	to	have	an	ordinance	in	place	to	approve	
secondary	 units;	 if	 a	 jurisdiction	 does	 not	 have	 an	 ordinance	 addressing	 second	 units,	 the	
Government	Code	requires	jurisdictions	to	approve	second	units	under	standards	established	at	
Government	 Code	 Section	 65852.2(b).	 The	 Zoning	 Code	 allows	 construction	 of	 a	 secondary	
residential	dwelling	unit	by	right	in	all	residential	zones	subject	to	the	requirements	of	Section	
17.41.040,	which	include:	
    §   The	lot	is	a	legal	lot	as	defined	by	EMC	Title	16,	Subdivisions.	
    §   The	lot	is	located	in	a	residential	district.	
    §   The	 lot	 contains	 only	 one	 existing,	 legal	 single-family	 dwelling,	 except	 when	 main	 and	
        secondary	dwelling	unit	are	being	constructed	concurrently.	
    §   The	 applicant	 for	 the	 building	 permit	 shall	 be	 the	 owner-occupant	 of	 the	 existing	
        dwelling.	
    §   The	secondary	dwelling	unit	shall	conform	to	all	height,	setback,	lot	coverage,	and	other	
        zoning	 requirements	 applicable	 to	 a	 primary	 main	 dwelling	 in	 the	 zone	 in	 which	 the	
        property	is	located,	except:	
            o At	least	one	covered	off-street	parking	space	shall	be	provided	for	a	secondary	
                 dwelling	unit	in	addition	to	the	required	spaces	for	the	main	dwelling;	and	
            o A	detached	secondary	dwelling	unit	shall	be	limited	to	one	story	and	a	maximum	
                 of	15	feet	in	height.	If	the	secondary	dwelling	unit	is	located	above	a	garage,	the	
                 height	 of	 the	 secondary	 dwelling	 unit	 shall	 be	 measured	 from	 the	 floor	 of	 the	
                 secondary	dwelling	unit.	
    §   The	exterior	of	the	unit	shall	be	similar	in	appearance	and	use	of	materials	to	that	of	the	
        primary	residence.	
    §   The	unit	shall	have	its	own	separate	entrance.	
    §   Secondary	dwelling	units	may	be	separately	metered	and	shall	include	separate	shutoffs	
        for	all	utilities.	
    §   The	following	additional	requirements	shall	apply	to	all	secondary	dwelling	units:	
            o The	 minimum	 lot	 size	 for	 attached	 secondary	 dwelling	 units	 shall	 be	 6,000	
                 square	feet.	
            o If	attached	to	the	existing	dwelling,	attachment	shall	be	made	as	required	by	the	
                 building	official.	
Housing	Element	                                   	                                                    5-7	

	
              o The	total	living	area	of	the	secondary	dwelling	unit	shall	not	exceed	30	percent	
                  of	the	existing	residence,	but	in	no	case	shall	exceed	1,200	square	feet.	
              o A	secondary	dwelling	unit	located	above	a	garage	shall	provide	a	direct	outside	
                  entrance	that	does	not	connect	through	the	garage.	
              o No	structure	containing	dwelling	units	located	within	50	feet	of	a	public	road	or	
                  street	shall	be	located	on	a	parcel	so	that	the	rear	of	the	building	faces	the	public	
                  road	or	street.	
      §  Only	one	secondary	dwelling	unit	is	allowed	on	any	lot.	
      §  Occupancy	is	limited	to	two	persons	for	a	studio	or	one-bedroom	unit	and	three	persons	
         for	a	two-bedroom	unit.	
	The	City’s	secondary	unit	standards	are	consistent	with	the	requirements	of	the	state	law,	do	
not	 constrain	 the	 development	 of	 second	 units,	 and	 provide	 clear	 standards	 for	 the	
establishment	of	second	units.	
Facilities	for	Disabled	Households	
A	large	residential	care	facility	is	any	use	of	a	residential	unit	serving	seven	or	more	persons	on	
a	24-hour	per	day	basis.	A	small	residential	care	facility	is	any	use	of	a	residential	unit	serving	six	
or	fewer	persons	on	a	24-hour-per-day	basis.	The	Zoning	Code	defines	a	small	residential	care	
facility	as	a	single	family	home	and	allows	small	residential	care	facilities	as	a	permitted	use	in	
all	 residential	 zones	 and	 subject	 to	 the	 same	 requirements	 as	 a	 single	 family	 dwelling	 in	 all	
other	zones.		The	Zoning	Code	allows	large	residential	care	facilities	within	the	R-3	zone	by	right	
and	 in	 all	 other	 residential	 zones	 with	 a	 conditional	 use	 permit.	 The	 C-2,	 C-M,	 M-1,	 and	 M-2	
zoning	districts	also	allow	the	large	residential	care	facilities	with	a	conditional	use	permit.

Health	 and	 Safety	 Code	 Sections	 1267.8,	 1566.3,	 1568.08	 require	 local	 governments	 to	 treat	
licensed	 group	 homes	 and	 residential	 care	 facilities	 with	 six	 or	 fewer	 residents	 no	 differently	
than	 other	 by-right	 single-family	 housing	 uses.	 “Six	 or	 fewer	 persons”	 does	 not	 include	 the	
operator,	the	operator’s	family	or	persons	employed	as	staff.	Local	agencies	must	allow	these	
licensed	 residential	 care	 facilities	 in	 any	 area	 zoned	 for	 residential	 use,	 and	 may	 not	 require	
licensed	residential	care	facilities	for	six	or	less	to	obtain	conditional	use	permits	or	variances	
that	are	not	required	of	other	family	dwellings.	
Following	adoption	of	the	2010	Housing	Element,	the	City	updated	the	Zoning	Code	to	define	
small	residential	care	facilities	consistent	with	State	law	and	to	revise	the	Zoning	Code	to	treat	a	
small	residential	care	facility	as	a	single	family	home.		As	described	in	the	Housing	Plan,	minor	
changes	 to	 the	 Zoning	 Code	 are	 being	 processed	 concurrent	 with	 this	 Housing	 Element	 to	
update	the	list	of	permitted	uses	to	be	consistent	with	the	definition	of	small	residential	care	
facilities	which	requires	such	facilities	to	be	treated	as	a	single	family	home.	The	City	does	not	
have	 minimum	 distance	 or	 concentration	 requirements	 for	 residential	 care	 facilities	 or	 group	
homes.	
Parking	standards	for	housing	for	disabled	persons	are	the	same	as	all	residential	development	
and	 do	 not	 pose	 a	 constraint	 on	 development	 of	 housing	 for	 disabled	 persons.	 	 The	 Zoning	
Code	 also	 includes	 provisions	 to	 modify	 the	 required	 number	 of	 off-street	 spaces	 for	 certain	
uses,	 including	 housing	 for	 persons	 with	 disabilities	 where	 it	 can	 be	 demonstrated	 that	
automobile	use	or	ownership	is	significantly	lower	than	for	other	dwellings	or	lodging	houses.	
This	parking	reduction	provision	is	consistent	with	State	law.	
Second	dwellings,	which	could	house	on-site	caretakers	assisting	disabled	persons,	are	allowed	
within	all	residential	zones.	This	is	consistent	with	state	law.		
Health	 and	 Safety	 Code	 Section	 17959	 requires	 a	 builder	 of	 new	 for-sale	 residential	 units	 to	
provide	potential	buyers	with	a	list	of	specific	“universal	design	features”	which	make	a	home	
safer	 and	 easier	 to	 use	 for	 persons	 who	 are	 aging	 or	 frail,	 or	 who	 have	 certain	 temporary	 or	
permanent	 activity	 limitations	 or	 disabilities.	 Escalon	 follows	 the	 requirements	 of	 the	
Americans	with	Disabilities	Act	(ADA)	in	regard	to	the	development	of	accessible	housing.		The	
Housing	 Plan	 includes	 measures	 to	 regularly	 review	 the	 City’s	 codes	 and	 practices	 to	 identify	
and	 remove	 constraints,	 as	 well	 as	 to	 provide	 incentives	 to	 encourage	 housing	 for	 disabled	
persons.		
Housing	for	Agricultural	Workers	
There	is	no	zoning	for	agricultural	uses	within	the	City.		Farmworker	housing	can	be	provided	
through	accessory	residential	uses,	which	are	permitted	by	right	in	all	residential	zones,	multi-
family	development,	which	is	permitted	by	right	in	the	R-3	zone	and	conditionally	permitted	in	
commercial	 zones	 subject	 to	 R-3	 standards,	 and	 boardinghouses,	 which	 are	 conditionally	
permitted	 in	 R-3,	 C-1,	 and	 C-2	 zones.	 	 Currently,	 farmworker	 housing	 needs	 are	 met	 through	
existing	affordable	and	market	rate	units.	As	described	in	Chapter	3,	no	increase	in	demand	for	
farmworker	housing	is	anticipated	so	development	of	farmworker	housing	is	not	anticipated	to	
be	 necessary.	 	 While	 an	 increase	 in	 demand	 for	 farmworker	 housing	 is	 not	 anticipated,	
Housing	Element	                                    	                                                    5-11	

	
farmworker	 housing	 can	 be	 developed	 within	 the	 city.	 	 Farmworker	 units,	 such	 as	 those	
assisted	 through	 the	 US	 Department	 of	 Agriculture	 Rural	 Development	 Sections	 514/516	
Program	 can	 be	 developed	 as	 a	 multifamily	 project	 on	 R-2	 or	 R-3	 land,	 or	 as	 a	 single	 family	
development	on	R-1	sites.			
In	order	to	accommodate	employee	housing	as	required	by	State	law,	the	City	is	updating	the	
Zoning	 Code	 to	 define	 ‘Employee	 Housing’	 serving	 six	 or	 fewer	 persons	 as	 an	 allowed	 use,	
subject	to	the	same	requirements	as	a	single	family	housing	unit,	as	described	in	the	Housing	
Plan.		This	will	provide	additional	opportunities	for	farmworker	housing.		
Facilities	for	Homeless	and	Households	At-Risk	of	Homelessness	
Facilities	 and	 housing	 for	 homeless	 persons	 and	 those	 at-risk	 of	 homelessness	 fall	 into	 three	
categories:	supportive	housing,	transitional	housing,	and	emergency	shelters.	
Supportive	and	Transitional	Housing.	Supportive	housing	means	housing	with	no	limit	on	length	
of	stay,	that	is	occupied	by	the	target	population,	and	that	is	linked	to	onsite	or	offsite	services	
that	assist	the	supportive	housing	resident	in	retaining	the	housing,	improving	his	or	her	health	
status,	 and	 maximizing	 his	 or	 her	 ability	 to	 live	 and,	 when	 possible,	 work	 in	 the	 community	
(Health	and	Safety	Code	Section	50675.14).	
Transitional	 housing	 and	 "transitional	 housing	 development"	 means	 buildings	 configured	 as	
rental	 housing	 developments,	 but	 operated	 under	 program	 requirements	 that	 call	 for	 the	
termination	 of	 assistance	 and	 recirculation	 of	 the	 assisted	 unit	 to	 another	 eligible	 program	
recipient	at	some	predetermined	future	point	in	time,	which	shall	be	no	less	than	six	months.	
(Health	and	Safety	Code	Section	50675.2).	
State	law	requires	the	consideration	of	both	supportive	and	transitional	housing	as	residential	
uses	that	must	only	be	subject	to	the	same	restrictions	that	apply	to	similar	housing	types	in	the	
same	zone.	Following	adoption	of	the	2010	Housing	Element,	the	Zoning	Code	was	updated	to	
define	 supportive	 housing	 and	 transitional	 housing	 and	 allow	 such	 uses	 subject	 to	 the	 same	
standards	 of	 other	 residential	 uses	 of	 the	 same	 type.	 	 This	 means	 that	 a	 single	 family	
transitional	or	supportive	housing	development	would	be	subject	to	the	same	standards	as	any	
other	 single	 family	 development	 proposed	 in	 the	 same	 zone.	 	 Similarly,	 a	 multifamily	
transitional	or	supportive	housing	development	would	be	subject	to	the	same	standards	as	any	
other	multifamily	development	proposed	in	the	same	zone.		Since	the	revisions	to	the	Zoning	
Code	to	implement	the	2010	Housing	Element,	State	law	has	changed	to	add	new	definitions	
for	supportive	housing,	transitional	housing,	supportive	services,	and	target	population	to	the	
Zoning	 Code.	 	 The	 definition	 for	 supportive	 housing	 is	 consistent	 with	 State	 law,	 but	 the	
definition	 for	 transitional	 housing	 identifies	 a	 maximum	 stay	 of	 24	 months,	 which	 is	 not	
consistent	with	State	law.		The	Housing	Plan	includes	a	program	to	update	the	Zoning	Code	to	
include	 the	 definitions	 for	 transitional	 housing,	 supportive	 services,	 and	 target	 population	
consistent	 with	 Government	 Code	 Section	 65582.	 	 This	 program	 is	 being	 implemented	
concurrently	with	this	Housing	Element	Update.	
Housing	Element	                                   	                                                    5-12	

	
Emergency	Shelters.	Every	local	agency	must	identify	a	zone	or	zones	where	emergency	shelters	
are	 allowed	 as	 a	 permitted	 use	 without	 a	 conditional	 use	 or	 other	 discretionary	 permit.	 The	
identified	 zone	 or	 zones	 must	 include	 sufficient	 capacity	 to	 accommodate	 the	 need	 for	
emergency	shelter	as	identified	in	the	housing	element,	except	that	all	local	governments	must	
identify	a	zone	or	zones	to	accommodate	at	least	one	year-round	shelter.	Adequate	sites/zones	
can	include	existing	facilities	that	can	be	converted	to	accommodate	the	need	for	emergency	
shelters.	
The	 City	 is	 in	 the	 process	 of	 updating	 the	 Zoning	 Code	 to	 include	 provisions	 for	 ministerial	
approval	of	emergency	shelters	in	the	M-1	and	M-2	districts.		The	M-1	district	provides	for	small	
scale	light	industrial,	repair	and	service-oriented	activities	that	provide	services	primarily	to	city	
residents.	 The	 M-2	 district	 provides	 larger	 sites	 for	 large	 scale	 light	 and	 heavy	 industrial	 uses	
that	will	not	adversely	impact	the	city's	sewer	or	water	capacity,	and	will	not	have	a	significant	
negative	 impact	 on	 the	 city.	 	 These	 districts	 were	 selected	 due	 to	 the	 availability	 of	 sites,	
appropriateness	 of	 the	 emergency	 shelter	 use,	 and	 proximity	 of	 vacant,	 available	 sites	 to	
services	and	transit.		Vacant	sites	of	0.5	acre	and	larger	are	available	in	both	districts	and	are	
more	 than	 adequate	 to	 accommodate	 the	 City’s	 needs	 for	 emergency	 shelter.	 	 The	 City	 is	
adopting	standards	for	the	development	of	emergency	shelters	in	Chapter	17.51	of	the	Zoning	
Code.	 	 The	 standards	 regulate	 the	 maximum	 number	 of	 beds,	 off-street	 parking,	 size	 and	
location	of	exterior	and	interior	onsite	waiting	and	client	intake	areas,	the	provision	of	onsite	
management,	the	proximity	to	other	emergency	shelters	(300	feet),	the	length	of	stay,	lighting,	
and	security,	as	allowed	by	Government	Code	Section	65583	(a)(4).		As	described	in	the	Housing	
Plan,	these	changes	will	be	adopted	prior	to	or	concurrently	with	this	Housing	Element	Update.	
Extremely	Low	Income	Households	
Extremely	 low	 income	 households	 can	 be	 housed	 in	 affordable	 housing	 developments	 with	
deep	 subsidies,	 such	 as	 Section	 8	 or	 Section	 232.	 These	 types	 of	 projects	 are	 typically	
multifamily	 apartments	 and	 are	 permitted	 by	 right	 in	 the	 R-3	 and	 C-2	 zones	 and	 with	 a	
conditional	 use	 permit	 in	 the	 C-1	 and	 C-M	 zones.	 	 Other	 housing	 opportunities	 for	 extremely	
low	 income	 households	 include	 housing	 with	 shared	 facilities,	 such	 as	 living	 or	 dining	 areas,	
with	private	sleeping	areas	and	are	often	referred	to	as	single	room	occupancies	(SROs).	This	
type	 of	 development	 allows	 rents	 to	 be	 much	 lower	 than	 those	 associated	 with	 typical	
apartment	complexes.	An	SRO	could	be	constructed	as	a	multifamily	housing	project	in	the	R-3	
and	 C-2	 zones.	 	 Escalon’s	 boardinghouse	 use	 also	 allows	 for	 facilities	 such	 as	 SROs	 and	 is	
permitted	 in	 the	 R-3,	 C-1,	 and	 C-2	 zones	 with	 a	 site	 a	 conditional	 use	 permit.	 As	 discussed	 in	
Chapter	4,	there	are	vacant	sites	with	these	land	use	designations,	which	provide	opportunities	
for	housing	for	extremely	low	income	persons.	
Parking	Requirements	
The	Zoning	Code	establishes	parking	standards	for	various	types	of	facilities.	Table	5-3	provides	
those	 parking	 requirements.	 The	 City’s	 parking	 requirements	 for	 single	 family	 homes,	
condominiums,	and	townhomes	are	two	parking	spaces	per	unit.	Multiple-unit	facilities	require	
1.5	spaces	per	unit,	plus	.5	visitor	spaces	per	unit.	Secondary	units	require	one	parking	space	
per	 unit.	 	 The	 Zoning	 Code	 includes	 provisions	 to	 modify	 the	 required	 number	 of	 off-street	
spaces	for	uses	such	as	mixed	use	elderly	housing	(where	both	elderly	and	nonelderly	housing	is

On-Site	and	Off-Site	Improvements	
Subdivisions	and	parcel	maps	are	required	to	provide	necessary	for	the	general	use	of	residents	
of	the	subdivision	and	to	meet	local	traffic	and	drainage	needs.		The	improvements	required	as	
conditions	 of	 approval	 of	 the	 tentative	 subdivision	 or	 parcel	 map	 may	 include,	 but	 are	 not	
limited	to,	the	following:	
     •    Grade	 and	 fill	 to	 a	 grade	 acceptable	 to	 the	 city	 engineer	 and	 construct	 all	 necessary	
          grade	crossings,	culverts,	bridges	and	other	related	works;	
     •    Construct	 and	 install	 all	 drains,	 drainage	 facilities,	 channel	 improvements	 and	 other	
          drainage	 works	 required	 to	 provide	 adequate	 drainage	 for	 the	 subdivision	 and	 to	
          protect	 all	 lots	 and	 adjacent	 land	 from	 flood	 or	 overflow	 by	 storm	 or	 flood	 waters	 in	
          accordance	with	the	accepted	plans	for	drains	and	drainage	works;	
     •    Construct	and	install	concrete	curbs,	gutters	and	sidewalks	on	both	sides	of	every	street	
          and	 on	 the	 proximate	 side	 of	 each	 existing	 or	 dedicated	 street	 bordering	 the	
          subdivision.	 If	 a	 street	 is	 an	 extension	 of	 a	 turnaround	 or	 temporary	 turnaround,	 the	
          bulbed	portion	shall	be	removed	and	required	improvements	installed;	
     •    Install	 or	 provide	 for	 the	 installation	 of	 water	 mains,	 sanitary	 sewer,	 storm	 drains,	
          necessary	appurtenances	and	all	laterals	required	to	serve	each	lot;	
     •    Relocate	or	provide	for	the	relocation	of	any	underground	or	overhead	utility,	including	
          irrigation	 lines	 and	 traffic	 signal	 lines,	 the	 relocation	 of	 which	 is	 necessitated	 by	
          development	of	the	subdivision;	
     •    All	 underground	 utilities,	 sanitary	 sewers,	 storm	 drains	 and	 other	 facilities	 installed	 in	
          streets	or	alleys	shall	be	constructed	prior	to	the	paving	of	such	street	or	alley.	Service	
          connections	for	all	underground	utilities	and	sanitary	sewers	shall	be	laid	at	such	lengths	
          to	avoid	disturbing	the	street	or	alley	improvements	when	service	connections	thereto	
          are	made;	
Housing	Element	                                       	                                                  5-14	

	
     •   Install	street	pavement;	
     •   Install	sidewalks,	alleys,	pedestrian	ways	and	bikeways;	
     •   Provide	for	the	planting	of	residential	street	trees;	
     •   Install	or	provide	for	the	installation	of	street	lighting	facilities;	and	
     •   Construct	of	fencing,	walls,	or	sound	reduction	barriers,	where	necessary.	
Projects	 that	 do	 not	 require	 a	 parcel	 map,	 such	 as	 development	 of	 a	 single	 family	 home	 or	
duplex	 on	 an	 existing	 lot	 are	 required	 to	 connect	 to	 utilities	 and	 may	 be	 required	 to	 provide	
street	 improvements,	 such	 as	 curb,	 gutter,	 sidewalk	 and	 drainage	 facilities.	 Deferred	 street	
improvement	agreements	may	be	executed	by	the	city	council	if	appropriate.	
Affordable	Housing	Ordinance	
The	City’s	Affordable	Housing	Ordinance	requires	residential	developments	to	provide	10	to	15	
percent	of	units	at	rents	or	costs	affordable	to	very	low,	low,	and	moderate	income	households.		
The	 ordinance	 was	 adopted	 to	 ensure	 that	 affordable	 housing	 is	 constructed	 and	 maintained	
within	the	City	and	to	assist	in	meeting	the	City’s	share	of	regional	housing	needs.	
Escalon’s	affordable	housing	requirements	are	similar	to	those	of	other	jurisdictions	throughout	
the	state.		Statewide,	jurisdictions	with	inclusionary	housing	programs	typically	require	from	a	
minimum	 of	 10	 percent	 up	 to	 25	 percent	 of	 units	 to	 be	 affordable	 to	 very	 low,	 low,	 and	
moderate	 income	 households.	 	 Escalon’s	 requirement	 of	 10	 to	 15	 percent	 falls	 within	 the	
typical	 range.	 	 In	 the	 vicinity	 of	 Escalon,	 the	 City	 of	 Ripon	 requires	 housing	 developments	 to	
provide	at	least	12	percent	of	units	at	prices	or	rents	affordable	to	very	low,	low,	and	moderate	
income	 households.	 	 San	 Joaquin	 County	 and	 the	 City	 of	 Modesto	 are	 currently	 considering	
inclusionary	housing	requirements.		
For	all	residential	projects	that	require	a	tentative	and	final	map	or	a	parcel	map,	the	developer	
is	 required	 to	 enter	 into	 an	 inclusionary	 housing	 agreement	 and	 provide	 affordable	 housing	
units	 to	 satisfy	 the	 requirements	 of	 the	 ordinance,	 unless	 the	 city	 council	 makes	 a	 finding	 of	
infeasibility.	The	inclusionary	housing	agreement	must	be	executed	and	recorded	as	a	condition	
of	 approval	 for	 any	 tentative	 or	 parcel	 map.	 	 The	 Affordable	 Housing	 Ordinance	 requires	 the	
affordable	units	to	be	constructed	on-site,	unless	the	developer	demonstrates	that	provision	of	
the	 units	 on-site	 is	 not	 feasible	 in	 which	 case	 the	 developer	 may	 dedicate	 land	 or	 pay	 in-lieu	
fees.		The	City	may	also	allow	a	developer	to	provide	the	units	off-site.	If	a	development	does	
not	require	a	tentative	and	final	map	or	a	parcel	map,	the	developer	may	pay	in-lieu	fees	and	is	
not	required	to	enter	into	an	inclusionary	housing	agreement.		Developers	of	projects	with	less	
than	10	units	may	also	pay	in-lieu	fees.			
Subject	 to	 the	 approval	 of	 the	 City	 Council,	 the	 City	 Manager	 determines	 the	 percentage	 of	
units	 in	 the	 residential	 development	 that	 will	 be	 available	 to	 very	 low,	 lower,	 and	 moderate	
income	households.		Unless	the	City	expressly	and	in	writing	permits	otherwise,	the	developer	
shall	provide	very	low,	lower	and	moderate	income	inclusionary	units	in	equal	numbers	in	the	
Housing	Element	                                      	                                                  5-15	

	
residential	 project	 and	 in	 each	 phase	 of	 the	 residential	 project.	 	 While	 the	 requirement	 to	
provide	10	to	15	percent	of	units	as	affordable	is	not	considered	a	constraint,	this	component	
of	the	Ordinance	provides	for	flexibility	and	allows	the	City	Manager	to	work	with	each	project	
proponent	 to	 develop	 an	 affordable	 housing	 requirement	 between	 10	 and	 15	 percent	 that	
provides	 for	 the	 City’s	 affordable	 housing	 needs	 while	 accommodating	 any	 unique	 aspects	 of	
the	project.			
Developers	 that	 wish	 to	 dedicate	 land	 or	 pay	 in-lieu	 fees	 instead	 of	 building	 the	 inclusionary	
units	 must	 request	 a	 finding	 of	 infeasibility	 from	 the	 City	 Council.	 	 In	 order	 to	 request	 this	
finding,	 the	 developer	 files	 a	 request	 with	 the	 City	 Clerk	 no	 later	 than	 the	 date	 on	 which	 the	
developer	 files	 its	 application	 for	 its	 first	 discretionary	 approval	 by	 the	 City	 or	 the	 time	 of	
application	of	a	building	permit,	whichever	is	earlier.		A	request	for	infeasibility	must	include	a	
description	of	the	project,	a	detailed	explanation	of	why	it	is	infeasible	to	provide	inclusionary	
units	 within	 the	 residential	 project,	 and	 any	 other	 information	 the	 city	 manager	 or	 his	 or	 her	
designee	 deems	 necessary	 or	 relevant	 to	 enable	 the	 City	 Council	 to	 make	 a	 reasoned	
determination.	“Feasible”	means	that	even	with	the	construction	of	inclusionary	units	pursuant	
to	the	Ordinance,	the	residential	project	as	a	whole	remains	reasonably	capable	of	being	built	
and	marketed	given	the	conditions	prevailing	at	the	time	of	approval	of	the	residential	project.	
All	 in-lieu	 fees	 are	 paid	 prior	 to	 issuance	 of	 any	 building	 permits	 for	 the	 development.	
Resolution	28-08	sets	forth	the	method	of	calculating	in	lieu	fees.		The	in-lieu	fee	is	calculated	
differently	for	residential	projects	with	more	than	10	units	and	projects	with	less	than	10	units.		
A	 residential	 project	 with	 more	 than	 10	 units	 would	 pay	 an	 in	 lieu	 fee	 for	 each	 of	 affordable	
units	required	but	not	constructed	based	on	the	greater	of	the	following:		1)	an	amount	equal	
to	50	percent	(for	very	low),	75	percent	(for	low),	or	100	percent	(for	moderate)	of	the	median	
sales	price	of	homes	in	Escalon	as	established	by	the	Sacramento	Association	of	Realtors	(CVAR)	
at	the	time	of	building	permit	issuance,	or	2)	an	amount	equal	to	50	percent	(for	very	low),	75	
percent	 (for	 low),	 or	 100	 percent	 (for	 moderate)	 of	 the	 median	 sales	 price	 plus	 half	 the	
difference	between	the	median	sales	price	and	the	median	listing	price.		Projects	with	less	than	
10	 units	 would	 pay	 an	 in	 lieu	 fee	 based	 on	 the	 percentage	 of	 required	 affordable	 units	
multiplied	by:	1)	an	amount	equal	to	50	percent	of	the	median	sales	price	of	homes	in	Escalon	
as	established	by	the	CVAR	at	the	time	of	building	permit	issuance,	or	2)	an	amount	equal	to	50	
percent	of	the	median	sales	price	plus	half	the	difference	between	the	median	sales	price	and	
the	median	listing	price.		Since	the	amount	is	based	on	the	median	sales	price,	it	will	increase	at	
times	 when	 the	 housing	 market	 it	 strong	 and	 decrease	 at	 times	 when	 the	 housing	 market	 is	
weak.	
Only	 one	 project,	 Silverwood,	 constructed	 to	 date	 has	 been	 required	 to	 provide	 affordable	
units.	 	 The	 Silverwood	 project	 had	 34	 total	 units	 and	 was	 required	 to	 provide	 3.4	 affordable	
units	 (10	 percent).	 	 However,	 the	 builder	 requested	 that	 0.4	 unit	 be	 waived	 as	 a	 concession.		
The	City	allowed	this	request	and	only	required	the	three	units.		The	units	were	constructed	on-
site	as	a	duplex	unit	and	single	family	home.		
From	October	through	March	2009,	market	rate	units	in	Silverwood	were	selling	from	$300,000	
up	 to	 $375,000.	 	 There	 were	 five	 homes	 remaining	 priced	 from	 $239,990	 (four	 bedrooms)	 to	
Housing	Element	                                     	                                                    5-16	

	
$281,543	(five	bedrooms).		Based	on	these	sales	prices	and	the	2009	County	income	levels,	the	
units	were	affordable	to	moderate	and	above	moderate	households	and	were	not	priced	out	of	
reach	to	households.			
If	 the	 cost	 to	 construct	 the	 required	 affordable	 units	 is	 infeasible	 for	 the	 developer,	 they	 can	
request	 to	 pay	 in	 lieu	 fees,	 dedicate	 land,	 or	 demonstrate	 that	 providing	 the	 affordable	 units	
renders	the	development	infeasible.		Based	on	the	median	sales	price	of	$254,900,	the	in-lieu	
fee	for	the	Silverwood	development	would	have	been	approximately	$573,525,	or	$16,868	per	
market	rate	unit.	The	fee	for	a	given	project	would	depend	on	the	prices	and	market	conditions	
at	the	time	of	the	development.			
The	 ordinance	 also	 allows	 a	 developer	 to	 dedicate	 land	 to	 meet	 its	 affordable	 housing	
requirement.		The	Silverwood	developer	could	have	dedicated	lots	to	a	non-profit	developer	in	
order	 to	 meet	 is	 obligation.	 	 This	 would	 have	 been	 the	 most	 cost-effective	 approach	 as	 the	
developer	would	not	have	realized	a	profit	on	those	lots,	but	would	not	have	incurred	any	costs	
associated	with	constructing,	marketing,	and	selling	the	affordable	units.	
The	City	allows	a	developer	to	request	incentives,	including	a	density	bonus,	which	would	allow	
the	developer	to	construct	additional	market	rate	units	than	would	otherwise	be	allowed	and	
would	 offset	 some	 of	 the	 cost	 of	 providing	 the	 affordable	 units	 or	 paying	 in	 lieu	 fees;	 a	 fee	
waiver	or	deferral	which	would	also	offset	some	of	the	cost	of	providing	the	affordable	units;	
modification	to	development	standards	which	may	reduce	the	cost	of	constructing	the	units	or	
accommodate	additional	units	to	offset	the	cost	of	providing	affordable	units	or	paying	in	lieu	
fees;	or	assistance	in	obtaining	financing	or	subsidies	(if	available)	which	would	offset	the	cost	
of	constructing	the	affordable	units.	The	developer	requests	specific	incentives	at	the	time	they	
make	their	development	application	to	the	City.		Any	request	for	incentives	is	reviewed	as	part	
of	the	review	of	the	overall	entitlements	for	the	development	project.		
The	 housing	 market	 has	 declined	 since	 adoption	 of	 the	 Affordable	 Housing	 Ordinance,	 so	 the	
level	of	recent	development	is	not	a	good	measure	of	the	effects	of	the	ordinance.		Following	
adoption	 of	 the	 2010	 Housing	 Element,	 the	 City	 updated	 the	 Zoning	 Code	 to	 revise	 the	
Affordable	 Housing	 Ordinance	 requirements	 as	 follows:	 1)	 reduce	 the	 minimum	 lot	 size	 for	
affordable	units	to	the	minimum	lot	size	in	the	development,	with	the	exception	of	duplex	units	
which	must	have	a	combined	lot	size	that	is	equal	to	or	greater	than	the	median	lot	size	in	the	
development,	 2)	 ensure	 that	 there	 are	 incentives	 in	 place	 for	 developers	 to	 provide	 the	
affordable	units,	3)	establish	a	process	for	developer’s	to	request	incentives,	4)	provide	relief	to	
projects	 that	 would	 not	 be	 financially	 viable	 with	 the	 affordable	 housing	 requirement,	 and	 5)	
ensure	that	the	ordinance	does	not	result	in	pricing	entry-level	housing	developments	beyond	
the	means	of	entry-level	buyers.	The	revisions	also	included	a	monitoring	component	to	ensure	
that	the	Affordable	Housing	Ordinance	does	not	constrain	the	production	of	housing	necessary	
to	meet	Escalon’s	needs.		
Since	 the	 revisions	 to	 the	 Affordable	 Housing	 Ordinance,	 the	 City	 has	 not	 had	 any	 new	
development	 projects	 that	 would	 be	 subject	 to	 the	 Affordable	 Housing	 Ordinance.	 	 New	
residential	development	that	occurred	following	the	2010	Housing	Element	was	limited	to	in-fill	
Housing	Element	                                    	                                                     5-17	

	
development	of	individual	single	family	parcels,	including	existing	single	family	lots	in	existing	
subdivisions.	 	 The	 changes	 to	 the	 Affordable	 Housing	 Ordinance	 ensure	 that	 the	 Affordable	
Housing	 Ordinance	 is	 not	 an	 obstacle	 to	 development	 and	 does	 not	 unduly	 constrain	
development	of	housing.	
Density	Bonus	Ordinance	
Chapter	 17.48	 of	 the	 Zoning	 Code	 includes	 provisions	 for	 a	 density	 bonus.	 The	 density	 bonus	
ordinance	 is	 intended	 to	 implement	 these	 goals	 by	 complying	 with	 the	 State	 Density	 Bonus	
Law,	 Government	 Code	 Section	 65915	 et	 seq.,	 and	 in	 providing	 below	 market	 rate	 (BMR)	
housing	 units.	 This	 law	 provides	 that	 a	 local	 government	 shall	 grant	 a	 density	 bonus	 and	
additional	 incentives,	 or	 financially	 equivalent	 incentive(s),	 to	 a	 developer	 of	 a	 housing	
development	 agreeing	 to	 construct	 a	 specified	 percentage	 of	 housing	 for	 lower	 income	
households,	very	low-income	households,	moderate	income	households	or	senior	citizens.	The	
ordinance	 is	 intended	 to	 contribute	 significantly	 to	 the	 economic	 feasibility	 of	 lower	 income	
housing	 in	 proposed	 housing	 developments,	 while	 also	 accomplishing	 the	 requirement	 for	
inclusionary	housing	units.		
All	 housing	 developments	 containing	 five	 or	 more	 units	 (excluding	 density	 bonus	 units)	 are	
eligible	for	a	density	bonus	of	up	to	35	percent,	and	one	or	more	additional	incentives	upon	the	
developers	agreeing	to	construct	the	percentage	of	dwelling	units	or	donate	land	as	specified	in	
Section	65915	as	amended.	
The	 City’s	 Density	 Bonus	 Ordinance	 provides	 a	 density	 bonus	 to	 housing	 developments	
consistent	 with	 the	 requirements	 of	 State	 law	 and	 includes	 various	 incentives	 including:	 a	
reduction	 in	 site	 development	 standards,	 such	 as	 reduced	 parking	 requirements,	 open	 space	
requirements,	 and	 setback	 requirements;	 reduced	 park	 dedication	 fees;	 reduced	 application	
and	 construction	 permit	 fees;	 and	 tax-exempt	 financing	 or	 other	 financial	 assistance	 as	
approved	by	the	city	council.		
The	ordinance	requires	all	below	market	rate	(BMR)	units	to	remain	affordable	for	at	least	50	
years.	Any	rental	BMR	units	targeted	for	lower	income	households	must	be	affordable	at	a	rent	
that	 does	 not	 exceed	 30	 percent	 of	 60	 percent	 of	 the	 San	 Joaquin	 County	 median	 income	
adjusted	for	household	size,	or	as	modified	by	state	law.	The	rental	BMR	units	targeted	for	very	
low-income	 households	 must	 be	 affordable	 at	 a	 rent	 that	 does	 not	 exceed	 30	 percent	 of	 50	
percent	of	the	San	Joaquin	County	median	income	adjusted	for	household	size,	or	as	modified	
by	state	law.		All	BMR	for-sale	units	must	be	sold	to	senior	citizens	or	first-time	home	buyers.		
The	 first-time	 homebuyer	 units	 must	 be	 occupied	 by	 the	 very	 low,	 low,	 or	 moderate	 income	
household	that	purchases	the	unit.		The	City’s	requirements	for	BMR	units	require	affordability	
for	a	shorter	term	than	State	law	and	the	requirement	that	BMR	for-sale	units	must	be	sold	to	
senior	citizens	or	first-time	homebuyers	exceeds	the	requirements	of	State	law.		The	Housing	
Plan	 includes	 a	 program	 to	 amend	 these	 provisions,	 which	 will	 be	 implemented	 concurrently	
with	this	Housing	Element	Update.	
Following	adoption	of	the	City’s	2010	Housing	Element,	the	City’s	Density	Bonus	Ordinance	was	
revised	 to	 provide	 up	 to	 two	 incentives	 to:	 1)	 a	 multifamily	 project	 of	 15	 or	 more	 units	 that

request	consolidation	of	two	or	more	contiguous	small	lots,	2)	a	housing	project	of	10	or	more	
units	 restricted	 to	 occupancy	 by	 persons	 with	 a	 disability	 and	 their	 caretakers,	 and	 3)	 a	
multifamily	housing	project	of	15	or	more	units	that	provides	a	minimum	of	20	percent	of	the	
units	as	large	units	with	three	or	more	bedrooms.		These	revisions	were	intended	to	encourage	
multifamily	projects	that	include	a	lot	consolidation	component,	housing	for	disabled	persons,	
and	rental	housing	for	large	families.			
The	 City’s	 Density	 Bonus	 Ordinance	 is	 consistent	 with	 the	 requirements	 of	 State	 law	 and	
provides	 incentives	 beyond	 those	 required	 by	 State	 law	 in	 order	 to	 further	 encourage	
multifamily	and	special	needs	housing.	
Subdivision	Ordinance	
The	 Subdivision	 Ordinance	 regulates	 the	 subdivision	 of	 land	 and	 real	 property	 within	 the	 City	
for	the	purposes	of	sale,	lease	or	financing	in	all	instances	except	those	which	are	exempt	under	
the	provisions	of	the	Subdivision	Map	Act	of	the	state	of	California	as	set	forth	in	Title	7	of	the	
California	Government	Code.	The	ordinance	provides	for	regulation	and	control	of	design	and	
improvement	 of	 subdivisions	 to	 preserve	 the	 public	 health,	 safety	 and	 general	 welfare;	 to	
promote	 orderly	 growth	 and	 development;	 to	 promote	 open	 space,	 conservation,	 protection	
and	proper	use	of	land;	and	to	ensure	the	provision	of	adequate	traffic	circulation,	utilities	and	
other	services	of	the	city.		
Growth	Management	Ordinance	
The	Growth	Management	Ordinance	(GMO),	located	at	Chapter	15.04	of	the	Municipal	Code,	
provides	 for	 an	 annual	 allocation	 of	 building	 permits,	 which	 ensures	 that	 limited	 municipal	
services	and	utilities	are	equitably	distributed.		The	GMO	is	intended	to	reduce	the	potential	for	
wasteful	 construction	 of	 public	 facilities	 on	 a	 crisis	 basis;	 overburdening	 of	 municipal	 services	
and	utilities;	increases	in	tax	costs	in	excess	of	tax	gains;	premature	and	inefficient	commitment	
of	 prime	 agricultural	 land	 to	 urbanization;	 and	 environmentally	 detrimental	 development	
patterns.	The	GMO	specifies	that	it	is	intended	to	control	the	rate	and	location	of	growth	while	
still	meeting	the	future	housing	needs	as	determined	by	the	Housing	Element.		Following	the	
City’s	2010	Housing	Element,	the	GMO	was	updated	consistent	with	Housing	Element	Program	
2-6,	which	revised	the	Growth	Management	Ordinance	to	ensure	that	adequate	allocations	are	
provided	 to	 accommodate	 the	 City’s	 fair	 share	 of	 housing	 needs	 through	 1)	 providing	
allocations	for	extremely	low,	very	low,	and	low	income	units	on	a	2	for	1	basis,	2)	increasing	
the	 number	 of	 allocations	 available	 during	 the	 second	 round	 to	 a	 maximum	 of	 25,	 	 and	 3)	
requiring	 annual	 monitoring	 of	 the	 ordinance	 to	 ensure	 that	 it	 does	 not	 constrain	 the	
development	of	housing.		
The	 GMO	 allows	 a	 maximum	 of	 75	 new	 building	 permits	 to	 be	 issued	 annually	 for	 the	
construction	of	new	single-family	dwelling	units.		The	City	Council	may	allow	up	to	100	building	
permits	to	be	issued	in	a	year,	including	permit	allocations	rolled	over	from	the	preceding	year;	
provided,	that	non-rollover	permits	do	not	exceed	75.		Applications	for	rollover	allocations	have	
priority	over	applications	for	new	allocations.			
Housing	Element	                                  	                                                      5-19	

	
Building	 permits	 are	 allocated	 twice	 per	 year.	 	 The	 primary	 allocation	 period	 provides	
allocations	for	the	full	fiscal	year.			Applications	for	unused	allocations	can	be	rolled	over	to	the	
next	 fiscal	 year.	 	 Rollover	 requests	 receive	 priority.	 	 Applicants	 requesting	 allocations	 for	
subdivisions	 and	 multifamily	 developments	 are	 encouraged	 to	 apply	 for	 allocations	 at	 the	
primary	allocation	period	which	occurs	July	1	of	each	fiscal	year.		In	order	to	receive	allocations	
in	 the	 primary	 allocation	 period,	 project	 applicants	 must	 have	 their	 map	 finalized	 (for	 single	
family	projects)	and	necessary	approvals	(for	multifamily	projects)	and	submit	an	application	by	
May	1st.	Since	the	growth	allocation	process	follows	the	necessary	entitlements	(final	map	or	
site	plan	approval),	the	City	will	work	with	an	applicant	during	the	processing	of	their	map	or	
site	 plan	 application	 to	 ensure	 that	 the	 applicant	 understands	 the	 process	 to	 apply	 for	
allocations	and	to	work	with	the	applicant	to	receive	necessary	materials	so	that	a	development	
can	 receive	 its	 entitlements	 in	 a	 timely	 manner	 to	 apply	 for	 its	 allocations.	 	 Further,	 since	 an	
applicant	will	have	already	gone	through	the	entitlement	process,	the	City	will	have	reviewed	
the	 proposed	 project	 and	 made	 a	 decision	 on	 the	 subdivision	 map	 or	 site	 plan.	 	 When	 an	
applicant	 is	 at	 the	 stage	 of	 applying	 for	 an	 allocation,	 the	 City	 has	 already	 reviewed	 and	
approved	 the	 proposed	 development	 project.	 	 This	 provides	 the	 applicant	 with	 the	 certainty	
that	the	City	desires	the	applicant’s	project	and	streamlines	the	development	process.	
The	secondary	allocation	period	provides	allocations	only	for	the	remainder	of	the	fiscal	year	in	
which	granted	and	these	allocations	are	considered	on	January	1st.		Allocations	allotted	in	the	
secondary	 period	 are	 not	 eligible	 for	 rollover	 requests.	 	 Planning	 staff	 works	 with	 project	
applicants	 to	 assist	 in	 the	 timing	 of	 requests	 for	 approvals,	 so	 that	 project	 applicants	 have	 a	
clear	understanding	of	the	process	and	can	submit	application	materials	in	a	timely	manner	to	
be	 eligible	 for	 the	 primary	 allocation	 period.	 	 The	 secondary	 allocation	 period	 is	 limited	 to	
twenty-five	allocations	and	only	one	allocation	per	applicant.		The	primary	allocation	period	is	
the	 only	 one	 that	 allows	 adequate	 allocations	 to	 accommodate	 subdivisions	 and	 larger	
residential	 projects;	 this	 limits	 a	 developer’s	 ability	 to	 apply	 for	 an	 allocation	 to	 construct	 a	
significant	portion	of	a	major	project	to	a	single	application	period	each	year.		
The	 GMO	 encourages	 development	 of	 affordable	 housing	 (extremely	 low,	 very	 low,	 and	 low	
income	 units),	 multi-family,	 and	 mobile	 home	 units	 through	 counting	 each	 two	 affordable,	
multi-family,	or	mobile	home	units	as	a	single	allocation.		The	GMO	also	allows	the	City	Council	
to	set	aside	allocations	for	a	multi-family	project	at	any	point	throughout	the	year	as	part	of	the	
approval	 process	 for	 the	 multi-family	 project.	 	 There	 have	 been	 no	 multi-family	 projects	 in	
Escalon	since	the	GMO	was	enacted.		The	allotment	the	following	year	would	then	be	reduced	
by	 one	 single	 family	 unit	 for	 each	 two	 multiple	 dwelling	 units	 or	 two	 mobile	 homes.	 	 For	
example,	a	44-unit	multifamily	project	may	be	approved	following	the	second	growth	allocation	
period	in	2016.		As	part	of	the	approval,	the	City	Council	may	set	aside	building	permits	from	
the	following	year’s	allocation.		The	multifamily	project	would	receive	its	44	building	permits.		
These	 would	 be	 in	 addition	 to	 the	 other	 allocations	 already	 made	 in	 2016.	 	 In	 2017,	 the	
maximum	 allocations	 would	 be	 reduced	 by	 22	 allocations	 (two	 multi-family	 units	 count	 as	 a	
single	 family	 allocation).	 	 This	 approach	 provides	 certainty	 for	 the	 multi-family	 developer	 by	
allocating	 their	 units	 as	 part	 of	 the	 project	 approval	 process	 and	 outside	 of	 the	 allocation	
application	period.				
Housing	Element	                                   	                                                       5-20	

	
The	 Council	 may	 also	 set	 aside	 senior	 affordable	 allocations	 and	 reduce	 the	 following	 year’s	
allotment	by	the	number	of	affordable	senior	units.		The	senior	unit	allocation	can	be	guarantee	
up	 to	 15	 permit	 allocations	 per	 year	 for	 a	 two-year	 period	 (up	 to	 30	 allocations	 guaranteed).		
For	 a	 senior	 project	 to	 receive	 this	 priority	 allocation,	 it	 must	 provide	 both	 owner	 and	 renter	
units,	 provide	 on-site	 amenities	 conducive	 to	 both	 active	 and	 passive	 senior	 lifestyles,	 be	
permitted	by	a	development	agreement	that	includes	a	minimum	of	10	percent	each	for	very	
low,	low,	and	moderate	income	dwelling	units	that	are	deed	restricted	for	affordability.			
In	addition	to	the	provisions	to	accommodate	affordable	housing,	multifamily	housing,	mobile	
homes,	and	senior	units,	the	Growth	Management	Ordinance	exempts:	
    §    Single	lots	of	record	as	of	December	31,	2000,	which	is	restricted	to	a	single-family	
         residential	unit	by	the	zoning	regulations;
    §    Rehabilitation	or	remodeling	of	an	existing	dwelling,	or	conversion	of	apartments	to	
         condominiums,	so	long	as	no	additional	dwelling	units	are	created;	and
	
    §    Residential	units	on	parcels	zoned	P-D	which	are	deed	restricted	for	affordability	by	low-	
         and	very	low-income	households	for	a	period	of	at	least	50	years.	The	number	of	units	
         to	be	so	exempted	shall	not	exceed	the	city's	average	annual	fair	share	for	very	low	and	
         low-income	housing	units	as	estimated	by	the	San	Joaquin	County	council	of	
         governments.	
The	 Growth	 Management	 Ordinance	 includes	 provisions	 to	 accommodate	 development	 of	
multifamily	 housing,	 mobile	 home	 parks,	 and	 affordable	 senior	 units	 by	 increasing	 the	
allotment	 for	 these	 units	 in	 any	 given	 year	 and	 allowing	 these	 types	 of	 projects	 to	 be	
guaranteed	 a	 specific	 allocation	 without	 competing	 in	 the	 allocation	 process.	 	 The	 Growth	
Management	Ordinance	exempts	very	low	and	low	income	units	that	are	zoned	P-D	and	deed	
restricted	for	affordability	for	at	least	50	years.		These	provisions	accommodate	development	of	
affordable	 and	 higher	 density	 housing	 and	 ensure	 that	 affordable	 units	 are	 either	 provided	
priority	or	exempted	from	the	process.		During	the	2003-2008	Housing	Element	cycle,	the	three	
affordable	units	in	the	Silverwood	subdivision	were	exempted	from	the	Growth	Management	
Ordinance	process.			
The	 City’s	 remaining	 Regional	 Housing	 Needs	 Allocation	 for	 the	 2014-2023	 period	 is:	 60	
extremely	low,	43	very	low	income	units,	66	low	income	units,	54	moderate	income	units,	and	
171	 above	 moderate	 income	 units,	 a	 total	 of	 396	 units.	 	 Table	 5-5	 demonstrates	 that	 for	 the	
2014	 through	 2023	 RHNA	 period,	 the	 City’s	 GMO	 will	 allow	 600	 allocations	 for	 the	 remaining	
RHNA	 period	 (2016-2023)	 which	 are	 more	 than	 enough	 to	 accommodate	 the	 City’s	 RHNA.	 Of	
course,	 the	 City	 cannot	 compel	 developers	 to	 obtain	 allocations	 during	 the	 RHNA	 period	 and	
from	2014/15	through	2015/16,	there	have	been	no	applications.		In	previous	years,	allocations	
requested	 and	 approved	 have	 been	 significantly	 less	 than	 available	 allocations.	 	 As	 shown	 in	
Table	5-4	below,	the	City’s	GMO	has	allowed	adequate	allocations	to	accommodate	the	RHNA	
during	the	2014-2023	cycle.

Housing	Element	                             	                                                  5-22	

	
As	shown	in	Table	5-4,	the	City’s	GMO	has	provided	adequate	allocations	to	accommodate	the	
City’s	housing	needs	at	all	levels	of	affordability.		The	750	allocations	allowed	during	the	period	
would	have	accommodated	development	of	all	RHNA	units.	As	previously	mentioned,	the	City	
cannot	 compel	 developers	 to	 construct	 the	 RHNA	 and	 there	 has	 been	 a	 surplus	 of	 available	
allocations	since	2006.			
Table	5-5	demonstrates	that	the	remaining	600	allocations	under	the	GMO	for	2016/17	through	
2023/24	 can	 accommodate	 the	 City’s	 RHNA.	 It	 is	 noted	 that	 the	 GMO	 provides	 more	 than	
adequate	capacity	for	the	RHNA.	It	is	noted	that	allocations	for	affordable	units	(extremely	low,	
very	 low,	 and	 low)	 are	 granted	 on	 a	 two-for-one	 basis,	 meaning	 that	 two	 units	 can	 be	
constructed	per	each	allocation	granted.		Similarly,	multifamily	and	mobile	home	units	are	also	
counted	on	a	two-for-one	basis.	As	shown	in	Table	5-5,	the	City’s	remaining	allocation	of	600	
units	will	accommodate	the	City’s	lower	income	RHNA	of	169	units	with	85	allocations	and	will	
have	 515	 remaining	 allocations.	 	 The	 remaining	 allocations	 exceed	 the	 City’s	 moderate	 and	
above	moderate	income	RHNA	of	225	units.

The	City	incentivizes	affordable	housing	through	the	GMO	process	by:	
     1) Allocations	 for	 lower	 income	 units	 are	 given	 on	 a	 two-for-one	 basis,	 meaning	 a	
         developer	that	receives	20	allocations	may	build	40	affordable	units.			
     2) Lower	income	units	that	have	a	Planned	Development	designation	are	exempt	from	the	
         GMO	 requirement,	 meaning	 that	 lower	 income	 units	 that	 go	 through	 the	 Planned	
         Development	 process,	 which	 provides	 flexibility	 in	 site	 and	 project	 design,	 can	 be	
         constructed	 without	 requesting	 any	 GMO	 allocations.	 	 A	 developer	 can	 request	 a	 P-D	
Housing	Element	                                  	                                                  5-23	

	
         designation	for	an	affordable	project	in	order	for	the	lower	income	units	to	be	exempt	
         from	the	ordinance.			
     3) Lower	income	units	that	are	in	a	senior	housing	project	receive	priority	allocations.		The	
         City	prioritizes	15	allocations	(30	affordable	senior	units)	each	year.			
The	City	exempted	the	affordable	units	in	Silverwood	as	previously	described	and	this	process	
would	be	provided	for	future	affordable	units.		A	developer	can	request	the	P-D	designation	at	
the	 time	 they	 submit	 their	 project	 application.	 	 The	 P-D	 designation	 allows	 for	 relaxed	
development	standards	and	allows	flexibility	with	project	design	in	terms	of	lot	sizes,	parking,	
setbacks,	et	cetera.		A	request	for	a	P-D	designation	is	processed	as	part	of	the	overall	request	
for	entitlements	and	does	not	require	special	applications	or	submittals.		In	addition	to	having	
flexibility	with	design	and	development	standards,	the	P-D	designation	also	exempts	all	of	the	
affordable	 units	 from	 the	 GMO	 allocation	 requirement.	 	 This	 saves	 a	 developer	 time	 and	
money,	as	they	do	not	have	to	go	through	the	allocation	process.	The	P-D	process	is	described	
under	the	Processing	Times	section	of	this	chapter.		If	affordable	housing	developers	requested	
a	P-D	designation,	all	192	of	the	extremely	low,	very	low,	and	low	income	RHNA	units	would	be	
exempt	from	the	GMO.	
Some	affordable	developers	may	not	wish	to	request	a	P-D	designation.		These	developers	will	
receive	allocations	on	a	two	affordable	unit	per	one	allocation	basis,	as	previously	described.			
The	Growth	Management	Ordinance	process	does	not	impede	the	development	of	single	family	
housing,	affordable	housing,	or	multifamily	housing.		The	GMO	specifically	provides	incentives	
for	 the	 development	 of	 multifamily	 housing,	 mobile	 homes,	 affordable	 housing,	 and	 senior	
housing	 of	 housing	 as	 previously	 described.	 	 The	 GMO	 provides	 adequate	 capacity	 to	
accommodate	the	City’s	remaining	RHNA.		No	revisions	are	needed	to	the	GMO.	
Annexations	
The	 City	 of	 Escalon	 has	 special	 regulations	 that	 address	 annexations.	 Chapter	 17.61	 of	 the	
Zoning	Code	requires	projects	that	are	five	or	more	acres	to	have	a	specific	plan	prepared	prior	
to	 approval	 of	 the	 annexation.	 Additionally,	 the	 Zoning	 Code	 provides	 the	 City	 with	 the	
discretion	to	require	a	specific	plan	for	developments	of	less	than	five	acres	in	size,	while	also	
providing	 the	 City	 with	 the	 discretion	 to	 accept	 a	 preliminary	 development	 plan	 in	 lieu	 of	 a	
specific	plan.	As	a	condition	of	approval	for	any	annexation	to	the	city	of	five	or	more	acres,	the	
applicant	is	required	to	enter	into	a	development	agreement	with	the	City.		
Ultimately,	the	San	Joaquin	County	Local	Agency	Formation	Commission	(LAFCo)	regulates	the	
boundary	changes	proposed	by	public	agencies	or	individuals.	LAFCo	does	not	have	the	power	
to	 initiate	 boundary	 changes	 on	 their	 own,	 except	 for	 proposals	 involving	 the	 dissolution	 or	
consolidation	of	special	districts	and	the	merging	of	subsidiary	districts.	Their	authority	includes	
both	Sphere	of	Influence	(SOI)	amendments	and	annexations.	
LAFCo’s	 efforts	 are	 directed	 toward	 seeing	 that	 services	 are	 provided	 efficiently	 and	
economically	while	ensuring	that	agricultural	and	open-space	lands	are	protected.	LAFCo	must	
conduct	 service	 reviews	 to	 evaluate	 the	 provision	 of	 municipal	 services	 with	 respect	 to	 nine	
Housing	Element	                                  	                                                   5-24	

	
areas:	 (1)	 infrastructure	 needs	 or	 deficiencies;	 (2)	 growth	 and	 population	 projections	 for	 the	
affected	area;	(3)	financing	constraints	and	opportunities;	(4)	cost	avoidance	opportunities;	(5)	
opportunities	 for	 rate	 restructuring;	 (6)	 opportunities	 for	 shared	 facilities;	 (7)	 government	
structure	options,	including	advantages	and	disadvantages	for	consolidation	or	reorganization	
of	service	providers;	(8)	evaluation	of	management	efficiencies;	and	(9)	local	accountability	and	
governance.	
While	LAFCo	serves	an	important	role	in	local	land	use	planning	and	the	provision	of	services,	
SOI	 and	 annexation	 approvals	 are	 considered	 a	 governmental	 constraint	 to	 housing	
development	 because	 of	 the	 lengthy	 time	 period	 and	 the	 service	 review	 requirements.		
However,	the	City	does	not	require	any	SOI	or	annexation	approvals	in	order	to	accommodate	
the	RHNA.	
Building	Codes	
Building	 Codes	 regulate	 the	 erection,	 construction,	 enlargement,	 alteration,	 repair,	 moving,	
removal,	 demolition,	 conversion,	 occupancy,	 equipment,	 wiring,	 plumbing,	 height,	 area,	 use	
and	 maintenance	 of	 all	 buildings	 and/or	 structures	 in	 the	 City.	 The	 City	 has	 adopted	 the	
California	 Building	 Standards	 Code	 (CBSC),	 which	 includes	 the	 2013	 editions	 of	 the	 California	
Administrative	 Code,	 California	 building	 Code,	 California	 Residential	 Code,	 California	 Electrical	
Code,	California	Mechanical	Code,	California	Plumbing	Code,	California	Energy	Code,	California	
Historical	Building	Code,	California	Fire	Code,	California	Existing	Building	Code,	California	Green	
Building	Standards	Code,	and	the	California	Referenced	Standards	Code.	The	CBSC,	as	published	
by	 the	 California	 Building	 Standards	 Commission,	 is	 applied	 statewide.	 The	 California	 Building	
Code	includes	provisions	to	reasonably	accommodate	disabled	people	in	accordance	with	ADA	
requirements.	
The	 City	 has	 adopted	 the	 CBSC	 without	 amendments,	 except	 the	 California	 Building	 Code,	
which	 was	 adopted	 with	 amendments	 for	 health	 and	 safety	 (requirements	 for	 enclosure	 of	
electrical	 cable	 penetrations)	 and	 to	 allow	 the	 City	 Council	 to	 set	 building	 fees	 by	 resolution,	
which	is	a	standard	approach	to	building	fees	for	cities	and	counties	in	California.	
Building	 Code	 enforcement	 is	 conducted	 by	 the	 City	 first	 through	 the	 plan-check	 process	 for	
new	construction,	remodeling,	and	rehabilitation	projects.	The	plan	check	process	ensures	that	
the	 plan	 and	 specifications	 are	 designed	 according	 to	 code.	 The	 second	 step	 is	 scheduled	
inspections	during	construction	to	ensure	that	the	structure	is	built	to	the	plan	specifications.	
Inspections	are	also	conducted	in	response	to	public	complaints	or	an	inspector’s	observation	
that	construction	is	occurring	without	proper	permits.	Local	enforcement	of	these	codes	does	
not	add	significantly	to	the	cost	of	housing	in	Escalon	and	maintains	an	acceptable	standard	of	
health	and	safety	for	all	inhabitants.	
Processing	Times		
The	residential	development	process	has	various	stages,	each	of	which	requires	some	form	of	
City	 review.	 	 Initial	 processing	 of	 a	 development	 application	 depends	 on	 the	 type	 of	 project	
proposed	(e.g.,	Planned	Development,	subdivision,	single	family	unit,	etc.)	as	well	as	whether	
additional	requirements	will	need	to	be	met	(e.g.,	rezoning	of	land,	environmental	review,	etc.).		
Housing	Element	                                   	                                                      5-25	

	
Therefore,	processing	review	times	can	vary	depending	on	many	different	factors.		Processing	
times	for	development	review	in	Escalon	vary	based	on	the	size	of	the	project	and	the	extent	of	
review	required.	The	review	period	can	range	from	4	to	6	weeks	for	a	straight	forward	permit	
approval	to	around	52	weeks	for	CEQA	review	of	a	complex	development	project.			
Processing	 time	 for	 a	 conventional	 building	 permit	 requires	 five	 working	 days	 for	 review,	
provided	no	variances	of	other	special	procedures	are	required.	
Tentative	 subdivision	 maps	 are	 reviewed	 by	 Planning	 Commission	 with	 a	 public	 hearing,	 then	
forwarded	to	City	Council	with	a	recommendation.		The	City	Council	will	hold	a	public	hearing	
on	 the	 map	 and	 then	 take	 action.	 	 The	 City	 Council	 is	 also	 the	 decision-maker	 on	 the	 final	
subdivision	map.	
A	 Conditional	 Use	 Permit	 is	 not	 required	 for	 multi-family	 housing	 development	 in	 Escalon.	 	 A	
multifamily	project	does	require	site	plan	approval.		Currently,	the	Planning	Commission	is	the	
decision-making	body	for	site	plan	approval	for	all	residential	projects	one	acre	or	larger	and	for	
all	 residential	 projects	 in	 a	 commercial	 zone.	 	 The	 Planning	 Commission	 conducts	 Site	 Plan	
Approval	in	conjunction	with	the	Planned	Development	Overlay.		The	PD	Overlay	requirement	
has	been	identified	as	a	constraint	to	multifamily	housing,	as	discussed	below.				
With	 the	 removal	 of	 the	 PD	 overlay	 requirement	 for	 a	 multifamily	 project	 (see	 Program	 2-6),	
the	 Development	 Services	 Manager	 is	 the	 decision-making	 authority	 for	 multifamily	
development	 that	 is	 a	 permitted	 use	 (e.g.,	 a	 multifamily	 project	 in	 the	 R-3	 zone)	 and	 for	
residential	projects	that	do	not	require	additional	approvals	(e.g.,	parcel	map,	subdivision	map,	
etc.).		Site	plan	review	is	not	required	for	a	single	family	home.	
Approval	 of	 a	 site	 plan	 requires	 findings	 that	 the	 use	 or	 activity	 is	 an	 allowed	 use	 within	 the	
zoning	district;	that	the	site	plan	is	consistent	with	the	provisions	of	the	Zoning	Code,	General	
Plan,	 and	 other	 applicable	 plans	 and	 policies	 adopted	 by	 the	 City	 Council;	 findings	 related	 to	
building	architecture,	including	that	building	architecture	promotes	variety	through	the	use	of	
scale,	 bulk,	 and	 building	 height,	 and	 features	 such	 as	 facades,	 projections,	 offsets,	 roofs,	 and	
overhangs,	 are	 an	 integral	 part	 of	 the	 design	 and	 that	 building	 architecture	 follows	 a	 design	
theme	which	unifies	a	group	of	related	buildings	while	allowing	for	distinctive	features	which	
make	similar	uses	recognizable	from	each	other;	and	findings	related	to	site	design	including:	
1.	Site	plan	elements,	e.g.,	buildings,	circulation	and	open	spaces,	are	arranged	on	the	site	so	
that	activities	are	integrated	and	harmonious	with	the	neighborhood	and	surrounding	area	and	
are	 arranged	 to	 produce	 an	 attractive,	 efficient	 and	 cohesive	 development	 of	 sustained	
desirability;	
2.	Consider	existing	natural	topography,	natural	watercourses	and	exposure	to	wind;	
3.	 The	 site's	 design	 and	 building	 arrangement	 provides	 for	 the	 greatest	 opportunity	 for	 solar	
access;	
4.	 The	 project	 is	 designed	 to	 maximize	 the	 opportunity	 for	 privacy	 by	 the	 residents	 of	 the	
project	and	adjacent	residential	development;

as	not	to	interfere	with	the	flow	of	traffic	and	safety	of	vehicles	and	pedestrians;	
10.	There	is	adequate	space	for	loading	and	unloading	of	persons,	materials	and	goods;	
11.	 The	 pedestrian	 circulation	 system	 is	 designed	 to	 assure	 that	 pedestrians	 can	 move	 safely	
and	easily	both	on	the	site	and	between	properties	and	activities	within	the	neighborhood;	
12.	 Incorporates	 design	 features	 to	 enhance	 convenience	 and	 safety	 across	 parking	 lots	 and	
driveways;	
13.	 Outdoor	 lighting	 is	 provided	 which	 promotes	 pedestrian	 and	 vehicle	 safety	 and	 crime	
prevention	and	is	confined	to	the	site;	
14.	Recreational	areas	are	accessible	to	the	residential	units	they	are	intended	to	serve;	
15.	Signs	complement	the	architectural	theme	of	buildings,	are	an	integral	part	of	a	site	design,	
and	are	consistent	with	provisions	set	forth	in	this	title;	
16.	 The	 site	 design	 contributes	 to	 speedy	 access	 to	 all	 buildings	 for	 fire,	 medical	 and	 police	
response;	and	
17.	 The	 site	 design	 incorporates	 provisions	 for	 barrier-free	 access	 for	 the	 handicapped.	 (Ord.	
495	§	1,	2005)	
In	order	to	make	the	findings,	the	decision-making	entity	(Development	Services	Manager	for	
permitted	 uses	 and	 Planning	 Commission	 for	 uses	 that	 require	 a	 subdivision	 map,	 tentative	
parcel	map,	or	other	Planning	Commission	approvals)	must	review	the	site	plan	and	the	related	
standards	 of	 the	 City’s	 adopted	 planning	 documents,	 including	 the	 General	 Plan	 and	 Zoning	
Code.		The	site	plan	review	process	ensures	that	new	development	addresses	health	and	safety	
requirements	 (lighting,	 access,	 loading/unloading).	 	 A	 project	 must	 be	 consistent	 with	
development	standards	(e.g.,	building	heights,	setbacks,	density,	etc.)	in	order	for	the	project	to	
be	determined	to	meet	the	findings.		The	site	plan	review	process	is	a	straightforward	process	
that	is	not	considered	a	constraint	to	providing	housing.		While	the	site	plan	review	process	is	
not	considered	a	constraint	to	housing,	Program	2-7	has	been	provided	to	increase	certainty	for

affordable	 and	 multifamily	 developers	 and	 to	 further	 encourage	 the	 development	 of	
multifamily	housing.	
A	 plan	 check	 for	 a	 single	 family	 unit	 would	 typically	 require	 two	 to	 four	 weeks.	 	 For	 a	 single	
family	 subdivision	 that	 does	 not	 require	 a	 zone	 change	 or	 general	 plan	 amendment,	
approximately	 30	 weeks	 (7	 months)	 would	 be	 required.	 	 A	 multifamily	 project	 that	 does	 not	
require	a	zone	change	or	general	plan	amendment	would	require	site	plan	review,	which	would	
take	three	months	on	average.		The	processing	time	frames	are	consistent	with	those	in	other	
communities	within	California	and	are	not	considered	excessive.	Table	5-6	presents	the	typical

Planned	Development	
The	 Planned	 Development	 (PD)	 zone	 is	 intended	 to	 simplify	 and	 streamline	 the	 processing	 of	
development	proposals	by	concurrently	reviewing	land	use,	subdivision,	public	improvements	
and	 design	 considerations;	 to	 provide	 design	 flexibility	 by	 using	 performance	 standards;	 to	
promote	 mixed	 use	 development	 as	 a	 means	 of	 optimizing	 land	 utilization;	 to	 encourage	
diversity	 in	 housing	 types,	 styles	 and	 prices;	 and	 to	 ensure	 the	 provision	 of	 adequate	 public	
facilities,	 services	 and	 amenities	 in	 the	 design	 of	 development	 projects.	 	 Affordable	 housing	
projects	are	exempt	from	the	allocation	requirements	of	the	Growth	Management	Ordinance	
(see	 below)	 if	 the	 affordable	 units	 are	 deed	 restricted	 for	 a	 period	 of	 at	 least	 50	 years	 and	
located	on	a	site	designated	PD.	
All	residential	projects	over	one	acre,	except	in	the	downtown	area,	are	required	to	have	a	PD	
overlay/district	designation.	
In	order	for	a	project	site	to	receive	a	PD	designation,	the	site	must:	have	a	minimum	lot	area	of	
one	 acre,	 be	 consistent	 with	 the	 General	 Plan	 and	 underlying	 land	 use	 district,	 and	 be	
consistent	with	the	underlying	zoning	district,	provided	that	development	standards	that	would	
otherwise	be	applicable	to	the	property	may	be	modified.	
Conditional	 use	 permits	 are	 only	 required	 for	 uses	 not	 consistent	 with	 the	 approved	
development	plan.		If	a	PD	designation	was	requested	for	a	multi-family	project	proposed	on	an	
R-2	 or	 R-3	 site,	 a	 conditional	 use	 permit	 would	 not	 be	 required	 as	 the	 multi-family	 use	 is	
consistent	with	the	underlying	zoning	district.	
The	procedure	for	review	and	approval	to	establish	a	PD	district	for	construction	of	a	planned	
development	is	as	follows:	
A.	 The	 completed	 application	 for	 a	 PD	 zone	 classification	 shall	 be	 submitted	 to	 the	 planning	
department,	 including	 the	 development	 plans,	 supportive	 materials,	 and	 environmental	
documentation.	
B.	The	application	shall	be	submitted	to	and	reviewed	by	the	city	planner.	The	city	planner	shall	
review	all	materials	for	completeness,	compliance	with	applicable	requirements,	and	adequacy	
of	project	design	and	conformance	with	the	purpose	of	the	PD	zone.	
C.	Upon	completion	of	this	review	and	preparation	of	this	chapter	with	performance	standards,	
the	 application	 and	 preliminary	 development	 plan	 shall	 be	 submitted	 to	 the	 planning	
commission	for	review	at	a	public	hearing.	
D.	Upon	completion	of	the	planning	commission	hearing,	the	matter	shall	be	forwarded	to	the	
city	council	as	required	by	applicable	codes	and	ordinances.	
E.	 The	 city	 council	 shall	 review	 the	 matter	 at	 public	 hearing	 as	 the	 deciding	 body,	 and	 may	
adopt	the	chapter	establishing	the	PD	zone.	
The	 PD	 zone	 provides	 for	 flexibility	 in	 designing	 projects	 that	 provide	 affordable	 and	 special	
needs	housing.		Applying	the	PD	designation	involves	a	change	to	the	City’s	zoning	map	to	add	
Housing	Element	                                   	                                                      5-29	

	
the	overlaying	PD	designation,	so	City	Council	approval	is	required.		While	this	approval	does	
add	 an	 additional	 two	 to	 four	 weeks	 in	 processing	 time	 for	 projects	 that	 would	 otherwise	 be	
approved	 at	 the	 Planning	 Commission	 level,	 the	 PD	 process	 provides	 benefits	 of:	 1)	 allowing	
flexibility	in	the	design	and	uses	proposed	on	a	project	site,	and	2)	exempting	affordable	units	
on	a	PD	site	from	the	Growth	Management	Ordinance.		However,	the	requirement	to	apply	for	
a	PD	overlay	for	all	residential	development	over	one	acre	in	size	is	considered	a	constraint	to	
multifamily	housing	development	and	to	small	residential	projects.		The	Housing	Plan	includes	a	
program	 to	 revise	 the	 PD	 requirements	 in	 order	 to	 remove	 constraints	 to	 multifamily	
development	and	small	housing	projects.		
Governmental	Fees	
Although	governmental	fees	do	contribute	to	the	total	cost	of	housing	development,	the	extent	
to	 which	 these	 costs	 are	 passed	 on	 to	 the	 consumer	 depends	 on	 price	 sensitivity	 of	 each	
housing	 type	 and	 the	 ability	 of	 housing	 developers	 to	 absorb	 such	 cost	 increases	 and	 still	
maintain	 acceptable	 profit	 margins.	 Where	 increased	 costs	 cannot	 be	 absorbed	 by	 the	
consumer	 or	 developer,	 housing	 production	 will	 decline.	 In	 “price	 sensitive”	 markets,	 such	 as	
that	 for	 affordable	 housing,	 when	 increased	 costs	 cannot	 be	 absorbed	 by	 the	 developer,	 or	
products	 modified	 to	 compensate	 the	 developer,	 and	 additional	 funding	 sources	 are	 not	
available,	affordable	housing	is	not	built.		
Government	 Code	 Section	 66020	 requires	 that	 planning	 and	 permit	 processing	 fees	 do	 not	
exceed	 the	 reasonable	 cost	 of	 providing	 the	 service,	 unless	 approved	 by	 the	 voters;	 agencies	
collecting	fees	must	provide	project	applicants	with	a	statement	of	amounts	and	purposes	of	all	
fees	 at	 the	 time	 of	 fee	 imposition	 or	 project	 approval.	 Table	 5-7	 presents	 the	 2009	 permit

That	 City	 of	 Escalon	 adopted	 these	 fees	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 nexus	 requirements	 of	 the

increases	a	fee	as	a	condition	of	development	approval	do	all	of	the	following:	(1)	identify	the	
purpose	of	the	fee;	(2)	identify	the	use	to	which	the	fee	is	to	be	put;	(3)	determine	how	there	is	
a	reasonable	relationship	between	the	fee’s	use	and	the	type	of	development	project	on	which	
the	fee	is	imposed;	and,	(4)	determine	how	there	is	a	reasonable	relationship	between	the	need	
for	 the	 public	 facility	 and	 the	 type	 of	 development	 project	 upon	 which	 the	 fee	 is	 imposed.	
These	 fees	 were	 established	 by	 Ordinance	 and	 are	 codified	 in	 the	 Municipal	 Code	 Title	 3

unit,	3-acre	project).		In	2017,	the	fees	will	be	reduced	to	approximately	$45,645.81	for	a	single	
family	unit	and	$29,085.5	for	a	multifamily	unit.	
These	 fees	 are	 consistent	 with	 recent	 fee	 calculations	 for	 specific	 development	 projects.	 	 For	
the	recent	Westwood	single	family	project	developed	in	2014	and	2015,	the	City	and	outside	
agency	 development	 impact	 and	 utility	 connection	 fees	 collected	 totaled	 $48,350.69.	
Additional	fees	were	the	building	permit,	valuation,	plan	review,	residential	capital	facilities	fee,	
and	green	building	fees	of	$4,433.15	(electrical,	plumbing,	mechanical,	etc.),	which	were	based	
on	a	construction	valuation	of	$260,232.86	for	the	single	family	unit.			
Regional	Impact	Fee	Comparison	
The	City	of	Escalon’s	development	and	utility	connection	fees	total	approximately	$41,159	per	
single	family	unit	and	$25,250	per	multifamily	unit;	these	figures	will	be	reduced	to	$35,240	and

NON-GOVERNMENTAL	CONSTRAINTS	
Non-governmental	 constraints	 are	 those	 which	 are	 generated	 by	 the	 economic	 and	 social	
environment	which	are	beyond	the	control	of	local	governments.	Some	of	the	impacts	of	non-
governmental	constraints	can	be	offset	to	a	minimal	extent	by	local	governmental	actions,	but	
usually	 the	 effects	 are	 localized	 and	 have	 little	 influence	 on	 the	 housing	 need	 within	 the	
jurisdiction	 or	 market	 area.	 Non-governmental	 constraints	 to	 affordable	 housing	 consist	 of	
three	major	factors:	land	costs,	cost	of	construction,	and	availability	of	financing.		
The	 availability	 of	 financing	 is	 affected	 by	 factors	 that	 the	 local	 government	 cannot	 control,	
including	 capital	 levels	 of	 banks	 and	 investors,	 credit	 worthiness	 of	 borrowers,	 and	 the	
willingness	 of	 investors	 to	 supply	 capital	 for	 real	 estate.	 Regional	 demand	 for	 housing	 has	 a	
direct	impact	on	the	cost	of	land.	The	local	government	can	either	limit	or	provide	an	adequate	
supply	 of	 entitled	 land	 for	 development	 in	 order	 to	 meet	 the	 regional	 demand.	 Construction	
costs	 are	 affected	 by	 a	 variety	 of	 factors,	 including	 the	 national	 demand	 for	 materials	 and	
commodities,	 and	 the	 supply	 of	 local	 construction	 labor.	 The	 state	 of	 the	 housing	 market,	
including	land	costs,	cost	of	construction,	and	availability	of	financing,	can	affect	the	potential	
to	develop	housing	projects.		
Housing	Element	                                             	                                                                5-33	

	
COST	AND	AVAILABILITY	OF	FINANCING	
Financing	 is	 critical	 to	 the	 housing	 market.	 Developers	 require	 construction	 financing,	 and	
buyers	require	permanent	financing.	The	two	principal	ways	in	which	financing	can	serve	as	a	
constraint	 to	 new	 residential	 development	 are	 the	 availability	 and	 cost	 of	 construction	
financing	and	the	availability	and	cost	of	permanent	financing.	
    •	 If	financing	is	not	easily	available,	then	more	equity	may	be	required	for	developing	new	
        projects	and	fewer	homebuyers	can	purchase	homes,	since	higher	down	payments	are	
        required.		
    •	 Higher	 construction	 period	 interest	 rates	 for	 developers	 result	 in	 higher	 development	
        costs.	 For	 homebuyers,	 higher	 interest	 rates	 translate	 into	 higher	 mortgage	 payments	
        (for	 the	 same	 loan	 amount),	 and	 therefore	 reduces	 the	 purchasing	 power	 of	
        homebuyers.	
In	March	2016,	the	average	rate	for	a	30-year	mortgage	was	3.69	percent.		From	2005	through	
2015,	average	monthly	mortgage	rates	have	ranged	from	a	high	of	6.76	percent	in	July	2006	to	
a	low	of	3.35	percent	in	November	and	December,	2012.			For	homebuyers,	it	is	necessary	to	
pay	 a	 higher	 down	 payment	 than	 in	 the	 immediate	 past,	 as	 well	 as	 demonstrating	 credit	
worthiness	 and	 adequate	 incomes,	 so	 that	 loan	 applications	 meet	 standard	 underwriting	
criteria.		While	adherence	to	strict	underwriting	criteria	was	not	required	during	the	early	and	
mid-2000s,	the	return	to	stricter	standards	is	consistent	with	loan	standards	prior	to	2001.	
LAND	COSTS	
Cost	of	land	is	influenced	by	the	cost	of	the	raw	land,	the	cost	of	holding	the	land	during	the	
development	 process,	 and	 the	 cost	 of	 providing	 services	 to	 meet	 City	 standards	 for	
development.	 The	 cost	 of	 raw	 land	 is	 influenced	 by	 variables	 such	 as	 scarcity,	 location,	
availability	 of	 public	 utilities,	 zoning,	 general	 plan	 designation,	 and	 unique	 features	 like	 trees,	
water	frontage,	and	adjoining	uses.		
Larger	residential	acreages	(lots	ranging	from	6.5	to	135	acres)	in	the	Escalon	area	are	priced	
around	 $50,000	 and	 $75,000	 per	 acre,	 on	 average.	 Smaller	 in-fill	 residential	 lots	 range	 from	
$35,000	to	$75,000	for	a	0.16-acre	to	0.44-acre	lots.		
COST	OF	CONSTRUCTION	
Construction	costs	include	both	hard	costs,	such	as	labor	and	materials,	and	soft	costs,	such	as	
architectural	and	engineering	services,	development	fees,	and	insurance.	Rising	costs	of	labor	
and	materials	have	contributed	to	non-governmental	constraints	on	housing	development	and	
improvements.	 These	 costs	 were	 a	 substantial	 part	 of	 the	 increased	 housing	 costs	 during	 the	
1990s	through	2005.	Builders	passed	those	increases	along	to	the	homebuyer	or	renter.	As	the	
value	of	homes	turned	downward	with	the	recession,	construction	costs	also	decreased.		
The	 cost	 of	 residential	 construction	 varies	 significantly.	 	 Construction	 costs	 in	 Escalon	 run	
approximately	$105	to	$130	per	square	foot.		The	source	of	this	figure	was	a	review	of	building	
permit	 valuations.	 	 Escalon	 uses	 the	 International	 Conference	 of	 Building	 Officials	 good	
Housing	Element	                                    	                                                      5-34	

	
standard	for	a	basis	of	building	permit	fees.		Additional	costs,	which	average	from	$40	to	$60	
per	 square	 foot	 of	 residential	 construction,	 account	 for	 site	 improvements.	 	 The	 recent	
Westwood	single	family	subdivision	had	total	construction	valuation	costs	of	$131	per	square	
foot.	 	 While	 no	 multifamily	 developments	 have	 been	 built	 in	 Escalon	 in	 the	 past	 five	 years,	 a	
recent	 multifamily	 development	 in	 nearby	 Ripon	 had	 construction	 costs	 of	 approximately	
$87,500	per	unit,	or	$73	per	square	foot.	
Current	 construction	 cost	 estimates	 for	 multifamily	 homes	 in	 San	 Joaquin	 County,	 show	 that	
hard	costs	still	account	for	approximately	70	percent	of	the	building	cost	and	soft	costs	average	
around	25	percent	(the	remaining	5	percent	is	land	costs).	For	single	family	homes,	hard	costs	
currently	account	for	roughly	50	percent	of	the	building	cost,	soft	costs	are	30	percent	and	land	
is	the	remainder.				
Construction	cost	increases,	like	land	cost	increases,	affect	the	ability	of	consumers	to	pay	for	
housing.	 	 Construction	 cost	 increases	 occur	 due	 to	 the	 cost	 of	 materials,	 labor,	 and	 higher	
government	 imposed	 standards	 (e.g.,	 energy	 conservation	 requirements).	 	 In	 the	 past	 five	
years,	 the	 development	 community	 produced	 market	 rate	 for-sale	 housing	 in	 Escalon	 that	 is	
affordable	to	moderate	and	above	moderate	income	households.		
AT	RISK	HOUSING	UNITS	
Housing	 Element	 Law	 requires	 that	 there	 be	 an	 analysis	 of	 existing	 or	 potential	 “at-risk”	
assisted	housing	developments,	which	are	eligible	to	convert	to	market-rate	housing	over	the	
next	 ten	 (10)	 years.	 The	 conversion	 may	 be	 due	 to	 the	 termination	 of	 a	 subsidy	 contract,	
mortgage	prepayment,	or	expiration	of	use	restrictions.	“Assisted	housing	developments”	are	
multi-family	rental	housing	projects	that	receive	or	have	received	government	assistance	under	
federal	programs	listed	in	the	Housing	Element	Law,	state	and	local	multi-family	revenue	bond	
programs,	 local	 redevelopment	 programs,	 the	 federal	 Community	 Development	 Block	 Grant	
Programs,	or	local	in-lieu	fees.	
ASSISTED	MULTIFAMILY	UNITS	IN	ESCALON	
In	the	City	of	Escalon	there	are	42	affordable	housing	units	reportedly	in	good	condition	which	
are	currently	subsidized.	These	units	are	funded	under	the	following	federal	programs:	
Project-Based	Section	8:	Section	8	is	a	rent	subsidy	program	in	which	tenants	pay	no	more	than	
30%	of	their	income	for	rent	with	HUD	paying	the	difference	up	to	the	contract	rent	amount.	
Project-based	 Section	 8	 contracts	 have	 terms	 of	 up	 to	 20	 years,	 except	 for	 those	 financed	 by	
the	California	Housing	Finance	Agency,	which	have	terms	of	30	years.	The	owner	of	units	that	
are	subsidized	under	Section	8	are	able	to	renew	their	contracts	on	an	annual	basis	after	the	
contract	expires.		
Section	 202	 Supportive	 Housing	 for	 the	 Elderly.	 The	 Section	 202	 program	 helps	 expand	 the	
supply	 of	 affordable	 housing	 with	 supportive	 services	 for	 the	 elderly.	 It	 provides	 very	 low-
income	elderly	with	options	that	allow	them	to	live	independently	but	in	an	environment	that	
provides	support	activities	such	as	cleaning,	cooking,	transportation,	etc.	The	program	is	similar	
to	Supportive	Housing	for	Persons	with	Disabilities	(Section	811).	
Housing	Element	                               	                                                       5-35	

	
There	is	only	one	assisted	multifamily	housing	developments	in	Escalon,	as	shown	in	Table	5-12.		
There	are	no	units	that	at-risk	of	converting	to	market-rate	housing	over	the	next	ten	years.	The	
Heritage	 House	 complex	 has	 42	 units	 that	 are	 financed	 under	 a	 Section	 202	 contract.	 The	
Section	 202	 maturity	 date	 is	 in	 2027.	 This	 complex	 is	 also	 subsidized	 under	 a	 supplemental	
Section	8/202	contract	that	is	renewed	on	an	annual	basis	every	May.	As	the	expiration	date	of	
the	Section	202	contract	nears,	these	units	will	still	be	considered	lower	risk	because	they	are	
owned	 by	 a	 non-profit	 that	 has	 a	 primary	 mission	 of	 providing	 affordable	 housing	 to	 the	
community.

TERMINATION	NOTICE	REQUIREMENTS	
State	 law	 (§65863.10	 of	 the	 Government	 Code)	 requires	 notice	 by	 owners	 who	 want	 to	
terminate	 their	 rental	 restrictions	 (Section	 8	 and	 federally	 assisted	 mortgages),	 whose	
restrictions	 expire	 (tax	 credit	 projects),	 or	 who	 want	 to	 sell	 an	 assisted	 property.	 The	 law	
applies	to	projects	with	low-income	rental	restrictions,	including:	1)	all	types	of	project-based	
Section	 8	 developments;	 2)	 projects	 with	 mortgages	 financed	 through	 the	 Section	 221	 (d)	 (3)	
BMIR,	Section	236,	Section	202	programs	or	Section	515;	and	3)	projects	that	have	received	an	
allocation	of	tax	credits	under	Section	42.	
Two	 notices	 are	 required:	 one	 at	 twelve	 months	 prior	 to	 termination	 or	 expiration	 of	 the	
restrictions,	 and	 a	 second	 notice	 at	 six	 months.	 The	 purpose	 of	 these	 notices	 is	 to	 inform	
tenants,	local	governments,	local	housing	authorities,	and	the	California	Department	of	Housing	
and	Community	Development	(HCD)	of	the	owner’s	intention	to	terminate	restrictions.	
California	law	also	contains	an	“option	to	make	an	offer	to	purchase”	(Section	65863.11	of	the	
Government	 Code).	 The	 purpose	 of	 this	 provision	 is	 to	 provide	 buyers	 willing	 to	 preserve	 an	
assisted	 project	 with	 an	 opportunity	 to	 try	 to	 purchase	 the	 development	 from	 the	 seller.	 An	
owner	 who	 chooses	 to	 terminate	 rental	 restrictions	 or	 whose	 restrictions	 are	 expiring	 is	
required	 to	 provide	 a	 notice	 to	 potential	 qualified	 buyers.	 An	 owner	 with	 an	 assisted	 project	
also	 must	 provide	 notice	 if	 selling	 the	 project	 would	 result	 in	 discontinuance	 of	 the	 use	
restrictions.

A	 notice	 must	 be	 sent	 to	 all	 qualified	 entities	 who	 register	 with	 the	 State	 Housing	 and	
Community	 Development	 Department	 (HCD)	 on	 their	 website	 or	 who	 contact	 the	 owner	
directly.	 This	 notice	 must	 be	 sent	 12	 months	 prior	 to	 sale	 or	 termination	 by	 registered	 or	
certified	mail,	as	well	as	posted	in	the	project.	
Active	Termination	Notices	
There	 are	 not	 currently	 any	 private	 owners	 of	 assisted	 multifamily	 rental	 housing	 units	 in	
Escalon	 who	 are	 considering	 no	 longer	 providing	 rental	 restrictions	 and	 converting	 restricted	
units	 to	 market-rate	 units	 that	 have	 filed	 notice	 with	 the	 California	 Housing	 and	 Community	
Development	Department.	
QUALIFIED	ENTITIES	
Housing	 element	 law	 states	 that	 the	 analysis	 shall	 also	 identify	 public	 and	 private	 non-profit	
corporations	 known	 to	 the	 local	 government	 which	 have	 legal	 and	 managerial	 capacity,	 and	
interest	 in	 acquiring	 and	 managing	 assisted	 housing	 developments.	 Qualified	 Entities	 are

RESOURCES	
Federal,	state,	and	local	funding	sources	and	programs	provide	assistance	for	the	development,	
conservation,	and	rehabilitation	of	housing,	particularly	affordable	housing,	in	Escalon.			
LOCAL	FUNDING	SOURCES	
The	 City	 currently	 has	 one	 City-managed	 funding	 source	 to	 assist	 with	 the	 development	 of	
affordable	housing.		The	City	has	collected	approximately	$817,000	in	the	Affordable	Housing	
fund,	 which	 is	 funded	 by	 fees	 collected	 in	 lieu	 of	 affordable	 housing	 requirements	 under	 the	
City’s	Affordable	Housing	Ordinance.		There	is	currently	$32,351	in	funds	available	to	assist	with	
the	 development	 of	 new	 affordable	 housing.	 	 The	 Affordable	 Housing	 fund	 was	 reduced	 by	
$800,000	to	make	an	inter-fund	loan	to	the	City	Hall	Development	Impact	fund,	as	allowed	by	
Government	Code	Section	66066(1)(g).		This	loan	was	approved	by	the	City	Council	in	June	2013	
and	 has	 a	 20-year	 maturity	 with	 a	 fluctuating	 interest	 rate,	 based	 on	 the	 Local	 Agency	
Housing	Element	                                      	                                                     5-37	

	
Investment	Fund	(LAIF).		The	balance	of	the	loan	as	of	November	2017	is	$783,707.		If	the	City	
receives	a	request	for	these	funds,	the	City	can	make	a	subsequent	inter-fund	loan	to	cover	the	
City’s	affordable	housing	obligations.	
FEDERAL	AND	STATE	FUNDING	SOURCES	
Housing	providers	in	Escalon	have	access	to	a	variety	of	existing	and	potential	funding	sources	
available	 for	 affordable	 housing	 activities,	 including	 new	 development,	 rehabilitation,	 and	
preservation	 of	 existing	 affordable	 units.	 These	 include	 local,	 State,	 Federal	 and	 private	
resources.	The	largest	housing	funding	sources	available	for	housing	production,	rehabilitation,	
or	 preservation	 include	 the	 Community	 Development	 Block	 Grants,	 Tax	 Credits,	 USDA	 Rural	
Development	loans,	HOME	Investment	Partnership	Program	grants,	Section	8,	and	Emergency	
Shelter	Grants.		
Community	Development	Block	Grant	(CDBG)	program.	CDBG	funds	are	awarded	to	entitlement	
communities	 on	 a	 formula	 basis	 for	 housing	 activities.	 Funding	 is	 awarded	 on	 a	 competitive	
basis	 to	 each	 participating	 city.	 Activities	 eligible	 for	 CDBG	 funding	 include	 acquisition,	
rehabilitation,	economic	development	and	public	services.		The	City	of	Escalon	receives	CDBG	
funds	 annually,	 typically	 in	 the	 $75,000	 range,	 through	 the	 San	 Joaquin	 Urban	 County	 and	
HOME	 Consortium.	 	 These	 funds	 can	 be	 utilized	 for	 the	 replacement	 of	 substandard	 housing,	
rehabilitation	 of	 lower	 income	 owner-occupied	 and	 rental-occupied	 housing	 units,	 and	 other	
programs	that	assist	households	with	incomes	at	or	below	80	percent	of	median	income.	The	
funds	 can	 also	 be	 used	 to	 offset	 infrastructure	 costs	 in	 support	 of	 affordable	 housing	
development.		
HOME	Program.	HOME	funds	are	granted	by	a	formula	basis	from	HUD	to	increase	the	supply	
of	decent,	safe,	sanitary,	and	affordable	housing	to	lower	income	households.	Eligible	activities	
include	new	construction,	acquisition,	rental	assistance	and	rehabilitation.	The	City	participates	
in	 the	 San	 Joaquin	 County-administered	 HOME	 Program,	 which	 administers	 HOME	 funds	 to	
projects	 in	 participating	 jurisdictions.	 	 County-administered	 HOME	 funds	 for	 first	 time	
homebuyer	 assistance	 are	 made	 available	 to	 residents	 or	 employees	 of	 the	 local	 jurisdictions	
participating	in	the	HOME	program.		New	development	projects	are	typically	allocated	funding	
on	a	competitive	basis.		The	City	of	Escalon	receives	HOME	funds,	typically	up	to	$17,000	each	
year,	 through	 the	 San	Joaquin	Urban	County	and	HOME	Consortium.		Funds	may	be	used	for	
rehabilitation,	acquisition	and/or	new	construction	of	affordable	housing.	At	least	90	percent	of	
the	households	assisted	must	be	at	or	below	60	percent	of	median	income.		
Section	 8	 Housing	 Choice	 Voucher	 Program.	 The	 Section	 8	 Housing	 Choice	 Voucher	 Program	
provides	 monthly	 rental	 assistance	 payments	 to	 private	 landlords	 on	 behalf	 of	 low-income	
families	 who	 have	 been	 determined	 eligible	 by	 the	 San	 Joaquin	 Housing	 Authority.	 The	
program's	 objective	 is	 to	 assist	 low-income	 families	 by	 providing	 rental	 assistance	 so	 that	
families	 may	 lease	 safe,	 decent,	 and	 sanitary	 housing	 units	 in	 the	 private	 rental	 market.	 The	
program	 is	 designed	 to	 allow	 families	 to	 move	 without	 the	 loss	 of	 housing	 assistance.	 Moves	
are	permissible	as	long	as	the	family	notifies	the	Housing	Authority	ahead	of	time,	terminates	
its	existing	lease	within	the	lease	provisions,	and	finds	acceptable	alternate	housing.		There	are	
12	Section	8	vouchers	in	use	in	Escalon.	
Housing	Element	                                 	                                                     5-38	

	
Section	8	–	Project	Based	Assistance.	The	Section	8	Project-Based	program	is	a	component	of	
the	Housing	Choice	Voucher	program.	The	program's	objective	is	to	induce	property	owners	to	
make	standard	housing	available	to	low-income	families	at	rents	within	the	program	limits.	In	
return,	the	Housing	Authority	or	HUD	enters	into	a	contract	with	the	owner	that	guarantees	a	
certain	level	of	rents.		
Section	811/202	Program	(Supportive	Housing	for	Persons	with	Disabilities/Elderly)	–	Non-	profit	
and	 consumer	 cooperatives	 can	 receive	 no	 interest	 capital	 advances	 from	 HUD	 under	 the	
Section	 202	 program	 for	 the	 construction	 of	 Very-Low	 Income	 rental	 housing	 for	 seniors	 and	
persons	with	disabilities.	These	funds	can	be	used	in	conjunction	with	Section	811,	which	can	
be	 used	 to	 develop	 group	 homes,	 independent	 living	 facilities	 and	 immediate	 care	 facilities.	
Eligible	activities	include	acquisition,	rehabilitation,	new	construction	and	rental	assistance.	
Affordable	 Housing	 Innovation	 Program	 (AHIP)	 –	 Loan	 and	 Practitioner	 Funds.	 The	 AHIP

Development,	 the	 AHSC	 Program	 funds	 land-use,	 housing,	 transportation,	 and	 land	
preservation	 projects	 to	 support	 infill	 and	 compact	 development	 that	 reduce	 greenhouse	 gas	
("GHG")	 emissions.		 Funding	 for	 the	 AHSC	 Program	 is	 provided	 from	 the	 Greenhouse	 Gas	
Reduction	Fund	(GGRF),	an	account	established	to	receive	Cap-and-Trade	auction	proceeds.	
Building	 Equity	 and	 Growth	 in	 Neighborhoods	 (BEGIN).	 BEGIN	 provides	 grants	 to	 local	
jurisdictions	to	make	deferred	payment	second	mortgage	loans	to	qualified	first-time	low-	and

current	funding	is	offered	for	this	program.	
California	 Community	 Reinvestment	 Corporation	 (CCRC).	 The	 California	 Community	
Reinvestment	 Corporation	 is	 a	 multifamily	 affordable	 housing	 lender	 whose	 mission	 is	 to	
increase	 the	 availability	 of	 affordable	 housing	 for	 Low	 Income	 families,	 seniors	 and	 residents	
with	special	needs	by	facilitating	private	capital	flow	from	its	investors	for	debt	and	equity	to	
developers	of	affordable	housing.	Eligible	activities	include	new	construction,	rehabilitation	and	
acquisition	of	properties.

sponsors	through	its	acquisition/rehabilitation	program.		
Emergency	Housing	and	Assistance	Program	(EHAP).	EHAP	provides	funds	to	local	government	
agencies	 and	 non-profit	 corporations	 for	 capital	 development	 activities	 and	 facility	 operation	
for	 emergency	 shelters,	 transitional	 housing	 and	 safe	 havens	 that	 provide	 shelter	 and	
supportive	services	for	homeless	individuals	and	families.	No	current	funding	is	offered	for	this	
program.		
Emergency	 Shelter	 Grant.	 The	 purpose	 of	 the	 Emergency	 Shelter	 Grants	 (ESG)	 Program	 is	 to	
provide	emergency	shelter	and	related	services	to	the	County's	homeless	populations.	Eligible	
activities	include:	the	rehabilitation	and	conversion	of	buildings	for	use	as	emergency	shelters;

and	 homeless	 prevention/rapid	 rehousing	 activities.	 ESG	 funds	 administered	 by	 San	 Joaquin	
County	can	be	used	within	the	Urban	County.		
Federal	 Home	 Loan	 Bank	 System.	 The	 Federal	 Home	 Loan	 Bank	 System	 facilitates	 Affordable	
Housing	 Programs	 (AHP),	 which	 subsidize	 the	 interest	 rates	 for	 affordable	 housing.	 The	 San	
Francisco	Federal	Home	Loan	Bank	District	provides	local	service	within	California.	Interest	rate	
subsidies	 under	 the	 AHP	 can	 be	 used	 to	 finance	 the	 purchase,	 construction,	 and/or	
rehabilitation	of	rental	housing.	Very	low	income	households	must	occupy	at	least	20	percent	
of	the	units	for	the	useful	life	of	the	housing	or	the	mortgage	term.		
Governor’s	 Homeless	 Initiative.	 The	 Governor’s	 Homeless	 Initiative	 is	 an	 interagency	 effort	
aimed	 at	 reducing	 homeless.	 The	 funding	 program	 component	 of	 the	 Governor’s	 Homeless	
Initiative	 assists	 with	 the	 development	 of	 permanent	 supportive	 housing	 for	 persons	 with	
severe	mental	illness	who	are	chronically	homeless.	It	is	a	joint	project	of	HCD,	CalHFA,	and	the	
Department	of	Mental	Health	(DMH).		
Housing-Related	 Parks	 Program.	 	 This	 program	 is	 intended	 to	 increase	 the	 overall	 supply	 of	
housing	affordable	to	lower	income	households	by	providing	financial	incentives	to	cities	and	
counties	with	documented	housing	starts	for	newly	constructed	units	affordable	to	very	low	or	
low-income	 households.	 	 Applications	 will	 be	 invited	 through	 issuance	 of	 a	 Notice	 of	 Funding	
Availability	(NOFA)	for	each	year	that		
Infill	Infrastructure	Grant	Program.	The	program	funds	infrastructure	improvements	to	facilitate	
new	 housing	 development	 with	 an	 affordable	 component	 in	 residential	 or	 mixed	 use	 infill

construction,	 rehabilitation	 and	 acquisition	 of	 owner-	 and	 renter-occupied	 housing	 units	 for	
Housing	Element	                                  	                                                  5-40	

	
agricultural	workers,	with	a	priority	for	lower	income	households.	No	current	funding	is	offered	
for	this	program.	
Low	 Income	 Housing	 Tax	 Credits.	 The	 California	 Tax	 Credit	 Allocation	 Committee	 (CTCAC)	
administers	 the	 federal	 and	 state	 Low-Income	 Housing	 Tax	 Credit	 Programs.	 Both	 programs	
were	 created	 to	 encourage	 private	 investment	 in	 affordable	 rental	 housing	 for	 households	
meeting	certain	income	requirements.	Under	these	programs,	housing	tax	credits	are	awarded	
to	 developers	 of	 qualified	 projects.	 Twenty	 percent	 of	 federal	 credits	 are	 reserved	 for	 rural	
areas,	 and	 ten	 percent	 for	 non-profit	 sponsors.	 To	 compete	 for	 the	 credit,	 rental	 housing	
developments	have	to	reserve	units	at	affordable	rents	to	households	at	or	below	46	percent	of	
area	median	income.	The	assisted	units	must	be	reserved	for	the	target	population	for	55	years.	
The	federal	tax	credit	provides	a	subsidy	over	ten	years	towards	the	cost	of	producing	a	unit.	
Developers	 sell	 these	 tax	 benefits	 to	 investors	 for	 their	 present	 market	 value	 to	 provide	 up-
front	capital	to	build	the	units.	Credits	can	be	used	to	fund	the	hard	and	soft	costs	(excluding	
land	costs)	of	the	acquisition,	rehabilitation,	or	new	construction	of	rental	housing.	Projects	not	
receiving	other	federal	subsidy	receive	a	federal	credit	of	nine	percent	per	year	for	ten	years	
and	a	state	credit	of	30	percent	over	four	years	(high	cost	areas	and	qualified	census	tracts	get	
increased	federal	credits).	Projects	with	a	federal	subsidy	receive	a	four	percent	federal	credit	
each	 year	 for	 ten	 years	 and	 a	 13	 percent	 state	 credit	 over	 four	 years.	 The	 CTCAC	 also	
administers	 a	 Farmworker	 Housing	 Assistance	 Program	 and	 a	 Commercial	 Revitalization	
Deduction	Program.	
Low-Income	 Housing	 Preservation	 and	 Residential	 Home	 Ownership	 Act	 (LIHPRHA).	 LIHPRHA	
requires	that	all	eligible	HUD	Section	236	and	Section	221(d)	projects	“at-risk”	of	conversion	to	
market-rate	 rental	 housing	 through	 the	 mortgage	 prepayment	 option	 be	 subject	 to	 LIHPRHA	
Incentives.	 The	 incentives	 to	 owners	 include	 HUD	 subsidies	 which	 guarantee	 owners	 an	 eight	
percent	annual	return	on	equity.	Owners	must	file	a	Plan	of	Action	to	obtain	incentives	or	offer	
the	project	for	sale	to	a)	non-profit	organizations,	b)	tenants,	or	c)	public	bodies	for	a	12	month	
period	followed	by	an	additional	three-month	sale	to	other	purchasers.	Only	then	are	owners	
eligible	to	prepay	the	subsidized	mortgages.	
Mobilehome	 Park	 Rehabilitation	 and	 Resident	 Ownership	 Program.	 	 The	 Mobilehome	 Park	
Rehabilitation	 and	 Resident	 Ownership	 Program	 finances	 the	 preservation	 of	 affordable	
mobilehome	parks	by	conversion	to	ownership	or	control	by	resident	organizations,	nonprofit	
housing	sponsors,	or	local	public	agencies.		
Multifamily	 Housing	 Program	 (MHP).	 The	 MHP	 program	 provides	 low	 interest	 loans	 to	
developers	of	affordable	rental	and	transitional	housing	projects.	Funds	may	be	used	for	new	
construction,	 rehabilitation,	 acquisition	 and	 rehabilitation,	 or	 conversion	 of	 non-residential	
structures.	
Preservation	Interim	Repositioning	Program	(PIRP).	PIRP	is	a	short-term	loan	program	designed	
to	 preserve	 housing	 at	 risk	 of	 conversion	 to	 market	 rates.	 Only	 non-profits,	 dedicated	 to	 the	
provision	 of	 affordable	 housing,	 may	 apply.	 Local	 matching	 funds,	 together	 with	 PIRP	 funds,	
may	not	exceed	20	percent	of	total	costs.	No	current	funding	is	offered	for	this	program.	
Housing	Element	                                  	                                                   5-41	

	
United	State	Department	of	Agriculture	(USDA)	Rural	Development	Loans.	USDA	offers	several	
loan	and	grant	programs	to	assist	in	the	construction	of	rental	housing	(Section	515),	ownership	
housing	(Section	502),	and	infrastructure	improvements	(Community	Facilities	Loan	Program)	in	
rural	 areas.	 The	 unincorporated	 area	 of	 the	 County	 contains	 two	 USDA	 rental	 projects	 that	
provide	127	units	for	farm	workers.	
Veterans	 Housing	 and	 Homelessness	 Prevention	 (VHHP).	 	 The	 VHHP	 program	 provides	 for	
acquisition,	construction,	rehabilitation	and	preservation	of	affordable	multifamily	housing	for	
veterans	and	their	families	to	allow	veterans	to	access	and	maintain	housing	stability.		
HOUSING	AND	SERVICES	RESOURCES	
The	agencies	and	organizations	described	below	provide	assistance	to	lower	income	and	special	
needs	households	in	the	region.	
Housing	Authority	of	the	County	of	San	Joaquin	
The	 Housing	 Authority	 currently	 assists	 more	 than	 19,000	 people	 throughout	 San	 Joaquin	
County	 through	 distribution	 of	 4,530	 housing	 vouchers,	 including	 single	 family	 homes	 spread	
throughout	 the	 county,	 and	 by	 managing	 and	 maintaining	 1,075	 units	 in	 the	 county’s	 public	
housing	 developments,	 187	 units	 of	 assisted	 multifamily	 housing,	 and	 288	 units	 of	 seasonal	
migrant	 family	 housing.	 The	 Housing	 Authority	 provides	 significant	 assistance	 through	 many	
specific	assistance	programs,	by	forming	partnerships	with	other	agencies	and	businesses,	and	
by	 overseeing	 and	 distributing	 millions	 of	 federal	 dollars	 each	 year.	 These	 programs,	
partnerships	 and	 the	 dollars	 spent	 are	 managed	 to	 specifically	 benefit	 the	 people	 of	 San	
Joaquin	County,	including	the	City	of	Escalon.		
Housing	 Choice	 Voucher	 Program.	 The	 Housing	 Choice	 Voucher	 Program,	 funded	 by	 the	 U.S.	
Department	of	Housing	and	Urban	Development,	provides	housing	assistance	to	extremely	low	
and	 very	 low-income	 families,	 senior	 citizens,	 and	 disabled	 or	 handicapped	 persons.	 Its	
objective	is	to	provide	affordable,	decent	and	safe	housing	for	eligible	families,	while	increasing	
a	family’s	residential	mobility	and	choice.	The	Voucher	Program	also	includes	programs	such	as	
Family	Self-Sufficiency	and	Welfare	to	Work.	These	are	designed	to	assist	families	in	becoming	
economically	 self-sufficient.	 A	 family	 with	 a	 voucher	 can	 chose	 which	 community	 in	 which	 to	
live,	including	the	City	of	Escalon.	The	Housing	Authority	has	4,530	vouchers	in	use	Countywide;	
there	are	currently	12	families	within	the	City	of	Escalon	that	have	vouchers.		
Supportive	 Services	 Centers.	 The	 Housing	 Authority	 administers	 four	 Supportive	 Services	
Centers	that	are	located	at	their	public	housing	developments.	These	centers	help	residents	to	
access	 the	 resources	 they	 need	 to	 become	 economically	 self-sufficient.	 Over	 400	 people	 visit	
the	 Supportive	 Services	 Centers	 each	 month.	 These	 facilities	 offer	 computer-based	 learning	
exercises	 in	 math,	 reading	 and	 writing;	 job	 readiness	 training,	 resume	 preparation	 assistance	
and	community	job	placement;	tutoring,	enrichment	and	recreational	activities;	free	computer	
and	 telephone	 access	 for	 those	 seeking	 employment;	 counseling	 services	 for	 individuals	
involved	 in	 substance	 abuse	 or	 domestic	 violence;	 daycare,	 transportation,	 social	 service	 and	
affordable	 housing	 information.	 None	 of	 these	 centers	 are	 located	 within	 the	 City	 of	 Escalon,	
but	all	are	available	to	its	residents.		
Housing	Element	                                  	                                                   5-42	

	
Family	Self-Sufficiency.	Family	Self-Sufficiency	(FSS)	is	a	program	designed	to	assist	residents	in	
becoming	independent	of	public	assistance.	With	the	help	of	local	agencies,	FSS	combines	case	
management,	education,	training,	and	supportive	services	with	rental	assistance	to	aid	families	
toward	self-sufficiency.	As	participants	become	self-sufficient,	their	housing	subsidies	become	
available	 for	 others	 wanting	 to	 succeed	 and,	 as	 they	 begin	 paying	 higher	 taxes,	 it	 helps	 to	
reduce	the	tax	burden	on	society	as	a	whole.	This	program	is	available	to	all	Section	8	Housing	
Choice	Voucher	Program	recipients	within	San	Joaquin	County.		
Farmworker	 Families.	 	 The	 Housing	 Authority	 has	 a	 31-unit	 year-round	 farm	 labor	 housing	
development	in	Thornton.	
Migrant	Families.	The	Housing	Authority	has	three	Migrant	Centers	that	total	288	units,	none	of	
which	are	within	the	City	of	Escalon.		
Direct	Assistance	Programs

income	 individuals	 in	 crisis,	 if	 they	 have	 a	 48-hour	 notice	 or	 a	 shut	 off	 notice.		 Clients	 are	
required	to	call	for	an	appointment	on	Monday	mornings	and	are	required	to	attend	an	Energy	
class	and	bring	appropriate	documents	to	receive	immediate	help	with	their	utility	bill.		
Home	 Energy	 Assistance	 Program	 (HEAP)	 assists	 low-income	 households	 to	 pay	 their	 energy	
costs.	 Assistance	 is	 in	 the	 form	 of	 a	 dual	 or	 single-party	 warrant,	 or,	 a	 direct	 payment	 to	 the	
utility	company	on	behalf	of	the	applicant.	The	amount	of	assistance	is	based	on	the	number	of	
persons	 in	 the	 household,	 total	 household	 income,	 the	 cost	 of	 energy	 within	 the	 County	 the	
household	resides	in,	and	funding	availability.	HEAP	provides	one	payment	per	year.	
PG&E	offers	assistance	to	low-income,	disabled	and	senior	citizen	customers	through	numerous	
programs	 and	 community	 outreach	 projects	 which	 include:	 California	 Alternate	 Rates	 for

Homeless	Resources	
As	part	of	the	Urban	County,	the	City	participates	in	the	Countywide	homeless	programs	and	
resources	 are	 funded	 primarily	 through	 the	 federal	 Emergency	 Shelter	 Grant	 and	 Community	
Development	Block	Grant	programs.	The	homeless	in	San	Joaquin	are	provided	shelter	primarily	
in	 Stockton,	 Lodi,	 Tracy,	 and	 Manteca.	 	 Homeless	 from	 virtually	 all	 other	 County	 towns	 are	
referred	to	Stockton.		Some	of	the	major	shelter	providers,	most	of	which	are	in	Stockton,	are	
the	 Stockton	 Shelters	 for	 the	 Homeless,	 the	 Gospel	 Center’s	 Rescue	 Mission	 and	 New	 Hope	
Family	 Shelter,	 and	 Salvation	 Army.	 	 There	 are	 over	 a	 dozen	 other	 shelter	 providers	 whose

ENERGY	CONSERVATION	
Energy	 conservation	 improvements	 offer	 the	 most	 viable	 means	 of	 addressing	 high-energy	
costs.	The	objective	of	energy	conservation	efforts	directed	towards	new	development	includes	
the	maximum	feasible	use	of	passive	or	natural	cooling	and	lighting,	which	can	be	achieved	by	
encouraging	 the	 incorporation	 of	 solar	 access.	 Examples	 of	 passive	 cooling	 opportunities	
include	 the	 design	 of	 lots	 to	 allow	 the	 proper	 orientation	 of	 a	 structure	 to	 take	 advantage	 of	
prevailing	breezes	or	available	shade.	Passive	heating	opportunities	include	the	design	of	lots	to	
allow	structures	to	be	aligned	in	an	east-west	direction	for	southern	exposure.	
CITY	ENERGY	STANDARDS	
Zoning	Code	
The	 Zoning	 Code	 addresses	 this	 issue	 in	 Section	 16.02.300	 Energy	 Conservation,	 which	 states	
that	the	design	of	a	subdivision	for	which	a	tentative	parcel	or	subdivision	map	is	required	shall	
provide,	 to	 the	 extent	 feasible,	 for	 the	 future	 passive	 or	 natural	 heating	 or	 cooling	
opportunities	 in	 the	 subdivision.	 Passive	 or	 natural	 heating	 opportunities	 include,	 but	 are	 not	
limited	 to,	 the	 design	 of	 lot	 size	 and	 configuration	 to	 permit	 orientation	 of	 a	 structure:	 in	 an	
east-west	 alignment	 for	 southern	 exposure;	 and	 to	 take	 advantage	 of	 shade	 or	 prevailing	
breezes.	Additionally,	all	residential	structures	must	meet	the	requirements	of	Title	24	relating	
to	energy	conservation	features.		
General	Plan	
The	General	Plan	sets	forth	the	City’s	approach	to	energy	conservation	within	the	Air	Quality,	
Land	 Use,	 and	 Circulation	 Elements.	 These	 elements	 were	 updated	 in	 2010	 to	 address	 air	
quality,	energy	efficiency,	greenhouse	gas	emissions,	and	particulate	matter	emissions.	
Air	 Quality	 Goal	 F	 encourages	 energy	 efficient	 building	 designs	 and	 transportation	 systems	 in	
order	 to	 conserve	 energy	 and	 reduce	 air	 emissions.	 Air	 Quality	 Policy	 2	 promotes	 energy	
efficient	 designs,	 including	 provisions	 for	 solar	 access,	 building	 siting	 to	 maximize	 natural	
heating	and	cooling,	and	landscaping	to	aid	passive	cooling	and	to	protect	from	winter	winds.	
Air	 Quality	 Policy	 8	 encourages	 new	 buildings	 and	 development	 to	 be	 designed	 for	 energy	
efficiency	 and	 reduction	 in	 greenhouse	 gas	 emissions	 through:	 construction	 methods	 and	
passive	 design	 concepts	 (siting	 and	 location),	 encouraging	 use	 of	 solar	 and	 alternative	 energy	
systems,	 and	 encouraging	 and	 accommodating	 projects	 that	 incorporate	 alternative	 energy,	
enhanced	 energy	 conservation	 measures,	 and	 other	 voluntary	 methods	 of	 reducing	 energy	
usage	and	greenhouse	gas	emissions.		Air	Quality	Implementation	Strategy	1-6	requires	the	City	
to	 review	 new	 development	 and	 rehabilitation	 projects	 consistency	 with	 policies	 related	 to	
reducing	 energy	 consumption	 and	 greenhouse	 gas	 emissions.	 	 Acceptable	 energy	 reduction	
measures	include,	but	are	not	limited	to:	
Housing	Element	                                     	                                                     5-47	

	
     •   Passive	design	concepts;	
     •   Construction	methods	(LEED	certification,	exceedance	of	Title	24	energy	standards,	and	
         green	building	methods);	
     •   Use	 of	 trees,	 landscaping,	 and	 sun	 screens	 to	 shade	 west	 and	 south	 exterior	 building	
         walls,	particularly	during	the	warm	season;	
     •   Use	 of	 energy-efficient	 water	 heating	 mechanisms	 for	 residences,	 commercial	 uses,	
         industrial	uses,	swimming	pools,	and	other	uses;	
     •   Limit	installation	of	fireplaces	and	woodburning	devices	to	EPA-certified	or	EPA-qualified	
         devices;	
     •   Provision	of	natural	gas	or	electric	outlets	in	outdoor	areas	to	encourage	use	of	energy-
         efficient	fireplaces,	barbecues,	lawnmowers,	and	other	devices;	
     •   Use	of	light	emitting	diodes	(LEDs)	for	traffic,	street,	and	other	outdoor	lighting;	
     •   Installation	 of	 “cool”	 roof	 (e.g.,	 roof	 materials	 with	 a	 high	 albedo)	 and	 pavement	
         materials;	and	
     •   Installation	of	solar	panels.	
Air	 Quality	 Implementation	 Strategy	 1-8	 encourages	 community	 services	 agencies	 and	
organizations	to	fund	energy	efficiency	projects,	including	heating,	ventilation,	air	conditioning,	
lighting,	water	heating	equipment,	insulation	and	weatherization,	for	low	income	residents.	
General	 Circulation	 and	 Street	 System	 Policy	 12	 requires	 all	 streets	 to	 be	 designed	 and	
constructed	 to	 promote	 energy	 efficiency.	 Residential	 Land	 Use	 Policy	 6	 encourages	 energy	
efficiency	 through	 requiring:	 1)	 appropriate	 landscaping	 materials	 to	 provide	 shade	 in	 the	
summer	 and	 protection	 from	 the	 weather	 in	 winter;	 2)	 eaves,	 canopies,	 and	 awnings	 along	
south	and	west	elevations;	and	3)	secured	bicycle	storage	areas	with	lock-up	capabilities.	
Residential	Construction	Standards	
The	State	of	California	has	adopted	building	standards	for	energy	efficiency	that	apply	to	newly	
constructed	dwellings	and	residential	additions.	The	California	Green	Building	Code	(CalGreen)	
(Title	 24	 of	 the	 California	 Code	 of	 Regulations)	 sets	 forth	 mandatory	 energy	 efficiency	
standards.	 	 	 The	 inclusion	 of	 CALGreen	 in	 the	 CBSC	 has	 streamlined	 energy	 efficiency	 and	
conservation	 measures	 for	 jurisdictions	 throughout	 California.	 	 CALGreen	 addresses	 energy	
efficiency	 through	 requiring	 compliance	 with	 Title	 24	 Tier	 I	 energy	 efficiency	 standards	 which	
address	 energy	 efficiency	 through	 appliances,	 air	 conditioning/heating	 units,	 water	 heating	
systems,	 windows/doors,	 insulation,	 roofing,	 lighting,	 solar-readiness,	 as	 well	 as	 requiring	
additional	 mandatory	 measures	 that	 address	 site	 development	 (stormwater	 management),	
construction	 (construction	 waste	 reduction/recycling,	 pollution	 control,)	 and	 long-term	 use	 of	
the	 residence	 (indoor	 water	 use,	 outdoor	 water	 use,	 building	 maintenance	 and	 operation,	
fireplaces,	 indoor	 air	 quality	 and	 exhaust,	 and	 interior	 moisture	 control).	 CALGreen	 has	
Housing	Element	                                   	                                                  5-48	

	
standardized	 energy	 efficiency	 throughout	 California,	 making	 the	 process	 straightforward	 for	
developers	who	often	work	in	multiple	jurisdictions.			
RETROFIT	
There	 are	 a	 number	 of	 methods	 available	 to	 improve	 conditions	 of	 existing	 structures	 and	 to	
decrease	their	energy	demand,	all	of	which	fall	under	the	general	label	of	“retrofit.”	Among	the	
most	common	techniques	for	increasing	building	efficiency	are:	insulation	of	ceilings,	heating-
ventilating	air	conditioning	ducts	and	hot	water	heaters;	weather	stripping	and	caulking;	night	
setback	 thermostats;	 spark	 ignited	 pilot	 lights;	 low-flow	 shower	 heads;	 window	 treatment	 to	
provide	 shade;	 and	 furnace	 efficiency	 modifications.	 The	 City	 of	 Escalon	 monitors	 such	
modifications	on	rehabilitation	projects	pursuant	to	the	Building	Code.	
Weatherization	 in	 existing	 dwellings	 can	 greatly	 cut	 down	 heating	 and	 cooling	 costs.	
Weatherization	is	generally	done	by	performing	or	improving	attic	insulation,	caulking,	weather	
stripping	 and	 storm	 windows,	 furnace	 efficiency	 modifications,	 and	 certain	 mechanical	
measures	to	heating	and	cooling	systems.		
Other	 means	 of	 energy	 conservation	 in	 residential	 structures	 includes	 proper	 design	 and	
location	 of	 windows,	 window	 shades,	 orientation	 of	 the	 dwelling	 in	 relation	 to	 sun	 and	 wind	
direction,	and	roof	overhang	to	let	the	winter	sun	in	and	block	the	summer	sun	out.	
RESOURCES	FOR	ENERGY	CONSERVATION	
Pacific	Gas	&	Electric	provides	a	variety	of	energy	conservation	services	for	residents	and	also	
participates	 in	 several	 other	 energy	 assistance	 programs	 for	 lower	 income	 households,	 which	
help	 qualified	 homeowners	 and	 renters,	 conserve	 energy	 and	 control	 electricity	 costs.	 The	
California	 Alternate	 Rates	 for	 Energy	 Program	 provides	 a	 15%	 monthly	 discount	 on	 gas	 and	
electric	 rates	 to	 income-qualified	 households,	 certain	 nonprofit-operated	 facilities	 housing	
agricultural	employees,	homeless	shelters,	hospices,	and	other	qualified	non-profit	group	living	
facilities.	The	Relief	for	Energy	Assistance	through	Community	Help	(REACH)	Program	provides	
one-time	energy	assistance	to	customers	who	have	no	other	way	to	pay	their	energy	bills.	The	
intent	 of	 REACH	 is	 to	 assist	 low-income	 customers,	 particularly	 the	 elderly,	 disabled,	 sick,	
working	poor,	and	the	unemployed,	who	experience	severe	hardships	and	are	unable	to	pay	for	
their	 necessary	 energy	 needs.	 	 The	 County	 HSA	 operates	 a	 weatherization	 program	 to	 assist	
eligible	homeowners	with	weatherization	improvements.

CHAPTER SIX – HOUSING PLAN
This	section	describes	the	City’s	housing	plan	for	the	planning	period.		Housing	goals,	policies,	
and	programs	for	Escalon	are	identified.	A	goal	is	defined	as	a	general	statement	of	the	highest	
aspirations	of	the	community.	A	policy	is	a	course	of	action	chosen	from	among	many	possible	
alternatives.	 It	 guides	 decision-making	 and	 provides	 a	 framework	 around	 which	 the	 housing	
programs	operate.	A	program	is	a	specific	action,	which	implements	the	policy	and	moves	the	
community	toward	the	achievement	of	its	goals.	Programs	are	a	part	of	the	City’s	5th	Housing	
Element	cycle	action	plan	and	constitute	the	City’s	local	housing	strategy.	
STATE	HOUSING	GOALS	
According	to	the	California	Statewide	Housing	Plan	Update,	it	is	the	goal	of	the	state	to	“ensure	
to	 all	 Californians	 the	 opportunity	 to	 obtain	 safe,	 adequate	 housing	 in	 a	 suitable	 living	
environment.”	 Additionally,	 the	 State	 Department	 of	 Housing	 and	 Community	 Development	
has	established	the	following	four	primary	goals:	
§   Provision	of	new	housing;	
§   Preservation	of	existing	housing	and	neighborhoods;

CHAPTER	SEVEN	–	COMMUNITY	PARTICIPATION	
Community	 participation	 was	 solicited	 and	 encouraged	 throughout	 the	 Housing	 Element	
process.		Public	participation	is	not	only	a	required	portion	of	the	update	process,	but	is	also	
important	in	understanding	the	community's	goals	and	preferences.		Community	participation	
efforts	are	described	below	for	the	development	of	the	Housing	Element.	
In	 order	 to	 engage	 the	 community	 in	 the	 Housing	 Element	 Update	 process,	 a	 series	 of	 two	
public	 outreach	 workshops,	 one	 Planning	 Commission	 hearing,	 and	 one	 City	 Council	 hearing	
were	 held.	 	 The	 public,	 including	 residents,	 businesspeople,	 housing	 advocates,	 service	
agencies,	 and	 other	 organizations	 addressing	 housing	 and	 special	 needs,	 was	 encouraged	 to	
participate	in	the	process.	A	Housing	Element	Update	survey	was	mailed	to	City	residents	and	
businesses	in	the	utility	bill	and	was	also	made	available	at	City	Hall	and	on	the	City’s	website.		
Input	 received	 through	 the	 outreach	 process	 was	 used	 to	 determine	 housing	 needs	 and	
develop	goals,	policies,	and	programs	that	addressed	the	identified	needs.	
WORKSHOPS	
Two	community	workshops	were	held	on	September	30,	2015	and	October	8,	2015	at	City	Hall		
to	 receive	 community	 input	 regarding	 the	 Housing	 Element	 update	 process	 and	 its	
requirements	and,	more	specifically,	to	identify	local	housing	priorities	and	preferences.		
In	order	to	encourage	residents,	businesspeople,	and	other	stakeholders	to	participate,	the	City	
used	multiple	outreach	outlets,	including:		
     •  Newsletters	 and	 notices	 posted	 throughout	 the	 City,	 including	 at	 City	 Hall,	 the	
        Community	Center,	Post	Office,	and	library	and	delivered	to	apartment	complexes	and	
        mobile	home	parks		
     •  Workshop	announcements	ran	in	the	local	Escalon	Times	newspaper	that	identified	the	
        workshop	dates	and	times	
The	 City	 encouraged	 the	 community	 to	 get	 involved	 and	 help	 the	 City	 address	 the	 following	
questions:	
        •    What	kind	of	new	housing	is	needed?	
        •    Where	should	new	housing	be	located?	
        •    What	can	be	done	to	make	housing	more	affordable	and	accessible	to	all?	
The	 workshops	 included	 a	 presentation	 describing	 the	 Housing	 Element	 Update	 process,	
Housing	 Element	 content	 requirements,	 and	 key	 findings	 regarding	 housing	 in	 Escalon.		
Workshop	 attendees	 were	 provided	 an	 opportunity	 to	 comment	 on	 housing	 issues	 and	
concerns.		No	comments	were	made	regarding	housing	issues	or	concerns.

HOUSING	SURVEY	
The	 City	 circulated	 a	 housing	 survey	 in	 September	 2015	 to	 collect	 information	 on	 the	
community’s	 housing	 issues	 and	 preferences.	 	 The	 City	 received	 390	 responses.	 	 Survey	
responses	are	shown	in	Appendix	B	and	housing	preferences	are	summarized	below;	it	is	noted	
that	some	respondents	answered	some	questions	with	more	than	one	answer.		
COMMUNITY	INPUT	–	HOUSING	WORKSHOPS	AND	SURVEY	
Housing	Issues	
Workshop	attendees	and	survey	respondents	identified	the	primary	housing	issues	as:	
    •   Keeping	the	small-town	feel	
    •   Maintain	slow	pace	of	growth		
    •   Provide	housing	for	seniors	
    •   Senior	housing	should	include	apartments	and	a	nice	mobile	home	park	
    •   Provide	 affordable	 housing	 options	 so	 adult	 children	 of	 residents	 can	 afford	 to	 buy	 a	
        house	in	Escalon	
    •   Enforce	housing	and	building	codes	
    •   High	 density	 development	 should	 be	 upscale	 and	 high-quality	 apartments,	
        condominiums,	and	senior	housing	
    •   Ensure	property	and	landscaping	maintenance	
    •   Provide	moderate	and	high-end	housing	
    •   Prioritize	development	on	vacant	and	in-fill	sites	within	the	City	limits	
    •   Ensure	new	homes	have	water	conservation	features	
Housing	Preferences	
Survey	 respondents	 identified	 the	 following	 priorities	 for	 new	 housing	 developed	 in	 Escalon	
(housing	types	listed	in	order	of	preference):	
    1. Senior	housing	–	31%	
    2. Single	family	homes	–	27%	
    3. Housing	for	disabled	persons	–	13%	
    4. Condos/townhomes	–	11%	
    5. Apartments	–	9%	
    6. Second	units	–	8%	
PUBLIC	REVIEW	DRAFT	HOUSING	ELEMENT		
From	 August	 25,	 2016	 to	 September	 26,	 2016,	 the	 Public	 Review	 Draft	 Housing	 Element	 was	
circulated	 for	 review	 by	 the	 public	 and	 the	 State	 Department	 of	 Housing	 and	 Community	
Housing	Element	                                	                                                     7-2	

	
Development.		The	City	published	a	Notice	of	Availability	for	the	Public	Review	Draft	Housing	
Element,	 encouraging	 the	 public	 and	 interested	 parties	 to	 review	 the	 Public	 Review	 Draft	
Housing	 Element	 and	 provide	 comments.	 	 The	 Notice	 of	 Availability	 was	 published	 in	 the	
Escalon	Times,	at	City	Hall,	and	on	the	City’s	website.		The	City	mailed	the	Notice	of	Availability	
to	 local	 service	 providers	 and	 housing	 providers	 (Escalon	 apartment	 complexes	 and	 mobile	
home	 parks).	 	 The	 Notice	 of	 Availability	 provided	 directions	 to	 comment	 on	 the	 Housing	
Element	in	writing	and	also	invited	interested	parties	to	attend	the	Planning	Commission	and	
City	Council	adoption	meetings	to	provide	input.		No	comments	were	received	during	the	public	
review	period.	
HOUSING	ELEMENT	ADOPTION	
The	Planning	Commission	reviewed	the	Housing	Element	on	October	11,	2016	and	November	1,	
2016.	 	 No	 public	 comments	 were	 received	 during	 either	 Planning	 Commission	 hearing.	 	 The	
Planning	 Commission	 adopted	 Resolution	 16-	 recommending	 that	 the	 City	 Council	 adopt	 the	
Housing	 Element,	 with	 the	 revisions	 recommended	 by	 HCD	 and	 with	 revisions	 that	 were	
discussed	by	the	Planning	Commission.	
The	City	Council	held	a	public	hearing	to	consider	the	Housing	Element	on	November	21,	2016.	
One	public	comment	was	made	identifying	a	concern	that	water	and	sewer	priority	provisions	
may	preclude	residents	from	building	a	home.	It	was	noted	during	Council	discussion	that	the	
City	 currently	 has	 adequate	 capacity	 to	 accommodate	 development	 planned	 by	 the	 General	
Plan	within	the	City	limit	and	is	adequate	to	accommodate	the	RHNA.	The	City	Council	adopted	
the	 Housing	 Element	 on	 November	 21,	 2016,	 inclusive	 of	 the	 revisions	 recommended	 by	 the	
Planning	Commission	and	HCD.

INTRODUCTIO
                                                                                        Introduction
INTRODUCTION
California state law requires each city and county to adopt a General Plan “for the physical development
of the county or city, and any land outside its boundaries which bears relation to its planning” (§65300).
The California Supreme Court has called the General Plan the “constitution for future development.”
Escalon’s General Plan expresses the community’s development goals and embodies public policy relative
to the distribution of future land uses, both public and private. State law speciﬁes that each General Plan
address seven issue areas: land use, circulation, open space, conservation, housing, safety and noise.
The Escalon General Plan provides comprehensive planning for the future. It encompasses what the City
is now, what it intends to be, and provides the overall framework of how to achieve this future condition.
Estimates are made about future population, household types, and employment, so that plans for land
use, circulation and public facilities can be made to meet future needs. The General Plan represents
an agreement on the fundamental values and a vision that is shared by the residents and the business
community of Escalon and the surrounding area of interest. Its purpose is to provide decision makers and
staff of the City of Escalon with direction for confronting present issues, as an aid in coordinating planning
issues with other governmental agencies, and for navigating the future.
     The Land Use Element provides the central policy context on which to base all land use decision
      making in Escalon. It is through the implementation of the goals, objectives, and policies, that the
      future land use pattern of Escalon will continue to be shaped.
     The Housing Element looks at the current and future need for housing units, the capacity in the City
      for additional units, the types of households that will need some form of assistance or special housing,
      and ways to perpetuate existing housing.
     Transportation routes, design standards for streets, and current and future trafﬁc levels on City streets
      are among the issues covered in the Circulation Element of the General Plan.
     Conservation issues include strategies for an orderly transition from agriculture to urban uses,
      groundwater recharge, conservation of ground water resources, and commitment to conservation of
      agricultural lands by establishing a greenbelt around the City.
General Plan                                                                                   Adopted June 6, 2005
City of Escalon                                                                                                I-1

Introduction
     Open space and recreation issues include discussion of parks and recreation resources, targeted growth
      of these facilities, and targeting open space to function in a multi-use capacity.
     Existing and future noise from trafﬁc, rail and other activities are issues discussed in the Noise
      Element.
     The Safety Element of the General Plan analyzes conditions in the City and surrounding area that
      may be hazardous to those who live and work there, such as ﬂood inundation, ﬁre and hazardous
      materials.
Each of these issue areas have goals, objectives, and policies designed to provide a safe and pleasant
environment in the future. Escalon’s General Plan contains not only the seven mandatory elements
required by state law, but also several additional elements. These include: Public Facilities, Economic
Development, Community Design, Urban Boundary, and Air Quality. Each General Plan chapter covers
an aspect of the City’s growth and development. Components of each section are interrelated and therefore
must be consistent with each other. Taken together, they provide the guidance for all aspects of planning
for the future.
Having adopted the General Plan, the City assumes the responsibility to implement it, to report on its
continuous status, and to communicate with citizens and other agencies regarding the Plan’s policies.
Organization of the General Plan
This General Plan is an update, expansion and reorganization of the 1994 General Plan. Signiﬁcant
changes to the 1994 General Plan have occurred; including expanding the boundaries of the Sphere of
Inﬂuence (SOI) to include all four corners of the Brennan Avenue and State Route 120 intersection and
the Campbell Avenue and State Route 120 intersection; the inclusion of 10-year growth boundaries; an
updated circulation system; and a new Planning Area beyond the SOI. The Planning Area encompasses
the City limits and SOI, and unincorporated territory bearing a relation to the City’s planning.
The Escalon General Plan consists of three separate documents – a General Plan Background Report,
Policies Statement, and the environmental impact report and technical appendices. The General Plan
Policies document contains ten (10) chapters. The focus of each element consists of goals, objectives
and policies associated with the major issue areas. Some of the elements contain related background
information required by State law. The environmental impact report presents the three alternatives and
documents how the proposed plan will impact the environment as compared to the alternative plans. The
technical appendices contain technical reports and background information which provide a more detailed
analysis.
Context
The Escalon General Plan Project Area is located within southeast San Joaquin County, approximately
nine miles north of Modesto and 12 miles east of Manteca. The Escalon General Plan covers an eight
square mile Planning Area which encompasses the City of Escalon and unincorporated San Joaquin
 General Plan                                                                                 Adopted June 6, 2005

County, inclusive of the City’s SOI. All lands outside of the City’s SOI are regulated by the San Joaquin
County General Plan and zoning designations. However, State law requires that cities plan for areas
outside of their immediate jurisdiction, if the areas have a direct relationship to planning needs.
The Escalon Project Area consists of three distinct geographical areas: The City, which represents the
incorporated City within the City limit boundaries; the existing SOI which is slightly larger than the City’s
previous SOI; and the Planning Area, which includes unincorporated San Joaquin County lands outside
of the City’s SOI.
Intent of the Plan
This General Plan was developed through a cooperative effort involving the City Council and Planning
Commission, City staff and their consultants, and interested citizens who participated in “vision
workshops.” The General Plan Update process disclosed that expansion of employment, recreation and
industrial opportunities, are concerns which have been instrumental in shaping the plan.
The Planning Commission and City Council adopted Planning Principles on January 8, 2004 which helped
to guide the development of the General Plan and asked that a General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC)
review the policies appropriate to implement these principles, to develop a land use plan, and to develop
appropriate zoning designations and regulations in conformance with the General Plan. The Planning
Principles are as follows:
    Escalon’s friendly, small town atmosphere should be preserved by ensuring diverse, appropriate scale
     retail services; citizen participation in decision making; quality of public schools and adequacy of
     public services.
    The Growth Control Ordinance should be continued to ensure that public services and infrastructure can
     be provided, and that new residents can be socially and physically accommodated in the community.
    Additional services and facilities should be planned so that Escalon provides a full range of medical,
     ofﬁce, retail, convenience and entertainment services that are needed by residents.
    The role of the downtown as a focal point for the community should be preserved. Adequate expansion
     area should be planned so that it will grow in proportion to the rest of the community. Sites for more
     retail, entertainment, specialty stores and medical services should be identiﬁed.
    The commercial opportunities afforded by Highway 120 should be capitalized on.
    Development in the community should be compact and contiguous to existing developed areas. New
     development areas should “square off” existing developed areas.
    The City’s Sphere of Inﬂuence and growth policies should ensure that the community is physically
     distinct from others and contains an agricultural buffer area.
General Plan                                                                                  Adopted June 6, 2005
City of Escalon                                                                                         Page I - 3

Introduction
     Trafﬁc conﬂicts should be resolved, including connectivity between neighborhoods, access to
      industrial areas, and critical intersections. Growth should be allocated with accessibility constraints in
      mind.
     Local streets and minor collector streets should be used to provide connectivity between neighborhoods
      while limiting cross-town trips through neighborhoods. Collector and local roads should be designed
      to provide good, safe connectivity between neighborhoods, services and facilities.
Administering the General Plan Program
Once adopted, the General Plan does not remain static. State law provides direction on how cities can
maintain the plan as a contemporary policy guide. Government Code section 65400 [b] directs the
Planning Department to report annually to the City Council on the status of the plan and progress in its
implementation.
Over time it may be necessary to re-evaluate the goals, objectives and polices and modify them due
to changes in the environment, regional considerations, and the economy. Up to four general plan
amendments per year for each mandatory element are permitted by State law. It is required that any
decision on a general plan amendment be supported by ﬁndings of fact.
General Plan Requirements
While they allow considerable ﬂexibility, state planning laws do establish some requirements for the
issues that general plans must address. The California Government Code establishes both the content of
general plans and rules for their adoption and subsequent amendment. Together, state law and judicial
decisions establish three overall guidelines for general plans.
     The General Plan must be comprehensive. This requirement has two aspects. First, the General
      Plan must be geographically comprehensive. That is, it must apply throughout the entire incorporated
      area and it should include other areas that the City determines are relevant to its planning. Second, the
      General Plan must address the full range of issues that affects the City’s physical development.
     The General Plan must be internally consistent. This requirement means that the General Plan
      must fully integrate its separate parts and relate them to each other without conﬂict. The internal
      consistency requirement has ﬁve dimensions: equal status among elements, consistency between
      elements, consistency within elements, area plan consistency and text and diagram consistency.
     The General Plan must be long-range. Since the General Plan affects the welfare of current and
      future generations, state law requires that the plan take a long-term perspective (§65300). The
      General Plan projects conditions and needs into the future as a basis for determining objectives. It
      also establishes long-term policies for day-to-day decision-making based upon those objectives.

NOISE ELEMENT
                                                                                        Noise Element
1.0        NOISE ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
Noise levels within the community of Escalon affect the quality of life of people living and working in
the City. The most signiﬁcant noise levels within the community are associated with the railroad lines
and roadways. High noise levels associated with these and other activities can create stress and irritation.
The Noise Element addresses the physiological, psychological and economic effects of noise by providing
effective strategies to reduce excessive noise and limit community exposure to loud noise sources.
PURPOSE OF THE NOISE ELEMENT
Government Code § 65302 (F) states that a City’s General Plan must include “A noise element which shall
identify and appraise noise problems in the community. The noise element shall recognize the guidelines
established by the Ofﬁce of Noise Control in the State Department of Health Services and shall analyze
and quantify, to the extent practicable, as determined by the legislative body, current and projected noise
levels for all of the following sources:
           1.   Highways and freeways
           2.   Primary arterials and major local streets.
           3.   Passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and ground rapid transit systems.
           4.   Commercial, general aviation, heliport, helistop, and military airport operations, aircraft
                overﬂights, jet engine test stands, and all other ground facilities and maintenance functions
                related to airport operation.
           5. Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad classiﬁcation yards.
           6. Other ground stationary noise sources identiﬁed by local agencies as contributing to the
                community noise environment.”
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE NOISE ELEMENT
The State of California recognizes the relationship between noise and noise-sensitive uses and has adopted
State Guidelines for Noise Elements. This Noise Element satisﬁes the requirements of State planning law
and is a mandated component of the General Plan. Government Code Section 65302 (f) establishes the
required components of the Noise Element. The Element also complies with California Health and Safety
General Plan                                                                                     Adopted June 6, 2005

 Noise Element
 Code Section 56050.1 guidelines for Noise Elements.
 Future noise conditions from short- and long-term growth are quantiﬁed and identiﬁed as noise exposure
 contours. This noise information serves as the basis for developing guidelines for identifying compatible
 land uses; identifying the proper distribution of land uses on the General Plan Land Use Map; and
 establishing proper development standards.
 The Noise Element comprises four sections: the Introduction; Purpose of the Noise Element; Scope
 and Content of the Noise Element; and the Goals, Objectives and Policies. In the Goals, Objectives,
 and Policies section, major issues pertaining to noise sources are identiﬁed and related policies are
 established. The objectives are statements of the City’s desires and comprise broad statements of purpose
 and direction. The policies and standards serve as guides for reducing or avoiding adverse noise impacts
 on the population.
 OBJECTIVES
 A. To protect the citizens of the City from the harmful and annoying effects of exposure to excessive
      noise.
 B. To protect the economic base of the City by preventing incompatible land uses from encroaching upon
      existing or planned noise-producing uses.
 C. To preserve the tranquility of residential areas by preventing noise producing uses from encroaching
      upon existing or planned noise-sensitive uses.
 D. To educate the citizens of the City concerning the effects of exposure to excessive noise and the
      methods available for minimizing such exposure.
 E. To emphasize the reduction of noise impacts through careful site planning and project design, giving
      second preference to the use of noise barriers and/or structural features to buildings containing noise-
      sensitive land uses.
 POLICIES AND STANDARDS
      1. Areas shall be recognized as noise impacted if exposed to existing or projected future noise levels
            at the exterior of buildings in excess of 65 dB Ldn (or CNEL).
      2. Noise sensitive land uses should be discouraged in noise impacted areas unless effective mitigation
            measures are incorporated into the speciﬁc design of such projects to reduce exterior noise levels
            to 65 dB Ldn (or CNEL) or less and 45 dB Ldn (or CNEL) or less within interior living spaces.
            Noise sensitive land uses include hospitals, residences, schools, churches, and other uses of a
            similar nature as determined by the Planning Director.
General Plan                                                                                   Adopted June 6, 2005
City of Escalon                                                                                           Page 1 - 2

      3. Industrial, commercial or other noise generating land uses should be discouraged if resulting noise
           levels will exceed 65 dB Ldn (or CNEL) at the boundary areas of planned or zoned noise sensitive
           land uses. Noise generating land uses should not be located near roadways or railways that exceed
           65 dB(A).
      4. The City shall enforce applicable State Noise Insulation Standards (California Administrative
           Code, Title 24) and Uniform Building Code (UBC noise requirements).
      5. New equipment and vehicles purchased by the City should comply with noise level performance
           standards consistent with the best available noise reduction technology.
      6. The preferred method of noise control used is thoughtful site design. Secondarily, noise control
           should be achieved through the use of artiﬁcial noise barriers. Site and building design guidelines
           may include:
           a. Noise sensitive land uses should not front onto the primary noise source. Where this is not
                possible, the narrow portion of the building should face the primary noise source, and the
                interior layout should locate the most sensitive areas away from the noise source by placing
                garages, storage facilities, carports or other such areas nearest the noise source.
           b. Site design should permit noise to pass around or through a development. This can be achieved
                by placing the narrow or convex portion of the structure toward the primary noise source.
           c. Commercial and industrial structures should be designed so that any noise generated from the
                interior of the building is focused away from noise sensitive land uses.
           d. Two-story residential construction should be avoided, where possible, immediately adjacent
                to arterials or collectors unless an adequate combination of noise attenuation procedures are
                used.
           e. When possible, residential cul-de-sacs should be perpendicular to adjacent arterials or
                collectors.
           f. Loading and unloading activities for commercial uses should be conducted in an enclosed
                loading dock, preferably with a positive seal between the loading dock and trucks.
      7. The City shall review all relevant development plans, programs and proposals to ensure their
           conformance with the policy framework outlined in this Noise Element.
      8. Prior to the approval of a proposed development in a noise impacted area, or the development of
           an industrial, commercial or other noise generating land use in or near an area containing existing
           or planned noise sensitive land uses, an acoustical analysis may be required if any of the following
           ﬁndings are made:
General Plan                                                                                      Adopted June 6, 2005

 Noise Element
            a. The existing or projected future noise exposure at the exterior of buildings which will contain
                noise sensitive uses or within proposed outdoor activity areas (patios, decks, backyards, pool
                areas, recreation areas, etc.) exceeds 65 dB Ldn (or CNEL).
            b. Interior residential noise levels resulting from offsite noise are estimated to exceed 45 dB(A).
            c. Estimated or projected noise levels cannot be reduced to the noise exposure limitations
                speciﬁed in this Noise Element by the application of Standard Noise Reduction Methods.
 When noise studies are necessary they should:
            a. Be the responsibility of the applicant.
            b. Be prepared by an individual or ﬁrm with demonstrable experience in the ﬁelds of environmental
                noise assessment and architectural acoustics.
            c. Include representative noise level measurements with sufﬁcient sampling periods and locations
                to adequately describe local conditions.
            d. Include estimated noise levels in terms of dB Ldn (or CNEL) for existing and projected future
                conditions, with a comparison made to the adopted policies of the Noise Element.
            e. Include recommendations for appropriate mitigation measures to achieve compliance with the
                adopted policies and standards of the Noise Element.
            f. Include estimates of noise exposure after the prescribed mitigation measures have been
                implemented. If compliance with the adopted standards and policies of the Noise Element will
                not be achieved, a rationale for acceptance of the project must be provided.
            g. Be prepared as early in the project review or permitting process as possible, so that noise
                mitigation measures may be an integral part of the project design, rather than an afterthought.
      9. Reduce downtown noise levels by re-routing truck trafﬁc off of Main Street in downtown. Truck
            trafﬁc is only permitted along 3rd Street from SR 120 to Main and along Main Street from 3rd
            Street south to Santa Fe.
      10. Noise created by temporary activities necessary to provide construction or required services should
            be permitted for the shortest duration possible and limited to time periods that will have the least
            possible adverse impact on surrounding land uses.

 3.0        OPEN SPACE, CONSERVATION AND RECREATION ELEMENT
 INTRODUCTION
 Some of the most valuable assets of Escalon include its agricultural land, parks, historical and architectural
 resources. The Open Space, Conservation and Recreation Element focuses on the protection and
 enhancement of open space, natural and recreational resources to ensure a high quality living environment
 in Escalon.
 PURPOSE OF THE OPEN SPACE, CONSERVATION AND RECREATION ELEMENT
 The Open Space, Conservation and Recreation Element meets the state requirements for Conservation and
 Open Space Elements as deﬁned in Sections 65302(d) and 65301(e) of the Government Code. According
 to these requirements, the Conservation element must contain goals and policies to protect and maintain
 natural resources such as water, soils, wildlife, and minerals, and prevent wasteful resource exploitation,
 degradation, and destruction. The Open Space Element must contain goals and policies to manage open
 space areas, including undeveloped lands and outdoor recreation areas. Speciﬁcally, the Open Space
 Element must address several open space categories such as those used for the preservation of natural
 resources and managed production of resources, as well as open space maintained for public health and
 safety reasons. This last category of open space is addressed in the Safety Element. Because the subjects
 required to be addressed under the Conservation Element and Open Space Element overlap substantially,
 the two elements, and the Recreation Element have been combined for this Plan.
 SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE OPEN SPACE, CONSERVATION AND RECREATION
 The Open Space, Conservation and Recreation Element expresses community policies to protect
 environmental, open space and recreational resources. Resources addressed in this element include:
 water resources; agricultural resources; cultural resources; ecological and biological resources; mineral
 resources; and parks and recreational facilities. Because everyday activities in Escalon affect air quality
 outside City boundaries and regional activities affect air quality within Escalon, regional air quality issues
 are also addressed in this element.
 The Open Space, Conservation and Recreation Element is comprised of four sections: the Introduction;

 4.0        ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
 INTRODUCTION
 Escalon is a small agricultural community in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley. Many opportunities exist
 for expanding the existing commercial and industrial employment base. Escalon wishes to keep that small
 town charm, but at the same time provide an equal mix of jobs and housing and an increase in industrial
 opportunities.
 PURPOSE OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
 The purpose of the Economic Development Element is
 to provide guidance for economic development within
 the City of Escalon in order to attain an economically
 viable and self-sustaining community. In this sense,
 economically viable means providing a range of
 housing and employment opportunities that meet the
 needs of both residents and workers, attracting families
 and businesses to create demand for planned land uses,
 and establishing and funding public service levels that
 preserve or enhance Escalon’s quality of life.
 The Economic Development Element is an optional element of Escalon’s General Plan. Authority for the
 Economic Development Element is found in State Government Code Section 65303, which allows cities
 and counties to add optional elements beyond the State-mandated elements. Once adopted, an optional
 element carries the same legal weight as any of the other elements. The Economic Development Element
 is not a required element in the General Plan. The City has prepared one in order to consolidate and codify
 a growing body of policy concerning the economic and ﬁscal viability of Escalon.
 SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
 The Economic Development Element establishes goals, objectives and policies to guide City efforts to
 maintain an economically viable community. In this sense, economically viable means providing a range
 of housing and employment opportunities that meet the needs of both residents and workers, that attract

 families and businesses to create demand for planned land uses, and that establish and fund public service
 levels to preserve Escalon’s quality of life.
 The Economic Development Element is comprised of four sections: the Introduction; Purpose of the
 Economic Development Element; Scope and Content of the Economic Development Element; and the
 Goals, Objectives, and Policies. In the Goals, Objectives, and Policies section, the City’s economic
 development needs are identiﬁed and corresponding policies established. The goals and objectives are
 comprised of the City’s broad statements of purpose and direction. The polices and standards serve as
 guidelines for providing adequate industrial, commercial and ofﬁce land, infrastructure improvements,
 and a commercial, industrial and residential balance.
 GOAL
 Foster and maintain a high quality of life for the City’s residents by sustaining and developing a strong
 and diverse local economy.
 OBJECTIVES
 A. To achieve and maintain a balance of jobs and housing in Escalon.
 B. To ensure that there is adequate industrial land that is adequately located and served to
      accommodate the needs of new employers.
 C. To actively recruit new businesses, and retain existing ones, which generate local employment
      opportunities and sales tax revenues while assisting existing businesses in maintaining and
      enhancing sales, employment, and the appearance of their buildings.
 D. Ensure that there is adequate infrastructure improvements which promote commercial and
      industrial development.
 E. To encourage a balance of commercial and industrial uses which support a strong and diverse
      economic base, which provide adequate ﬁscal revenues, and which are compatible with the
      needs of the community.
General Plan                                                                               Adopted June 6, 2005

                                                                                          Economic Development Element
4.1         Adequate Industrial, Commercial and Ofﬁce Land
POLICIES AND STANDARDS
      1. Coordinate economic development planning with land use planning. This shall include locating light
            and heavy industrial uses in locations that are most convenient for the community to serve, and to plan
            the size of industrial parcels that are most appropriate to meet the needs of the prospective employers.
            Heavy industrial uses shall be limited to the industrial areas south of Clough Avenue; light industrial
            uses should be permitted north of State Highway 120 and west of the Santa Fe railroad tracks.
      2. The City should designate property in the industrial areas for an appropriate mix of large and
            small parcels. Approximately one-fourth of properties should be less than 5 acres, one-fourth
            should be for mid-sized parcels of between ﬁve and ten acres, approximately one-fourth should
            be for parcels of 10 to 20 acres, and one-fourth for properties larger than 20 acres.
      3. Since rail service is important to 10-25 percent of industrial users, and given the community’s
            signiﬁcant rail-service assets, at least 20 percent of the parcels should be available to be served by
            rail. Encourage rail service in southern undeveloped areas. Adequate heavy truck access should
            be provided for the remainder of the parcels.
      4. Encourage economic development activities which provide, either through initial stages or through
            expansion, the opportunity for career employment of local residents in jobs that will enable them
            to live in Escalon.
      5. Commercial areas are encouraged to cluster in identiﬁed areas such as the downtown to prevent
            and discourage strip development. Where appropriate, locate commercial uses at focal points
            along major arterial streets such as McHenry Avenue and State Route 120.
      4.2        Employer Recruitment and Retention
      1. Encourage the preservation and expansion of existing industrial uses in areas
            designated as industrial.           Land use that may conﬂict with employment-generating
            uses should be discouraged from locating adjacent to industrial areas.
      4.3        Infrastructure Improvements
      1. The City shall ensure that there is at least a 10-year supply (80 acres) of zoned and vacant
            commercial and industrial land inside the City limits at any one time. The City will ensure that
            infrastructure is installed or programmed in the Capital Improvement Program for a ﬁve-year
            supply of land so that such property is “ready-to-go.” The City should develop an Industrial
            Park Speciﬁc Plan for the Southern Industrial Area to ensure that such supply is available.
      2. If necessary, the City should encourage annexations and non-renewal of ag preserves to ensure
            that key industrial and commercial properties are available for development when necessary.

 Economic Development Element
      3. Plan and implement circulation improvements which eliminate the constraints to development
            of the Southern Industrial area, and development of a loop industrial street.
      4. Conduct an economic development/redevelopment feasibility study, and implement a plan to
            ﬁnance needed infrastructure improvements, downtown improvements, and to remove substandard
            building conditions. The project should be used to “front-load” infrastructure improvement for
            key economic development activities.
      4.4       Commercial, Industrial and Residential Balance
      1. In the downtown area, retail, ofﬁce, ﬁnancial, government, and professional services shall be
            encouraged to expand the current business mix and increase the area’s economic viability as a
            destination point for shopping, work, dining, and entertainment. The City should plan for the
            expansion of the downtown area on the westerly side of Main Street, where possible, and along
            the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Street corridors between Main Street and SH 120. Future expansion should be
            considered from Main Street to McHenry. Both of the above are intended to provide expansion of
            the downtown and exposure to the community’s main trafﬁc arteries.
      2. Based on projected population needs in the community, and the existing cross-commuting patterns,
            the City shall ensure that there is an adequate amount of ofﬁce and industrial land to serve the
            needs of the community for the next 20 years. This will mean that at least 100 industrial acres will
            be needed to provide employment opportunities for those currently leaving the community and 75
            to 100 industrial acres to accommodate new residents with this zone. Additional land shall also
            be planned to accommodate the relocation of industrial uses from the core of the community to
            designated industrial areas.
      3. Maintain a balance of Commercial and Industrial uses in Escalon. The growth in Commercial
            and Industrial employment shall not substantially exceed the rate of growth in local residential
            population to eliminate the possibility that the community’s jobs-housing balance will worsen.
            The amount of commercial and industrial land shall also be balanced with the amount of residential
            land so that the overall general plan will be ﬁscally positive. This will mean that at least four (4) but
            not more than nine (9) acres of residential land should be developed for each acre of commercial
            and industrial space in the community.
      4. Encourage increased cooperation between the public and private sectors, such as the
            Chamber of Commerce, non-proﬁt and community groups, service clubs, plant managers,
            and business associations, in formulating economic development plans and programs.
      5. Enhance the downtown area as a focal point for civic and tourist activities.

AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
                                                                         Air Quality Element
5.0 AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Air Quality Element is intended to protect the public’s health and welfare by implementing
measures that allow the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District to attain Federal and
State air quality standards, that will move toward a sustainable level of air quality. To achieve this
goal, the Element sets forth a number of policies and standards to reduce current pollution
emissions and to require new development to include measures to comply with air quality
standards. In addition, this Element contains provisions to address new air quality requirements.
California Government Code Section 65303 enables a county or city to adopt “any other elements
or address any other subjects, which, in the judgment of the legislative body, relate to the physical
development of the county or city.” The City of Escalon has adopted the Air Quality Element to
help the community meet ambient air quality standards established by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board.
PURPOSE OF THE AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
The purpose of the Air Quality Element is to identify air quality problem areas and implement
policies and standards to address those problem areas. Without the implementation and
maintenance of appropriate air quality standards, threats to public health and a declining quality of
life may result. The Air Quality Element, although not mandated by state planning law, has been
included in Escalon’s General Plan to ensure a healthy environment through the management of our
air resources.
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
The Air Quality Element includes goals, objectives and policies for minimizing the number and
length of vehicle trips, transportation alternatives, and for requiring area and stationary source
projects that generate significant amounts of air pollutants to incorporate air quality mitigation in
their design.
GOAL
To protect the health and welfare of Escalon residents by promoting development and planning
practices that are compatible with air quality standards and regional efforts to improve air quality.

2. Require area and stationary source projects that would have a significant air quality impact,
     either individually or cumulatively, to incorporate adequate air quality mitigation in their
     design, including:
         The use of best available and economically feasible control technology for stationary
         industrial sources;
         The use of EPA-certified wood stoves in new residential units;
         The use of new and replacement fuel storage tanks at refueling stations that are clean fuel
         compatible, if technically and economically feasible;
         The promotion of energy efficient designs, including provisions for solar access, building
         siting to maximize natural heating and cooling, and landscaping to aid passive cooling and
         to protect from winter winds
3. Require development projects, infrastructure projects, and land use plans to include strategies
     to minimize the number and length of vehicle trips, which may include:
         Promoting commercial/industrial project proponent sponsorship of van pools or club buses;
         Encouraging commercial/industrial project day care and employee services at the
         employment site;
         Encouraging the provision of transit, especially for employment-intensive uses of 200 or
         more employees;
         Providing incentives for the use of transportation alternatives;
         Providing expansion and improvement of public transportation services and facilities,
         including bike lanes, pedestrian walkways, and bus stops.
4. Encourage transportation alternatives to motor vehicles by developing infrastructure amenable
     to such alternatives by doing the following:
         Consider right-of-way requirements for bike usage in the planning of new arterial and
         collector streets and in street improvement projects;
         Require that new development be designed to promote pedestrian and bicycle access and
         circulation;
         Provide safe and secure bicycle parking facilities at major activity centers, such as public
         facilities, employment sites, and shopping and office centers.

        Locate air pollution point sources, such as manufacturing and extracting facilities in areas
        designated for industrial development and separated from residential areas and sensitive
        receptors (e.g., homes, schools, and hospitals);
        Establish buffer zones (e.g., setbacks, landscaping) within residential and other sensitive
        receptor site plans to separate those uses from highways, arterials, hazardous material
        locations and other sources of air pollution or odor;
        Consider the jobs/housing/balance relationship (i.e., the proximity of industrial and
        commercial uses to major residential areas) when making land use decisions; Provide for
        mixed-use development through land use and zoning to reduce the length and frequency of
        vehicle trips;
        Accommodate a portion of the projected population and economic growth of the City in
        areas having the potential for revitalization;
        Locate public facilities (libraries, parks, schools, community centers, etc.) with
        consideration of transit and other transportation opportunities;
        Encourage small neighborhood-serving commercial uses within or adjacent to resident
        neighborhoods when such areas are aesthetically compatible with adjacent areas; do not
        create conflicts with neighborhoods schools, minimize traffic, noise, and lighting impacts;
        encourage and accommodate pedestrian and bicycle access; and, are occupied by
        commercial uses that have a neighborhood-scale market area rather than a community-wide
        market area;
        Encourage a development pattern that is contiguous with existing developed areas of the
        City.
6. Continue to implement broad-scale General Plan strategies to decrease the generation of air
    pollution and greenhouse gas emissions through the reduction of vehicle miles traveled,
    excessive vehicle traffic congestion, and excessive engine idling by providing public
    transportation options and making land use planning decisions that encourage pedestrian,
    bicycle, and transit trips rather than private passenger vehicle trips.
7. Minimize exposure of the public to toxic air pollutant emissions and noxious odors from
    industrial, manufacturing, and processing facilities through requiring an adequate distance
    between sensitive receptors and industrial sites, major arterials, and hazardous material
    locations.
8. Encourage new buildings and development designed to be energy efficient. Reduce energy
    consumption and greenhouse gas emissions through:
        Requiring new development to be energy-efficient through passive design concepts (e.g.,
        siting and location) and construction methods;
        Encourage use of solar and alternative energy systems;

CIRCULATION ELEMENT
                                                                          Circulation Element
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE CIRCULATION ELEMENT
The state General Plan Guidelines recommend that the circulation policies and plans should:
         Coordinate the transportation and circulation system with planned land uses;
         Promote the safe and efficient transport of goods and the safe and effective movement of all
         segments of the population;
         Make efficient use of existing transportation facilities; and
         Protect environmental quality and promote the wise and equitable use of economic and
         natural resources.
The Guidelines indicate that the Circulation Element should address all facets of circulation
including streets and highways, transportation corridors, public transit, railroads, bicycle and
pedestrian facilities, and commercial, general, and military airports. The Escalon Circulation
Element fulfills state requirements with a plan to provide effective circulation facilities supporting
desired community development. Along with circulation, public utilities must be addressed in the
General Plan. Instead of addressing utilities within the Circulation Element, the Escalon General
Plan contains a Public Services and Facilities Element that discusses the provision of utilities and
public services/facilities. This element contains goals, objectives, and policies and standards to
improve overall circulation in Escalon. For vehicular transportation, a hierarchical roadway network
is established with designated roadway types and design standards. The roadway type is linked to
anticipated trafﬁc levels, and acceptable levels of service are established to determine when
capacity improvements are necessary. Because local circulation is linked with the regional system,
the element also focuses on participation in regional programs to alleviate trafﬁc congestion and
construct capacity improvements. Alternative transportation modes are also emphasized in this
element to reduce dependency on the automobile and thereby improve environmental quality.
GOAL
To design and maintain a fully integrated local network that provides for safe and convenient
circulation using a variety of transportation modes.
OBJECTIVES
A. Maintain a roadway level of service (LOS) of D or better on local streets, Minor Collectors,
     Collector and Arterial streets.
B. Enhance the availability and accessibility of alternative modes of transportation, such as
     walking, bicycling, carpools, buses and rail.

C. Improve neighborhood livability by ensuring that streets are related to other aspects of the
    community, that enhance and contribute to Escalon's small town charm, provide safe and
    pleasant conditions for residents, and have adequate emergency access.
D. Design streets that promote safe and pleasant conditions for residents, pedestrians, bicyclists,
    and motorists on neighborhood streets, while preserving access for emergency vehicles, buses,
    and other users.
E. Eliminate truck conflicts with commercial and residential areas in the community.
6.1 General Circulation and Street System
1. Periodically evaluate the adequacy of traffic impact fees for providing sufficient funding for
    circulation network improvements necessitated by planned future growth.
2. Incorporate features such as bus shelters, bicycle storage, bicycle racks and park and ride lots into
    the design of public and private development projects.
3. Designate a network of bicycle routes providing safe passage throughout the City; establish
    linkages between schools, parks and the designated bikeway.
4. Require bicycle storage facilities as a condition of approval for multi-family residential
    development projects containing 10 or more units and for all commercial and public
    development proposals.
5. Conduct an assessment of existing parking requirements and consider reducing them as a means
    of attracting commercial development.
6. Discourage truck traffic along Main Street in order to facilitate and encourage pedestrian access
    to downtown.
7. Provide additional landscaping, including street trees, along existing roadways. Utilize reclaimed
    water where feasible to irrigate roadway landscaping.
8. The City will budget for traffic improvements in the Capital Improvement Program each fiscal
    year.
9. Over-design of streets including streets that are too wide for projected traffic volumes shall be
    avoided to save lives, property and money.
10. In the interest of reducing housing production costs and City maintenance costs, street widths
    should be minimized. Where appropriate, private streets and other design features to reduce
    street
11. Lighting and Landscape Districts and other mechanisms shall be promoted and encouraged for
    the maintenance and operation of new appurtenances to residential streets.
12. Streets shall be designed and constructed to promote energy efficiency.

13. In new residential subdivisions, to the maximum extent possible, local streets should be aligned
     in an east-west orientation.
14. All new local streets and Minor Collectors shall have a minimum planting strip of 6 feet in
     width. Within the planting strip, the maximum spacing between trees shall be 25 feet on center.
15. Local residential streets shall be kept at a curb to curb width of 32 - 36 feet and provided with
     shade to prevent excessive heat build-up.
16. Design the street network with multiple connections and relatively direct routes for pedestrians,
     bicyclists as well as motorists.
17. To facilitate emergency response times, all new residential development shall have a Network
     Connectivity Rating of 1.4 or higher. In order to accomplish this, loop-lanes should be
     encouraged.
18. Residential streets shall be designed with sidewalks on both sides. Sidewalks shall be a
     minimum width of six feet to provide enough room for two pedestrians to walk side by side.
     Sidewalks and bike lanes shall be shaded by trees for pedestrian comfort.
19. Provide pedestrians and bicyclists with shortcuts and alternatives to travel along high volume
     streets by designing pedestrian and bicycle pass-through pathways at cul-de-sac bulbs adjacent
     to Arterial roadways.
20. Through-streets and Collectors or Arterials should be no more than over a half-mile apart.
21. Short streets, trees, on-street parking, tee intersections, use of terminating vistas and traffic
     calming devices should be used to limit vehicle speed.
22. Use traffic calming measures to keep speeds on streets that provide direct access to homes down
     to 20 mph. (See Table 6-1)
23. Streets shall be designed in accordance with projected traffic volumes and city-adopted level of
     service standards. Oversized streets shall be discouraged.
24. Connectivity shall be encouraged and provided which permits vehicular and non-vehicular
     circulation within a neighborhood without exclusive reliance on perimeter Collectors and
     Arterials.
25. The right-of-way for the circulation system shall be developed and dedicated to the appropriate
     extent when development or division of property occurs. General Plan
26. Street widening and right-of-way acquisition in existing developed areas shall be undertaken
     when required for obvious safety reasons, such as trends towards higher accident rates or
     marked decline in overall levels of service.
27. Established truck routes shall be maintained. New truck routes should be limited to Arterials
     and Collectors.
General Plan                                                                   Updated October 18, 2010

28. Minor Collectors shall be used to provide connectivity within neighborhoods as shown in
    Figure 6-1. These streets shall have offsets, and/or other traffic calming features, in
    conformance with table 6-1, to discourage through-traffic. They should also be designed to
    avoid four way intersections, when possible.
29. Minor Collector streets shall provide access to traffic generating land uses such as schools,
    hospitals, shopping and recreation areas.
30. Arterials shall be designated to provide cross-town, through-town, and inter-city traffic.
    Frequent drive approaches shall be discouraged, where possible, to facilitate traffic fl ow and
    reduce potential traffic conflicts and hazards.
31. Direct access (driveways) to individual dwelling units to Arterials shall be prohibited. Direct
    access to Collector streets with projected traffic volumes at full build-out in excess of 2,000
    average daily trips, shall also be prohibited.
32. Overnight truck (tractor-trailer) parking shall be prohibited in residential areas, or other areas
    that are deemed inappropriate.
33. Traffic calming features may be used in accordance with Table 6-1. Passive traffic calming
    features such as road curvature and width, narrowings, street offsets and other built-in features
    are preferred over roadway obstructions such as speed humps or tables, chicanes, barriers,
    diverters, or traffic islands.
34. Minor Collectors and Local streets shall not carry an unreasonable level of through traffic. If it
    is determined that a Local street or Minor Collector is carrying an unacceptable level of through
    traffic, the City may take appropriate means to reduce traffic through creation of one-way traffic
    fl ow, installation of traffic diversion devices, and/or any other means deemed to be acceptable
    under the Vehicle Code of the State of California. For the purposes of this policy an
    unreasonable level of traffic may be deemed to exist when traffic exists that is 25 percent in
    excess of the volume that would be expected from land uses directly served by these streets.
35. Maintain pedestrian, bicycle, transit, and automobile connections in existing neighborhoods and
    developments.
Arterial Streets
36. Arterial streets shall be built at a typical separation of one (1) mile with a typical right-of-way
    of 110 feet as shown in Figure 6-1 and 6-2.

     Arterials and Collectors. Raised medians shall be installed as required to restrict unsafe turning
     movements.
42. Collector streets shall be up to four lanes for through traffic and may include an optional median
     for left turn access to local streets and adjacent land uses. On street parking may be provided
     where street capacity does not require left turns or four through lanes.
43. Arterials and Collectors in areas of existing development shall be built to standards consistent
     with a policy of reducing impacts on adjacent properties.
44. Where possible, Arterials and Collectors should form 4-leg, right-angle intersections; jog, offset
     and skewed intersections of major streets in near proximity shall be avoided where possible.

     schools and other areas with significant pedestrian traffic. Whenever feasible, pedestrian paths
     shall be developed to allow for unobstructed pedestrian ﬂow from within a neighborhood.
47. Where Arterial and Collector streets are required, residential development shall be oriented
     away (side-on or rear-on) from such streets, and properly buffered so that the traffic carrying
     capacity of the street will be preserved and the residential environment be protected from the
     adverse effects of the street.
48. Adequate access shall be provided to high intensity land use areas such as employment centers,
     shopping areas, and recreation facilities.
49. Due to the traffic congestion which results from numerous points of ingress and egress along
     commercial streets, future commercial developments or modiﬁcations to existing developments

        such as through-block connections or other accessibility methods. These street linkages may
        include access roads, open ended cul de sacs, pedestrian paths, or other such facilities for
        pedestrian and bike access, and emergency access, where necessary. Linkages should be
        made to abutting Collector or Arterials no less frequently than every 600 feet.
Local Streets
53. Local Streets shall be designed in accordance with adopted standards with right-of-way widths
    in conformance with Figure 6-2.
    a. 56-foot Local streets (32-feet curb to curb) may be used in cul-de-sacs or on Local streets
        that will have traffic volumes that do not exceed 750 ADT.
    b. Local street lengths should be short, preferably not exceeding 500 feet, or they shall be
        designed with gentle curves and changes in grade to limit the sight line to 500 feet.
    c. A majority of streets should be curved or terminate so that no street vista is longer than 500
        feet.
    d. Traffic calming features such as curb extensions, traffic circles and medians may be used to
        encourage slower traffic speeds, in accordance with Table 6-1.
    e. Local streets should be aligned to form three-way intersections when possible, in order to
        create inherent right-of-way assignment and to reduce accidents without the use of traffic
        controls.
    f. Local streets that intersect an Arterial should be aligned with another street to form a four-
        way intersection. Local streets that intersect a Collector should provide for an offset. These
        streets should be designed so that they can easily be regulated by a stop sign or other traffic
        control device, if necessary.
    g. Curb cuts for driveways to individual residential lots shall be prohibited along Arterial
        streets. Curb cuts shall be limited to intersections with other streets or access drives to
        parking areas for commercial, civic or multifamily uses. Clear sight triangles shall be
        maintained at intersections, unless controlled by traffic signal devices.
    h. Pedestrian accessibility from adjacent residential neighborhoods shall be provided by the
        usage of through-block connections or other accessibility methods. These street linkages

          for pedestrian and bike access, and emergency access, where necessary. Such a linkage
          shall be made to abutting Collector or Arterials no less frequently than every 600 feet.
54. The Subdivision Ordinance, Zoning Ordinance or other applicable City codes and ordinances
     shall be amended to include standards to address the policies and objectives of the Circulation
     Element.
55. Where alternate build out is not immediately needed, major traffic facilities may be phased so
     that there is adequate increase in economy.
6.2 Parking and Onsite Circulation
1. Parking standards will be evaluated to ensure that parking requirements are satisfied within
     walking distance of development, and so that Arterial and collector streets do not separate
     parking from the parking demand generator.
2. Soften the impact of expansive parking areas in all land use designations through landscaping
     and tree plantings as prescribed in the City Zoning Ordinance.
3. Maintain street tree lines and landscaped buffers between parking surfaces and street right-of-
     ways.
4. Facilitate and encourage adequate parking throughout the community including all commercial
     areas.

     for pedestrian circulation, and open space use.
5. Ensure convenient and safe pedestrian crossings.
6. Pedestrian and bicycle access shall be provided on Local streets and Minor Collectors to enable
     pedestrians to have access through a neighborhood, to shopping areas, to transit stops, schools
     and other such facilities.

    where there is no demonstrated need, such as industrial and rural residential areas.
10. Encourage the inclusion of green belts and common open space for pedestrian use within the
    residential development areas.
11. Require that Collector streets which are identiﬁed to function as links for the bicycle
    transportation system be provided with Class II bikeways (bike lanes) or show an alternative
    route. Arterial streets shall provide for a Class I or Class II bike routes. In such cases, the City
    shall accommodate cyclists on these identiﬁed streets by widening the street or eliminating on-
    street parking wherever possible.
12. Design bicycle and pedestrian paths so that interaction with vehicular trafﬁc is minimized.
13. Require the provision for safe bicycle circulation in all new developments, including bicycle
    parking facilities and internal bicycle and pedestrian routes.

Circulation Element
4. The transportation facilities are interdependent, and efforts shall be made to ensure an efficient
     system by coordination of local and regional efforts. The regional and local transit links must be
     closely related and synchronized to provide maximum efficiency and transfers.
5. Coordinate the City's dial-a-ride system with regional transit services.
6. Arterials and Collectors will be designed to allow transit vehicles to pull out of traffic. This
     policy may be implemented with either a continuous parking lane with bus stops, or with special
     bus pull-out lanes.
7. Give a high priority to public transportation systems which are responsive to the needs of the
     commuter, aged, handicapped and disadvantaged.
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES
1-1.      As part of the project review process for new development, large-scale redevelopment, and
          long-term planning projects, consult with transit providers to: identify appropriate locations
          for transit facilities, when appropriate, determine project impacts on transit operations and
          long-range transit plans, and ensure that impacts are mitigated.

     Belota Road, Santa Fe south of 3rd Street, and 3rd Street between Main Street and SR 120 as
     Truck Routes (reference Figure 6-3). Truck Routes on City Local, Collector and Minor
     Collector streets shall be prohibited.
2. The City will continue to encourage the construction of the City's Arterial Street system as part of
     the countywide network, and to seek non-local funding for its construction.
3. The City shall encourage Caltrans and the County to modify signage so as to direct through and
     truck traffic along SR 120 and McHenry/Escalon-Belota Rd, and to use Santa Fe and River
     Road as the preferred route for through traffic.

LAND USE ELEMENT
                                                                            Land Use Element
7.0     LAND USE ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Element is a guide to future land use within Escalon and affects many of the issues
addressed in the other General Plan elements. The Land Use Element identifies the type and
location of future land uses within the City. The specific land uses and their location within the
community in turn affect the remaining General Plan elements. For example, the location and type
of land uses outlined in the Land Use Element affect the circulation system that is identified in the
Circulation Element, and the land uses identified in the Land Use Element also reﬂect the
community's goals for its future form and character, as outlined in the Community Design Element.
In addition to land uses, the Land Use Element also addresses how growth will occur, with special
attention given to public services and facilities and economic development.
PURPOSE OF THE LAND USE ELEMENT
As a city, state law requires that Escalon prepare and adopt a General Plan as a tool to manage
growth and development. The Land Use Element is one of the seven mandatory elements of the
General Plan.
The purpose of the Land Use Element is to describe present and planned land uses and their
relationship to the community's long-range goals for the future. The Land Use Element identifies
the proposed general distribution, location, and extent of land uses such as residential, commercial,
industrial, and public/quasi public. The element consists of text and a map (reference map pocket)
that outline the future land uses within the City and how these uses are integrated with the other
General Plan elements and policies. The Land Use Map is a particularly important feature of the
element since it shows the location, and types of development within the City. The element also
describes the intensity or density of development planned for the community. The general location
of future growth is also defined in the element.
The Land Use Element of the Escalon General Plan represents the City's desire for long-range
changes and enhancements of land uses. Finally, the goals, objectives and policies contained in this
element establish the framework for future land use planning and decision making in Escalon.

SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE LAND USE ELEMENT
The Land Use Element complies with the requirements of the General Plan Land Use Element
mandated in Government Code Section 65302(a). The element is comprised of five sections: the
Introduction, Purpose of the Land Use Element, Scope and Content of the Land Use Element,
Goals, Objectives, and Policies, and Land Use Map. In the Goals, Objectives, and Policies section,
major land use issues are identified and related goals and policies are established to address these
issues. The goals, which are overall statements of community desires, are comprised of broad
statements of purpose and direction. Policies serve as guides for reviewing development proposals,
planning facilities to accommodate anticipated growth, and accomplishing community economic
development strategies. To achieve the goals, objectives, and policies, a logical, organized land use
pattern is established with standards for future community development. The Land Use Map
graphically identifies the planned land uses within Escalon.

7.2 Residential Land Use
OBJECTIVES
A. Ensure adequate land area is available
     for future housing needs.
B. Provide new residential areas that offer a
     variety of housing densities, types, sizes,
     costs and locations to meet projected
     demand throughout the community.
C. Identify locations for multi-family
     developments which are accessible to
     transportation routes, commercial areas,
     schools, and recreation facilities.
D. Goal: To enhance and maintain the
     quality of life in Escalon and to
     encourage a community identity and a
     pride in that identity.
POLICIES AND STANDARDS
1. Give priority consideration to infill development of vacant and underutilized land within the
     City limits through expedited permit processing. Consideration shall be given to financially
     assisting such development through special infrastructure financing programs.
2. Consider annexations which are consistent with the extension of public services and facilities
     and other City policies and plans. The City shall maintain at least a 10-year supply of zoned
     land in the City for all residential land use types, and a minimum five-year supply of "ready to

    go" zoned land served by infrastructure. Designate an adequate amount of residential land in the
    General Plan for a 30-year supply of single-family and multifamily land uses.
3. In reviewing proposals for changes in land use to or from a residential land use, a
    fiscal/economic impact analysis shall be completed to ensure that the change is fiscally and
    economically beneficial to the City. The City shall also determine if the change will result in a
    residential land use inventory that is insufficient to meet the City's Regional Housing Needs
    Allocation.
4. Encourage the use of site development techniques which ensure that a good mix of housing
    types is provided through such methods as inclusion of duplexes on corner lots in low-density
    areas where they can be made to be compatible with surrounding development.
5. Plan and coordinate residential development in close proximity to planned urban facilities and
    services such as schools, parks, sanitary sewer, water, storm drainage, circulation network,
    transportation facilities and commercial centers.
6. Promote comprehensively planned and high quality building and site design for multi-family
    developments with the following criteria:
        Exterior Elevations-Use design features such as offsets, balconies, projections, landscaping
        or similar elements to preclude large expanses of uninterrupted building surfaces.
        Building, Parking, Walkway Separation-Provide privacy, light, air, and access to dwellings
        within the development by ensuring adequate distances among buildings, parking lots and
        driveways, and walkways.
        Open Space, Landscaping, and Screening-Designate private open space exclusive of
        required setbacks, right-of-way, and easements within each development for the use of
        residents.
        Open space, landscaping and screening should provide outdoor space for the residents and
        mitigate negative impacts related to land use compatibility between the development and
        adjacent land uses, noise, lighting, parking (screening and shading), on-site traffic
        circulation, and preservation of natural features.
        Energy Efficiency-Encourage the following measures: 1) appropriate landscaping materials
        to provide shade in the summer and protection from the weather in winter; 2) eaves,
        canopies, awnings, along south and west elevations; 3) secured bicycle storage areas with
        lock-up capabilities.
7. Continue to encourage the distribution of low and moderate income housing throughout the
    community and on smaller sites.
8. Encourage development of housing for seniors and other special populations (i.e.,
    developmentally disabled and physically handicapped). Locational criteria for these
    development proposals, at a minimum, should include proximity to health care,

     recreation/cultural, and/or commercial facilities; and, aesthetic quality of area, including noise
     impact compatibility, and open space.
9. In order to avoid over concentration of multifamily dwelling units, they should be spread
     throughout the community, integrated as part of overall neighborhood planning, and be in
     concentrations consistent with Policy 22.
10. Encourage planned unit developments according to the following criteria:
         For mixed-use developments which include a Convenience Center or a Neighborhood
         Center, the minimum site area shall be 20 acres. Sites less than 20 acres may be considered
         upon recommendation of the Planning Commission.
         Common usable open space, exclusive of right-of-way and required setbacks, shall be
         encouraged to the greatest extent possible for recreation and open space purposes.
         Existing natural features shall be preserved and enhanced consistent with the Conservation,
         Open Space, Parks and Recreation Element.
         Density shall not exceed the underlying zoning provisions. Density increases may be
         granted in accordance with the Zoning Ordinance such as density bonuses or for infill
         projects, or for affordable housing.
11. Identify residential areas adjacent to roadways and other noise-sources. (i.e., railroads, airport,
     industry) which require setbacks and/or special soundproofing to reduce negative noise-related
     impacts, as identified in the Noise Element. Mitigation measures shall include the following:
         The performance standards of the City's Noise Element.
         Noise mitigation "packages" including the use of setbacks to ensure that the exterior noise
         levels at the closest building façade do not exceed 65 dB Ldn and interior noise exposure of
         45 dB Ldn or below.
         For multi-family development, site design techniques shall be used to reduce the need for
         supplemental noise mitigation requirements. Also, investigate the feasibility of requiring
         greater setbacks for multi-family residential development along arterials and collectors as an
         alternative to walls and fences.
12. Develop design measures to buffer residential development from non-residential land uses.
     These measures should, at a minimum, include setbacks; roadways; community waterways;
     landscaping; and landforms such as berming, fences, and walls.
13. Encourage higher density residential development near employment centers, commercial
     development, transit, and parks.
14. Provide for the continued viability of existing single-family areas in the downtown of the
     community and encourage medium and high-density residential development in the central
     business district where such uses do not conflict with existing neighborhoods.

15. Require special site development standards for proposed non-residential or more intensive land
    uses adjacent to established residential areas to minimize negative impacts on abutting
    properties.
16. Estate Residential areas shall be designed to provide opportunities for residential dwellings or in
    conjunction with small-scale farming and animal husbandry or in a semi-rural setting. Estate
    Residential development (6 persons per acre - up to 2 dwelling units per gross acre) shall be
    directed to areas where:
        All urban services (i.e. storm drainage, schools, sidewalks, lighting) may not be required;
        Adjacent to long-term agricultural areas where more intensive future urban development is
        unlikely because of public safety conflicts such as the airport protection area;
        Boundaries between dissimilar land uses (i.e., industrial to residential in the northwest and
        agriculture to residential in the southwest);
        In areas where the viability of large-scale agriculture may ultimately be threatened due to
        the encroachment of non-agricultural uses, and which do not warrant designation to a higher
        density.
    Subject to the following minimum conditions:
        a. Developments will not be permitted to have farm animals.
        b. Full road, sewer, and water improvements shall be installed.
        c. Development setbacks and buffering will ensure that there will be no conflicts with
        adjacent rural residential uses.
    One half-acre lot shall be allowed in the R-E zone through the approval of a conditional use
    permit if the City determines that the size or shape of the site limits the development of a
    standard size subdivision or the approval of 1/2-acre parcels would facilitate infill development.
17. Continue to encourage comprehensively planned Low Density Residential development (up to
    21 persons/acre - 2 to 10 dwelling units net acre). Developments in excess of 7 units per acre
    may be permitted through the PD process. Usage of duplex or halfplex units shall be
    encouraged to increase overall densities where they are made to be compatible with the overall
    residential development.
18. Promote Medium Density Residential development (up to 40 persons per acre - 10 to 15
    dwelling units per net acre) which typically consists of duplex, triplex and four-plex
    development for in-fill or new development at Local/Collector and/or Collector/Collector
    intersections to a maximum of 50 units in one contiguous development on sites ranging from
    3.5 to 5 acres. Medium Density Residential developments on sites less than 3.5 acres at
    arterial/collector intersections may also be considered. Medium density developments may be
    permitted on corner lots in single-family zones where they can be provided in conformance with
    Policy 18. Medium density residential developments may also be used in infill areas where they

     can be made to be consistent with adjacent properties through the PD process and contract
     zoning.
19. Locate High Density Residential development (up to 58 persons per acre - 15 to 29 dwelling
     units per net acre) throughout the City at arterial, collector and Data locations according to the
     following criteria:
         Arterial intersections - 100-unit maximum on sites ranging from 3.5 to 5 acres.
         Arterial/collector intersections - 75-unit maximum on sites ranging from 2 to 5 acres.
         Mid-block arterials - 50-unit maximum on sites ranging from 1 to 3 acres.
         Downtown - at in-fill locations, which do not jeopardize the viability of existing single-
         family areas.
         High-density residential developments may also be used in in-fill areas where they can be
         made to be consistent with adjacent properties through the PD process and conditional
         zoning. Consistency and compatibility with adjacent properties shall be evaluated based on
         issues including but not limited to: adjacent zoning, adjacent land use, proposed building
         mass, and the adequacy of public facilities available to the site.
     Densities in excess of 20 units/acre will be reviewed on a case-by- case basis and may be
     approved through a the PD process where measurable community benefit is demonstrated and
     where infrastructure including mass transit facilities is available (or can be made available) to
     accommodate impacts of increased density.
20. Future growth of the City shall conform to the Growth Management Ordinance of the City of
     Escalon. Residential building permits shall be limited as provided by the City's Growth
     Management Ordinance in effect.
7.2 Commercial Land Use
OBJECTIVES
A. Ensure the continued viability of Escalon's existing commercial areas.
B. Designate appropriate and sufficient commercial land for Escalon's needs to the year 2025 with
     appropriate phasing.
C. Investigate and implement methods of accelerating the project review process for commercial
     and industrial development proposals which generate employment opportunities.
POLICIES AND STANDARDS
1. Ensure that future commercial development is concentrated in shopping districts and nodes to
     discourage expansion of new strip commercial development.

2. It shall be a priority of the City to develop commercial land on the west and east sides of the
    community along SR 120.
3. In order to accommodate modern shopping center formats, the depth of new commercial areas
    shall be at least 500 feet. The depth of existing commercial development along SR 120 and
    McHenry Avenue may be extended on a case-by-case basis if the extension increases the
    feasibility of commercial development and the proposed action will not create land use conflicts
    or reduce viability of adjacent residential properties.
4. Encourage convenience commercial development in residential areas that serve the needs of the
    area and include site development standards which minimize negative impacts on adjacent
    properties.
5. Development standards for the interface between commercial or office uses and residential uses
    shall be as follows:
        A landscaped setback of at least ten feet wide containing deciduous and evergreen trees
        shall be planted and maintained along the property line between commercial or office uses
        and residential properties that have a common property line.
        A masonry wall eight feet in height shall be erected along the property line where
        commercial and office uses have a common property line with residentially designated
        properties.
        A masonry wall three and one-half feet in height or landscape berm shall be erected along
        the front setback line, parallel to, and ten feet from the local streets abutting planned
        residential uses.
        A commercial loading and storage areas shall be screened from view of adjoining residential
        property by a combination of landscape planting and a masonry wall. Loading areas shall be
        enclosed and be located so that there are no noise impacts to adjacent residential properties.
        All storage shall be within an enclosed structure.
        Roof-mounted and detached mechanical equipment shall be acoustically baffled to prevent
        noise from the equipment from exceeding 55dB (A) measured at the nearest residential
        property line.
6. In order to encourage the integration of Neighborhood and Community Commercial uses into
    neighborhoods, designs should de-emphasize the usage of walls as buffers where they create
    barriers to pedestrian access. Continuous block walls shall be discouraged and offsets,
    landscaping pockets and openings shall be encouraged.
7. In order to promote non-vehicular modes of transportation, and to limit the unnecessary usage
    of Collectors and Arterials for vehicular access, commercial development shall provide direct
    pedestrian and vehicular access to adjoining residential areas through Minor Collectors, Local
    Streets and/or through pedestrian access points.

8. Designate Convenience Centers for personal and convenience goods and services for nearby
     residential areas. Such centers may be in new, in-fill, and/or consolidated existing strip
     commercial developments and at a scale which is compatible with surrounding residences.
     Special site design standards shall be imposed on these facilities including high quality
     architecture, landscaping, signage and lighting to ensure that they are aesthetically pleasing.
     Convenience Centers may be approved by a planned development permit on the corner of
     arterial/ collector intersections on sites of three acres or less, and at least at one-half mile away
     from neighborhood shopping centers. Where possible, such centers are to be developed as part
     of specific plans or master plans.
9. Designate Neighborhood Centers for shopping centers with a major grocery store as an anchor
     and supporting businesses which serve one square mile residential area. Location shall be at one
     corner of arterial/arterial or arterial/collector intersections on sites of approximately 10 acres in
     area. Centers shall be located no closer than approximately one mile from other General Plan-
     designated neighborhood centers, from existing Grocery stores, or from General Plan-
     designated community centers.
     The center's scale and site design must be compatible with the surrounding residential area with
     an emphasis on access, circulation, parking, signage, noise, and landscaping. Where possible,
     these facilities should be planned and integrated into neighborhoods as part of a specific plan or
     master plan.
10. Preserve and enhance the Central Business District (CBD) as the community's historic services
     center. Promote retail commercial, specialty retail, professional/administrative office, personal
     services, professional services, public and community facilities and urban residential uses.
11. Visitor-serving commercial areas are to be promoted along the SR 120 corridor for tourists and
     travelers uses. Development in these areas shall be in compliance with the goals, policies and
     development standards of the Community Design Element to promote the SH 120 corridor as a
     scenic entrance to the community.

     and areas proposed for conversion in the Central Business District where adequate parking can
     be provided.
7.4 Industrial Land Use
OBJECTIVES
A. Promote industrial sites which are functional, have adequate public services, and have access to
     major streets and railroads.
POLICIES AND STANDARDS
1. Promote a mix of industrial uses that provide the City with a sound, diverse industrial base.
2. Provide adequate land for a wide range of industrial uses. Heavy industrial uses (warehousing)

8.0        COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Community Design Element brings together the physical elements and design features of Escalon
thereby establishing a strong sense of place and local identity. The unique characteristics that deﬁne the
community are protected and encouraged in this element. Residential, commercial and industrial design
as well as landscaping, streetscape, focal points, boundaries and vistas are addressed.
PURPOSE OF THE COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
The Community Design Element addresses the conservation and enhancement of the visual quality of the
Escalon environment. New development and redevelopment create pressure on the natural and historic
resources in Escalon that form the community’s unique character. The Community Design Element
helps to preserve and improve the quality of life in Escalon by addressing: the protection of natural
resources; the preservation and enhancement of the historical character of the community; the harmonious
incorporation of new development into existing public and private development; and the maintenance of
the community’s “small-town, rural atmosphere.”
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
The Community Design Element is not a State-mandated element, but is an important component of
the Escalon General Plan. The Element comprises four sections: this Introduction; the Purpose of the
Community Design Element; the Scope and Content of the Community Design Element; and Objectives,
Policies and Standards. In the Objectives, Policies and Standards section, major issues related to the
preservation and enhancement of the character of the community are identiﬁed and related policies and
standards are established to address these issues.
General Plan                                                                               Adopted June 6, 2005

Community Design Element
8.1        Gateways/Streetscape Design
OBJECTIVES
A.         Improve the appearance of city streets.
POLICIES AND STANDARDS
1.         Promote a city-wide street tree planting
           program which enhances the appearance
           of the street and is scaled in relationship
           to the function of the roadway. Tree wells
           shall be located and designed to ensure
           adequate sight distance for trafﬁc and
           pedestrian safety.
2.         The undergrounding of utilities along the
           City’s main corridors is a priority. In developing areas, new development projects shall place all
           new utility lines underground. The City will also explore a range of options for undergrounding
           utilities in existing developed areas.
3.         Preserve and protect views of the Sierras/foothills from the City’s major roadways. Local streets
           should also be oriented to maximize such views.
4.         Ensure all signs are compatible with the overall streetscape design including the redesign/
           removal of signs, which are disruptive elements.
5.         Outdoor advertising billboards shall not be allowed within the City limits.
6.         Establish coordinated, distinctive and high quality signage, accent plantings and paving materials
           for entries into the City. Locations for this treatment include SH 120, Main Street, and City
           Arterial Streets. As primary entrances to the City, these streets should reﬂect higher standards of
           development. Standards should contain provisions for minimum building setbacks, landscaping,
           sidewalk pattern and street furniture, with distinctions made between upgrade of existing uses
           and new development. Proper orientation, design and architectural features shall be regulated
           through zoning and the site plan review process.
7.         A special design overlay shall be developed for the SH 120 corridor which includes the following
           features:
           a.       For new developments, landscape setbacks shall be 30 feet, where existing development
                    does not preclude.
General Plan                                                                                   Adopted June 6, 2005

                   the area including Sycamore, Poplar, and occasional seasonal color should be provided
                   by Red Buds, Ginkgo and others. Trees should be planted in clusters to provide adequate
                   view windows to commercial development along SH 120 while achieving dense plantings
                   at key locations.
           c.      Intersecting streets should have special entry treatments including low retaining walls
                   with ornamental planting, commercial center signage integrated into the entry, and design
                   features that provide interest such as rock outcroppings, river rock, or other means.
           d.      Speciﬁc designs shall be approved as part of the overall master plan or speciﬁc plan for
                   the development.
8.2        Residential Development
OBJECTIVES

           will also be included for street trees in new residential, commercial and industrial development.
5.         Encourage growth patterns that will promote livable neighborhood development principles
           including the following:
           a.      Providing      compact      development       so     that    vehicle    use    is      reduced
                   to the extent practicable, and so that vehicle trips are shorter.
           b.      City neighborhoods (one square mile area) should have a mix of land uses including
                   housing, schools, small shops and neighborhood shopping centers. Residential uses
                   should be clustered within walking distance of commercial and service facilities.
General Plan                                                                                    Adopted June 6, 2005

Community Design Element
           c.      Neighborhoods        should      be    designed     as     suburban      “villages”        with
                   connectivity consistent with the circulation element’s policies.
OBJECTIVES
B.         Promote high quality new residential neighborhoods.

12.        Strengthen the City’s sense of history by identifying and preserving historic residential structures
           throughout the community.
8.3        Commercial and Industrial Development
OBJECTIVES
A.         Ensure that all commercial and industrial development is attractive and of high-quality design, to
           enhance the image of the city.
POLICIES AND STANDARDS
1.         Establish site plan review procedures for all commercial and industrial development, including
           provisions for building setbacks, lot coverage, parking, access and circulation, outdoor lighting,
           signage, and landscaping.
2.         Promote rehabilitation of appropriate commercial sites and investigate funding opportunities for
           rehabilitation/remodeling of small businesses.
3.         Strengthen the City’s sense of history by identifying and preserving historic structures throughout
           the community.
4.         Buildings on a site should be linked visually through architectural style, colors and materials,
           signage, landscaping, design details such as light ﬁxtures, and the use of arcades, trellises or other
           open structures.
General Plan                                                                                    Adopted June 6, 2005

Community Design Element
5.         The height and scale of new development should be compatible with that of surrounding buildings
           where an established pattern or character is apparent. New development should provide a transition
           from the height of adjacent structures to the maximum height of new development.
6.         Tall dominating structures should be broken up by creating horizontal emphasis through the use
           of trim, awnings, eaves or other ornamentation, and by using a combination of complementary
           colors.
7.         All roof equipment shall be screened from a horizontal line of sight. Screening should be an
           integral part of the roof design and not appear as a “tacked on” afterthought. For ﬂat roofs, a
           screen enclosure behind the parapet wall may be used if it is made to appear as an integral part
           of the structure’s design. Ground or interior-mounted mechanical equipment (with appropriate
           screening) is encouraged as an alternative to roof-mounting.
8.         Structures in pedestrian-oriented areas should provide continuous storefronts at the ground level
           front elevation.
9.         Entries should be protected from the elements and should create a focus or sense of entry for the
           building. Wall recesses, roof overhangs, canopies, arches, signs, and similar architectural features
           should be integral elements of building design calling attention to the importance of the entry.
10.        Vertical mixed use projects, where residential uses are located above commercial or ofﬁce uses, or
           ofﬁce uses located above commercial uses, are encouraged.
11.        Buildings shall be designed with a precise concept for adequate signage. Signs shall be integrated
           into the design of buildings and should be part of the architecture. All signage shall be compatible
           with the building and site design relative to colors, materials and placement, and shall respect
           established architectural and/or historical character.
12.        Monument-type signs are preferred over tall pole signs for business identiﬁcation, wherever
           possible. Where several tenants occupy the same site, individual wall mounted signs are
           appropriate in combination with a monument sign identifying the development. Custom signs,
           which are unique and creative, are encouraged, provided that the style of the sign complements the
           style and design of the building. Historic signs that are in themselves architectural features shall
           be retained.
13.        The planting of street trees is encouraged for all existing and new commercial and industrial
           development.
14.        Buildings, landscaping, parking and other development features should be arranged in a manner
           that is compatible with the size, scale and appearance of nearby development.
15.        Landscaped areas should be clustered on a site to maximize their effect on the public view.
General Plan                                                                                    Adopted June 6, 2005

 9.0        PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES ELEMENT
 INTRODUCTION
 The Public Services and Facilities Element addresses the community need for public services and facilities.
 The majority of Escalon is developed and sufﬁciently served by existing public services and facilities.
 Future development of the remaining vacant land within the City will require expansion of public services
 and facilities to meet the increase in demand for service. Planning for this future increase in demand will
 ensure that the needs of future residents for public services and infrastructure are met, while avoiding
 adverse impacts to the existing community.
 PURPOSE OF THE PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES ELEMENT
 The purpose of the Public Services & Facilities Element is to ensure that sufﬁcient levels of public services
 are provided as Escalon develops. Working in conjunction with the Land Use and Economic Development
 Elements, the Public Services & Facilities Element plans for the needed expansion and funding of public
 services and infrastructure to coincide with new development.
 SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES ELEMENT
 The Public Services & Facilities Element is not a state-mandated element. The issues addressed within
 this Element closely relate to the Land Use Element and Economic Development Element. The Element is
 comprised of four sections: the Introduction; Purpose of the Public Services & Facilities Element; Scope
 and Content of the Public Services & Facilities Element; and the Objectives, Policies and Standards. In
 the Objectives, Policies and Standards section, major issues related to the provision of public services
 and facilities are identiﬁed and related policies and standards are established to address these issues. The
 objectives, which are overall statements of the community’s desires, are comprised of broad statements
 of purpose and direction. The policies and standards serve as guides for infrastructure and facility
 improvements to provide sufﬁcient levels of service.
General Plan                                                                                  Adopted June 6, 2005

Public Services and Facilities Element
9.1        Public Facility Improvement
OBJECTIVES
A.         It is the policy of the City that new growth shall pay its own way. Fees shall be established to pay
           for both needed facilities, and incremental demands on existing facilities.
B.         A master plan for the development and funding of necessary services and utilities (including
           but not limited to storm drainage, water and sanitary facilities) shall be developed and adopted.
           Funding can be through the formation of an assessment district, entering into deferral agreements
           or direct developer funding of improvements. Distribution of cost for improvements shall be done
           in a fair and equitable manner.
C.         Facilities and services shall be consistent with the General Plan land use goals and objectives.
POLICIES AND STANDARDS
1.         Continue to coordinate community irrigation ditch issues with local districts, private ditch
           companies, private land owners, and public agencies. Irrigation ditches shall be piped as a
           condition of approval prior to development on subject property.
2.         Developers shall prepare an infrastructure and public services assessment as part of each
           annexation and/or development application to determine infrastructure needs, feasibility, timing,
           and ﬁnancing.
3.         Prepare and implement Citywide infrastructure master plans which carry out adopted land use goals,
           objectives and policies and federal and State regulations. These master plans shall be implemented
           through various funding mechanisms including assessment district, property owner’s associations,
           user fees, development impact fees, mitigation payments, reimbursement agreements and/or other
           mechanisms which provide for equitable distribution of development and maintenance costs.
4.         Require the extension and construction of infrastructure to proposed developments according
           to adopted elements and master plans. The City shall use reimbursement agreements or other
           ﬁnancing techniques to reimburse developments for any oversizing cost, which may be required.
5.         Coordinate urban growth management planning with public and private utilities.
6.         Design storm water runoff drainage structures to decrease erosion.
7.         Development fee credit may be given for public improvements made by a builder but shall not
           exceed the amount of fees.
8.         Developers shall construct all tributary facilities necessary to connect to major infrastructure
           facilities, whether or not the major facilities have yet been constructed.
General Plan                                                                                    Adopted June 6, 2005

9.         Temporary drainage facilities such as ponding basins may be constructed by the developer if the
           major facilities are not available, subject to City determination and approval. The developer will
           also be required to pay all applicable drainage fees in addition to constructing temporary facilities
           at his own cost.
10.        Temporary drainage facilities such as retention basins shall be dedicated to the City. If the
           basin is abandoned within ten years, the property would revert to the original owner, subject to
           redevelopment of the site in a manner satisfactory to the City.
11.        Upon the collection of adequate funds, the City will install major facilities in accordance with the
           master plan at the locations deemed most essential by the City, with due regard for community
           needs and areas from which fees were collected. To make the best use of funds, growth shall be
           encouraged in areas where it is possible to develop facilities incrementally.
12.        To encourage groundwater recharge, ponding basins shall be designed as retention basins.
           However, pumping facilities shall be included in such facilities to handle peak ﬂows and to
           provide for disposal of storm water into irrigation ditches when necessary. Stormwater inﬂow
           into irrigation district canals and pipelines shall be subject to existing or future agreements by and
           between the City and the irrigation districts specifying maximum inﬂow, maximum service area
           boundary and any other limitation thereto.
13.        New development shall demonstrate that adequate sewerage capacity and sewage treatment
           capacity exist prior to development or that conditions of project approval will ensure adequate
           capacity will be created as part of the project prior to the issuance of building permits. Conditions
           may include installation of necessary facilities or other methods acceptable to the City.
14.        New municipal water well sites should be planned which include pump, storage, pressure ﬁltration
           and/or treatment equipment. These new wells should be located so that they will not conﬂict
           with planned residential neighborhoods. They should have design, screening, landscaping and
           architectural improvements which make them compatible with adjacent land uses.
15.        The City shall require industrial sewage pretreatment for dischargers that have high biological
           treatment demands. Water conservation measures should also be encouraged for industrial,
           commercial and residential uses to preserve hydraulic capacity at the treatment plant and to reduce
           impacts to the sewerage system.
16.        The City shall require the connection of existing and new business, residents and industries to the
           City’s water and sewer system. The City shall establish fees, which enable it to recover the costs
           of such connection.
17.        Conditions of approval shall be implemented with each development to assure that the necessary
           water production, distribution and/or treatment facility is in place prior to issuance of a building
           permit.
General Plan                                                                                          Adopted June 6, 2005

18.        Conditions of approval shall be implemented with each development to assure that the necessary
           sewer collection facility is in place and/or wastewater treatment plant capacity is available prior to
           issuance of a building permit.
19.        Monitor treatment plant operations and consider the related effects of land use changes when
           evaluating plan amendments.
9.2 Local Government Facilities and Services
OBJECTIVE
A.         Provide high quality government facilities and services to the general public. Local government
           facilities and services shall be directed to the Central Business District of the community to the
           greatest extent possible.
POLICIES AND STANDARDS
1.         Maintain innovative solid waste service and programs.
2.         The City’s Capital Improvement Program shall be adequate to meet future growth and development

URBAN BOUNDARY ELEMENT
                                                                Urban Boundary Element
10.0 URBAN BOUNDARY ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
Since it was originally incorporated in 1957, Escalon has grown to an estimated 2004 population of
approximately 6,700 persons. The General Plan includes an assumption of low population growth, to
about 11,950 persons, by the year 2025. The City’s growth has been located within the present City
boundary and concentrated along State Route 120, McHenry Avenue, and the southwest portion of town.
Future growth is planned for the southwest and northwest areas of town.
PURPOSE OF THE URBAN BOUNDARY ELEMENT
The purpose of the Urban Boundary Element is to deﬁne the limits for extending City services and
infrastructure so as to accommodate new development anticipated within the time frame of this General
Plan. The element includes 10-year growth rings (boundaries) starting with the year 2015, 2025 (Sphere
of Inﬂuence), 2035, and the outer boundary which is the Planning Area. Reference the map pocket for the
Land Use and Urban Boundaries map.
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE URBAN BOUNDARY ELEMENT
The Urban Boundary Element is not a state-mandated element. It is, however, an important element
because it limits leap-frog development and provides for an orderly transition from rural to urban land
uses. The element comprises ﬁve sections: the Introduction; Purpose of the Urban Boundary Element;
Scope and Content of the Urban Boundary Element; Objectives, Policies and Standards; and the Urban
Boundary Map. The Policies and Standards section establishes boundaries for new development over the
next 30 years. LAFCo’s guidelines for Spheres of Inﬂuence and Planning Areas is also included.
10.1       Urban Boundaries
OBJECTIVES
A.         Provide for an orderly and efﬁcient transition from rural to urban land uses.
B.         Minimize urban sprawl and leap-frog development.
General Plan                                                                             Adopted June 6, 2005

Urban Boundary Element
C.         Designate growth areas that can be served by logical infrastructure extensions.
POLICIES AND STANDARDS
1.         First priority shall be given to development of vacant, underdeveloped, and/or redevelopable land
           where urban services are or can be made available. Parcels shall be substantially contiguous to
           existing development.
2.         Identify and use natural and man-made edges, such as local roadways, as urban development limits
           for growth phasing lines.
3.         Utilize low density and rural residential land uses as a buffer and transition between long-term
           agricultural uses and higher density urban development.
4.         Prohibit the premature conversion of agricultural lands where agricultural preserves are present.
5.         Encourage the use of parks and open space to enhance gateways to the City.
6.         Discourage new or expanded urban development outside of the city’s Urban Growth Boundaries.
10.2       Growth Policies
OBJECTIVES
A.         Implement growth policies, which will guide the timing, type, and location of growth, preserve
           resource lands, protect natural features and open space, and encourage techniques which encourage
           energy conservation.
POLICIES AND STANDARDS
1.         Establish a Planning Area Boundary around the City consistent with San Joaquin County LAFCo’s
           Guidelines. This area should represent a potential 50-year growth boundary with an additional
           appropriate buffer and/or greenbelt area extending an additional one-quarter to one-half mile. This
           area should include any “areas or communities of interest” that may affect the City.
2.         Establish Urban Development Boundaries for the logical, sequential development of the community
           over the next 30 years. These boundaries shall be established based on the following factors:
           a.      Adequate residential, commercial and industrial capacity for the planning period.
           b.      Inclusion of a 30 percent vacancy factor (“ﬂexibility factor”) for residential land; that is, at
                   least 30 percent additional land shall be provided than needed for each 10-year ring.

11.0 HOUSING ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Housing Element describes housing goals, policies, and programs for the City of Escalon. A goal is
deﬁned as a general statement of the highest aspirations of the community. A policy is a course of action
chosen from among many possible alternatives. It guides decision-making and provides a framework
around which the housing programs operate. A program is a speciﬁc action, which implements the policy
and moves the community toward the achievement of its goals. Programs are a part of the City’s ﬁve-year
action plan and constitute the City’s local housing strategy.
PURPOSE OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
The purpose of the Housing Element is to reﬂect and implement state goals and direction at the community
level based upon local and regional needs determined through the Housing Element update process.
Policies and programs from the 1988 Housing Element have been either incorporated herein or updated,
otherwise modiﬁed, or deleted as necessary to reﬂect accomplished programs and current needs.
Implementation of programs shall be on a continuous basis unless otherwise noted in the program
description. Monitoring will be accomplished on an annual basis primarily through the annual General
Plan review process and reported to the City Council.
SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
The following goals, policies and programs are part of the free-standing Housing Element document
which has previously been adopted by the City of Escalon and certiﬁed by the State Department of
Housing and Community Development (adopted July 19, 2004). The element comprises four sections:
The Introduction; Purpose of the Housing Element; Scope and Content of the Housing Element; and the
goals, policies and programs of the previously adopted Housing Element.

11.1       Goals, Policies and Programs
A. PRESERVING HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOODS.
Goal 1:                 Intrusion of incompatible uses into residential uses will be prohibited and
                        adverse effects of adjacent uses will be minimized.
Goal 2:                 Residential support uses such as commercial uses, parks and educational
                        facilities shall be supplied in adequate amounts and in locations to serve the
                        residents of the City without detriment to residential areas.
Goal 3:                 Conﬂicts between adjacent land uses shall be minimized.
Goal 4:                 All reasonable means will be used to ensure that all existing urban areas are
                        planned with basic services, including storm drainage, sanitary sewers, water
                        supply, and solid waste disposal and that all future development will coincide
                        with planned extensions of these basic services.
Policy 1:               Uses allowed under the Low Density, Medium Density, or High Density
                        Residential designations of the General Plan shall include only those uses speciﬁed
                        in the Residential zoning districts. All nonresidential uses which are speciﬁcally
                        permitted       in these zones shall only be permitted if it can be determined that the
                        use can be located so that it is not detrimental to people or property in the area.
Policy 2:               Methods that should be used to maintain neighborhoods include:
                        (a)      Encouragement of both public and private participation and expenditures;
                        (b)      Conservation of existing housing, wherever possible;
                        (c)      Preventing intrusion of incompatible land uses, increased trafﬁc volumes
                                 and other potentially blighting inﬂuences.
Policy 3:               The use of rehabilitation funds to prevent the decay of established residential areas
                        shall be encouraged. Encourage maximum participation in CDBG process.
Policy 4:               Land use applications shall be approved only if potential land use conﬂicts can be
                        reduced to an acceptable level.
Program A1:             Maintain and Enforce the Zoning Ordinance. The City shall maintain and enforce
                        the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance which requires (a) a use permit for of all
                        nonresidential uses in residential zoning, (b) site plan approval of any residential
                        use of more than three units and all nonresidential uses; and, (c) construction of
                        at least a 6 foot masonry fence to separate residential uses from non-residential
                        uses.

Program A2:         Neighborhood Improvements. The City shall encourage residents to use available
                    means to improve neighborhoods. These means include, at this time, the use of
                    the Improvement Bond Acts under which citizens can install curbs and gutters
                    and have the cost added to their taxes. During annual review of the Capital
                    Improvement Program, the City shall determine which projects are appropriate to
                    combine with such neighborhood improvements. (For example, when repaving
                    of a street is planned, encouragement of neighbors to pay for adjacent curb,
                    gutters and sidewalk improvements will be considered.) Other neighborhood
                    improvement programs may include neighborhood “ﬁx-up” programs, whereby
                    the City will contact and serve as liaison with volunteer organizations for the
                    purposes of improving neighborhood conditions.
