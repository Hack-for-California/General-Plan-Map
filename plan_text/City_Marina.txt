1. Introduction
1. Introduction
                Purposes of the General Plan
                1.1 The Marina General Plan is a statement of what the residents of Marina
                    believe to be in the best interest of their community. Its primary purpose is
                    to permit them to consciously consider and determine their future. Thus,
                    the plan serves as a response to present problems, a framework for
                    achieving future potentialities, and a means to conserve what is generally
                    valued. The plan has two major purposes:
                    1.        To guide daily and long-term planning and development decisions
                              by the City in a manner consistent with stated City goals. Areas in
                              which the plan will serve as a guide include zoning, construction
                              and     operation    of    community       facilities, transportation
                              improvements, and capital improvements and financing.
                    2.        To provide clear documentation of the City’s goals and
                              commitments for private developers, homeowners, businesses,
                              investors, and other public entities that may want to carry on
                              planning and development activities that will affect Marina. This
                              will enable these actors to better coordinate their actions with
                              those of the City, and undertake their programs in a manner that
                              complements and promotes City aims.
                1.2 The Marina General Plan provides an integrated view of the factors which
                    make up the community. Since there can never be total unanimity on every
                    aspect of community life, the plan provides a vehicle for citizens, acting
                    through local political processes, to have their differing ideas and proposals
                    considered, discussed and reconciled. The General Plan thus serves as a
                    statement of consensus on community aspirations.
                1.3 The comprehensive and integrated nature of the plan provides the
                    community with the means to determine the relative importance of various
                    values, such as the preservation of natural resources, community
                    socioeconomic composition, community appearance, public safety, and
                    convenience of travel. It does so by setting forth broad community goals,
                    by translating these goals into more specific policies and programs which
                    apply to various areas or elements of the City, and by identifying measures
                    needed to accomplish these objectives.
City of Marina General Plan                                                                      12
1. Introduction

                1.4 Finally, the General Plan enables the City to fulfill its legal obligations as
                    established in state planning law. Specifically, State Government Code
                    Sections 65302-65303 require each city or county to prepare a general plan
                    that encompasses policies toward land use, circulation, housing, open
                    space, conservation, safety, noise, and any other areas a community may
                    consider important. Such plans must encompass all territory within the
                    boundaries of a city or county and any land outside its boundaries which in
                    the planning agency’s judgment bears a relationship to its planning. The
                    planning area encompassed by the Marina General Plan is shown in Figure
                    1.1. It includes the existing incorporated City and adjoining land judged to
                    be necessary in the preparation of the General Plan. Included are the
                    City’s currently adopted Sphere of Influence, additional lands proposed for
                    inclusion in an enlarged Sphere of Influence, and unincorporated lands in
                    Monterey County lying to the north and east of the City’s adopted Sphere of
                    Influence. Sphere of Influence is defined as the probable ultimate physical
                    boundaries and service area of the city as approved by the Local Agency
                    Formation Commission (LAFCO). Figure 1.1 also depicts the City’s Urban
                    Growth Boundary - that is, the area within which the City will concentrate
                    growth and new development, along with required community services until
                    2020. (2005-82)
                General Plan Format and Content
                1.5 State law provides that a general plan must address seven elements: land
                    use, circulation, housing, natural resource conservation, open space, noise,
                    and safety. However, the state’s General Plan Guidelines note that “. . .
                    while state planning law divides a general plan’s required contents into
                    seven distinct elements, this division is more a product of the incremental
                    nature of the legislative process than a conscious design. The division of
                    the general plan provisions into elements tends to mask the statutory and
                    functional relationships among the elements and issues to be addressed in
                    the general plan.”
                1.6 To avoid these problems and enable the Marina General Plan to be easily
                    referred to by residents of Marina, the Planning Commission, and the City
                    Council on a day-to-day basis, the plan is consolidated into four major
                    elements. In brief, the Community Land Use Element defines how the city’s
                    land supply is to be used; the Community Infrastructure Element identifies
                    what essential community services and facilities are to be provided; the
                    Community Development and Design Element establishes the physical
                    design and construction requirements to accommodate permitted uses and
                    infrastructure; and the Program and Implementation Element describes
City of Marina General Plan                                                                     13
1. Introduction

                     recommended steps and programs to accomplish General Plan objectives.
                     The General Plan also incorporates by reference the City’s Local Coastal
                     Program’s land use plan and the resource protection policies contained
                     therein. The content of each element and its relationship to state planning
                     law is further described below.
                1.7  Community Land Use Element. This element establishes the permitted use
                     of land for the entire planning area as well as permissible housing densities
                     and building intensity levels for nonresidential uses.         This element
                     distinguishes between land to be retained in open space (to protect natural
                     resource values and avoid hazard to life and property) and land suitable for
                     housing, commercial and industrial uses, and for community purposes such
                     as schools. The Community Land Use Element thus integrates into one
                     section all land use policies required by the state-mandated land use
                     element and those of the conservation, open space, noise and safety
                     elements.
                1.8  Community Infrastructure Element. This element sets forth the City’s
                     policies for vehicular, transit, pedestrian and bicycle circulation in
                     accordance with the state circulation element requirements. This element
                     also encompasses other infrastructure requirements including water supply,
                     wastewater collection and treatment, storm drainage, and associated
                     issues and concerns pertaining to water resource management and soil
                     conservation.
                1.9  Community Development and Design Element. This element encompasses
                     both the functional and aesthetic requirements for the physical design and
                     construction that accompany use of the land and provision of infrastructure.
                     It addresses the overall design and appearance of the city and design
                     decisions for individual sites and buildings — decisions which taken
                     together, do much to determine how the entire city functions and appears.
                     The following general plan features can be found in this element: policies
                     governing citywide appearance; standards and guidelines for roads;
                     detailed design guidance for individual neighborhoods and commercial
                     areas; and policies and guidelines addressing environmental protection,
                     conservation, and public safety.
                1.10 Program and Implementation Element. This element lays out the steps and
                     actions needed to accomplish the General Plan objectives. It makes
                     recommendations for bringing City ordinances and codes into compliance
                     with the General Plan — as required by state planning law. And it contains
                     recommendations for public improvement programs and makes proposals
City of Marina General Plan                                                                     14
1. Introduction

                     for complementary studies. The element also includes housing programs,
                     as set forth in the state-mandated housing element.
                1.11 Technical Appendices. Several technical appendices are provided. The
                     first (Appendix A) provides a summary of the geotechnical and natural
                     resource data which underlies the General Plan’s safety and conservation
                     policies. The second (Appendix B) provides the existing and projected
                     2020 noise contour level maps needed to support the general plan noise
                     policies and standards as set forth within the Public Health and Safety
                     section of this plan. The third, Appendix C, contains the noise standards
                     established by Table 4-1 of the Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan.
                     Appendix D contains mitigation measures from the Final Environmental
                     Impact Report on the Draft General Plan and associated Mitigation
                     Monitoring Plan which were not incorporated in the body of this plan.
                Use of the Plan
                1.12 The General Plan is designed to be used by elected and appointed City
                     officials on a daily basis, as they make decisions with direct or indirect land
                     use or development and design implications. The Plan is also intended to
                     provide private individuals, firms, and elected or appointed representatives
                     of other public entities with a concise, unambiguous statement of the City’s
                     intents, and of development and conservation requirements governing land
                     within the City’s planning jurisdiction.
                1.13 The General Plan in its entirety, both text, maps and diagrams, constitute
                     City policy. The following key terms are used throughout, and a proper
                     understanding of them should accompany use the Plan.
                     1.         Policies contained in the Plan are expressed in terms of “shall” or
                                “should.” Use of “shall” indicates an unequivocal commitment to
                                require compliance, while “should” represents the intent of the City
                                to require compliance unless other conditions and factors make it
                                unfeasible to comply with the stated policy.
                     2.         Residential density allowances are given as either “units per gross
                                acre” or “units per net acre.” When the term units per gross acre
                                is used, the specified area excludes major roadways, open
                                spaces, and lands occupied by public facilities such as schools,
                                but it includes local streets, sub-neighborhood parks, recreation
                                areas, and other common open spaces. When the term units per
                                net acre is used, the specified area is limited to land occupied by
City of Marina General Plan                                                                       15
1. Introduction

                               residential parcels for single-family houses and the sites of multi-
                               family housing developments, exclusive of required street or open
                               space dedications.
                     3.        The intensity of non-residential development is given as the floor
                               area ratio of a site — that is, the ratio between the square footage
                               of enclosed building space and the square footage of the site.
                               Floor area ratios, commonly referred to as FARs, are given as
                               numerical ratios. Thus, an FAR of 0.5 indicates that the permitted
                               enclosed floor area of a building is equal to one-half the square
                               footage of the parcel on which it is located. An FAR of 1.0,
                               therefore, indicates that a building may have a total floor area
                               equal to the total square footage of its site.
                     4.        The Marina Planning Area is the entire geographic territory
                               covered by this General Plan and as depicted in its various
                               figures, including Figure 1.1. The Urban Growth Boundary defines
                               the area within which the City will concentrate development and
                               urban services until the year 2020. (2005-82)
                1.14   The General Plan encompasses three time horizons. The first is the
                       ultimate permitted buildout, as represented by the overall land use
                       policies of the Community Land Use Element Map. This non-time-
                       specific horizon represents the community’s current understanding of
                       future long-term demographic and economic conditions, natural resource
                       or geotechnical limitations on the use of land for development purposes,
                       and the values and aspirations of the present residents of Marina. The
                       second horizon is the year 2020. This 20-year period is appropriate in
                       terms of planning for major public investments in transportation, utilities,
                       and other facilities such as schools. It also allows adequate time to
                       address the financing and construction of these facilities. A third time
                       horizon of five years is used in the Program and Implementation Element
                       (Chapter 5) to provide a guide for steps and actions in regard to which
                       there is greater immediacy. The five-year period also corresponds to the
                       state housing element requirement for a five-year housing program, and
                       to other state guidelines that recommend revisiting the General Plan
                       every five years.
                1.15   Based on demographic and economic trends and forecasts, it is
                       estimated that by 2020 practically all General Plan-designated residential
                       lands in Marina will be developed to their planned capacity. However,
                       undeveloped commercial and industrial land will remain in the city since
                       the amount of such land designated by the Plan exceeds projected 2020

                     are all based on anticipated 2020 development. (The companion General
                     Plan Environmental Impact Report also uses the year 2020 growth
                     estimate as a basis for its environmental impact assessments.)

1. Introduction
                Community Goals
                1.17The overall goal of the Marina General Plan is the creation of a community
                      which provides a high quality of life for all its residents; which offers a
                      broad range of housing, transportation, and recreation choices; and which
                      conserves irreplaceable natural resources. Toward this end, this Plan
                      sets forth the following General Plan vision statement: “Marina desires to
                      grow and mature, along with its image, from a small town, primarily
                      bedroom community, to become a small city which is diversified, vibrant
                      and mostly self-sufficient. The City can and will accomplish this by
                      achieving both the necessary level and diversity of jobs, economic
                      activity, public services, housing, and civic life (including culture and
                      recreation), and parks and open space.” The following 17 specific goals
                      provide the framework for reaching this overall goal. They also provide
                      the foundation for the various General Plan elements.
                1.18  During the preparation of this General Plan the following goals, phrased
                      in the form of planning principles, provided the basis for developing
                      appropriate land use, infrastructure, and community design proposals for
                      specific areas of the city, and for judging among several citywide General
                      Plan alternatives and providing direction for selecting the preferred
                      alternative. As incorporated into the General Plan, these framework
                      goals provide the overall direction necessary to ensure that, as it grows,
                      the city will be well functioning and attractive; that it will balance the
                      needs of residents and business; and that appropriate use will be made of
                      its natural, human and economic resources:
                      1.       Housing within the means of households of all economic levels,
                               ages and lifestyles, and, therefore, a diversified and integrated
                               housing supply in which new residential development emphasizes
                               a mix of housing types and lot sizes at the neighborhood level.
                      2.       Community development which avoids or minimizes to the
                               greatest extent possible the consumption or degradation of non-
                               renewable natural resources including natural habitats, water,
                               energy, and prime agricultural land.
                      3.       A city within which the majority of the residences, businesses and
                               community facilities are served by frequent, cost-effective transit.
                      4.       A balance of jobs and housing that provides the greatest possible
                               opportunity both to live and work in Marina.
                      5.       A city designed for and attractive to pedestrians, in which most of
                               the housing, shops, businesses, and community facilities are
                               within easy walking distance of each other.

1. Introduction

                      6.     A balanced land use/transportation system which minimizes traffic
                             congestion, noise, excessive energy consumption, and air
                             pollution.
                      7.     A city that helps avoid sprawl in the region by making efficient use
                             of lands designated for community development purposes.
                      8.     A city physically and visually distinguish-able from the other
                             communities of the Monterey Bay region, with a sense of place
                             and identity in which residents can take pride.
                      9.     A diversified and sound economic base that will permit the
                             delivery of high-quality public services to city residents and
                             businesses.
                      10.    A community responsive to the housing and transportation needs
                             of Monterey County.
                      11.    One or more centers which bring together commercial, civic,
                             cultural and recreational uses and serve as a focus for community
                             life.
                      12.    A physically and socially cohesive community in which existing
                             and future land uses, transportation facilities, and open spaces
                             are well integrated.
                      13.    Ample opportunities for outdoor recreation for all residents, both
                             within their immediate neighborhoods, elsewhere in the city, and
                             in the immediate environs.
                      14.    Development which maintains continuity with the city’s history and
                             is responsive to the climate and the natural and scenic features of
                             the local and regional setting, including the city’s strategic position

                      15.    Attractive, distinctive residential neighbor-hoods and commercial
                             districts which contribute to the overall vitality, image and identity
                             of the city.
                      16.    Prevention of threats to life and property from flooding, slope
                             failure, and seismic activity.
                      17.    Equitable distribution of responsibilities and benefits between
                             existing and future residents and businesses.
                Amendment of the General Plan

                       individually and cumulatively with respect to citywide implications and
                       effects. (2005-82)

1. Introduction

                     Until December 31, 2020, the location of the Urban Growth Boundary or
                     UGB may be amended only by a vote of the people, or by the City
                     according to the following provisions and procedures:
                     1.     To comply with state law relating to the provision of housing for all
                            economic segments of the community, the City Council may
                            amend the Urban Growth Boundary as shown on Figures 1.1, 2.1
                            and 2.2 in order to provide affordable housing, provided that no
                            more than 10 acres of land are incorporated within the UGB for
                            this purpose in any one calendar year.
                     2.     Such amendment of the UGB may be adopted only if, based upon
                            substantial evidence, the City makes each of the following
                            findings:
                            a.      That the land to be included within the Urban Growth
                                    Boundary is immediately adjacent to an area where
                                    development already exists, and that specific evidence in
                                    the administrative record relating to the amendment
                                    demonstrates that the Public Safety and Public Works
                                    departments have adequate capacity to accommodate the
                                    proposed development and to provide adequate public
                                    services for the proposed development; and
                            b.      That the proposed development will consist of housing
                                    primarily for low, very low or moderate income persons,
                                    and that effective restrictions will be imposed to maintain
                                    the housing as available to such persons in perpetuity; and
                            c.      That there is no other existing residentially-designated land
                                    available within the UGB to accommodate the proposed
                                    affordable housing development (i.e., housing affordable
                                    to very low, low and/or moderate income persons); and
                            d.      That it is not reasonably feasible to re-designate lands
                                    within the UGB in order to accommodate the proposed
                                    affordable housing development; and
                            e.      The proposed development is necessary to comply with
                                    state law requirements for provision of housing affordable
                                    to persons of very low, low or moderate income.
                     3.     Upon request of an affected landowner, the City Council may
                            amend the Urban Growth Boundary or any of the goals or policies
                            of Section 2 of the UGB Initiative as incorporated in this Plan,
                            pursuant to a finding based on substantial evidence in the
                            administrative record, and without substantial evidence to the

                             contrary, that the application of one or more of the UGB provisions
                             to any specific property constitutes an unconstitutional taking of a
                             landowner’s property. Such amendment, however, shall be made
                             only to the minimum extent necessary to avoid an unconstitutional
                             taking of a landowner’s property. (2005-82)
                1.23 Prior to approving any UGB-related amendments pursuant to Section
                     1.21 of this Plan, at least one noticed public hearing before the City
                     Council shall be held for the purpose of receiving testimony and evidence
                     from the applicant and the public on the proposed amendment and any
                     findings proposed in connection with such amendment. This hearing
                     shall be in addition to any other public hearings regularly required for a
                     General Plan amendment. (2005-82)

                     inconsistent with the Marina UGB Initiative shall be approved by the City
                     or any of its commissions, boards, departments, and officers and
                     employees. (2005-82)
City of Marina General Plan                                                                   23
1. Introduction

2. Community Land Use Element
               Function and Content
               2.1   Community land use encompasses use of the land for residential,
                     commercial, industrial and other purposes requiring construction on the
                     land as well as use of the land for agriculture, natural habitat, outdoor
                     recreation, scenic preservation, avoidance of hazards, and other open
                     space purposes.       The enactment of environmentally, socially and
                     economically appropriate land use policies and regulations for this broad
                     range of uses requires careful consideration of many factors. Among
                     these are limitations on use of the land due to seismic hazard, flooding,
                     and slope instability; the need to safeguard natural habitats, prime
                     agricultural soils, and water and air quality; and the desire to protect
                     developed areas from man-generated adverse impacts such as noise.
               2.2   State planning law mandates that the General Plan establish policies
                     addressing land use, housing, open space, conservation, safety, and
                     noise. Although each of these topics is often addressed by separate plan
                     elements, planning law allows for their consolidation into one or more
                     combined elements. The Marina General Plan employs this latter
                     approach, incorporating all concerns pertaining to the appropriate use of
                     land - whether for community development, open space, noise protection,
                     or public safety concerns - into a single element. This approach is used
                     so as to better document the bases for City land use policies. For
                     example, it might help trace whether a recommended land use arises in
                     response to noise problems, the need to protect valued natural habitat, or
                     the desire to establish an overall strategy to protect air quality. This
                     consolidated approach also helps ensure consistency throughout the
                     General Plan by directly linking land use policies pertaining to
                     conservation, safety, noise and housing. The housing provisions of this
                     plan are intended to be consistent with the Housing Element’s
                     predominant themes of providing for affordability, adequacy and diversity
                     of the City’s housing stock. (2005-82)
               2.3   This element is organized into the following seven sections:
                     1.      Primary Policies. This section establishes the overall basis and
                             framework for specific land use policies.
City of Marina General Plan                                                                 24
2. Community Land Use Element

                     2.     Land Resources.         This section addresses natural resource
                            protection, conservation needs, and required safeguards against
                            natural and manmade hazards, so as to distinguish between lands
                            appropriate for community development and lands which might
                            more properly remain in open use.
                     3.     Open Space. The open space policies of this section serve three
                            purposes: 1) to ensure retention of land with significant agricultural
                            or natural resource values and to encourage ongoing agricultural,
                            open space and natural resource uses on lands north or outside of
                            the Urban Growth Boundary; 2) to avoid construction on land
                            where there are potential threats to life and/or property due to
                            natural or man-produced hazards; and 3) to provide for the
                            outdoor recreation needs of Marina residents and others who may
                            be working in or visiting the City. (2005-82)
                     4.     Housing and Neighborhoods. Policies pertaining to the use of
                            land for residential purposes are found in this section. Here can
                            be found the policies and recommendations for accommodating
                            projected population growth, providing housing to meet the needs
                            of all income levels and of residents with special needs, and
                            protecting and enhancing the quality of neighborhoods.
                     5.     Commercial. This section establishes the land use requirements
                            to meet the retail and personal-service needs of existing and
                            future Marina residents, and for accommodating visitor-serving
                            retail and service uses and regional retail facilities at levels
                            sufficient to provide for the economic and fiscal needs of the City.
                            Also included are provisions for various types of office use,
                            including those associated with research and development
                            activities.
                     6.     Industrial. This section provides for industrial and warehousing
                            activities and commercial-service uses with space, transportation,
                            or storage characteristics similar to industrial uses.
                     7.     Community Facilities. The function of this section is to ensure that
                            appropriately sized and located sites are provided for schools, city
                            administrative and cultural facilities, and police and fire services to
                            meet the needs of existing and future Marina residents and
                            businesses.
City of Marina General Plan                                                                     25
2. Community Land Use Element
               Primary Policies
               2.4   The intent of the community land use element is to help achieve the
                     overall General Plan goals of providing a satisfying, safe and healthful
                     living and working environment and promoting the economic well-being of
                     city residents and businesses. To accomplish these ends, City planning,
                     regulatory and development decisions shall be governed by the following
                     policies which adhere to the goals in the “Introduction” (Chapter 1).
                     1. The City shall provide a land supply within (i.e., south of) its Urban
                          Growth Boundary sufficient in size and appropriately located to
                          accommodate a fair share of the future population and employment
                          growth within Monterey County. Unless otherwise amended by a vote
                          of the Marina electorate, until December 31, 2020, the City’s Urban
                          Growth Boundary– as shown on Figures 1.1, 2.1 and 2.2 of this plan–
                          may be amended by the City Council only to accommodate lands
                          designated for affordable housing in accordance with Sections 1.21
                          through 1.24 of this Plan. (2005-82)
                     2. The City shall prevent under-utilization of land within its UGB that is
                          appropriate for community development, in order to ensure that
                          development proceeds in an orderly and consistent manner and to
                          minimize the dispersal of future growth in Monterey County to outlying
                          areas with potentially higher natural resource value. With respect to
                          phasing and timing, whenever feasible, the City shall encourage new
                          development to locate within the existing developed portion of Marina
                          and Marina’s former Fort Ord in preference to the development of
                          currently vacant, undeveloped lands located within the City’s UGB
                          (from Section 2 of UGB Initiative). (2005-82)
                     3. The Marina Heights Specific Plan area is to be developed within
                          Marina’s former Fort Ord in preference to development of currently
                          vacant, undeveloped lands. Development of Marina Heights in
                          accordance with the adopted Specific Plan represents a more efficient
                          utilization of land at the residential densities proposed than the
                          existing pattern of development in the former military housing area,
                          and, as such, can be considered consistent with Policy 2.4.2 Section
                          2.36 discusses the Marina Heights Residential Homes (MHRH)
                          designation, as stipulated in the Marina Heights Specific Plan, which
                          will be utilized to regulate development on portions of the Marina
                          Heights development. The purpose of this designation is to ensure
City of Marina General Plan                                                                   26
2. Community Land Use Element

                          comprehensively planned development of an area intended primarily
                          for residential use. (2004-42)
                     4. Wherever possible, lands with significant agricultural, natural habitat,
                          or scenic value shall be retained and protected from degradation.
                     5. Future land development, whether it involves development of new
                          areas, infilling of existing neighborhoods or commercial areas, or
                          redevelopment of former Fort Ord lands, shall be organized and have
                          sufficient intensity to help ensure the longer-term feasibility of public
                          transit for work and other purposes, and to create a pedestrian-
                          oriented community. Intensity associated with the provision of public
                          transit service to Marina Municipal Airport shall be required to ensure
                          consistency with the Marina Municipal Airport Comprehensive Land
                          Use Plan. (2008-224)
                     6. The Marina Heights project may be deemed supportive of transit and
                          pedestrian-oriented development if affordable housing goals are met,
                          and amenities such as pedestrian and bicycle facilities (encouraging
                          alternative access to transit routes and offsite destinations), and home
                          office areas (to encourage telecommuting) are provided, thereby
                          reducing reliance on the private automobile. The City will actively
                          work with Monterey Salinas Transit to develop and promote routes to
                          minimize reliance on the private automobile by residents. (2004-42,
                          2005-82)
                     7. Retail and personal-service uses shall be channeled into existing
                          commercial areas and other identified commercial centers in the plan,
                          and efforts shall be taken to avoid strip-type commercial development.
                     8. Construction of a broad range of housing types shall be permitted and
                          promoted in order to provide greater housing choice and diversity.
                     9. Development shall be prohibited or restricted where natural conditions
                          present a serious threat to life or may lead to the destruction of
                          homes, businesses, or public facilities.
                     10. Where feasible, the community shall be demarcated from adjacent
                          communities by permanent open space.
City of Marina General Plan                                                                     27
2. Community Land Use Element
                     11. Sufficient land shall be set aside to meet the outdoor recreation needs
                          of existing and future residents.
                     12. Land appropriate for community development shall be allocated and
                          phased in a manner that enhances local employment and economic
                          opportunities and provides the City with a strong economic and fiscal
                          base. The City recognizes that, while the Marina Heights Specific Plan
                          will not directly supply permanent employment opportunities, it will
                          dramatically enhance the City’s economic and fiscal base. (2004-42)
                     13. The City will provide adequate urban services, including water, only to
                          areas within its designated Urban Growth Boundary. The costs of
                          providing the public facilities and services needed for new
                          development shall be borne by new development unless the City
                          chooses to help assume such costs in order to obtain identified
                          community-wide benefits. (2005-82)
                     14. The City shall encourage economic opportunities and development at
                          and surrounding the Marina Municipal Airport, by providing
                          opportunities for aviation and non-aviation related uses that have the
                          appropriate sites and environment for a broad range of commercial
                          and industrial uses. The City shall create an attractive image for the
                          entire Airport area, both as experienced upon entering and traveling
                          within the area that promotes the City’s economic objectives to
                          contribute to an overall appearance that will attract desired uses and
                          enhance the area’s short and long-term economic viability. (2008-
                          224)
                     15. The City shall protect the Marina Municipal Airport and related
                          aviation facilities from encroachment by potentially incompatible land
                          uses, and shall promote the development of an Airport facility that can
                          accommodate the future growth of aviation and air commerce while
                          minimizing airport-related environmental and safety hazards. The City
                          shall utilize the Airport Influence Area (AIA) or “Airport Planning Area”
                          adopted by the Monterey County Airport Land Use Commission in the
                          Marina Municipal Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan, and
                          consider all applicable FAA regulations, policies and procedures.
                          (2008-224)
                     16. The City shall ensure that all future development within the AIA or
                          Airport Protection Area should be consistent with the policies adopted
City of Marina General Plan                                                                      28
2. Community Land Use Element

                          by the Monterey County Airport Land Use Commission, except where
                          pursuant to Public Utilities Code Sections 21676 and 21675.5, the
                          City Council, pursuant to a two-thirds vote, exercises its option to
                          conclude that, notwithstanding a negative recommendation from the
                          Monterey County ALUC, the Council’s proposed action is consistent
                          with the purposes of providing for the orderly development of the
                          Airport and its surrounding area while protecting the public health,
                          safety and welfare by minimizing the public’s exposure to excessive

               2.5   The City of Marina Planning Area encompasses approximately 10,880
                     acres of land, exclusive of major right-of-ways. Based on documentation
                     and analysis of natural factors (such as the presence of prime agricultural
                     soils, wildlife habitat, flood danger, slope instability, and seismic hazards)
                     and manmade hazards (such as excessive noise and aviation-related
                     danger), the un-built portion of the Marina Planning Area has been
                     classified into two major categories:
                     1.       Land to be retained in open space use to allow conservation of
                              biological, water, soil, and mineral resources and for outdoor
                              recreation; and
                     2.       Land suitable for community development purposes. Figure 2.1
                              documents the location of these lands. Approximately 60 percent
                              of the planning area is designated for open space purposes
                              including the proposed golf course, and the remaining 40 percent
                              for residential, commercial, industrial, and community facilities,
                              including school sites and a reservoir site to store recycled water.

               2.6   The following sections of the Community Land Use Element set forth
                     specific policies governing appropriate uses of these lands. General
                     Plan-designated land uses for the planning area are shown in Figure 2.2,

               Open Space
               2.7   The open space system in the Marina Planning Area shall be
                     implemented by designating the following categories of open space:

                     1.       Habitat Reserves and Other Open Space for the protection of
                              important habitat areas, scenic areas, and other areas of natural
                              open space.
                     2.       Agriculture Reserve for the long- term protection of prime and
                              other productive agricultural lands outside of the City’s Urban

               2.8   Wherever possible, public open space in the form of natural undeveloped
                     lands and/or developed parklands shall be incorporated into all major
                     subdivisions and developments, including residential, commercial and
                     institutional (educational and civic) projects. Wherever feasible, major
                     open space areas shall be linked to each other through the provision of
                     wildlife habitat corridors and/or recreational trails.
               2.9   Approximately 6,500 acres of land in the Marina Planning Area (60
                     percent, exclusive of right-of-ways) are designated for open space uses
                     (see Figure 2.2 and Table 2.1). Specific policies pertaining to the use of
                     open space lands for agriculture, natural habitat, and recreation are

                                  Habitat Reserves and Other Open Space
               2.10  Lands designated as “Habitat Reserve and Other Open Space” are
                     intended for permanent retention in open space to protect significant
                     plants and wildlife inhabiting these areas. These lands consist of the
                     following natural areas:
                     1.      Riparian Habitat. Land occupied by riparian vegetation along the
                             banks of the Salinas River shall be retained and the scarce
                             riparian habitat preserved. Use of these lands for development
                             purposes is further restricted by the potential for flooding.
                     2.      Coastal Strand and Dunes. These lands adjacent to Monterey
                             Bay provide habitat for rare, threatened wildlife and plant species.
                             Approximately 1,600 acres west of Highway One are designated
                             as habitat reserve for this purpose. Except for a limited number of
                             areas where visitor-serving facilities and public park use is to be
                             permitted, this entire area shall be retained as open space. As
                             part of the “Habitat Reserve” designation, a stand-alone State
                             Park designation is recognized as an appropriate use by this plan
                             for the 370 acre Lonestar property, with the condition that most of
                             this site be provided with an implementing funding source for
                             protection of its habitat values, and recreational uses be limited
                             and subordinated to the habitat requirements of sensitive plant
                             and wildlife species occurring here. On both public and privately
                             owned lands, dune habitat shall be restored to a healthy condition.
                     3.      Maritime Chaparral, Coastal Scrub, and Coast Live Oak
                             Woodland. Approximately 1,160 acres of land within the Marina
                             Planning Area is designated for permanent retention in open
                             space so as to protect maritime chaparral, coastal scrub, and
                             coast live oak woodlands and other plant and wildlife species that
                             inhabit these areas. The designated lands include approximately
                             600 acres in the University of California Natural Reserve System
                             located next to the Monterey Bay Educational, Science, and
                             Technology Center; an adjoining 124-acre site occupying a
                             combination of lands conveyed to the City as part of the transfer of
                             the airport and adjacent land on Armstrong Ranch and 160 acres
                             located within the larger East Garrison Reserve. Another 227-
                             acre reserve is located south of Imjin Road. This area is a former
                             landfill site that has been capped, and which will be restored as a
                             natural habitat area. An additional 50 acres located along the east

                              side of Highway One in the vicinity of the planned extension of Del
                              Monte Boulevard is also a designated reserve.
                      4.      Wetlands. An area of 80 acres on the Armstrong Ranch property
                              between Del Monte Boulevard and Highway One is designated as
                              Habitat Reserve due to the potential presence of vernal ponds.
                              Prior to approval of development plans for this property, biological
                              field surveys shall be conducted to determine if vernal ponds exist.
                              If such surveys document the existence of such ponds,
                              development plans must provide either for the preservation or
                              replacement of this habitat. If such ponds do not exist, then the
                              property may be designated for other land uses.
                      In Central Marina, several vernal ponds are also designated as open
                      space, and a potential seasonal pond is located at the southwest corner
                      of the Reservation Road/Beach Road intersection. Any development
                      application for this latter site shall be evaluated by a qualified biologist to
                      determine the pond boundaries and any needed restoration measures
                      consistent with the Marina Landing Enhancement Plan, incorporated as
                      part of the 1989 Local Coastal Program Land Use Plan Amendment.

               Agriculture
               2.11 A 1,250-acre band of land along the southwest side of the Salinas River
                      contains mostly prime agricultural soils– that is, soils classified as Class I
                      and II and currently in agricultural production. These unincorporated
                      lands are designated as Agriculture Reserve in order to support long-term
                      agricultural uses. (2005-82)
               Parks and Recreation
               2.12 To meet the needs of existing and future Marina residents and persons
                      employed within the City, outdoor park and recreation space shall be
                      provided consistent with the standards of Table 2.2.
               2.12.1 Some areas of the Marina Heights Specific Plan may be exempted from
                      the standards set forth in Table 2.2 where the pedestrian circulation
                      patterns in those areas to be exempted provide a high degree of
                      pedestrian connectivity to the sub-neighborhood park serving those areas
                      and if, in addition, either the means to finance improvement of

                2.13   At present the City of Marina has a total of 96.7 acres devoted to local
                       and community-serving park and recreation use, including the sports
                       center, teen center, equestrian center, and school playfields. The present
                       ratio of City park and recreation land to population, excluding former Fort
                       Ord sites, is 5.3 acres per 1,000 residents. This ratio is consistent with the
                       current City standard of 5.3 acres of improved parkland for every 1,000
                       residents. (2008-42)
                2.14   The outdoor recreational assets of Marina are further augmented by more
                       than 650 acres of state and regional coastal parkland within the Marina
                       Planning Area and another 16,000 acres of U.S. Bureau of Land
                       Management land in close proximity to but outside of the Marina Planning
                       Area. Approximately half the BLM lands are currently open for public
                       recreational uses.
                2.15   Despite the citywide abundance of existing and already-planned park and
                       recreation areas, there will remain a need to provide neighborhood-
                       serving park and recreation facilities for under-served existing
                       neighborhoods and for new residential areas planned for the Armstrong
                       Ranch property. There also exists a need to finance improvements of
                       unimproved parks and recreation sites and fund on-going maintenance

                     costs. In the near-term, the City should actively pursue funding and
                     acquisition of vacant lots for park site development in underserved
                     neighbor-hoods as identified in Policy 2.16.3. To help meet this objective,
                     the City, in cooperation with the Marina Coast Water District, shall study
                     the feasibility of utilizing percolation lots.
               2.16  The following provisions shall be made to accommodate existing and
                     future park and recreation needs.
                     1.      New development on the Armstrong Ranch property shall provide
                             for park and recreation needs in accordance with the minimum
                             standards shown in Table 2.2. All playgrounds, neighborhood and
                             sub-neighborhood parks, and recreation trails shall be fully
                             improved by the developer. Responsibility for the improvement of
                             play fields and community parks shall be determined in
                             conjunction with the preparation of a specific plan for the
                             Armstrong Ranch lands and the establishment of any associated
                             development agreements.
                     2.      New development on presently undeveloped lands within and
                             adjacent to the Urban Growth Boundary shall provide a linear park
                             (greenbelt) or other open space buffer between the new
                             development and existing, adjoining residential neighborhoods.
                             (from UGB Initiative Section 2) (2005-82)
                     3.      At least three mini-park sites shall be provided to serve the needs
                             of residents in existing neighborhoods– one in the west- central
                             portion of Marina (in the vicinity of Lake Drive), one on or in the
                             vicinity of Carmel Avenue near Seacrest, and one in the
                             southeastern section of central Marina. The approximate location
                             of these parks is shown in the Community Land Use Element Map
                             (Figure 2.2). A mini-park is defined as a park of less than one
                             acre designated primarily for use of people living within 1,000 feet
                             of the park site.
                     4.      In former Fort Ord, with the exception of sub-neighborhood parks
                             to serve new or renovated housing, the dedication of land for

                     may be combined with other required outdoor recreation areas provided;
                     (a) the service area criteria are met; and (b) the design of park and active-
                     recreation areas provides, where necessary, sufficient separation
                     between areas so as to simultaneously accommodate different age
                     groups or potentially incompatible activities. To meet the recreation trail
                     standard, a trail shall link the area served to an existing or planned trail so
                     as to eventually create an integrated citywide trail system.
               2.19  At full General Plan build-out of residential areas, and with the
                     improvement of the former Fort Ord sites, the ratio of park and recreation
                     land to city population will be approximately 20 acres per 1,000 residents.
                     This figure excludes the former Fort Ord dunes areas, the State Beach,
                     recreation sites and open space on the CSUMB campus and future multi-
                     purpose play fields on school sites. (2005- 82)
               Golf Courses
               2.20 The City’s intent is to develop approximately 190 acres of former Fort Ord
                     lands which have been conveyed to the City with uses as described in the
                     ‘Restriction and Covenant to Restrict Use of the Property’ (CRUP),
                     executed by the Department of the Army and the Department of Toxic

               2.21 Approximately 1,230 acres are designated UGB Open Space consistent
                     with and implementing the 2000 Urban Growth Boundary Initiative. Uses
                     of these lands so designated are limited to those uses appropriate for
                     unimproved open space areas as defined by Government Code 65560,
                     including preservation of natural resources, scientific study and research,
                     managed production of resources, and outdoor recreation. (from UGB

               Housing and Neighborhoods
               2.22  The General Plan’s housing and neighborhood policies and related
                     programs have a dual function: to protect and enhance the quality of the
                     City’s existing housing stock and neighborhoods; and to accommodate a
                     fair and reasonable share of the region’s growth over the next 20 years.
                     The latter function should take place in a manner which responsibly
                     addresses a full range of concerns, among which are: (1) environmental
                     concerns associated with the protection of land, air and water resources;
                     (2) a desire to mitigate the closely related problems of traffic congestion

2. Community Land Use Element

                      and inappropriate use of land for development purposes; (3) concerns
                      related to qualify of life, including community appearance and housing
                      and neighborhood stability; and (4) socio-economic concerns related to
                      affordability of housing, community diversity, a balance of housing with
                      local jobs, and the maintenance of a sound fiscal base for the community.
                      The following policies and associated programs detail how the City of
                      Marina intends to accomplish these objectives.
               2.22.1 The Marina Heights Specific Plan may be considered to be consistent
                      with Section 2.22 in recognition that fair and reasonable implementation
                      of the Marina Heights Specific Plan may enhance opportunities for long
                      term economic development with fiscal stability. (2004-42)
               Accommodating Future Housing Needs
               2.23 The City of Marina is an integral and important part of the Monterey Bay
                      Region, an area of national and even international importance due to its
                      significant agricultural and recreational resources and its evolving
                      importance as a center for educational and scientific endeavors. As the
                      host city for three major educational research centers, each of which
                      make a valuable contribution to the community of Marina - California
                      State University at Monterey Bay, the University of California Monterey
                      Bay Education, Science and Technology Center and the Monterey
                      Peninsula College Marina Satellite Campus - Marina’s importance to the
                      region will increase over the next several decades. (2010-125)
               2.24   In 1990, prior to the closure of former Fort Ord, Marina’s population was
                      26,436. By 2000, the U.S. Census estimated that the City’s population
                      had fallen to 19,163, a 27.5 percent decline. (2005- 82)
               2.25   By the year 2020, the City’s population would range between 38,000 and
                      40,000, including current and projected residents of the Frederick-
                      Schoonover housing area and CSUMB’s North Quad new housing.
                      Policies contained herein will accommodate an increase of approximately
                      15,700 to 17,400 new residents through 2020, excluding CSUMB
                      students residing on the main campus. This estimated increase is
                      equivalent to an 82 - 91 percent population growth over a 20 year period,
                      at an average annual growth rate of 4 to 4.6 percent from 2000 to 2020.
                      (2005- 82)
               2.26   The General Plan’s commercial and industrial land use policies are
                      intended to attract a substantial number of jobs for future City residents,
                      providing them with a source of livelihood. The land area set aside in the
City of Marina General Plan                                                                  40
2. Community Land Use Element

                      General Plan for commercial and industrial uses is capable of
                      accommodating an estimated 28,600 additional jobs, substantially in
                      excess of the likely 2020 local work force, which is estimated at 17,700.
               2.27   Unless a major imbalance of jobs and housing within Marina and its
                      immediate environs is avoided, regional traffic congestion can be
                      expected to worsen due to the generation of increasingly longer commute
                      trips between housing (outside Marina environs) and new jobs created in
                      the City. A major imbalance between jobs and housing within Marina
                      would also help accelerate the pressure to convert prime agricultural lands
                      in the County for housing development. Conversely, construction of new
                      housing commensurate with new jobs within the expanded city limits of
                      Marina will provide ample opportunity for Marina residents to both live and
                      work within their community as well as avoiding or substantially reducing
                      the adverse environmental and social effects associated with an
                      imbalance. It will be a continuing challenge for Marina, in collaboration
                      with Monterey County and other concerned cities, to prevent the
                      significant county and community imbalances that will likely result from
                      major job growth in the southern portion of Silicon Valley and a spill-over
                      of housing demand to Monterey County.
               2.27.1 The Marina Heights Specific Plan may be considered to be consistent
                      with Section 2.27 in recognition that, while the Marina Heights Specific
                      Plan will not directly supply permanent employment opportunities, it will
                      likely enhance the City’s economic and fiscal base. (2004-42)
               2.28   Under California law, each community also has the responsibility to
                      provide housing affordable to all income groups.             The California
                      Department of Housing and Community Development assigns a share of
                      what it projects to be the statewide housing need to each region in the
                      state. In the Monterey Bay area, AMBAG then allocates the region’s
                      statewide share to local jurisdictions through its Regional Housing Needs
                      Plan. These housing targets are subsequently incorporated into the
                      jurisdictions’ general plans through updates of their housing elements.
                      Through implementation of its Housing Element policies and programs,
                      Marina will continue to enhance the local supply of affordable housing and
                      meet the housing needs of special-needs populations. (2005- 82)
               Opportunities for New Housing
               2.30 Marina’s opportunity to address these future housing needs is limited to
                      three areas:
City of Marina General Plan                                                                     41
2. Community Land Use Element

                     1.     Already-Developed Residential Portions of the City.             Land
                            available for new housing within these areas is extremely limited.
                            Within already-developed portions of the City, excluding land
                            west of Highway One, there remain about 61 acres of vacant
                            land, the majority of which is located in areas currently
                            designated for commercial or industrial uses. There are also
                            approximately 66 acres of land in already-developed areas which
                            are economically under-utilized - that is, where improvements to
                            land have a lower value than the land itself. A portion of this
                            under-utilized land is, however, occupied by mobile homes or
                            low-cost motel units, while other portions are located along major
                            retail frontages and may more logically be used for retail or mixed
                            use commercial development. Consequently, it is estimated the
                            Community Land Use Element policies would accommodate
                            between 400-600 new units in already-developed areas of
                            Marina, most of which would consist of multi-family housing
                            located in multiple-use commercial areas along with secondary
                            dwellings and small lot single-family homes.
                     2.     Areas of Former Fort Ord within the City’s Corporate Limits or
                            Sphere of Influence. This area is within the jurisdiction of the Fort
                            Ord Reuse Authority and is subject to the provisions of its Fort
                            Ord Reuse Plan as well as this General Plan. Sections 2.34 and
                            2.35 and Table 2.3 identify the various housing areas within
                            former Fort Ord and the number of potential units associated with
                            each area. With reference to former Fort Ord, the terms
                            “replacement” housing and “new” housing are defined as follows:
                            Replacement housing is new housing construction intended to
                            replace former military family housing units on a one-for-one
                            basis, such that for each demolished unit, a new unit provided in
                            its stead shall be considered a “replacement” unit irrespective of
                            housing type and location of the replacement unit’s building
                            footprint. New housing refers to that increment of a project’s new
                            housing development equal to the difference between the total
                            number of project units and the number of replacement units.
                     3.     The Armstrong Ranch Property. This approximately 2,000-acre
                            property immediately adjoins developed portions of the City to the
                            north. Approximately 320 acres lie within the City’s municipal
                            boundary and UGB, and the remaining, greater portion lies
                            outside the UGB but within the City’s Sphere of Influence. Most of
City of Marina General Plan                                                                    42
2. Community Land Use Element

                             the incorporated portion of this property is considered suitable for
                             residential, commercial, industrial, and community-serving uses
                             such as a school and parks, after allowances have been made
                             for natural resource protection, public safety, and open space
                             requirements. (2005- 82)
               Housing Policies
               2.31 It is the City of Marina’s intent to promote construction of new housing
                     that is environmentally and socially responsible and that adheres to the
                     following policies:
                     1.      In order to promote the social and fiscal well-being of the
                             community, new housing shall be phased and shall provide for
                             the needs of all economic groups, particularly with respect to
                             matching the needs of the City’s current and future workforce. In
                             addition, the development of new and substantially rehabilitated
                             homes, other than age-restricted housing, on Armstrong Ranch
                             and the former Fort Ord shall be linked with the creation of new
                             jobs pursuant to a development agreement or similar mechanism
                             stipulating requirements to help attain a citywide jobs-housing
                             balance. (2005- 82)
                             a.      The Marina Heights Specific Plan may be considered to be
                                     consistent with Policy 2.31.1 in recognition that, while the
                                     Marina Heights Specific Plan will not directly supply
                                     permanent employment opportunities and will not be
                                     phased commensurate with the creation of new jobs, it will
                                     likely enhance the City’s overall economic and fiscal base.
                                     (2004-42)
                     2.      To ensure that housing continues to be available to households
                             of lower income in Marina, affordable housing shall be provided
                             pursuant to the inclusionary housing requirement of the Housing
                             Element of this plan. (2005- 82)
                     3.      The Marina Heights development is identified as a
                             redevelopment project on the former Fort Ord. In accordance
                             with state redevelopment law, which places the obligation to
                             provide affordable housing on the Redevelopment Agency
                             (unless the Agency imposes the obligation on the developer), the
                             Redevelopment Agency has retained the obligation to provide
                             affordable housing in connection with the development of the
                             Marina Heights project. The Marina Heights project is therefore
                             not required to meet the provisions of Section 2.31.2 by providing
                             affordable housing on the Marina Heights project site, other than
City of Marina General Plan                                                                    43
2. Community Land Use Element

                            85 “bridge homes”, and, instead, the Marina Heights project’s
                            remaining General Plan affordable housing obligations may be
                            met by the Redevelopment Agency on a site adjoining the Marina
                            Heights project site. (2004-42)
                     4.     New housing shall accommodate a broad range of life-styles,
                            including those associated with the presence of CSUMB and the
                            MBEST Center, with people wishing to combine living and work
                            space, and with retired residents who will make up an increasing
                            proportion of the region’s population in the future.
                     5.     California State University at Monterey Bay should provide
                            housing opportunities for both faculty and students in order to
                            reduce commuter travel to and from the campus. The supply of
                            on-campus housing should increase at least as fast as the level
                            of on-campus enrollment.
                     6.     New housing shall be constructed at densities and in patterns
                            which conserve land, reduce reliance on the private automobile
                            and result in walkable, attractive neighborhoods.
                     7.     The Marina Heights Specific Plan may be considered consistent
                            with Section 2.31.6 if affordable housing goals are met, park and
                            open space areas are provided, and amenities such as pedestrian
                            and bicycle facilities (encouraging alternative access to transit
                            routes and offsite destinations), and home office areas (to
                            encourage telecommuting) are provided, thereby reducing
                            reliance on the private automobile. The City will actively work with
                            Monterey Salinas Transit to develop and promote routes to
                            minimize reliance on the private automobile by residents. (2004-
                            42)
                     8.     New housing shall be integrated into the fabric of the City in such
                            a way that it complements existing housing areas and contributes
                            to the overall stability, image, and sense of community of the
                            City. Accordingly, gated communities should be avoided and, if
                            included as part of a development application, should be allowed
                            only if significant public benefits are provided as part of the
                            project.
                     9.     Amenities such as common open space, pedestrian paths and
                            bikeways, and well-landscaped streets shall be incorporated into
                            the design of new housing areas so as to ensure the long-term
                            desirability and stability of these areas as well as contribute to the
                            needs of the larger community. Single-family and Village Home
                            dwellings may be clustered and designed to provide for additional
                            common open space.
City of Marina General Plan                                                                      44
2. Community Land Use Element

                      10.     New housing shall be built to development and construction
                              standards that conserve water and energy.
                      11.     A fair share of infrastructure and public service costs shall be
                              borne by new housing.             However, to promote housing
                              affordability, the City shall not apply development fees or other
                              levies to new residential development that would require such
                              development to pay a disproportionate share of municipal costs
                              for facilities and services which mitigate pre-existing problems or
                              benefit both existing and future residents of the entire community.
               Housing Potential
               2.32 The General Plan’s land use policies allow for approximately 6,800 new
                      or rehabilitated housing units. It is estimated that at least 95 percent of
                      the housing to be added to the City over the next two to three decades
                      will be accommodated in two areas: (1) Armstrong Ranch lands in the
                      northern incorporated portion of the Marina Planning Area; and (2) the
                      portion of former Fort Ord within the City’s municipal boundaries and
                      Sphere of Influence. Housing allowances and requirements for these
                      two areas are specified below. Except where noted below, these
                      estimates rely upon calculations applying the density ranges on Figure
                      2.2 as gross densities, as defined in Section 1.13.2 of this plan.
                      Additional development and design policies and requirements are set
                      forth in the Community Development and Design Element (Chapter 4).
                      (2005-82, 2006-284)
               Armstrong Ranch
               2.33 In furtherance of the City and region’s affordable housing objectives, land
                      outside of the City’s Urban Growth Boundary on Armstrong Ranch may be
                      developed incrementally before 2020 for the purpose of providing housing
                      affordable to households of very low, low and/or moderate income.
                      Accordingly, the City’s Urban Growth Boundary– as shown on Figures 1.1
                      and 2.2 of this plan– may be amended by the City Council for the express
                      purpose of accommodating lands proposed for the development of
                      housing affordable to very low, low and/or moderate-income households,
                      provided that no more than 10 acres of land is added to the area within the
                      UGB in any calendar year and provided that such amendment is
                      consistent with the procedural requirements of Section 1.21 of this Plan
                      (from UGB Initiative Section 2 ). (2005- 82)
               2.33.5 A total of approximately 1,360 units of housing are permitted on the
                      incorporated portions of Armstrong Ranch lands in accordance with the
City of Marina General Plan                                                                    45
2. Community Land Use Element

                     locational requirements shown in the Land Use Element Map (Figure 2.2).
                     Several types of housing shall be provided as described below:
                     1.      Standard single-family detached houses at a density of 5 units per
                             gross acre. Portions of the Armstrong Ranch lands immediately
                             adjoining existing neighborhoods shall be developed with housing
                             of similar density. Housing within the lands so designed —
                             adjoining the Cardoza and Crescent Avenue areas — shall not
                             exceed 5 units per gross acre. This zone shall include a mix of
                             single-family detached houses of varying lot sizes . The mix of
                             housing types within this area may vary from that in Table 4-2 of
                             the Housing Element. Rowhouses and townhouses near the three
                             Multi-family areas shall be encouraged to provide for the housing
                             needs of young adults and seniors. The Single family and Multi-
                             family areas shall be organized into three village settings capable
                             of supporting both local and regional transit, with residents being
                             within walking distance of local shops, schools, and park and
                             recreation facilities. (2005-82, 2008-42)
                     2.      Designate as Multiple Use these Multi-family areas that shall
                             consist of row homes and multi-family housing and neighborhood
                             retail and office uses, often within the same mixed use buildings.
                             The overall average density of the three Multi-family areas shall be
                             between 15 and 35 units per gross acre. (2008-42)
                     3.      Age-restricted housing shall be composed of a mix of housing
                             types.
                     4.      New residential development on Armstrong Ranch should be
                             cumulatively phased so that the number of new units allowed to be
                             constructed is consistent with the jobs-housing balance policy of
                             Section 2.31. (2005- 82, 2008-42)
               South Marina
               2.34 South Marina consists of the Main Garrison area of former Fort Ord.
                     Excluding the 192 units in Abrams Park housing area, it has 1,685 units of
                     rehabilitated former military housing which are already occupied. The
                     occupied housing is comprised of the following:
                     1.      1,174 units in CSUMB’s Frederick-Schoonover area,
                     2.      381 units in Preston Park,
                     3.      130 units in Abrams and Patton Park. (2005-82)
City of Marina General Plan                                                                   46
2. Community Land Use Element

               2.35  Excluding CSUMB and UC lands, the General Plan allows for up to 3,193
                     units of primarily new and replacement housing on Marina’s portion of
                     former Fort Ord, including the already occupied Abrams B housing.
                     Additional units developed by CSUMB at Frederick-Schoonover Park and
                     its North Campus Quad and by U.C. at its multi-use area would eventually
                     bring the total number of units that could be developed in South Marina to
                     approximately 4,718 (refer to Table 2.3). Former Fort Ord lands within
                     Marina shall accommodate the following broad range of new housing
                     types:
                     1.      All of the units at the Abrams Park and Upper Patton Park areas
                             to become part of the Marina Heights development may be new
                             housing if there is adequate demonstration that new housing will
                             be provided of a similar or better quality and affordability than
                             would have been possible for rehabilitation of most of the existing
                             units plus new infill. If the majority or all of the existing units is
                             replaced, new housing shall be provided in accordance with the
                             Marina Heights Residential Homes (MHRH) and Single Family
                             Residential (R-1) designations and shall include an integrated mix
                             of housing types and mini-parks at the neighborhood level. (In
                             this event, the land use designation for this area shall become
                             “Marina Heights Residential Homes” to replace the Single-Family
                             Residential designation.) A total of 1,244 units are permitted
                             within the Abrams Park and Upper Patton Park areas, including
                             1,050 new and replacement units developed in accordance with
                             the adopted Marina Heights Specific Plan. (2004-42, 2005-82,
                             2006-284 )
                             a.       The Specific Plan and/or final development agreement for
                                      Marina Heights shall include a local worker/residency
                                      preference such that at least 50 percent of all designated
                                      affordable below-market-rate units and the 85 “Bridge”
                                      units, will be provided on a preferential basis to Marina
                                      workers and residents in a random manner and in the
                                      following order of preference:
                                      i.        Persons working in the City of Marina (both public
                                                and private sector workers) and for the State
                                                University at Monterey Bay, and
                                      ii.       Marina residents.

                                    based upon length of residency and/or employment. A

                                    units. This prioritization shall be reflected in the re-sale of
                                    any home designated for preferential housing, including
                                    1,050 new and replacement units developed in accordance
                                    with the adopted Marina Heights Specific Plan. (2004-42)
                     2.     A Marina Heights Residential Homes (MHRH) designation, as
                            stipulated in the Marina Heights Specific Plan, will be utilized to
                            regulate development on portions of the Marina Heights
                            development.       It is the purpose of this district to ensure
                            comprehensively planned development of large acreage within
                            designated urban areas that are intended primarily for residential
                            use. The intent of the MHRH district is to: 1) Promote flexibility
                            and innovative design, to provide desirable aesthetic and efficient
                            use of space and to preserve significant natural, scenic, and
                            cultural resources of a site; 2) Allow for a diversity of housing
                            types; and 3) Provide recreational opportunities for use by both
                            residents of the site and the public. The maximum density for the
                            areas that will be designated MHRH in the Marina Heights

                            Multiple-Use land use designation shall be an average of 20 units
                            per acre. This housing is to be developed in conjunction with an
                            overall multiple-use pattern of development in the area between
                            Highway One and the campus. The average density of residential-
                            designated land shall not exceed 35 units per net acre. The
                            General Plan initially provides for no more than 300 total units on
                            the 20 acres with this land use designation; however, an increased
                            development potential of up to 400 additional units may be allowed

                                 housing, that is, units which combine living and working space, are
                                 considered especially appropriate, and are encouraged in the
                                 Multiple-use Commercial designated land. (2005-128)

                      existing neighborhoods, multi-family-designated parcels along Del Monte
                      Boulevard north of Reservation Road, and multiple-use commercial areas
                      in which housing is permitted. The latter comprises approximately 18
                      acres of vacant and economically underutilized land located along Sunset
                      Avenue and Carmel Avenue. The combined capacity of these areas is
                      approximately 200 units.
               Commercial
               2.37   The intent of the General Plan’s commercial land use policies is as
                      follows: (1) to provide for the shopping and service needs of local
                      residents, businesses, and persons employed within the City; (2) to attract
                      commercial development that will strengthen the City's fiscal base; and (3)
                      to enhance employment and other economic opportunities for local
                      residents. The General Plan establishes four commercial categories:
                      Retail and Personal Services; Visitor-Serving Retail and Services;
                      Multiple-Use Commercial; and Office and Research and Development.
                      Policies pertaining to the four commercial categories are set forth in the
                      following sections and in Table 2.4, which summarizes development
                      intensity policies for different commercial land uses.            The areas
                      designated for each category are specified in Figure 2.2.
               Retail and Personal Services
               2.38 The land use policies of this section serve to promote the development
                      and location of retail and other commercial personal services which
                      adhere to the General Plan's principal goals. This entails providing
                      locations for retail and service uses that will permit capture of a significant
                      share of locally and regionally generated sales. It also entails providing
                      locations that make access to such uses by foot and public transit viable
                      and attractive as an alternative to access by private automobile, especially
                      in the case of multi-purpose trips. The Community Land Use Element
                      Map designates 207 acres primarily for retail and other personal- and
                      commercial-service uses.
               2.39   A "strip" form of commercial development shall be avoided, and future
                      retail, personal-service, and business-service uses shall be concentrated
                      to infill the Del Monte Boulevard and Reservation Road core retail areas
                      and create more pedestrian-oriented complexes. Wherever possible,
                      commercial development outside of these areas shall be planned more to
                      complement rather than directly compete with commercial activity in the
                      Del Monte Boulevard and Reservation Road areas. Marina’s core retail

               2.41.6 (2006-244, DELETED 2008-111)
               2.41.8 Residential use may be allowed when located on upper floors above
                      commercial use, and designed and/or constructed in accordance with the
                      noise standards of this plan. Residential living space shall be included as
                      part of the total gross floor area proposed for a site. Within Marina’s Core
                      Retail Area, as defined by Section 2.39 of this Plan, the residential portion
                      of a mixed use building may occupy up to 50 percent of the total floor
                      area. Outside of Marina’s Core Retail Area, the residential portion of a
                      mixed use building may occupy up to 70 percent of the total allowable
                      floor area. A comprehensive approach to parking required for such mixed
                      use projects should be taken in which the potential for shared parking and
                      project features which might effectively reduce parking need are
                      considered, including possible credit for on street parking for retail. (2002-
                      168, 2005-82)
               2.42   Other allowances for retail, personal-service, and business-service uses
                      are provided for in the Multiple-Use category. This allows and encourages
                      the combination of retail uses with office, research-and-development, and
                      light-industrial uses. Retail and service uses, such as restaurants,
                      commercial recreation facilities, and specialty shops that serve visitors to
                      the Monterey Peninsula are also permitted within the area designated for
                      Visitor-Serving uses. (2005-82)
               2.42.5 Residential use may be allowed when located on the upper floors above
                      commercial use, and designed and/or constructed in accordance with the
                      noise standards of this plan. Residential living space shall be included as
                      part of the total gross floor area proposed for a site. A comprehensive
                      approach to parking required for such mixed use projects should be taken
                      in which the potential for shared parking and project features which might
                      effectively reduce parking need are considered including possible credit
                      for on street parking for retail. (2002-168)
               Local-Serving Retail and Personal Services
               2.43 At present, a major portion of Marina’s population purchases everyday
                      items such as food, drugs, and other sundries outside the City. The result
                      is both a loss of sales tax revenue in support of City services and the
                      generation of a greater number of vehicular trips by residents. In general,
City of Marina General Plan                                                                      53
2. Community Land Use Element

                      vehicular trips would be decreased both in length and number if everyday
                      goods and services were more available locally.
               2.44   In large part, the current situation results from the existence of an
                      insufficient population and level of expendable income in the City to
                      support the type of business enterprises that might offer desired goods
                      and services. However, with the increased population and diversification
                      of housing types envisioned by the General Plan in coming years, the
                      opportunity will be presented to rectify current deficiencies. Such an
                      opportunity will be further enhanced by increases in the daytime
                      population of the City as a result of employment at and MBEST and
                      growth in employment elsewhere in the City.
               2.45   The majority of future local-serving retail and personal-service uses shall
                      be concentrated in the following areas except as allowed otherwise by this
                      plan (2001-34):
                      1.       At the existing Marina Landing Shopping Center. At present
                               approximately 13 acres remain undeveloped here.
                      2.       Along Reservation Road between Del Monte Boulevard and
                               California Avenue. New construction in this area, however, will be
                               limited to scattered vacant parcels and other parcels that are
                               economically under-utilized — i.e., parcels with site improvements
                               valued at less than 50 percent of the value of the land.
                      3.       Along the east side of Del Monte Boulevard south of Reservation
                               Road. Retail and service development here will be limited to
                               several small vacant and economically under-utilized parcels.

               Other Retail and Personal Service Areas
               2.46 Other retail, personal-service, and business-service uses shall be
                      permitted in the following areas provided that the type and extent of
                      development does not detract from the viability of the primary local-serving
                      areas identified above.
                      1.       Small-scale convenience-center development shall be permitted at
                               the four following designated locations: (1) the intersection of
                               Reservation Road and existing Blanco Road; (2) the intersection of
                               Imjin Road and Abrams Drive; (3) the southwest corner of Imjin
                               Boulevard and California Avenue and (4) the southwest corner of
                               1st Street and 2nd Avenue. (2005-128)

2. Community Land Use Element

                      2.       In conjunction with the development of the MBEST Center, within
                               areas designated by the MBEST Center Master Plan.
                      3.       In areas designated for industrial and commercial services such
                               that they do not detract from the viability of the primary use of the
                               areas for industrial-service commercial uses and that they do
                               provide services needed by the industrial-serve areas subject to
                               specific review by the City. (2001-120)
               2.46.5 Additional uses beyond retail and personal service type uses may be
                      permitted in two locations outside the core retail area as defined above:
                      (1) along the east side of Del Monte Boulevard south of its intersection
                      with Carmel Avenue, and (2) along both sides of Reservation Road east of
                      its intersection with De Forest Road (excluding the east side of De Forest
                      Road). Such uses include: office type uses located anywhere on a site or
                      other non-residential uses as allowed by this section. (2001-34, 2002-168)
               2.47   The majority of retail and personal-service facilities shall be concentrated
                      in the designated Multiple Use area to the west of Second Avenue, north
                      of Eighth Street. Provision for such uses on the CSUMB campus shall be
                      limited to no more than 107,000 square feet of space. (2005-128)
               Regional Retail Sales and Services
               2.48 Retail sales and services intended to serve the larger Monterey Peninsula
                      shall be located in University Villages and Marina Landing Shopping
                      Center. These areas are designated as Retail/Service and Multiple Use to
                      take advantage of the proximity to Highway One and planned transit
                      improvements and redevelopment opportunities provided by the
                      decommissioning of former Fort Ord. (2005-128, 2005-265)

               Visitor-Serving Retail and Services
               2.50 The primary intent of the Visitor-Serving Retail and Services designation is
                      to capture a significant share of the Monterey Peninsula’s tourist-
                      generated economic growth, and in turn promote the General Plan goal of
                      providing a sound fiscal base for the City. With the sole exception of the
                      10-acre site at the Blanco Road entrance to the City, the areas set aside
                      for visitor-serving uses share three characteristics which make them
                      especially suitable for this type of use: (1) they are in close physical
                      proximity to Monterey Bay; (2) they offer opportunities for scenic outlooks
                      to the Bay; and (3) they offer good regional accessibility via Highway One
                      and planned future public transportation. (2005-82)

2. Community Land Use Element

               2.51  Permitted uses in Visitor-Serving areas shall be limited primarily to the
                     following, except where otherwise limited by area-specific policies:
                     1. Hotels, motels, and associated conference and food-service facilities
                          and sundry shops serving hotel guests.
                     2. Restaurants and other food sales such as farm products and wines
                          produced within the region.
                     3. Specialty retail, in particular, but not exclusively, of arts, crafts, and
                          other goods produced within the region which have market appeal to
                          recreational visitors.
                     4. Commercial recreation such as cinemas, theaters, bowling alleys,
                          skating rinks, and other recreation or sports activities conducted within
                          an enclosed structure.
                     5. Convention and exhibit facilities.
                     6. Other uses which the City determines to meet the following criteria: (1)
                          the use is intended primarily to serve short-term visitors to the
                          Monterey Peninsula; (2) the use will not preempt land required to meet
                          future demand for hotel and associated uses; (3) the use, and the
                          activities associated with it, will not detract from or otherwise deter
                          development of the primary uses listed above; and (4) the use will
                          enhance, and not detract from, the image of the City.
               2.52  Development on sites designated for visitor-serving uses shall not exceed
                     a FAR of 0.4, nor be less than 0.15. For purposes of determining
                     compliance with the minimum required FAR, land permanently set aside
                     as open space for purposes of natural habitat protection, public recreation,
                     or avoidance of natural hazards shall not be included.
               2.53  An interim use may be approved by the City Council provided its FAR is
                     less than 0.1 and a legally binding agreement is entered into requiring
                     cessation of the use and removal of site improvements within a specified
                     time period. Such a use must also be compatible with the intended visitor-
                     serving purposes of an area, and it must in no way constrain or deter
                     development of intended visitor-serving uses.
               Area-Specific Policies
               2.54 Limited visitor-serving commercial uses shall also be permitted on a 10-
                     acre site located immediately west of Blanco Road on the south side of
                     the Salinas River. The following conditions shall apply so as to address
                     the especially sensitive issues associated with use of this area. Of

2. Community Land Use Element
                      particular concern are the site’s adjacency to prime agricultural land,
                      riparian habitat, the 100-year flood plain and the airport (about half of the
                      site is located within the designated Airport Protection Zone), and its high
                      visibility from the City’s major Blanco Road gateway and nearby bluff
                      areas of the MBEST Center.
               2.55   This General Plan incorporates by reference the provisions and policies of
                      the Marina Local Coastal Program Land Use Plan (LCP). In the event of
                      any apparent inconsistency between the LCP and General Plan, the LCP
                      shall prevail for that portion of Marina within the Coastal Zone. However,
                      in any such case, the City may also pursue possible amendment to the
                      LCP and/or General Plan as an alternative means to resolve an
                      appearance of possible differences between the two.
               Multiple-Use Commercial
               2.56 The function of the Multiple-Use Commercial category is to permit and
                      encourage a mix of different land use types in a planned and integrated
                      manner. Intermixing uses serves a number of functions, including
                      extending the hours of activity of an area (which increases surveillance
                      and thus discourages crime), contributing to visual and economic vitality
                      and interest, and reducing the total number of vehicular trips by
                      encouraging multiple-purpose trips and access by foot to many
                      destinations. The majority of the land assigned to the Multiple-Use
                      category is concentrated in two areas described below.
               2.57   A minimum FAR of 0.25 shall be required, and FAR’s of up to 0.90 may be
                      permitted for well-designed projects which achieve General Plan
                      objectives such as effectively integrating two or more uses; providing for a
                      pedestrian orientation, including landscaped courtyards, plazas and
                      walkways; incorporating visually attractive or high-caliber architectural
                      design, detail and materials; and providing for landscaping beyond the
                      required minimum. The precise upper limit shall be determined by
                      subsequent specific plans in areas subject to a specific plan requirement,
                      and through discretionary project review in areas not subject to a specific
                      plan requirement. Development in Multiple-Use Commercial areas may
                      take any one of three forms:
                      1.        Individual sites may be developed for any of the permitted uses.
                      2.        Two or more separate structures, each occupied by different types
                                of use, may occupy the same site.
                      3.        A building may contain two or more of the permitted uses.

2. Community Land Use Element

               2.58   The following uses are permitted in the Multiple-Use Commercial
                      category, subject to specific locational, proportional, and design
                      requirements of this section and Chapter 4.
                      1.       Offices for administrative use, professional services, real estate,
                               financial services, and other similar activities.
                      2.       Retail and personal-service uses.
                      3.       Business-service uses including those pertaining to computer
                               hardware and software applications, printing and duplication,
                               advertising, communication, and multimedia production.
                      4.       For-profit and nonprofit educational or training activities.
                      5.       Housing, provided that it occupies no more than 70 percent of the
                               total floor area of one or more buildings on any site designated as
                               “Multiple Use Commercial.” (2005-82)
                      6.       Arts and crafts studios which do not involve use of toxic or
                               hazardous materials in a manner incompatible with other permitted
                               uses, or which do not involve transport of goods and materials
                               resulting in frequent truck movements or use of semi-sized trucks.
                      7.       Small-scale manufacturing or assemblage uses whose operations
                               are compatible in terms of noise, vibration, odors, and truck
                               servicing with the residential and office types of uses in designated
                               multiple-use areas within former Fort Ord.
                      8.       Research-and-development activities conducted in an office type

                      10.      Warehousing and storage, but only when ancillary to other uses,
                               fully enclosed within a structure, and requiring only limited truck

               University Villages
               2.60 The intent in this area is to create a unique district that avoids the sterility
                      often associated with single-use developments such as office parks. This
                      designation offers opportunities for both new multiple-use development
                      and creative reuse of existing former military buildings. The intent of the
                      General Plan is that the area will become a lively place to work, live and

                      recreate. The area’s adjacency to the CSUMB campus and to planned
                      transit accommodations lends additional support to this type of
                      development.
               MBEST Center
               2.61 Within the portions of the MBEST Center designated for Multiple Use
                      Commercial uses, a conferencing/hotel facility of up to 150 bedrooms may
                      be allowed in order to support and enhance the variety of business uses
                      planned for the MBEST Center/Airport Business Park.
               UC Multiple-Use Lands North of 8th Street
               2.62 The intent in this area is to allow for housing to serve educational
                      institutions nearby Marina along with other non-residential uses,
                      consistent with the following parameters and all in a setting which respects
                      the natural amenities and constraints of the site. Up to 330 residential
                      units may be allowed, and some portion of this number may be visitor-
                      serving units. In order to accommodate this number of units, housing may
                      occupy up to 57% of the combined total floor area of all projects in this
                      area. Given the fairly narrow market segment of housing intended for this
                      area, housing to serve educational institutions need not meet every one of
                      the growth management or other General Plan provisions intended to
                      achieve a jobs housing balance in Marina. Such housing, however, still
                      needs to be targeted to jobs based in Monterey County. Any and all of the
                      “existing potable water supply” as referenced in Section 3.11.5.4 (b) and
                      elsewhere in the Fort Ord Reuse Plan which serves development in this
                      area shall come from the Fort Ord Reuse Authority’s water allocation for
                      the University of California and its MBEST Center. Most notable among
                      the natural amenities to be addressed are the significant oak woodlands
                      found at this location. To protect as much of the existing oak woodland as
                      possible, development shall be clustered, and building heights may vary
                      from those characteristic of the vicinity as long as development is still
                      visually compatible with its surroundings.
               Central Marina
               2.63 In the areas adjoining Carmel and Sunset Avenues, the above list of
                      permitted uses in Section 2.58 is modified such that housing is restricted
                      to no more than 70 percent of the floor area of a project only for housing
                      uses on sites of one or more acres. Sites of less than one acre may be
                      developed exclusively for residential use. (2005-82)

               2.63.5 The 1.44 acre site at 3125 De Forest Road shall include child care and/or
                      uses allowed in areas with a “Retail and Personal Services” designation,
                      and said uses shall occupy a building area equal to or greater than one-
                      half of the minimum floor area ratio of the site. Credit for said childcare
                      and/or retail and personal service land use square footage requirements
                      may be granted by the City at a rate of 275 square feet per parking space,
                      if parking is to be used by a retail or personal service land use on an
                      adjoining site is provided on the site at 3125 De Forest Road. (2002-128)
               2.63.51 The boundaries of the Downtown Vitalization Area are illustrated in Figure
                      2.4.     Prior to approval of any development other than temporary
                      projects/uses or projects already entitled to be built, a specific plan shall
                      be prepared which legally establishes development, design, and
                      infrastructure requirements in accordance with General Plan principles
                      and policies. (2008-111)
               Office/Research-and-Development
               2.64 The greater portion of land designated for Office and Research-and-
                      Development uses, approximately 297 acres, is located in the MBEST
                      Center and the contiguous Marina Municipal Airport and Business Park.
                      Smaller-scale areas for office/research use are provided elsewhere in the
                      Main Garrison area, on Armstrong Ranch, and along Reservation Road.
                      Unless otherwise specified, development shall not exceed a FAR of 0.45
                      or be less than 0.25. (2005-82)
               Permitted Uses
               2.65 Except as further specified in the following sections under Office and
                      Research- and-Development, permitted uses shall be limited to offices for
                      administrative, professional, and financial services; medical and health
                      facilities; and research-and-development activities conducted in an office
                      environment or in laboratory space. Production or assemblage activities
                      which are secondary to the research function and do not require the
                      frequent transportation of goods or materials or large bulk items may also
                      be permitted. Such production or assemblage activities not necessarily
                      secondary to a research function may be carried out in the MBEST Center
                      and adjoining Marina Airport Business Park when they are consistent with
                      the list of uses permitted under the Research and Development Land Use
                      Category in the University of California’s Monterey Bay Education,
                      Science, and Technology Center Master Plan, which was adopted by the
                      University of California Regents, March 21, 1997. Such production or
                      assemblage activities not necessarily secondary to a research function
                      may also be carried out in the interior of a single parcel or site with this

                     business-service uses are also permitted, provided such uses are ancillary
                     to the primary use, intended primarily for the convenience of the office or
                     R&D workforce within the same site or complex of buildings, and do not
                     occupy more than 5 percent of the gross floor area of the building or
                     complex within which they are located.
               MBEST Center
               2.66 These designated University of California-owned lands are intended to
                     accommodate public, nonprofit, and private office and research-and-
                     development activities devoted to educational, scientific or technology
                     endeavors, and which may also have limited manufacturing components.
                     Private office and research uses are limited to those which have a
                     relationship to the University or other govern-mental and nonprofit
                     educational and research activities located within the Center or elsewhere
                     in the Monterey Bay area.
               2.67  All applications for private and nonprofit development within the MBEST
                     Center shall be subject to approval by the City of Marina. The
                     development standards and guidelines governing development of office
                     and research activities set forth in the University of California’s Monterey
                     Bay Educational, Science, and Technology Center Master Plan, which
                     was adopted by the University of California Regents, March 21, 1997,
                     shall be used as the primary basis for approval for such applications, with
                     the exception that development intensity up to an FAR of 0.5 may be
                     allowed and building heights of up to fifty-six (56) feet may be allowed,
                     provided that visual simulations shall be prepared by project applicants for
                     any buildings proposed over thirty-five (35) feet high.             All such
                     development shall also be subject to applicable provisions of this General
                     Plan as well as the requirements of City of Marina Building Code, other
                     public safety code requirements, and fees and in-lieu payments in effect at
                     the time of application. Possible future amendments to the MBEST
                     Master Plan by the University shall also become applicable for City review
                     upon the City’s separate acceptance of any such amendments, which may
                     occur by the City Council without requiring amendment to this General
                     Plan. (2005-45, 2005-82)
               South Marina
               2.68 Several major sites are designated for office and research-and-
                     development uses in the North and West University Village areas of South

                      users seeking large sites with nearby freeway access, potential for future
                      regional transit service, and proximity to the CSUMB campus. A total of
                      45 acres is reserved for these purposes. Development shall be limited to
                      FAR’s ranging from 0.25 to 0.35. Development to an FAR of 0.35 is
                      appropriate and desirable for any site located within 1,500 feet of a
                      designated transit station site. (2005-82)
               Armstrong Ranch
               2.69 A more limited area of approximately 12 acres designated for office and
                      research-and-development use is located in the incorporated portion of
                      Armstrong Ranch as shown in Figure 2.2. (2005-82, 2008-42)
               2.70   This location offers advantages of good regional vehicular access,
                      potential for regional commuter-rail service, and proximity to planned retail
                      and visitor-serving uses. The area’s potential is further enhanced by its
                      high visibility from both Highway One and Del Monte Boulevard, and by its
                      position at the northern gateway to the City. Due to this visibility and
                      special location, however, high standards of site, landscape and
                      architectural design shall be required to protect and enhance the scenic
                      quality of Highway One and the City’s northern gateway. More detailed
                      policies addressing these design requirements are set forth in Chapter 4.
               Reservation Road
               2.71 Additional land area for office/research use is provided along the north
                      side of Reservation Road extending from the western boundary of the site
                      addressed 337 Reservation Road (APN 032-121-006) to the boundary of
                      the University of California Habitat Reserve where it fronts upon
                      Reservation Road. In contrast to the other major office and research
                      areas, this area is intended to provide opportunities for smaller office
                      developments with high roadway visibility for individual office structures
                      while allowing some continued commercial service uses within buildings
                      where they now exist and at the rear portions of new sites. Office and
                      limited commercial service use of this area also serves to limit the extent
                      of retail activities along Reservation Road, thereby avoiding or minimizing
                      a strip type of retail frontage. It is also intended to minimize impacts on
                      the adjacent U.C. Habitat Reserve.
                      For existing parcels on the north side of Reservation Road, those
                      business park and commercial service type uses permitted under the prior
                      land use designations for these areas may, when conducted in fully
                      enclosed buildings, continue to be established in the north portions of new
City of Marina General Plan                                                                    62

                       buildings as established in a subsequent ordinance. These uses may also
                       continue within buildings built prior to adoption of this general plan, also as
                       established by subsequent ordinance. Said uses shall be considered
                       permitted or conditionally permitted uses instead of non-conforming uses.
                       (2004-29)
               2.72    The FAR shall be limited to 0.45 if required parking is located in open lots,
                       and up to 0.6 if a portion or all of the parking is located beneath or within
                       the building it serves.
               Multiple-Use Commercial Areas
               2.73 Office and research-and-development uses are also permitted within
                       Multiple-Use Commercial areas. Approximately 1.2 million square feet of
                       office and research-and-development space could be built in Multiple-Use
                       Commercial areas assuming development at an FAR of 0.35 if 45 percent
                       of the floor area is devoted to such uses. (2005-82)
               Industrial and Commercial Services
               2.74    Approximately 290 acres of land are reserved for industrial and
                       commercial-services uses. Each of the designated areas has a distinctive
                       role based on its respective locational characteristics. The intent is to
                       accommodate a broad range of industrial and commercial-service
                       activities within the City, thereby enhancing local opportunities for
                       employment and economic development and providing for the service
                       needs of other uses within the City. (2005-82)
               2.74.5 Retail, personal service, and business-service uses shall also be
                       permitted in areas designated for industrial-service commercial uses such
                       that they do not detract from the viability of the primary use of the areas
                       for industrial-service commercial uses and that they do provide services
                       needed by the industrial-service areas subject to specific review by the
                       City (2001-120).
               Specific policies pertaining to the designated areas are set forth below.
               Permitted Industrial Uses
               2.75 The following uses shall be permitted unless explicitly excluded by the
                       policies and conditions for specific areas. Permitted industrial uses
                       include the following:

                      1.       Custom manufacturing such as small-scale manufacturing,
                               processing, assembling, packaging, or treatment of specialized
                               goods, such as precision equipment, scientific instruments, art

                               publishing.
                      2.       Light manufacturing involving processing, assembling, fabrication,
                               or packaging in an operation that does not create smoke, odor,
                               dust, sound, vibration, or lighting to a degree that might be noxious
                               or offensive to people residing or conducting businesses in the
                               vicinity.
                      3.       Warehousing involving the storage and distribution of raw,
                               unfinished, and manufactured products with on-premise sales
                               limited primarily to wholesale transactions and mini-storage serving
                               private individuals or firms.
               2.76   The designated areas are also intended to provide appropriate sites for
                      commercial-service uses requiring space and access similar to industrial
                      types of uses. These uses commonly require storage areas, both
                      enclosed and outdoor, truck access and loading areas, and on-site
                      storage of motor vehicles and may include equipment or vehicular-repair
                      activities. Permitted uses include the following:
                      1.       Construction-related services such as those related to general
                               building construction and landscaping.
                      2.       Building-maintenance services.
                      3.       Vehicular- and equipment-repair and -maintenance services.
                      4.       Uses involving retail sales of large bulk items such as plumbing
                               supplies, electrical equipment, lumber, and kitchen equipment are
                               also permissible.
               2.76.5 The potential for adverse impacts of industrial and commercial-services
                      upon residential uses has been addressed principally by the physical
                      separation of these areas from areas which have a significant level of
                      existing residential use or potential for such use. However, there are two
                      general areas designated for industrial and commercial-services uses
                      which have close proximity to areas which have a significant level of
                      existing or potential residential use. These two general areas are (1) the
                      Paul Davis Drive/Healy Avenue industrial and commercial-service area
                      and (2) the Reindollar Avenue industrial and commercial-service area. In
                      these two areas, industrial and commercial-service uses which have the
                      potential for adverse impacts upon abutting residential uses shall be

                      mitigated by a combination of design features and operational controls as
                      might be appropriate given the individual circumstances. Design features
                      should include orientation of any open storage areas and building
                      openings away from abutting parcels which have a significant level of
                      existing or potential residential uses and, where such orientation is not
                      possible, by the introduction of solid masonry wall and landscape buffering
                      at the property line. Operational controls should include limitation upon
                      the hours of operation, i.e., prohibiting certain operation or activities to
                      typical business hours. (2001-120)
               Marina Municipal Airport/UC MBEST Center
               2.77 A total of 214 acres of land has been provided in the Marina Municipal
                      Airport MBEST Center area for industrial and commercial-service uses,
                      which represents 74 percent of the total land area allocated to
                      accommodate growth of these uses in the City. The primary function of
                      this area is to provide sites for industrial and commercial-service uses
                      which are linked to aviation activities of the Municipal Airport or are
                      complementary to the various educational, science, and technology
                      oriented uses planned for the MBEST Center.
               2.78   Future development of lands owned by the City and successors in interest
                      at and surrounding the airport shall be governed by Marina Municipal
                      Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan and applicable FAA regulations,
                      policies, and procedures. Lands under the jurisdiction of the University of
                      California shall be governed by the standards and guidelines of the
                      University of California Monterey Bay Educational, Science and
                      Technology Center Master Plan, except as it may be modified herein by
                      this General Plan and, for that portion which falls within the airport
                      planning area, the policies and standards of the Airport Comprehensive
                      Land Use Plan, except that development intensity up to an FAR of 0.5
                      should be allowed and building heights of up to fifty-six (56) feet should be
                      allowed, provided that visual simulations shall be prepared by project
                      applicants for any buildings proposed over 35 feet high and such
                      development complies with the safety standards of the Marina Municipal
                      Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan and applicable FAA regulations,

               Industrial Area North of Marina
               2.79 This approximately 40 acre site, immediately east of the North Del
                      Monte/Highway One interchange, is located outside Marina’s city limits,
                      Urban Growth Boundary and proposed Sphere of Influence. It is currently
                      occupied by a large food-processing facility and is indicated as an existing
City of Marina General Plan                                                                     65

                     industrial use although not designated as such in accordance with the
                     UGB. The combination of direct truck access from the freeway and
                     availability of freight rail service make this an ideal location for
                     manufacturing, processing, and packing activities which involve heavy
                     truck movements and uses requiring freight rail service. Since these are
                     the types of uses which are not appropriate elsewhere in the City, the
                     additional available land supply in this area should be reserved for
                     transportation-intensive industrial and commercial-services uses. The City
                     should work with Monterey County to ensure that future development
                     within the area does not adversely affect the capacity and safety of the
                     North Del Monte Boulevard entrance to the City or detract from the
                     attractiveness of its northern gateway. Any future development that might
                     be approved by the County should be limited to one-story construction and
                     a maximum FAR of 0.4. (2005-82)
               Armstrong Industrial Park
               2.80 An area of approximately 38 acres, located both within the Marina
                     Municipal Airport Approach Protection Zone (as updated to reflect 2002
                     Caltrans Division of Aeronautics standards) and municipal boundaries, is
                     designated for industrial and commercial-service use. Use of this area,
                     which is part of the Armstrong Ranch property, is limited by the provisions
                     of the Marina Municipal Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan. This plan
                     specifies that uses within the Approach Protection Zone be limited to
                     industrial uses or other nonresidential uses of limited density. The plan’s
                     safety-compatibility policies further specify that the maximum allowable
                     density for non-residential uses be 50 people per acre. Outdoor
                     commercial recreation uses such as miniature golf courses, driving
                     ranges, and water parks would also be permissible. (2005-82, 2008-42)
               2.81  Based on the limitations of the Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan, use
                     of the site shall be limited to low-employment-intensity industrial uses,
                     warehousing and storage, and commercial-service uses such as building
                     construction services which involve enclosed and open storage of
                     materials and limited occupied building space. Development intensity
                     shall not exceed an FAR of 0.4 nor have projected employment intensity
                     greater than 50 employees or occupants per net acre.
               2.82  Due to the type of uses to be accommodated, well-landscaped buffers
                     shall be provided along public rights-of-way bordering the designated
                     area, and all outdoor storage shall be screened from view. Primary
                     vehicular ingress and egress to the area shall be limited to Golf Boulevard

                      so as not to adversely affect residential areas to the west and recreation
                      areas to north.
               Other Industrial and Commercial-Service Areas
               2.83 Three smaller areas, each representing a distinct situation, are also
                      designated for industrial and commercial-service use. The policies and
                      requirements for these areas address conditions unique to each.
               2.83.1 The potential for adverse impacts of industrial and commercial-services
                      upon residential uses has been addressed principally by the physical
                      separation of these areas from areas which have a significant level of
                      existing residential use or potential for such use. However, there are two
                      general areas designated for industrial and commercial-service uses
                      which have close proximity to areas with a significant level of existing or
                      potential residential use. These two general areas are (1) the Paul Davis
                      Drive/Healy Avenue industrial and commercial-service area and (2) the
                      Reindollar Avenue industrial and commercial-service area. (2001-120)
               2.83.3 In these two areas, industrial and commercial-service uses which have
                      the potential for adverse impacts upon abutting residential uses shall be
                      mitigated by a combination of design features and operational controls as
                      might be appropriate given the individual circumstances. Design features
                      should include the orientation of any open storage areas and building
                      openings away from abutting parcels which have a significant level of
                      existing or potential residential uses and, where such orientation is not
                      possible, by the introduction of solid masonry wall and landscape
                      buffering at the property line. Operational controls should include
                      limitations upon the hours of operation, i.e., prohibiting certain operations
                      or activities to typical business hours. (2001-120)
               2.84   The General Plan allows for expansion of the existing Marina Green and
                      Oakridge Business Parks along the west side of Del Monte Boulevard and
                      the Union Pacific rail line. However, industrial and commercial-service
                      uses are limited to land lying between the railroad right-of-way and the
                      planned extension of Paul Davis Drive and are restricted to those uses
                      determined to be compatible with nearby residences. (As described
                      earlier, the properties along the west side of this roadway are designated
                      for office and research-and-development uses.) Development shall be
                      limited to an FAR of 0.35, with allowances for an increase to 0.45 if 30
                      percent or more of the site is left open and attractively landscaped.

2. Community Land Use Element
               2.85   A 7.8-acre site at the south end of Del Monte Boulevard is designated as
                      Industrial/Commercial Service. This designation recognizes the existing
                      industrial and commercial-service use of the area. In the near-term,
                      industrial and commercial-service types of use should be permitted to
                      continue. However, given the location of this site at the south Del Monte
                      Boulevard entrance to the City, its adjacency to planned visitor serving
                      uses to the south, and its isolation from other industrial areas, longer-term
                      visitor-serving or retail use of the areas is desirable.
               2.86   The nine (9) acres located at the southeast corner of the intersection of
                      Imjin and Reservation Roads serves as a motor pool lot for the U.S. Army
                      Reserve. If the current military use of this site is discontinued and the site
                      is made available for development, future uses should be limited to office
                      and research-and-development activities similar to those permitted on the
                      adjacent MBEST Center. Alternatively, mixed commercial use may be
                      allowed to complement development within the MBEST Center and the
                      Marina Airport Business Park.
               Multiple-Use Commercial Areas
               2.87 Allowance for industrial uses is also provided in Multiple-use Commercial
                      areas located on former Fort Ord land. However, industrial uses in these
                      areas shall be limited to specialized types of light-industrial activities, best
                      characterized as small-scale cottage industries. Uses could include the
                      manufacture, fabrication, or assembly of small precision equipment items
                      or products such as custom clothing, art objects, or publications.

               Public Facilities
               2.88   Approximately 1,357 acres of the Marina Planning Area is set aside to
                      accommodate community-serving facilities.          This land area, which
                      represents 12 percent of the total planning area, is intended to
                      accommodate existing and planned community facilities, including
                      schools, police and fire facilities, civic uses, utilities, and various
                      transportation-related facilities. The designated location of these facilities
                      is shown in Figure 2.3. More specific policies and requirements are set
                      forth below.
               Existing K-12 School Sites
               2.89 The major portion of the City of Marina, including the area within the
                      former Fort Ord, lies within the service area of the Monterey Peninsula
                      Unified School District (MPUSD). The northerly, unincorporated portion of
                      the Marina Planning Area lies within the boundaries of the North Monterey
                      County Unified School District. Within the City, MPUSD currently operates
                      four elementary schools, one middle school, and a former elementary
                      school in former Fort Ord now used as a continuation/alternative high
                      school (i.e., Central Coast High School). Marina’s Del Mar, Crumpton,
                      Marina Vista and Olson Elementary Schools presently serve students in
                      kindergarten through fifth grade. Los Arboles Middle School serves
                      students from sixth through eighth grade. (2005-82)
               K-12 School Needs and Policies
               2.90 With total buildout of General Plan-designated residential lands, Marina’s
                      additional projected K-12 school enrollment will be about 2,870 students,
                      for a total enrollment of approximately 6,000 students. The projection is
                      based on an average of one student for every five bedrooms, with 60
                      percent of the students projected to be enrolled in grades K-5, 20 percent
                      in grades 6-8, and 20 percent in grades 9-12.            The distribution of
                      projected students is therefore calculated as follows:
                      Elementary (K 5)                1,722
                      Middle School (6-8)               573
                      High School (9-12)                573
               2.91   Accommodation of future students living within the City of Marina shall be
                      guided by the following policies:
                      1.      Develop a full service high school within Marina, with community-
                              based amenities including academic and athletic opportunities.

                     2.     Improve existing school sites as needed to        correct   existing
                            deficiencies and to accommodate a growing student population
                            consistent with each school site’s design capacity. Improve
                            existing school sites with permanent structures to reflect a pattern
                            of increasing, long-term utilization. Where improvements to
                            existing school sites would be needed to accommodate the
                            additional students generated by new (or renovated) residential
                            development, ensure that such improvements are in place or close
                            to completion prior to project completion or occupancy.
                     3.     Provide adequate new school sites to meet the projected year
                            2020 enrollment figures.
                     4.     Locate new elementary schools and a new middle school within
                            convenient walking and biking distance of households served.
                     5.     To the extent possible, minimize the need for school busing by
                            locating the high school within two miles of the majority of Marina
                            households with school-age children. (2005-82)

      CITY OF MARINA GENERAL PLAN                                                                                                            0.5       1       1.5       2 Miles
               2.92  Based on the above policies and enrollment projections, a projected need
                     exists for three additional K-5 school sites, one additional middle school
                     site, and a high school site. The General Plan provides for four additional
                     K-5 school sites, a middle school site, and a high school site - the
                     locations of which are shown in Figure 2.2. (2008-224)
               2.93  Although a K-5 school site was provided adjoining the extension of Blanco
                     Road in the Fredericks-Schoonover Park area as part of the Fort Ord
                     conveyances, this site is considered undesirable due to poor access and
                     proximity to a planned four-lane expressway. Alternative use of this site
                     should be considered.
               2.94    DELETED (2008-42)
               2.95  This plan recognizes that flexibility is needed in siting the proposed middle
                     school and elementary schools on the Armstrong Ranch property due to
                     aviation safety concerns and that, therefore, the designated sites may be
                     subject to future adjustment. (2008-224)
               2.96  The General Plan provides for three potential high school sites. First
                     priority is given to the site at Salinas Avenue south of Reservation Road
                     (Site #1); second priority is given to a site north of Reservation and east of
                     Blanco Road (Site #2); and a site at the south end of Marina on the
                     CSUMB campus (Site #3) is ranked third. All three sites should be further
                     analyzed based upon the feasibility of site acquisition and established
                     state school siting review criteria as well as City and School District
                     objectives.     Site #1 is given the highest priority for high school
                     development because of its central location and absence of acquisition
                     constraints (i.e., it is part of the former Fort Ord economic conveyance to
                     the City). Sites #2 and #3 may be feasible for high school use only if a
                     suitable property acquisition or exchange can be arranged with the current
                     owners. If either Site #2 or #3 do become feasible candidates for high
                     school use, Site #1 should then be considered as an alternative for
                     development of a new middle school.
               Other Educational Sites
               2.97 Excluding portions of the CSUMB campus lying within the City of Marina’s
                     jurisdiction, another 60 acres of land is designated for use by educational
                     institutions. This land allocation is largely the result of conveyances made
                     in conjunction with the decommissioning of Fort Ord. Areas of the
                     CSUMB campus located within the City of Marina’s jurisdiction occupy

2. Community Land Use Element

                      approximately 222 acres. The CSUMB Master Plan allocates this land as
                      follows:
                      Academic Facilities            32.5 acres
                      Student Housing                83.5 acres
                      Open Space/Recreation          49.9 acres
                      Multiple Use                   16.5 acres
                      Support Facilities             39 acres
               2.98   University of California lands - the MBEST Center, and the 47-acre site
                      located immediately north of 8th Street - are excluded from this public
                      facilities section of the General Plan, and are addressed under other land
                      use categories. Although educational types of activities are permitted on
                      these lands, the primary intent is to provide for both public, private, and
                      nonprofit uses related to educational, scientific, and technological-
                      research activities.
               Potential Civic Center Sites
               2.99 One of the primary goals of the General Plan is to bring together civic,
                      commercial, cultural and recreational uses to create a center, or centers,
                      to serve as a focus for community life and a source of community identity
                      in Marina. To accomplish this goal, the Community Land Use Element
                      has identified three potential locations for such a center. Prior to making
                      any further commitments on the location, design, or financing of any City
                      administrative offices, public-safety facilities, or other cultural or
                      community-center types of facilities with the exception of the library, the
                      City shall prepare a master plan for civic facilities and make a
                      determination as to which site or sites shall fulfill this function.
               2.100 The center or centers shall be multipurpose in nature, and shall
                      incorporate uses which provide for active use both day and evening,
                      weekdays and weekends. At a minimum, the center should include (in
                      addition to a primary public facility or facilities) a plaza sufficiently large to
                      serve as a site for special community events and/or reoccurring activities
                      such as a farmers market. Space shall also be set aside for small retail
                      shops and food service outlets. Three possible locations for such a center
                      are identified in the Land Use Element Map, and each is described briefly
                      below.      Other related design recommendations and conditions are
                      provided in the Community Design and Development Element (Chapter 4).
               Locke-Paddon Park/Marina Landing Site
               2.101 One candidate site is land along Seaside Circle. This site is adjoined on
                      one side by the Locke-Paddon Park and on the other by the Marina
City of Marina General Plan                                                                          73
2. Community Land Use Element
                      Landing Shopping Center. This site has the advantage of being located
                      along the Reservation Road entrance to the City. Although the site has
                      been primarily planned to accommodate a larger library for Marina, there
                      may be an opportunity to add other civic facilities such as City offices and
                      integrate them all with park and retail facilities. As described further in the
                      Community Design and Development Element (Chapter 4), approximately
                      12 acres is available at this site.
               Expanded City Hall Site
               2.102 At present, the City administrative-office facility is housed in a temporary
                      structure, and the City offices, City Council chamber, and a community-
                      center building are located at the west terminus of Hillcrest Avenue. The
                      City’s public safety building, accommodating both police and fire services,
                      is located on a contiguous parcel with separate access from Palm Avenue.
                      This City-owned property is on a low bluff adjoining commercial parcels on
                      Del Monte Boulevard.
               2.103 To accommodate rebuilding or additions to the existing facilities,
                      commercial properties along Del Monte Boulevard could be acquired. The
                      site could be further expanded through acquisition of residential parcels
                      along Hillcrest Avenue. A total site area of approximately 8.6 acres would
                      be possible after all these acquisitions were made. With the expansion to
                      Del Monte Boulevard, such a center would occupy a very prominent
                      location at the most heavily traveled entrance to the City.
               Salinas Road Site
               2.104 The approximately 50-acre site located on Reservation Road east of
                      Salinas Road is also a potential civic center site in the event that it is not
                      used for a high school. Given the large size of this site, it is possible to
                      build a mixed-use center that might incorporate other community-serving
                      facilities, complementary retail and personal-services uses, a community
                      plaza and public-event space, local-serving professional and medical-
                      service offices, and even housing.
               Police and Fire Protection
               2.105 Police and fire services to all parts of the City are provided from the City of
                      Marina’s Public Safety Building on Palm Avenue. A site and building at
                      the Marina Municipal Airport has also been acquired for use as a fire
                      station. This small facility was transferred to the City of Marina in 1996.
                      An additional site in former Fort Ord (on Imjin Road, between Imjin
                      Parkway and Eighth Street) has been approved as a station for future
City of Marina General Plan                                                                       74

                     emergency services to provide fire and police protection to the
                     surrounding communities. (2008-224)
               2.106 As the population of Marina grows, the police force should be sufficiently
                     staffed and deployed to maintain an average emergency response time of
                     four minutes. Similarly, a maximum response time for fire protection of
                     three to four minutes should be maintained. Where new development
                     would be located beyond a three-to-four-minute response time,
                     consideration should be given to the need for Class A fire-resistant
                     roofing.
               Childcare Facilities
               2.107 Provisions shall be made for childcare facilities with the development of
                     major job centers in the MBEST Center and Marina Airport Business Park,
                     the commercial and industrial center of Armstrong Ranch, the West
                     University Village, and all other large- scale mixed-use projects. Such
                     facilities proposed nearby the Marina Municipal Airport shall be sited in
                     accordance with the provisions of the Marina Municipal Airport
                     Comprehensive Land Use Plan. All childcare facilities shall be adequate
                     to serve the projected employee base of the respective areas.
               Transportation and Utilities
               2.108 In addition to the rights-of-way required for roads, rail lines, power,
                     wastewater, water, and storm drainage, the Land Use Element Map
                     (Figure 2.2) sets aside approximately 1,050 acres to accommodate
                     facilities associated with transportation and utility functions. The function
                     of existing and future sites designated for these purposes is shown in
                     Figure 2.2. The most significant uses are the Marina Municipal Airport,
                     which occupies 223 acres and a designated 233-acre site for a recycled-
                     water reservoir on Armstrong Ranch lands. Figure 2.3 identifies the
                     specific functions accommodated on the designated public-facility sites.
                     Detailed policies and standards pertaining to transportation, water supply,
                     storm water facilities, and wastewater facilities are contained in Chapter 3
                     of this document.

2. Community Land Use Element
3. Community Infrastructure Element
               Function and Content
               3.1   The physical development and well-being of a community depend upon
                     the ability to provide for its needs for physical infrastructure in a variety of
                     areas in an efficient and timely manner. Among these areas are
                     transportation, water supply, wastewater treatment and disposal, storm
                     water drainage, and solid-waste management. To achieve this overall
                     objective requires close coordination between land use decisions and
                     provision of essential infrastructure elements. The policies and programs
                     set forth below address both the circulation and infrastructure planning
                     requirements of Section 65302(b) of the State Government Code.
               3.2   This element is organized into the following five sections:
               1.    Transportation. With the exception of air transport and flights, this section
                     establishes the route and facility requirements for all modes of travel,
                     including automobile, transit, pedestrian and bicycle. Air flight routes and
                     related infrastructure development shall be governed by the Marina
                     Municipal Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan, Airport Layout Plan,
                     and other applicable plans, including those pertaining to development of
                     airport capital facilities.
               2.    Water Supply and Management. This section outlines provisions for
                     meeting the water supply needs of existing and future users and
                     managing and conserving scarce resources.
               3.    Stormwater Drainage. This section addresses the needs and methods for
                     accommodating the increases or changes in storm water runoff produced
                     by anticipated development activities.
               4.    Wastewater Management. This section addresses the future needs for
                     sewer services and treatment and discharge of wastewater.
               5.    Solid-Waste Management. This section addresses provisions for the
                     collection and disposal of solid waste and programs to reduce the
                     generation of solid waste.
               Primary Policies
               3.3   The intent of the General Plan Transportation and Infrastructure Element
                     is to ensure that the requirements for transportation, water supply,
                     wastewater collection and treatment, storm water drainage, and solid-
                     waste disposal generated by existing and future development are
                     adequately provided for. It is also the intent of this section to ensure, to
City of Marina General Plan                                                                       76
3. Community Infrastructure Element
                     the maximum extent possible, that the provision of such services does not
                     have a deleterious affect on either natural resources or the quality of life
                     of residents of Marina or other potentially affected areas. The major
                     concerns of this section are outlined below:
                     1.      Develop future areas of the City, and redevelop existing
                             developed areas, in patterns and to densities that make the
                             provision of frequent regional and local transit economically
                             feasible.
                             (a)      The Marina Heights Specific Plan may be considered to be
                                      consistent with Section 3.3.1 if affordable housing goals
                                      are met, park and open space areas are provided, and
                                      amenities such as pedestrian and bicycle facilities
                                      (encouraging alternative access to transit routes and offsite
                                      destinations), and home office areas (to encourage
                                      telecommuting) are provided, thereby reducing reliance on
                                      the automobile. The City will actively work with Monterey
                                      Salinas Transit to develop and promote routes to minimize
                                      reliance on the private automobile by residents. (2004-42)
                     2.      Reduce the length and travel time of work trips generated by local
                             residents by maximizing opportunities for residents to work within
                             the community. Figure 2.2, Land Use Plan, designates areas
                             appropriate for industrial and commercial uses, including multiple
                             use, office research, retail/service and visitor-serving uses. Land
                             use changes that reduce future job opportunities in the City and
                             immediate environs should be avoided. (2004-42)
                     3.      The Marina Heights Specific Plan may be considered consistent
                             with Policy 3.3.2 based upon contribution of appropriate impact
                             fees, implementation of adequate mitigation and provision of
                             design features and amenities necessary to reduce travel times to
                             areas designated as employment centers in the community.
                             (2004-42)
                     4.      Reduce the number and length of vehicular trips and limit overall
                             traffic congestion by promoting land use patterns which allow for
                             multipurpose trips and trip deferral during peak travel times.
                     5.      The City of Marina shall ensure that walking and bicycling routes
                             are integral parts of street design and form a safe and preferred
                             transportation network. (2010-13)
                     6.      Protect existing and future residential areas from through-traffic
                             that creates safety, noise, and pollution problems.
                     7.      The City of Marina shall coordinate with surrounding jurisdictions
                             and agencies, such as TAMC, Caltrans, California Department of
                             Parks and Recreation, Monterey Peninsula Regional Parks
                             District, CSUMB, AMBAG, FORA, BLM, City of Seaside and
City of Marina General Plan                                                                     77
3. Community Infrastructure Element
                             Monterey County to pursue projects that develop new pedestrian
                             and bicycle routes and that improve and maintain existing
                             pedestrian and bicycle routes. New routes shall be linked to
                             existing routes wherever possible. The City shall coordinate with
                             these entities to apply for regional funds. (2010-13)
                     8.      Link existing and future areas of the City with an integrated
                             system of roads, transit, footpaths and bikeways that connects
                             neighborhoods, commercial areas, schools, parks, and other
                             major community-serving destinations.
                     9.      Where necessary and feasible, accept some traffic congestion to
                             achieve other community goals, such as encouraging the integrity
                             of neighborhoods and the use of alternative means of travel.
                     10.     Make all transportation decisions within a broad policy context that
                             considers visual, environmental, economic and social objectives
                             rather than being solely responsive to existing or projected traffic
                             problems.
                     11.     Minimize the consumption of water for urban purposes and make
                             maximum possible use of recycled water.
                     12.     Design stormwater runoff facilities so as to the recharge ground
                             water aquifers while protecting the water quality of these aquifers.
                     13.     Ensure long-term availability of required facilities and services
                             prior to approval of new construction.
                     14.     Support water resource programs, including desalinization and
                             reclamation efforts, to provide an adequate water supply to
                             accommodate General Plan-permitted growth.
                     15.     Promote reductions in the generation of non-recyclable solid
                             waste.
                     16.     The City of Marina shall consider incorporating facilities, such as
                             bikeways, sidewalks and recreational trails for non-vehicular
                             users, when constructing or improving transportation facilities and
                             when reviewing new development and redevelopment proposals.
                             (New Policy 2010-13)
               Transportation
               3.4   At present, Marina residents and businesses, like residents and
                     businesses in most small and medium-sized cities in the U.S., are almost
                     totally dependent on the private automobile for transportation. Public
                     transit service provided by Monterey-Salinas Transit (MST) is limited.
City of Marina General Plan                                                                    78
3. Community Infrastructure Element
                      Opportunities to walk or bicycle to most destinations are hampered by the
                      absence of continuous walkways or bike paths linking major community
                      destinations, and where such paths exist, they are hampered by unsafe
                      and unattractive conditions. The dependency of Marina residents on the
                      private automobile is further exacerbated by a land use pattern and street
                      system which makes the provision of transit service or the option of
                      walking or biking from place to place difficult and inconvenient.
               3.5    The environmental and social consequences of over dependency on the
                      private automobile are now well documented. Air pollution, excessive
                      energy consumption, traffic congestion, noise pollution, disruption of
                      neighborhoods, and inordinate amounts of time devoted to travel for work
                      and other purposes are among the many problems directly attributable to
                      automobile-dominated transportation systems.
               3.6    The intent of the General Plan is to reduce this dependency on the private
                      automobile by providing Marina residents and others traveling in, out or
                      within the City with other practical and pleasant means of travel. Future
                      transportation and related land use decisions shall adhere to the following
                      transportation-related policies and programs.
               Protected Neighborhoods
               3.7    Existing and future residential neighborhoods shall be protected from
                      intrusion by heavy through-traffic and from safety, noise and pollution
                      problems created by such traffic. To achieve this end, inter-city traffic
                      shall be directed onto designated major arterials, and intra-city traffic to
                      designated collector streets. The network of streets shall be designed to
                      prevent or inhibit the use of local residential streets for intra-city or cross-
                      town vehicular travel. All streets extended so as to be integrated with
                      developed areas of the Armstrong Ranch and former Fort Ord shall be
                      limited to two lanes, one lane in each direction. Streets so affected are
                      De Forest Road, Crescent Avenue, Beach Road east of Del Monte
                      Boulevard, and Carmel Avenue. (2006-243)
               Streets and Highways
               3.8    The network of roadways to accommodate the movement of private and
                      commercial vehicles is shown in the Transportation Policy Map (Figure
                      3.1). Roads shall be designed in accordance with policies and programs
                      listed below, and, to the extent feasible, roadway system improvements
                      shall be implemented concurrent with major development as allowed by
                      this plan. Forecasted 2020 traffic volumes for major or critical road
                      segments and recommended roadway standards for accommodating
                      projected travel demands are set forth in Table 3.1. See the Community
                      Development and Design Element (Chapter 4) for further policies
                      governing design of designated routes.
               3.8.1  Pedestrian and Bicyclist Safety Considerations. In the design and
                      operation of new transportation facilities, pedestrian and bicyclist safety
                      should be a priority in balance with avoiding automobile congestion.

                     Traffic calming devices should be employed to reduce travel speeds and
                     increase pedestrian and bicyclist safety. (New Policy 2010-13)
City of Marina General Plan                                                              80

               Major Roadways
               3.9    Roads serving major inter- and intra-city vehicular movement are shown
                      in Figure 3.1. The City shall strive to maintain a peak period Level of
                      Service (LOS) “D’ shall be maintained for all highway segments and
                      major roads within the Marina Planning Area, except that where existing
                      roads and highways are operating at a lower LOS standard at the time of
                      plan adoption, the existing LOS will be maintained or improved.
                      Consistent with past practice, LOS D shall be considered the applicable
                      “Threshold of Significance” for purposes of assessing project-level
                      impacts, and projects which will cause highway segments or major roads
                      within the Marina Planning Area to fall below LOS D shall not be
                      approved unless the City finds that feasible mitigation measures are not
                      available to mitigate the project’s impact. (2005-82, 2007-177)
                      Table 3.1.A documents the projected 2020 traffic volumes on these roads
                      and specifies the required roadway design necessary to accommodate
                      these future volumes consistent with this plan’s LOS standard. Based on
                      projected traffic demands, each of these major travel routes has been
                      designated as one of the following road types:
                      1.      Expressway - Movements on and off the expressway should be
                              limited to major intersecting streets, and the spacing between
                              intersections should be sufficient to allow for proper signalization
                              and control of traffic movements. Fully protected left-turn lanes
                              should be provided at intersections, and, where traffic volumes
                              require, exclusive right-turn lanes should also be provided.
                      2.      Arterial - Private driveway connections to arterials should be
                              limited so as not to unduly constrain traffic-carrying capacity, and
                              fully protected left-turn lanes should be provided wherever
                              sufficient right-of-way can be provided for this purposes. Since
                              most arterials also serve as major pedestrian and bicycle routes,
                              use of right-turn lanes should be avoided to minimize road width at
                              crosswalks and reduce the risk for pedestrians and bicyclists at
                              major intersections. Right-turn lanes shall be prohibited on those
                              sections of arterials which pass through residential areas.
                              Depending on projected traffic volumes, either two or four travel
                              lanes shall be provided. Normally, curbside parking should be
                              prohibited so as to maintain the required street capacity.
                              However, parking may be allowed along designated four-lane
                              arterials until such time that use of the full capacity of the road is
                              required.     In commercial districts, permanent street parking
                              needed in connection with commercial uses shall be permitted
                              provided that four lanes remain operational. Curbside parking is
                              allowed when four lanes are provided and the carrying capacity is
                              maintained. (2008-42)
                      3.      Two-Lane Parkway - This type of roadway provides for more
                              limited through-capacity along routes passing through less
City of Marina General Plan                                                                      81
3. Community Infrastructure Element

                                developed areas of the community. Connections to the parkway
                                should be limited to major road intersections and to major
                                destinations along the route. This designation is limited to Golf
                                Boulevard which adjoins or passes through major areas set aside
                                for habitat protection and outdoor recreation.
                 3.10  Due to preexisting conditions, such as need to use an existing street in an
                       already developed area for arterial purposes, it will be necessary in some
                       circumstances to modify the roadway design and traffic operations to
                       minimize adverse impacts on the adjacent uses. Such conditions occur
                       along California Avenue as it passes through existing residential areas.
                       Similarly, the dual use of Reservation Road east of Del Monte Boulevard
                       as a major arterial and major retail commercial street requires
                       compromising motorist travel times to accommodate pedestrians and
                       bicyclists sharing this route. Under these and other similar circumstances
                       it shall be the policy of the City to balance these competing demands and,
                       if necessary, accept reductions in traffic capacity or travel time to
                       adequately address the competing demands. (2006-243)
                 3.11  Right-of-Way Design. The rights-of-way for all new roadways shall be
                       sufficient to accommodate Class I or Class II bikeways, sidewalks, transit
                       movements, landscaping, and other design requirements. (2010-13)

                      two-lane parkways and expressways), collector streets also provide
                      access for individual fronting residential and commercial properties, and
                      often function as the primary pedestrian and bicycle route for the area
                      served. Such streets shall be designed to discourage speeds in excess
                      of 25 miles per hour and unrelated through trips. (2010-13)
               3.13   The following existing streets and extensions thereof as shown in Figure
                      3.1 shall function as collector streets: (1) Cardoza Avenue and its
                      northward extension into Armstrong Ranch; (2) Carmel Avenue and its
                      extension to former Fort Ord; (3) Reindollar Avenue; (4) Salinas Road; (5)

               3.14   Within the MBEST Center and Marina Municipal Airport Business Park,
                      the existing Imjin Road from Reservation Road to Neeson Road and the
                      following proposed new roads in the MBEST Center shall serve as
                      collectors: (1) University Avenue from Imjin Road to Golf Boulevard; (2)
                      MBEST Drive from Reservation Road to University Avenue; and (3)
                      Research Drive from University Avenue to Blanco Road. Additionally,
                      Abrams Drive and Preston Drive shall serve as collectors for the Abrams
                      Park, Preston Park, and Frederick-Schoonover Park neighborhoods.
               3.15   Design of Collector Streets.             All collectors within residential
                      neighborhoods shall be limited to two travel lanes, one lane in each
                      direction. Provisions shall be made for Class I bicycle paths or Class II
                      bicycle lanes, either within or adjacent to the roadway, and, where
                      possible, for bus turn-outs along designated bus routes. Table 3.1.B
                      shows the current and future status of designated residential collectors.
                      Within residential areas travel speeds shall be maintained at 25 miles per
                      hour. Where necessary, excessive travel speeds shall be avoided by use
                      of traffic-calming devices such as narrowing of the street at intersections,
                      stop signs, tight corner radii and roundabouts. Cardoza Avenue and its
                      extension into Armstrong Ranch shall be designed to discourage its use
                      as a bypass of Reservation Road for trips using the Highway
                      One/Reservation Road interchange. (2010-13)
               3.16   The City shall work to provide an additional means of emergency access
                      to visitor-serving developments and other development along Dunes
                      Drive in the event of blockage of access as a result of a rail accident or
                      natural catastrophe. To address this public safety requirement, an
                      emergency road connection of minimum necessary width should be
                      provided between Dunes Drive and the Lonestar access road if

                      necessary coastal permits and/or other Coastal Commission approvals
                      can be obtained. The road shall be designed to minimize adverse
                      impacts on the natural resource values of the area through which it
                      passes and its use shall be limited to emergency vehicles, pedestrians,

                      serving existing and future industrial uses along Paul Davis Drive, and the
                      planned extension to the north, shall be required to enter and exit the

                      redeveloped areas to the north and south.
                      As required by Section 3.15 above, the new road extensions shall be
                      limited to one automobile travel lane in each direction. Any additional
                      roadway width shall accommodate only transit, bicycle, and pedestrian
                      circulation. However, rights-of-way and plan lines may be wider to
                      accommodate possible additional lanes beyond the time frame of this
                      General Plan.
               Local Residential Streets
               3.19   For both safety and quality-of-life purposes low travel speeds should be
                      maintained on residential streets which do not serve as collector streets.
                      Calming devices, such as those listed in Section 3.15, should be used
                      where necessary to discourage unrelated through travel or speeding
                      vehicles. Where existing road widths are excessive for the intended

                       street function, surplus right-of-way should be used to expand on-street
                       parking if needed, or be devoted to pedestrian and/or bicycle circulation.
               3.20    Landscaping of Local Residential Streets. In order to provide greater
                       visual and physical separation between moving vehicles and pedestrians
                       and moving vehicles and residences, landscaping should be provided by
                       the City, developer or homeowner, as appropriate. This includes but is
                       not limited to street trees and low-maintenance groundcovers. Where
                       existing street rights-of-way allowances are available, organizations such
                       as homeowners associations and commercial landscape districts should
                       be considered to maintain existing street landscaping and add it where it
                       has yet to be provided. (2010-13)
               Intersection Improvements
               3.21    In conjunction with the roadway improvements identified in Table 3.1, the
                       following intersection changes or improvements may be necessary to
                       accommodate future vehicular travel needs.
                       1.      If the State Public Utility Commission limits the number of rail
                               crossings, the existing intersection of Paul Davis Drive with Del
                               Monte Boulevard shall be closed so as to accommodate a rail
                               crossing at the intersection of Del Monte Boulevard and extended
                               Cardoza Avenue.
                       2.      The Highway One/12th Street interchange will be reconstructed In
                               conjunction with the realignment and reconstruction of 12th Street.
                               The reconstructed interchange shall serve as the access route to
                               the extension of Del Monte Boulevard.
                       3.      The extension of Del Monte Boulevard to 2nd Avenue shall be
                               designed so as to provide vehicular access to properties along its
                               east side and to avoid disorientation of motorists by maintaining
                               the evident continuity of the boulevard.
                       4.      The intersection of Blanco and Reservation Roads shall be
                               constructed in a manner which accommodates the expressway
                               function of Blanco Road and the arterial function of a two-lane
                               Reservation Road while also providing for a transit guideway
                               parallel to or within the expressway right-of-way. The design shall
                               also provide for safe and convenient linking of the Class I
                               bikeways to the north and south of Reservation Road. (2005-82)
                3.21.1 Roundabouts. Roundabouts improve the safety of intersections for
                       pedestrians, bicyclists and vehicles by eliminating conflict, reducing
                       speed differentials, and forcing drivers to decrease speeds as they
                       proceed through intersections. Roundabouts should be considered when
                       designing new roadway intersections. Two options for bicyclist travel
                       should be incorporated, including riding through the roundabout or using
                       on-ramps to sidewalks. (New Policy 2010-13)

               Vehicular Trip Reduction
               3.22 In addition to the land use and transportation provisions of this chapter,
                       trip reduction measures for major new employers, expansion of existing
                       businesses or relocation of existing businesses within Marina shall be
                       required in order to achieve a minimum 10 percent reduction in estimated
                       peak hour vehicular traffic volume. The threshold at which this trip
                       reduction shall apply is to be determined during preparation and adoption
                       of ordinances required to implement this plan.
               Transit Facilities and Services
               3.23 Design for Transit. All future development and redevelopment shall be
                       designed to promote cost-effective local and regional transit service and
                       minimize dependency on the private automobile for work, shopping,
                       recreation, and other trip purposes by requiring bus stops and/or bays in
                       appropriate locations where there are direct transit access routes for
                       pedestrians and bicyclists. (2005-82, 2010-13)
               3.24    The Marina Heights Specific Plan may be considered to be consistent
                       with Policy 3.23 if affordable housing goals are met, and sufficient
                       amenities such as pedestrian and bicycle facilities and linkages
                       (encouraging alternative access to transit routes and offsite destinations),
                       and home office areas (to encourage telecommuting) are provided,
                       thereby reducing reliance on the private automobile. (2004-42, 2010-13)
               Intra-regional Passenger Rail
               3.25    The City could support plans to provide passenger light rail or bus rapid
                       transit services to the Monterey Peninsula to serve both tourists and
                       workers needing to commute into, out of, or within the area only if the
                       services/facilities are designed to avoid the use of heavy rail, to directly
                       serve the City of Marina and to adequately mitigate impacts to residents
                       and businesses. Site reservations should be provided at the approximate
                       locations shown in Figure 3.2 or alternative appropriate locations
                       determined by the City and other concerned regional agencies. (2005-82,

                       Street corridor shall serve as the primary routes for intra-city bus service
                       as provided by Monterey -Salinas Transit (MST).                    Intermodal
                       accommodations shall be provided at the two proposed passenger rail
                       stations along the Union Pacific rail line. An additional bus transit center
                       shall be provided in central Marina in the general vicinity of the Del Monte
                       Boulevard/Reservation Road intersection. The location and design of
                       these centers shall be integrated with other civic or commercial
                       developments to provide a safe, attractive, high-amenity setting that will
                       encourage transit use.

               Regional Light-Rail Transit
               3.27    The Fort Ord Reuse Plan incorporates a multi-modal corridor, the
                       purpose of which is to accommodate longer-term high-capacity transit
                       operations that would link the cities of Marina and Salinas. The plan
                       includes right-of-way reservation beginning at Blanco Road south of the
                       Salinas River and extending to a final station location adjoining Highway
                       One and 1st Street. The latter station shall be closely linked with the
                       passenger rail station planned for the adjacent Transportation Agency of
                       Monterey County line on the west side of Highway One. (2005-82)
               3.28    In the early phase of transit development in the area, the transit right-of-
                       way shall be developed with an exclusive roadway for buses. Bus transit
                       service along this corridor shall be used to help promote public transit use
                       and transit-oriented development at intensities sufficient to eventually
                       support conversion of the corridor to light-rail operations. A portion of the
                       MST service between Salinas, Marina, and other Peninsula cities should
                       be routed along this alignment. As shown in Figure 3.2, five station sites
                       shall be reserved to serve the planned development of the corridor.
               3.29    The initial roadway and subsequent rail lines shall be designed such that
                       these transit facilities will be integrated into and become a focus of a
                       pedestrian-oriented street extending west from the east side of Armstrong
                       Ranch to Highway One. Additional design and development policies and
                       guidelines for the corridor and station areas are provided in the
                       Community Development and Design Element (Chapter 4). (2006-243)
               Local Transit
               3.30    The City supports productivity-based transit service — that is,
                       concentrating transit resources in areas where there is sufficient ridership
                       due to concentrations of housing to ensure high transit usage and, in turn,
                       sufficient fare collections to support services. This approach differs from
                       that of many other communities which attempt to serve all areas of the
                       community equally regardless of density. Where resources for transit are
                       limited, this latter approach dissipates available resources and results in
                       low service frequency, limited ridership, further declines in fare
                       collections, and a continuing decline in service feasibility.
               3.31    Productivity-based transit service– i.e., where the service is most
                       needed– shall be provided by limiting local transit service, except for
                       those services required by residents with special needs, to those areas of
                       Marina where the density of housing and/or the concentration of
                       employment is sufficient to support cost-effective local transit operations.
                       It shall also be limited by the need to integrate local transit services with
                       regional and intra-regional rail and bus transit services.

               3.32  To ensure the feasibility of future transit service, 80 percent or more of
                     the City’s residential growth shall be located within the transit-served
                     corridors designated in Figure 3.2. Furthermore, all future residential
                     development within 1,500 feet (approximately 1/4 mile) of designated
                     transit routes shall be governed by minimum density requirements. For
                     new development within already-developed portions this minimum density
                     shall be 6.5 units per net acre (i.e., the area of platted lots, exclusive of all
                     streets and public facilities). The minimum density for newly developing
                     or redeveloping areas of the City shall be 7 units per gross acre (i.e., total
                     development area excluding major roads, public facilities and open
                     space, but including local streets and local open space features and
                     amenities). See the Community Land Use and Development Element

               3.37.2 Class II Bikeway Design. Class II bikeways shall be provided along the
                       routes designated in Figure 3.3 except where infeasible due to current
                       roadway widths between curbs in combination with necessary and
                       frequently used on-street parking. Class II bikeways shall also be
                       provided along those segments of Class I designated routes where site-
                       specific constraints make it infeasible to accommodate a Class I standard
                       bikeway. (2010-13)
               Pedestrian Facilities
               3.38    Sidewalks. Whenever existing roadways are improved or when new
                       roadways are approved or constructed, sidewalks should be included.
                       (2010-13)
               3.38.1 Continuous Sidewalks. Continuous sidewalks should be provided along
                       existing streets where sidewalks are currently lacking. In constructing
                       new sidewalks, priority shall be given to streets which provide access to
                       local schools. Any roadway within proximity of a school shall have
                       sidewalks on both sides of the street where feasible. The City of Marina
                       shall encourage schools to provide sidewalks or separated walkways and
                       paths on school property, support parking prohibitions near intersections
                       and crosswalks near schools, and provide clearly marked drop off zones
                       on public roadways. (2010-13)
               3.38.2 Pedestrian Connections. The City of Marina shall encourage maximum
                       linkages for pedestrian connections, especially to provide access to
                       parks, schools and employment centers.              Enhanced pedestrian
                       connections and crossings shall also be provided at appropriate locations
                       within one-half mile radius of future rapid transit hubs. (New Policy

               3.38.5 Parking Provision in Downtown Marina. New development and
                      redevelopment within downtown Marina shall provide parking in
                      accordance with standards set forth within the Marina Municipal Code.
                      To transition existing parking facilities into a more pedestrian friendly
                      environment that encourages parking in one place and accessing
                      businesses and services on foot, up to 50% of the parking requirement
                      shall be met through one of two means: 1) where a new or redeveloped
                      project is proposed and adjacent uses have underutilized parking lots,
                      efforts should be undertaken by the developer to negotiate shared
                      parking arrangements; and 2) where opportunities for shared parking are
                      not feasible, fees shall be paid to the City of Marina in lieu of required
                      parking dedicated towards future construction of a downtown parking
                      structure. (New Policy 2010-13)
               3.38.6 Internal Circulation. Parking lots should be attractively landscaped and
                      the pedestrian circulation paths clearly evident to provide direct, well lit,
                      internal pedestrian circulation networks provided to building entrances,
                      adjacent public rights-of-way and public transit. (New Policy 2010-13)
               3.38.7 Maintenance Program. The City of Marina shall schedule maintenance
                      of City-owned pedestrian facilities through the Sidewalk Maintenance
                      Program and bicycle facilities through the Pavement Management
                      System to maintain smooth walking and bicycling surfaces. (New Policy
                      2010-13)
              3.38.8 Barrier-Free Circulation. Wherever possible, ensure that work on
                      utilities allows for barrier-free pedestrian and bicycle circulation. (New
                      Policy 2010-13)
               Equestrian Trails
               3.39   Equestrian facilities in Marina should be directly linked to a system of
                      equestrian trails on nearby BLM lands and other areas of former Fort Ord.
                      To avoid conflicts between horses and vehicles, the existing equestrian
                      facilities north of 8th Street should be relocated south of Imjin Road when
                      major improvements are made to that roadway. Possible relocation sites
                      include the former landfill site south of Imjin Road and the designated
                      park areas south of Inter-garrison Road.
               3.40   Equestrian trails should be constructed of soft materials such as dirt or
                      granular stone in order to avoid injury to horses. Trails should have a
City of Marina General Plan                                                                    98

                     minimum width of 5 feet and a minimum vertical clearance of 10 feet.
                     When equestrian trails are incorporated into a multi-use trail, a physical
                     separation, ideally in the form of a low 40- to 48-inch-high fence, should
                     be provided between the areas of the trail used by pedestrians and
                     bicyclists and the area used by horses.
               Water Supply and Management
               3.41  The Marina Coast Water District (MCWD) is the water purveyor for the
                     incorporated portion of the Marina Planning Area. However, the service
                     area presently excludes the 366-acre Lonestar property, Armstrong
                     Ranch, and former Fort Ord. The District currently operates and
                     maintains both the water and sewer systems on former Fort Ord as part
                     of a "caretaker" agreement with the U.S. Army, and will ultimately obtain
                     ownership of them through conveyance.
               3.42  Major changes in the management of water resources will be required in
                     the area in the future due to the water demands of future urban users,
                     Monterey County’s nationally significant agricultural industry, and
                     increasing problems of saltwater intrusion into local aquifers. Water
                     conservation and water reclamation and reuse must constitute a major
                     component of future water management efforts. The policies and
                     programs of the General Plan are designed to promote both water
                     conservation and the use of recycled water to protect water quality and to
                     ensure that the demand of future community development does not
                     exceed the capacity to provide water in an environmentally acceptable
                     way.
               Water Sources and Allocations
               3.43 The City’s potable water supply is provided by the Marina Coast Water
                     District (MCWD). The primary water sources are wells tapping the deep
                     aquifer of the Salinas Valley Water Basin. MCWD also operates a
                     desalinization plant with a limited capacity of 300 acre-feet of water per
                     year.
                     The total potable water supply from these sources is estimated at 5,845
                     acre-feet per year (afy), of which approximately 55 percent, or 3,230 acre
                     feet per year, is available to support new development in the planning
                     area, accounting for the 15 percent reserve set forth by this plan.
                     However, the actual use and distribution of Marina’s water supply is
                     limited pursuant to a 1996 agreement under which the Marina Coast
                     Water District received separate allocations from the Monterey County
                     Water Resources Agency of 3,020, 920 and 500 afy, respectively, for the
                     City of Marina (excluding former Fort Ord), Armstrong Ranch and RMC
                     Lonestar property. Under this Annexation Agreement, the MCWD is
                     limited to using the 3,020 afy within the identified service area; the
                     Agreement prohibits the use of any portion of this allocation to serve new
                     development in other areas of the City such as former Fort Ord. Similarly,
                     allocations to the Armstrong Ranch and RMC Lonestar properties must
City of Marina General Plan                                                                  99

                     be used within the boundaries of those separate allocation entities as
                     specified by this Agreement.
                     Former Fort Ord has received a separate allocation from the Monterey
                     County Water Resources Agency of which 1,175 afy has been allocated
                     by FORA to the City of Marina (excluding MBEST) and 230 afy to the
                     MBEST Center. There is also a potentially substantial non-potable water
                     supply available in Marina for irrigation of large areas of turf such as golf
                     courses or parks. Under an agreement with the Monterey Regional
                     Water Pollution Control Agency, the MCWD is entitled to receive tertiary-
                     treated water from the regional facility up to the volume of wastewater it
                     conveys for treatment.
               Estimated Demand
               3.44 The total demand for potable water by 2020 is estimated at approximately
                     7,720 acre-feet per year, of which an estimated 5,470 afy would be the
                     demand generated by new land uses and development within the
                     planning area. This estimate assumes a total build-out of all residential
                     designated areas. For commercial and industrial lands, the estimate is
                     based on potential market demand for these uses by 2020. With use of
                     recycled water for irrigation of large areas of turf, the total demand for
                     potable water could drop to a level roughly commensurate with total
                     available supply and assuming the long-term reliability of existing deep
                     aquifer wells. However, current limitations on the use of specified water
                     allocations within the Marina Planning Area – pursuant to the 1996
                     Annexation Agreement – result in individual water use deficits for certain
                     allocation entities – i.e., former Fort Ord, the MBEST Center and
                     Armstrong Ranch. At the present time, the most feasible ways of
                     reducing these water demand deficits appear to be increased reliance on
                     water conservation, expansion of the existing desalinization facility,
                     construction of a new desalinization facility, and/or reclaimed water for
                     irrigation of large areas of turf and City parks.
               Water Resource Management
               3.45 In no event shall the City permit new development requiring water
                     allocations in excess of the available supply or in excess of its designated
                     water allocation for that portion of former Fort Ord within the City. Toward
                     that end, the City shall employ a sound water resource management
                     program which (1) protects the quality of the water supply; (2) promotes
                     replenishment of water sources; (3) minimizes water consumption; and
                     (4) makes maximum use of recycled wastewater for large areas of turf.
                     The primary responsibility for water resource management rests with the
                     Marina Coast Water District, as the water purveyor, and the Monterey
                     County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA), which is responsible for
                     managing the surface and groundwater resources of the Salinas River
                     basin. The policies and programs of the General Plan are designed to be
                     consistent with the policies and objectives of these two agencies, and
                     where within the legal authority of the City, promote these policies and

                      objectives in land use and development decisions and in the adoption and
                      enforcement of related development standards.
               3.46   Enumerated below are specific land use and development policies which
                      address the City’s roles and responsibilities in terms of assisting MCWD
                      and MCWRA in managing the area’s water resources.
               3.47   With the exception of the City’s allocation for former Fort Ord, a minimum
                      15 percent reserve shall be retained to ensure the long-term protection of
                      the City’s water supply for Marina residents and businesses. If no new
                      water sources are in place by the time the City has reached 85 percent of
                      its available supply, new development, may not proceed until reclamation
                      and reuse and conservation efforts are sufficient to offset the demand
                      created by new development or other supplementary sources of water are
                      made available to the City.
               3.48   On an annual basis, the City shall request that MCWD provide the most
                      current information on the supply of available water by specific allocation
                      area in order to enable the City and MCWD to determine the extent to
                      which new development or uses which have occurred during the previous
                      12 month period have affected the supply of available water in each
                      allocation area. The City will also request that MCWD provide the most
                      current water use rates by type of activity or land use, in order to provide
                      a reliable basis for estimating future water demand rates associated with
                      potential activities and land uses which may be allowed by this plan.
               3.48.5 Additionally, when an annual report demonstrates that the City has
                      reached 65 percent of its available water allocation within an allocation
                      area for which a project is being considered, the City shall request that
                      MCWD issue Provision of Service letters for all new or rehabilitated
                      residential (projects including more than one dwelling unit) or commercial
                      projects. The letters will include the water requirement for irrigated
                      landscaping and turf plans which are part of these projects and not
                      immediately scheduled for recycled water. These letters will outline the
                      amount of water required for said project, the water district’s commitment
                      to provide such water, and what that commitment will do to the remaining
                      water balance for that part of the City. These letters should be submitted
                      as part of the planning process and should be part of any development
                      application scheduled for presentation before the City Council, Planning
                      Commission or Design Review Board.
               3.49   New golf courses should be based on a links concept – that is, a layout
                      which minimizes the extent of groomed fairways so as to minimize
                      irrigation and fertilization. Drainage from greens and tees shall be
                      designed to avoid impacts on sensitive habitats or on surface and
                      groundwater sources. Except when needed to flush courses with potable
                      water for high salt concentrations or if there is insufficient reclaimed water
                      stored to irrigate during the dry months, new golf courses shall rely upon
                      irrigation from non-potable (recycled) water and shall not proceed with
                      development until the Marina Coast Water District’s distribution system
City of Marina General Plan                                                                     101

                     for recycled water becomes available. The proposed golf course shall be
                     designed to make maximum use of existing and future supplies of
                     recycled water. To this end, it shall be designed utilizing modern
                     drainage techniques to minimize salt build-up and shall use a grass
                     variety that is not sensitive to problems associated with irrigation from
                     reclaimed water. The immediate adjacency of the designated Marina
                     Airport golf course site to the Monterey Regional Pollution Control
                     Agency’s wastewater treatment facility and the proposed recycled water
                     reservoir should facilitate use of recycled water. (2005-82)
               3.50  The City and the Marina Coast Water District shall reserve adequate
                     water from its available allocations to serve new schools, expansion of
                     the civic center and public safety facilities, and other community uses
                     such as designated park sites (exclusive of landscaping, including turf,
                     which will eventually be irrigated with non-potable water).
               3.51  The City will continue to work with the Marina Coast Water District, FORA
                     and other regional agencies to secure sufficient water resources to meet
                     the expected needs of projected growth and development as allowed by
                     this Plan beyond the year 2015. (2005-82)
               3.52  Environmental review shall be required for all proposed subdivisions,
                     schools and new commercial and industrial projects which might generate
                     significant water demands. The objective of such review is to disclose
                     projected water demand relative to available supply and to explore
                     effective means of achieving water savings. Additionally, all major new
                     development entailing parcels or sites with substantial landscaping shall
                     utilize recycled water for irrigation once the MCWD’s distribution system
                     for reclaimed or recycled water becomes available. Projects approved
                     prior to such availability shall make provisions to accommodate water
                     reuse at such time that it is available. The City and Marina Coast Water
                     District shall ensure that existing Marina residents do not pay for the cost
                     of providing recycled water to new commercial development within Marina
                     or in other jurisdictions.
               3.53  The City of Marina, in conjunction with MCWD, shall continue to promote
                     and require water-saving devices. Specifically the following measures
                     shall be required:
                     1.       All new multi-family units shall be required to install water meters
                              for each unit.
                     2.       A study shall be undertaken to determine the feasibility of
                              requiring separate metering of spaces within new commercial and
                              industrial buildings and existing duplexes, triplexes, and other
                              multifamily structures. Metering shall be required if found to be
                              physically and economically feasible.
                     3.       All new construction shall use low-flow water fixtures and ultra-
                              low-flush toilets. The MCWD and the City should continue to
                              require that all existing residential units and commercial properties
                              be retrofitted with low-flow fixtures upon resale.
City of Marina General Plan                                                                    102
3. Community Infrastructure Element

                     4.       The City shall support MCWD rebate programs to replace older,
                              more water-consumptive fixtures.
               3.54  All infrastructure required for adequate water supply shall be in place prior
                     to or concurrent with new development. The cost for providing water to
                     new development shall be paid by impact fees set at a rate sufficient to
                     cover the annual debt service of the new water supply system. This
                     provision may be especially critical in areas of former Fort Ord, where
                     water-distribution and storage facilities are in need of repair.
               Stormwater Drainage
               3.55  The manner in which storm water runoff is accommodated has major
                     implications for water quality, safety and overall aesthetics of the area. At
                     present, storm water runoff is accommodated through the use of small,
                     scattered retention basins. Since Marina has mostly fine to medium-
                     grained, generally unconsolidated soils with a high percolation rate, this
                     type of localized storm water drainage will most likely continue to be
                     workable and practical.
               3.56  There are, however, several adverse effects of the present system of
                     storm water drainage that should be addressed. Among these are the
                     current practice of fencing in retention areas without regard to issues of
                     design or appearance and the need to prevent urban runoff from
                     contaminating groundwater sources. The latter will become an increasing
                     problem with construction of larger-scale commercial and industrial
                     projects, which are normally characterized by more extensive areas
                     devoted to parking, vehicular circulation, and outdoor storage.
                     Throughout the planning area most soils are also highly susceptible to
                     water erosion.
               3.57  To avoid the above problems related to storm water drainage, the
                     following measures shall be taken:
                     1.       All storm water runoff shall continue to be retained onsite and
                              accommodated by localized retention basins, unless the creation
                              of such facilities would pose risks to the public (see item 4 below).
                              Retention basins associated with a particular project shall be
                              landscaped with appropriate plant materials and shall be designed
                              wherever possible as integral parts of a development project’s
                              common open space or parks, or to create new or enhance
                              existing habitat. All onsite drainage facilities shall be designed to
                              convey runoff from a 10-year frequency storm at minimum. In
                              areas of the City where recycled water will not be readily
                              available, the City encourages the provision of storm water reuse
                              facilities of sufficient size to provide for landscape irrigation of
                              development in proximity to retention basins. The adequacy of
                              onsite and off-site drainage facilities shall be determined through
                              the preparation of storm drainage reports and plans, approved by
City of Marina General Plan                                                                    103
3. Community Infrastructure Element

                              the City Public Works Director; such reports and plans shall be
                              required for all new subdivisions and new commercial/industrial
                              development proposed in Marina. (2008-224)
                     2.       Pretreatment of storm water runoff from roads, large parking
                              areas, and other extensive paved areas used by vehicles shall be
                              provided using appropriate means such as primary settlement
                              structures, routing through settlement ponds, or routing through
                              adequately long natural swales or slopes.            In addition, all
                              development plans shall conform to the requirements of the City’s
                              National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit and City
                              ordinances, and all subdivisions and new commercial/industrial
                              development shall identify Best Management Practices (BMP’s)
                              appropriate or applicable to uses conducted onsite to effectively
                              prevent the discharge of pollutants in storm water runoff.
                     3.       Storm water systems shall be constructed in a manner which
                              prevents soil erosion. Appropriate measures to avoid such
                              impacts include the dispersal of runoff, installation of energy
                              dissipaters where dispersal is not practical and concentration of
                              runoff water is necessary, and retention of vegetation or re-
                              vegetation of affected surfaces.
                     4.       FAA warns against the creation of wildlife hazards within 5,000
                              feet of piston-powered aircraft, within 10,000 feet of airports that
                              serve turbine-powered aircraft, and within 5 statute miles of
                              approach/departure surfaces, including the creation of new open
                              water sources or habitat enhancement. Consequently, open water
                              retention and sediment ponds are not appropriate near Marina
                              Municipal Airport unless specific design features are included. All
                              proposed storm water management facilities on Airport property
                              should be designed using the guidance set forth in FAA Advisory
                              Circular 150/5200-33B, ‘Wildlife Hazard Attractants on and Near
                              Airports. (2008-224)
               Wastewater Management
               3.58  Wastewater treatment for the Marina Planning Area is provided by the
                     Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency (MRWPCA). The
                     MRWPCA also serves the greater Monterey Peninsula, Salinas,
                     Castroville and Moss Landing areas. The MRWPCA treatment plant,
                     which is located adjacent to the Marina Planning Area, has been
                     designed to serve an initial population of 286,000, but its design would
                     allow it to be expanded to serve area growth beyond that population. The
                     plant’s present capacity is sufficient to accommodate AMBAG’s projected
                     growth in the service area until at least 2015, before a full plant expansion
                     will be required. Prior to that time, the MRWPCA expects that expansion
                     of a few of the facility’s individual treatment processes will be needed to
                     accommodate increased flows and loading.
City of Marina General Plan                                                                    104
3. Community Infrastructure Element

               3.59  Wastewater collection facilities within the City of Marina are operated and
                     maintained by the MCWD. At present the MCWD maintains the collection
                     system in both existing Marina and former Fort Ord and shall be
                     responsible for maintenance of all future collection systems within the
                     Marina Planning Area.
               3.60  All development projects requiring discretionary approval shall obtain
                     verification of adequate wastewater treatment capacity from the Monterey
                     Regional Water pollution control Agency prior to project approval.
               Solid Waste Management
               3.61  Solid waste generated in the City of Marina is collected by either the
                     Carmel-Marina Corporation or the Monterey Bay Disposal Corporation
                     which serves former Fort Ord. Solid wastes are disposed of at the
                     Monterey Regional Waste Management District’s (MRWMD) landfill site
                     located north of the City within the Marina Planning Area. This 475-acre
                     landfill has a total capacity of 42 million tons, with an available refuse
                     capacity of 34 million tons. This capacity is sufficient to accommodate
                     waste management needs in the service area for approximately 90 years.
               3.62  The City of Marina provides for curbside recycling for single-family
                     residences through a franchise agreement with a private hauler. At
                     present, this provides for close to a 50 percent waste-stream diversion, a
                     rate consistent with the state-mandated diversion rate for the year 2000.
                     As the City continues to grow, however, it will become increasingly
                     difficult to maintain this rate.

4.      Community Design & Development Element
               Function and Content
               4.1   The primary function of the Community Design and Development
                     Element is to help guide the decisions that will shape the City’s future
                     physical and spatial form and appearance at several levels. At the
                     citywide scale, this element addresses how the City will relate to its
                     regional setting and how its major components (such as its network of
                     streets, its neighborhoods, its major open spaces, and its significant
                     concentrations of nonresidential uses) relate to one another. At the
                     intermediate scale, design and development policies are set forth for
                     each of these major components. And at the fine scale, policies are
                     outlined which govern design and development decisions to be made
                     at the scale of the individual site or building - decisions which when
                     taken together, do much to determine the appearance of the entire
                     City.
               4.2   The policies of this element cut across and relate in some manner or
                     other to all 17 Framework Policies of Chapter 2. Aesthetics and
                     appearance, functional concerns, environmental protection and
                     enhancement, and safety and security concerns are all addressed.
                     This element thus serves as the complement to both the Community
                     Land Use and Community Infrastructure elements. The Land Use
                     Element defines how the city’s land supply is to be used; the
                     Infrastructure Element identifies what essential community services
                     and facilities are to be provided; and the Community Design and
                     Development Element establishes the physical design and
                     construction requirements to accommodate the permitted uses and
                     required infrastructure.         Complementing and implementing the
                     Community Design and Development Element are the City’s Design
                     Guidelines and Standards for Landscape, Lighting, Site and Parking
                     Lot Design. These guidelines establish detailed landscaping, lighting,
                     sign and parking lot requirements for development projects and
                     should be consulted and applied as appropriate to all applicable
                     projects (as identified in the Design Guidelines and Standards).
               4.2.5 For development projects proposed at, or in near proximity to, Marina
                     Municipal Airport, consideration shall be given to the City’s Design
                     Guidelines to accommodate safe airport operations, airport land use
                     compatibility, and all appropriate FAA regulations, policies and
                     procedures. Such guidance and regulations address, but are not
                     limited to, lighting, signage, landscaping, building and roadway
                     setbacks, etc. (2008-224)
               4.3   The element is organized into the following five sections.
                     1. City Form and Appearance. This section addresses three major
                          subjects: first, the relationship of the built portion of the City to its
                          immediate environs; second, the form and design of major
City of Marina General Plan                                                                        106
4.                     Community Design & Development Element

                          citywide components, such as travel routes and major open
                          spaces; and third, the delineation and differentiation of the city’s
                          existing and future neighborhoods and civic, commercial and
                          industrial areas.
                     2. Travel Routes. Design policies and specifications are set forth in
                          this section for streets, highways, transit routes, and pedestrian
                          and bicycle routes.
                     3. Neighborhoods and Districts. Area-specific policies and guidelines
                          are provided in this section for the major residential and

                          problems of adverse noise, exposure to hazards, and security are
                          the subject of this section.

                          resource value are complemented by more specific site- and
                          building- design requirements to avoid or minimize impacts on
                          water resources and natural habitats.
               City Form and Appearance
               4.4   The form and appearance of a City, when viewed at a citywide scale,
                     can be thought of as ideally having four major defining components:
                     1. Edges which distinguish the City from other urbanized areas.
                     2. Travel corridors which establish the physical framework of the City
                          and make its organization apparent to residents and nonresidents
                          alike.
                     3. Open spaces and natural features which retain the relationship to
                          significant natural characteristics of the region and which
                          contribute another level of coherence to the overall pattern and
                          form of the City.
                     4. Neighborhoods and districts which are readily identifiable within
                          the larger city setting and thus further contribute to its overall
                          imagability.
               4.5   Citywide form and appearance policies addressing these four city-
                     scale features are set forth below and in the accompanying Figure
                     4.1. These policies address how to preserve and enhance such
                     features when they are already present, and how future development
                     may augment and reinforce them to produce an attractive, highly
                     imageable city.
City of Marina General Plan                                                                   107
4.                     Community Design & Development Element

               City Edges
               4.6    The urban form of Marina is quite unique, and distinguishes it from
                      many U.S. cities. Historically, the presence of former Fort Ord along
                      the City’s southern and eastern edges, the Armstrong Ranch to the
                      north, Monterey Bay and its adjoining public lands to the west have
                      served to clearly distinguish the City from its surroundings. Enclosure
                      within such strong boundaries has set the City apart both visually and
                      functionally from neighboring built-up areas of the Monterey
                      Peninsula.
               4.7    Several other natural conditions have reinforced this sense of
                      separation within the regional context. To the north, the City’s
                      boundary is clearly established by the Salinas River and the high bluff
                      on its southern margin. The bluff creates a sharp break between low-
                      lying riparian and agricultural areas and the higher coastal plateau
                      that slopes westward to the beaches and dunes of Monterey Bay.
               4.8    Figure 4.1 identifies those areas on the City’s edge where sharp
                      distinctions are to be maintained between open lands and adjacent
                      development areas. Beyond the City’s north edge, land use policies
                      limiting land uses to agriculture, golf courses and related facilities
                      including lodges, and habitat preserve will ensure the retention here of
                      a distinction between "town and country." To the west, the presence
                      of Highway One and coastal dunes should continue to define this
                      edge of the City. Construction of limited visitor-serving uses to the
                      west of Highway One shall adhere to the following design
                      requirements:
                      1.       Buildings shall be sited and limited to low-profile structures so
                               as to be visually subordinate to the natural setting when
                               viewed from Highway One.
                      2.       Building materials, colors, and forms shall be used which
                               blend in with the natural forms and colors of the dunes.
                               Building space should be broken into clusters of small
                               structures or contained in highly articulated singular structures
                               to minimize the overall sense of building bulk.
                      3.       All surface parking shall be screened from view of Highway
                               One.
                      4.       All landscaping shall be comprised of plant material native to
                               the Marina dunes and other appropriate, non-invasive species
                               compatible with dune vegetation.
                      5.       No commercial signs shall be permitted on buildings or
                               properties which are visible to people using the beach, while
                               signage which is oriented and sized to be easily visible to
                               travelers on Highway One shall be permitted only for those
                               properties contiguous to the Highway One right-of-way.
               4.9    Along the City’s northern and eastern edges, the land designated for
                      open space and natural habitat purposes provides a well-defined
                      edge to the City. This condition is further reinforced southeast of
City of Marina General Plan                                                                     108
4.                      Community Design & Development Element

                      Blanco Road by the Salinas River and the high bluff along its southern
                      bank. The following design policies shall apply to these areas:
                      1.       Adjoining village housing in the Armstrong Ranch should form
                               a strong, well-defined edge.
                      2.       Streets within the developed areas should be designed to
                               provide vistas of outlying open spaces, thereby further
                               reinforcing the sense of a relationship between the City and
                               adjoining open spaces. (2005-82)
               4.10   Along the City’s southern border the major areas reserved for habitat
                      protection encircle the Frederick-Schoonover Park area and extend
                      inward as far as Imjin Road to provide a well-defined edge to the City.
                      Further to the west, however, city residential and commercial uses will
                      eventually border CSUMB’s main campus. Along this edge, 8th
                      Street and 2nd Avenue should be designed to clearly identify the
                      boundary between the campus and the City. However, to avoid
                      isolating the campus from the City, this edge needs to be penetrated
                      by streets and pathways which physically and visually link the campus
                      and the surrounding community. A similar design approach should be
                      applied along the campus’ 2nd Avenue frontage.
               Travel Corridors and Gateways
               4.11 The prominent position of Marina with respect to overall patterns of
                      regional travel also enhances the City’s identity and sense of place
                      within the region. Marina serves as the northern entrance to the
                      urbanized area of the Monterey Peninsula for travelers arriving from
                      the north along Highway One. The prominence of this sense of arrival
                      is reinforced by natural features, especially the crossing of the Salinas
                      River bridge and the abrupt change from open country to city
                      development that follows.
               4.12   At present, the “existing city” portion of Marina (Central Marina) as
                      shown in Figure 1.2 can only be entered at four points: (1) from the
                      west, at the Reservation Road/Highway One interchange; (2) from the
                      east, along Reservation Road at Salinas Avenue; (3) from the south,
                      at the Del Monte Boulevard/Highway One interchange; and (4) from
                      the north, along Del Monte Boulevard at Cosky Drive. The existing
                      city is thus distinguished by four well-defined (but not necessarily well-
                      designed) gateways.         With the closure and eventual complete
                      redevelopment of former Fort Ord, two additional gateways will be
                      added: at an improved 12th Street/Highway One interchange in
                      conjunction with improvements of 12th Street; and along 2nd Avenue
                      with the extension of Del Monte Boulevard. With development of the
                      MBEST Center, both Blanco and Reservation Roads at the Salinas
                      River bluff will also serve as major gateways. (2005-82)

   CITY OF MARINA GENERAL PLAN                                                                                                               0.5           1      1.5       2 Miles
               4.13  The City’s major streets are probably the most important element in
                     determining the visual image of the City for both residents and
                     nonresidents, both in positive and negative terms. As the major east-
                     west and north-south spines, Reservation Road and Del Monte
                     Boulevard provide an overall organization to the City that is easily
                     understood and remembered. And since these corridors are the most
                     intensively used public spaces in the City, they deserve a level of
                     design attention that extends well beyond simple concerns for traffic
                     carrying capacity. The 12th Street/ Imjin Road/ Blanco Road corridor
                     will be of comparable and increasing importance and, even though it
                     is planned as an expressway, it will deserve a similar level of design
                     attention.
               4.14  Future improvements along the City’s major travel corridors shall be
                     designed to build upon the positive attributes of these travel corridors
                     so as to enhance the image of the City and make the use of these
                     corridors more pleasurable for both motorists and adjoining residents
                     and businesses. To achieve this end, the following policies shall
                     apply.
                     1.      Each major travel corridor shall have a generally consistent
                             streetscape appearance along designated segments shown in
                             Figure 4.1, so as to reinforce a sense of identity and continuity.
                             This objective can be achieved by unified landscaping (trees,
                             groundcover, paving, lights, and signage) of the right-of-way.
                     2.      Significant natural features, major intersections, and points of
                             special interest which occur along the corridor should be
                             highlighted with special design treatment.
                     3.      The major entry points to Marina should be designed to
                             reinforce and enhance the image and identity of the City.
                             Accordingly, special attention shall be given to the
                             landscaping, building design, and signage at the designated
                             gateways. Specifically, open parking in these areas shall be
                             screened from view by attractive landscaping, signage shall be
                             limited primarily to directional information, commercial signage
                             - where permitted - shall be subdued, and buildings shall be
                             constructed with high-quality materials.         Special design
                             treatment, consisting of distinctive lighting, banners, special
                             paving materials, or actual structures, shall help define these
                             entrances. Small ornamental parks or plazas may also be
                             provided.
               Open Spaces and Significant Natural Features
               4.15 Natural features within the boundaries of the Marina Planning Area
                     are major contributors to the overall form and appearance of Marina.
                     These community-defining open spaces consist of four primary
                     landscape types: (1) coastal dunes and related plant communities
                     west of Highway One; (2) field crops and grazing lands north of the
                     City; (3) chaparral and oak woodland in the areas east of the UC
City of Marina General Plan                                                                    111
4.                     Community Design & Development Element

                     MBEST Center, around the Marina Municipal Airport, and in areas
                     immediately south of the existing city and between the family housing
                     areas on the former base; and (4) large windrows comprised primarily
                     of Monterey Cypress. The City’s four existing parks (Gloria Jean
                     Tate, Vince DiMaggio, Windy Hill, and Locke-Paddon) also contribute
                     to the City’s overall open space/landscape character.
               4.16  With the exception of its Monterey Bay frontage, there are no major
                     defining natural topographic features within the existing city. But
                     small-scale topographic features are important in local contexts. For
                     example, along the east side of Highway One south of Reservation
                     Road, high dunes buffer the City from the freeway and serve as a
                     visual backdrop to areas of housing. More generally, the gentle
                     undulating topography of the City’s neighborhoods helps break up the
                     generally linear pattern of both local streets and major cross town
                     routes such as Del Monte Boulevard and Reservation Road.
               4.17  Protection of many of the important open space features cited above
                     is provided for in the land use policies of Chapter 2. These open
                     space protection measures shall be further complemented by the
                     following policies:
                     1.      Existing windrows shall be retained where they are determined
                             to have significant visual or aesthetic value and/or significant
                             microclimatic value, and incremental programs of replanting
                             shall be instituted to ensure their long-term survival.
                     2.      Future development should incorporate new windrows into site
                             landscaping where appropriate so as to reinforce this
                             distinctive landscape feature of citywide significance. Use of
                             windrows, for example, can serve to define and buffer
                             residential and commercial uses, help distinguish the
                             boundaries of neighborhoods and districts identified below, or
                             serve as a scenic backdrop for new development.
                     3.      Within built-up areas, existing topography shall be retained to
                             make natural land forms more evident. This requirement of
                             the General Plan may be fulfilled by minimizing grading and
                             cutting and filling for roadways, by providing public space with
                             outlooks at the higher elevations, and by locating taller
                             structures on the upper slopes of hills. (2005-82)
               Neighborhoods and Districts
               4.18 The form and appearance of the City is further defined by major areas
                     which are readily distinguishable from other areas. The distinction
                     may result from evident boundaries such as streets, rail lines,
                     watercourses, or open spaces; from contrasts in the type of use and
                     buildings in adjoining areas; from an association with some major
                     internal feature such as park or plaza; or from any combination of
                     such features. When they are combined with major travel corridors
City of Marina General Plan                                                                  112
4.                     Community Design & Development Element

                     and adjacent open spaces, the sense of the separateness of these
                     areas (whether they are residential, commercial, industrial or
                     institutional in character) defines the City’s image.            If each
                     neighborhood or district could further develop a distinctive character,
                     the organization of the City would become more evident and its image
                     would become more appealing.
               4.19  Figure 4.1 identifies those areas of the City where establishing a
                     distinctive neighborhood or district appearance is desirable. Within
                     the already built-up areas, existing distinctions should be retained and
                     reinforced. Within new development or redevelopment areas, the
                     following three design techniques should be applied:
                     1.       The boundaries of the neighborhood or district should be
                              clearly defined by open space buffers or roadways.
                     2.       Major identifying features such as park, plaza, or school sites
                              should be provided.
                     3.       Each area should have its own distinct street pattern, and a
                              consistent and evident landscape scheme should be applied to
                              its streets and associated fronting properties.
               4.20  To reduce glare and lighting visible from residential neighborhoods,
                     the use of reflective surfaces and neon lighting on commercial
                     buildings shall be limited.
               4.21  Specific methods for promoting the citywide design concept outlined
                     above are prescribed below under the policy provisions for travel
                     routes and specific neighborhoods and districts.
               Travel Routes
               4.22  The preceding Chapter 3 established the citywide system of travel
                     routes for automotive, transit, and non-motorized travel as well as the
                     specific functional role of the respective routes and General Plan
                     requirements in terms of travel lanes and right-of-way width. This
                     section defines further the design requirements for the new roads and
                     for existing roads designated for changes such as the addition of
                     travel lanes, the incorporation of bikeways, the expansion of right-of-
                     way width, or other significant modifications. The design policies set
                     forth below shall apply except where localized conditions make the
                     attainment of a certain standard physically or economically
                     impractical.
               4.23  An overriding principle of this General Plan is to minimize to the
                     greatest extent possible any increase in right-of-way width or road
                     width in the City so as to reduce the total amount of land devoted to
                     roads, limit impervious surfaces, and facilitate safer and easier
City of Marina General Plan                                                                  113
4.                     Community Design & Development Element

                     pedestrian movement. Accordingly, the specified rights-of-way within
                     former Fort Ord should be reduced wherever feasible from those
                     shown in the FORA Reuse Plan.
               Neighborhood Streets
               4.24 It is a well-established fact that well-landscaped streets with slow-
                     moving traffic contribute both to the stability of neighborhoods and to
                     property values. It is essential, then, that "functional” concerns such
                     as minimizing landscape maintenance costs, affording minimum
                     constraints for infrastructure repairs, and facilitating high through-
                     travel speeds not rule out the ability to institute safer, more attractive,
                     more livable street design standards.
               4.25  Marina is fortunate in that most of its older existing residential streets
                     included curbside landscape strips. Unfortunately, however, along
                     many residential streets landscaping has not been provided or has not
                     been adequately maintained. Recently constructed residential streets
                     have also been designed without curbside landscape areas, and have
                     combined roadways and sidewalks into a monolithic surface which is
                     visually out of scale with adjoining residences. The latter type of
                     street construction standard also eliminates the separation between
                     pedestrians and vehicles, decreasing both pedestrian safety and the
                     attractiveness of the street.
               4.26  The following design policies and programs shall apply to residential
                     streets in the City. The standards designated for local residential and
                     collector streets are consistent with the national standards jointly
                     prescribed by the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Urban
                     Land Institute, and the National Association of Homebuilders.
                     1.       The City shall undertake a neighborhood street landscape
                              improvement program to promote improved street landscaping
                              and maintenance. In keeping with the neighborhood identity
                              policies prescribed above, a distinctive landscape concept
                              should be established for each neighborhood.
                     2.       With the exception of expressways, curb radii should be
                              limited to slow vehicle travel speeds and provide greater safety
                              for pedestrians and bicyclists.
                     4.       So as to avoid impeding local pedestrian and vehicular travel,
                              block lengths should not normally exceed 350 feet and only
                              rarely 450 feet. When block lengths exceed 450 feet, short
                              mid-block alleys should be provided for emergency vehicle
                              access and mid-block paths should be provided for
                              pedestrians and bicyclists. Where cul-de-sacs are proposed,
                              connecting paths for pedestrians and bicyclists shall be
                              provided to link neighborhoods, to connect residential and
                              commercial areas and/or to provide pedestrian/bicyclist access
                              to parks and schools.
City of Marina General Plan                                                                     114
4.                     Community Design & Development Element

                     5.     The Marina Heights Specific Plan may be considered to be
                            consistent with Policy 4.26.4 based upon implementation of
                            adequate mitigation and incorporation of adequate design
                            features and amenities such as bikeways and trail linkages as
                            approved by the City. (2004-42, 2005-82)
                     6.     Where appropriate, the use of alleys in residential or mixed-
                            use areas should be permitted and encouraged. They may be
                            designed as either secondary access to private properties
                            and/or to provide short connections between public streets.
                            However, they must be designed to be easily visible from
                            adjoining residences and nearby public streets so that they
                            may be readily monitored to ensure their proper use. Alleys
                            shall be constructed to accommodate emergency vehicles.
                            Their design shall be approved by the Police Chief and other
                            appropriate City officials to ensure that they minimize potential
                            problems sometimes associated with older alleys in other
                            communities, such as possibly becoming a gathering place for
                            illegal activity, abandoned vehicles, weeds, litter; or illegal
                            parking either by vehicles intentionally parking within an alley
                            or from vehicles encroaching onto an alley from adjoining
                            driveways, garages or other private parking areas off the alley.
                            Alley widths should be 15 feet if they are planned just for
                            vehicle access, and should increase to 22 feet or as otherwise
                            approved by the Fire Chief when they are planned to also
                            provide for possible future fire suppression operations.
                     7.     Marina has historically been developed with wide streets
                            typical of most suburban development in the United States
                            following World War II. It is recognized that as Marina moves
                            away from those historical street standards to safer, more
                            attractive, and more livable street standards, the City will
                            experience some situations which are different from those
                            features of the previous wider residential streets.             In
                            recognition of this, the City shall establish the following new
                            standards for narrower streets. These shall include, at least,
                            the provision of automatic fire sprinkler systems for buildings
                            accessed by these streets, non-combustible roofing, the
                            possible placement of more frequent fire hydrants where
                            determined necessary by the City’s Fire Chief, and prohibitions
                            against the parking of boats and recreational vehicles on
                            narrower streets.
                     8.     Both street lighting and lighting for parks and sports fields shall
                            be shielded and should be consistent with the provisions of
                            Chapter IV of the City Design Guidelines and Standards.

               4.27   The pavement widths of local residential streets should only be as
                      wide as necessary to accommodate the residences along the
                      immediate street frontage and should provide for parking on both
                      sides. Road widths of 32-34 feet are appropriate for local residential
                      streets and should allow vehicles and bicycles to share the roadway
                      without the need for a designated bikeway and allow for parking on
                      both sides. In order to primarily facilitate the turning of fire apparatus,
                      parking shall not be allowed within 20 feet of an intersection. In order
                      to discourage parking at intersections, improve street appearance,
                      and to improve pedestrian safety at intersections, street pavement
                      width should be reduced to 22 feet within about 20 feet of the
                      intersections. (2004-42, 2004-165, 2008-42, 2010-13)

               4.27.5 DELETED 2010-13
               4.27.1 Local residential streets within Marina Heights shall measure no more
                      than 28 feet between the faces of curbs. Except where determined
                      infeasible by the City, curb extensions shall be provided at
                      intersections such that curb to curb width is 22 to 24 feet, driveways
                      outletting onto the streets shall be located on adjoining portions of
                      adjoining lots, and where driveways do not outlet onto streets, curb
                      extensions of approximately 50 foot length shall be located
                      intermittently along the streets at a frequency and with a design to
                      provide for assured fire-fighting capabilities along the length of the
                      curb extension segments. (2004-42, 2010-13)
               Local Collectors
               4.28 The function of local collector streets is to funnel vehicular travel to
                      and from local residential areas to the City’s major roadways. Since
                      these collectors also serve individual residences along their frontages
                      and are generally designated by Figure 3.3 as routes for Class II
                      bikeways, the maintenance of low travel speeds is essential.
               4.29   The following design criteria shall apply to the design and construction
                      of all new local collectors and to existing collectors when changes are
                      required to mitigate existing safety problems.
                      1.       Along segments designated by Figure 3.3 as routes for Class
                               II bikeways, curbside parking should be eliminated to minimize
                               hazards for bicyclists if off-street parking is sufficient to
                               accommodate reasonable parking demand.
                      2.       The roadway between the curbs shall be limited to two 11- foot
                               travel lanes and two 7-foot parking lanes (see Figure 4.2)
                               except where segments are designated on Figure 3.3 as
                               routes for Class II bikeways. Where so designated, the striped
                               bicycle lanes shall be 7 foot alongside 11-foot travel lanes,
                               except that the bicycle lanes may be reduced to 6-foot lanes
City of Marina General Plan                                                                      116
4.                     Community Design & Development Element

                               alongside 12-foot travel lanes within segments which are not
                               congested by features such as frequent short blocks or
                               driveway entrances and where slightly higher travel speeds
                               may therefore be appropriate. Lastly, two 7-foot parking lanes
                               adjoining 6-foot bike lanes may be allowed in addition to two
                               10-foot travel lanes in the limited cases where off-street
                               parking is not sufficient to accommodate reasonable parking
                               demand, but where Class II bikeways are also designated, and
                               the resulting wider cross-section will not be detrimental to
                               pedestrian use of the area or be otherwise infeasible.
                       3.      Where an existing road width exceeds the required and
                               desirable width, such as along Crescent and Cardoza
                               Avenues, the extra road width should be devoted to expanded
                               parkway landscaping or a Class I bicycle path, or combination
                               thereof. Additional on-street parking is also appropriate where
                               the right-of-way is sufficient to ensure adequate landscape
                               separation between the parking and travel lanes, sidewalks,
                               and bicycle lanes.
                       4.      Where existing or future right-of-way alignments could
                               encourage undesirable travel speeds or unrelated through
                               movements, traffic-calming devices should be employed.
                               Similar measures should be used where designated collectors
                               pass by school, park or recreation sites so as to maintain low
                               travel speeds in these critical areas. Appropriate methods of
                               traffic calming include narrow travel lanes, roundabouts, and
                               increasing the width of sidewalks at intersections.
                       5.      As shown in Figure 4.2, street landscaping should create a
                               well-defined separation between vehicles and pedestrians and
                               adjacent residences.
                       6.      Street landscaping consisting of street trees, groundcovers,
                               street lights, and directional signage should be consistent
                               along street segments within the same neighborhood, and
                               should be easily distinguishable from that of related local
                               streets. Street lighting shall be shielded and should be
                               consistent with the provisions of Chapter IV of the City Design
                               Guidelines and Standards.
               California Avenue
               4.30 California Avenue is planned to extend south from Reindollar through
                       former Fort Ord lands to 8th street and the CSUMB campus. The
                       roadway shall be limited to two travel lanes, one lane in each
                       direction, and the roadway designed to discourage travel speeds in
                       excess of 25 miles per hour so as to maintain a safe and compatible
                       relationship with existing residences south of Reservation Road.

               4.31   The segment of California Avenue between Reservation Road and
                     Abrams Drive, which extends primarily through an existing residential
                     area, is designated as a Class II bikeway; the section between
                     Abrams Drive and 8th Street is designated for future development as a
                     Class I facility. However, the initial development of the portion
                     between Abrams Drive and 12th Street may be implemented as a

               Arterial Streets
               4.32 The function of arterial streets is to accommodate cross-town traffic
                       movement and movement in and out of the City to nearby locations.
                       Design policies for each of the five designated arterial routes are set
                       forth below. The design requirements vary along each route in order
                       to respond to existing or planned conditions along the street
                       frontages.
               8th Street/Intergarrison Road
               4.33 The 8th Street portion of this corridor is designated as a two-lane
                       arterial within the approximate time frame of this plan, but may be
                       expanded to four lanes when warranted, consistent with the cross-
                       section design shown by Figure 4.6; the Intergarrison Road segment
                       is designated as a two-lane arterial. The entire corridor is also
                       designated a Class I bikeway. The Intergarrison portion of the
                       corridor passes through permanently protected open space. In
                       contrast, the 8th Street segment passes through land slated for
                       extensive redevelopment, and serves as the boundary between the
                       CSUMB campus and the City. Design specifications in Figures 4.5
                       and 4.6 address these two, highly varied land use conditions.
               Del Monte Boulevard/2nd Avenue
               4.34 The entire length of this corridor is designated as a four-lane arterial.
                       Existing and planned land uses along this corridor, however, vary
                       substantially and require more segment-specific design specifications.
                       The following policies address these more localized requirements.
                       1.    The portion of Del Monte Boulevard passing through the
                             Armstrong Ranch shall be designed as a limited-access route,
                             with the number of intersecting streets limited.      (2006-243,
                             2008-42)
                       2.    The two-block section adjoining the proposed train station plaza
                             and retail area shall be designed to permit safe and easy
                             pedestrian crossing of the boulevard. (See Figure 4.8.)
                       3.    A landscaped median, similar to that existing along Del Monte
                             Boulevard south of Reservation Road, should be installed from
                             Reservation Road north to Golf Boulevard. (2006-243)

                     4.35 The following criteria shall apply to the extension of Del Monte
                           Boulevard to 12th Street and its connection with the northbound
                           off-ramp from Highway One:
                     1.      The continuity of Del Monte Boulevard should be readily
                             evident to motorists so as to avoid confusion and safety
                             problems. Alignments which intermingle freeway on- and off-
                             lanes with Del Monte Boulevard should be avoided.
                     2.      Northbound off-ramp connections which permit left and right
                             turns on Del Monte Boulevard are desirable. Permitting both
                             movements will provide better vehicular access to redeveloped
                             areas of former Fort Ord and provide an alternative to the 12th
                             Street interchange to avoid congestion there in the future.
                     3.      Roadway and off-ramp alignments should allow for reasonable
                             vehicular access to designated visitor-serving sites along the
                             east side of the extended roadway.
                     4.      Adequate right-of-way reservation shall be provided to allow
                             for consideration of major design options for the Highway
                             One/Del Monte Boulevard connection.
                     4.36    Design requirements for 2nd Avenue are shown in Figures 4.9
                             and 4.10. The street should be designed to function both as a
                             major arterial and a pedestrian-oriented commercial street.
                             1. A 10-foot-wide Class I bikeway shall be provided along the
                                 east side of the right-of-way (2005-128).
                             Blanco Road/Imjin Road/12th Street
                     4.37    This corridor functions as a major east-west route with
                             projected traffic volumes reaching approximately 40,000
                             vehicles per day along the 12th Street segment.                To
                             accommodate these future travel demands, the eastern
                             portion, from the California Avenue extension to the Salinas
                             River, is designated as a four-lane expressway, and the
                             segment west of California Avenue is designated as a six-lane
                             expressway. Projected traffic volumes indicate that, prior to
                             2020, four lanes should be sufficient, but reservation of a right-
                             of-way accommodating six lanes should be provided to meet
                             longer-term traffic demands. The right-of-way and related
                             roadway, transit guideway, and bikeway requirements are
                             shown in Figures 4.11 and 4.12.

               4.38   Provision for a Class I bikeway is included along the entire right-of-
                      way. From 6th Avenue to the eastern boundary of the MBEST Center
                      a reservation for a transit guideway is also required. East of California
                      access to the expressway shall be limited to the intersection with
                      Abrams Drive, the Imjin Road link to the Municipal Airport,
                      Reservation Road, and the intersection designated as an access point
                      to the MBEST Center in the master plan for that facility.
               4.39   12th Street west of California Avenue is designated as a six-lane
                      expressway. Access should be limited to 2nd, 3rd and 4th Avenues
                      and one intersection between 2nd Avenue and Highway One.
               Reservation Road
               4.40 Variations in adjacent land use and projected traffic on Reservation
                      Road require more segment-specific design requirements. Specific
                      policies and requirements tailored to address these variations are set
                      forth below.
               4.41   West Reservation Road. Reservation Road from Highway One to Del
                      Monte Boulevard serves as a major entrance to the City. Travel lanes
                      should be limited to two, and access to individual properties along its
                      frontage should be limited so as to maximize their traffic-carrying
                      capacity. A park-like landscaping, complementing Locke-Paddon
                      Park, should be provided along the entire road frontage. Related
                      commercial signage shall be limited and designed to complement the
                      park-like appearance and convey a positive image to motorists
                      entering and exiting the City at this gateway.
               4.42   Central Reservation Road. Reservation Road from Del Monte
                      Boulevard to Salinas Avenue has a dual role. In addition to serving as
                      one of the City’s major east-west arterials, it also functions as the
                      City’s major retail/commercial corridor. The latter role requires that
                      additional consideration be given to pedestrian movements, in
                      particular providing for safe and convenient crossings of Reservation
                      Road for persons patronizing its shops and residents of properties
                      both to its immediate north and south.
               4.43.1 The design of new projects on Central Reservation Road shall
                      consider adjacent existing and planned uses in order to achieve some
                      degree of architectural and design continuity on the commercial
                      segment of this corridor. Continuity should be sought for such site
                      and architectural design elements as roof lines and roofing
                      materials/colors, building heights and colors, parking layouts, signs,
                      and/or landscaping, etc. Where projects are proposed on adjacent
                      lots, traffic and pedestrian circulation should be coordinated to attain a
                      more integrated design and minimize the need for new
                      ingress/egress.
City of Marina General Plan                                                                     131
4.                      Community Design & Development Element


               4.43.3 To accommodate and balance the needs of motorists and
                      pedestrians, all future road improvements between Del Monte
                      Boulevard and Salinas Avenue shall be consistent with the following
                      design conditions:
                      1.      The number of travel lanes shall be limited to four (two in each
                              direction).
                      2.      In order to provide for safe and convenient pedestrian
                              crossings, construction of right-turn lanes should be limited.
                      3.      Sidewalk areas shall be expanded at major intersections to
                              minimize the distances pedestrians must cover to safely move
                              from one side of the street to the other.
                      4.      The existing landscaped median shall be extended east to
                              Salinas Road.
                      5.      Bus turnouts shall be provided at convenient intervals, and
                              their locations shall be coordinated with pedestrian circulation
                              routes to adjoining properties.
                      6.      A formal, more urban, landscaping pattern shall be provided
                              along the entire frontage, consisting of regularly spaced street
                              trees which clearly define the travel lanes from adjacent
                              walkways.       This landscape treatment will also serve to
                              distinguish this segment of Reservation Road from its western
                              and eastern segments, and thus highlight the community-
                              serving retail role of the area.
               4.44   East Reservation Road.           Land uses fronting the segment of
                      Reservation Road extending from Salinas Avenue to its intersection
                      with Intergarrison Road are markedly different from those along other
                      portions of Reservation Road. There are only five points of vehicular
                      access along the entire 2,200 foot frontage. Additionally, a substantial
                      portion of the frontage is within the University of California Natural
                      Resource System and is permanently protected as open space, and
                      the remainder consists of frontage along the MBEST Center where
                      50-foot landscaped buffers and 100-foot building setbacks are
                      required. The net effect of these conditions is to make the retention of
                      natural landscape appearances along the entire road length desirable.
               4.45   To protect and further enhance the natural landscape appearance of
                      this portion of Reservation Road, the following design requirements
                      shall apply to all future improvement along the frontage:
                      1.      Landscape improvements within the right-of-way shall use
                              plant materials which produce a seamless appearance with
                              the adjoining natural landscaping.

4.                     Community Design & Development Element
                      2.      A 50-foot landscape reservation, similar to that required along
                              the MBEST Center lands, shall be provided along the frontage
                              of the designated high school site.
               Golf Boulevard
               4.46    A portion of this designated arterial, located west of the Marina
                      Municipal Airport, adjoins land designated for natural habitat
                      protection and outdoor recreation.         To the extent practicable, an
                      informal, naturalistic landscape shall be provided from Blanco Road to
                      the west end of the airport. (2008-42, 2008-224)
               Transit Guideway
               4.47 A separate alignment extending from 1st Avenue east to the Salinas
                      River is provided for transit operations. From 6th Avenue east the
                      transit alignment is combined with the right-of-way for Imjin/Blanco
                      Road (see Figure 4.11). To the west of 6th Avenue, a separate right-
                      of-way is provided for transit vehicles. This portion of the right-of-way
                      shall serve as a transit/pedestrian street and central spine for retail-
                      oriented areas of University Villages. (2005-128)
               4.48   As discussed earlier in the Community Infrastructure Element, the
                      intent in the near term is to accommodate bus and van services
                      linking the MBEST Center and residences in the Preston Park,
                      Abrams Park and Frederick-Schoonover Park areas with the CSUMB
                      campus and the University Villages area. In the longer term, the right-
                      of-way will be available for light-rail service linking Marina to Salinas.
                      (2005-128)
               4.49   Figure 4.14 identifies the design requirements for the guideway west
                      of 6th Avenue. The following design specifications shall apply to this
                      portion of the guideway:
                      1.      With the exception of designated future light-rail station areas,
                              the right-of-way should be limited to 94 feet to maintain a
                              pedestrian scale suitable for retail activities.
                      2.      Additional right-of-way allowances shall be provided at the
                              designated stations in the University Village areas to be used
                              for public plazas with a minimum width of 100 feet and a depth
                              of 80 feet.
                      3.      Within retail-oriented areas, buildings shall be built to the right-
                              of-way line and should occupy the major portion of the street
                              frontage.
                      4.      Limited access for automobiles may be permitted for purposes
                              of providing access to commercial uses and transit stations.
                              Such access shall be limited to non-continuous loop roadways.
City of Marina General Plan                                                                       134

        Neighborhoods and Districts
               4.50  The Community Land Use Element assigns specific functional roles to
                     general areas of the City. This section complements those Land Use
                     Element policies by providing additional design guidance for areas of
                     the City where major future development is permitted. The policies
                     which follow also serve to promote the citywide design policies set
                     forth earlier in this element. The conceptual design policy diagrams
                     are intended to illustrate the applicable policies, and are not intended
                     to depict exact existing or future conditions.
               University Village
               4.51 General development and design principles for the University Village
                     area are set forth below and in accompanying Figure 4.15. Prior to
                     approval of any development other than temporary projects/uses or
                     projects already entitled to be built as part of the base
                     decommissioning process, a specific plan shall be prepared which
                     legally establishes development, design, and infrastructure
                     requirements in accordance with General Plan principles and policies
                     set forth below. (2005-128)
               4.52  The landscape buffer of Monterey Cypress along the east side of
                     Highway One shall be maintained and reinforced, and this landscape
                     feature should be extended north to the existing northbound Del
                     Monte Boulevard off-ramp. An assessment district may be formed for
                     the University Villages area to care for and maintain cypress trees
                     recommended for saving in a forestry report. (2005-128)
               4.53  Buildings in the University Villages project area should be sited to
                     complement the existing topography and landscape, maximize
                     opportunities for vistas of Monterey Bay, and protect identified scenic
                     vistas from public areas of CSUMB’s West Campus, including
                     common open space areas, greenbelts and academic buildings.
                     Building heights should be limited in the area to a maximum of 40
                     feet, with the exception of the optional height areas designated in
                     Figure 4.15. In the latter areas, the intent is to permit higher
                     structures which can serve as attractive landmarks identifying the
                     area and the City from Highway One and orient motorists to
                     destinations within Marina. The higher height allowance also should
                     serve to enhance the economic-development prospect of these areas
                     by increasing the opportunities for views of Monterey Bay for building
                     occupants. (2005-128)
                     Approval of heights in excess of 40 feet shall be conditioned on
                     findings that buildings visually complement the natural landscape and
                     topography, when seen from Highway One and protect existing
                     identified scenic vistas from the West Campus of CSUMB.
City of Marina General Plan                                                                  137
4.                     Community Design & Development Element

               4.54  The height of buildings located on the sloping portion of the area shall
                     adhere to natural slopes, with the height of structures from grade
                     increasing as the buildings step up the slopes, thereby maintaining
                     and emphasizing the natural landforms and increasing opportunities
                     for desirable views for building occupants. Where so designated in
                     Figure 4.15, building heights in excess of 40 feet shall be conditionally
                     permitted.
               4.55  As shown schematically in Figure 4.15, the central organizing element
                     of the area shall be a greenway extending from the southern
                     boundary with Seaside north beyond 12th Street to the natural habitat
                     preserve immediately south of the existing Del Monte/Highway One
                     northbound off-ramp.
               4.56  The main north-south spine of the greenway should occupy the
                     ridgetop of the low hills facing Highway One and Monterey Bay with
                     lateral corridors provided to allow for views of the Bay. The linear
                     greenway should be augmented occasionally by smaller ridge top
                     parks which may serve as open space foci for the adjoining residential
                     and mixed-use areas. Although the greenway is intended primarily for
                     pedestrians, limited vehicular access can be permitted to provide for
                     the access needs of adjoining properties, provided vehicle traffic
                     movements and the area devoted to travel lanes is subordinate and
                     compatible with the prevailing pedestrian function.              Along the
                     greenway, parking shall be concealed from view by either locating it to
                     the rear of fronting buildings or by incorporating it into the structures in
                     a manner which conceals the spaces from view and does not occupy
                     ground-level space facing the greenway. Residential units should
                     have their entrances opening directly onto the greenway. Shallow
                     front yards or garden courts defined by low walls are appropriate.
                     Along the 8th Street frontage, park, recreation or community-
                     sponsored visitor-serving facilities are permitted. (2005-128)

                     and adjacent property shall take into consideration and reflect the
                     functional and aesthetic differences among these corridors. The
                     general requirements and character of major corridors in University
                     Villages project are shown in Figures 4.9, 4.10, 4.12 and 4.14. (2005-

               4.58  Development fronting on the transit corridor shall provide for a
                     pedestrian-scale street wall defined by continuous building facades
                     with ground-floor shops and other pedestrian-serving uses. Vehicular
                     movements shall be limited to non-through-traffic, serving businesses
                     along the street, and permit some short-term on-street parking and
                     provision for drop-off and pick-up of transit riders, shoppers, and
                     residents in adjacent mixed-use housing. Consistent with the desired
                     pedestrian orientation of the village, drive-in facilities shall be
                     prohibited within the portion of University Villages south of 8th Street.

               4.59  12th Street should function as an east-west arterial linking major
                     areas of the City to Highway One. Given the anticipated high traffic
                     volumes (projected at approximately 40,000 vehicles per day by 2020)
                     and related noise issues, the portion of 12th Street east of 2nd
                     Avenue shall be designed as an attractive parkway with ample
                     setbacks and landscaping along its entire length. A consistent
                     landscape palette should be established for both landscaping within
                     the public right-of-way and fronting properties to ensure a unified,
                     well-landscaped appearance. 12th Street should serve as the
                     northern boundary of the University Village area. (2005-128)
               4.60  Del Monte Boulevard/2nd Avenue serves two functions. It provides a
                     major inter-community corridor linking Marina and Seaside, and it also
                     serves as the major access corridor for the entire University Villages
                     area. North of the proposed Crescent extension and south of 8th
                     Street, a parkway standard with permitted travel speeds of 35 miles
                     per hour is appropriate. However, despite this street’s arterial
                     function, as it passes through the more intensively developed area,
                     travel speeds should be restricted to 25 miles per hour, and
                     signalization should be provided that gives priority to pedestrians at
                     major crossings and makes allowances for orientation and
                     accommodation of motorists with destinations within the area. (2005-

                     elevation of 175 feet above sea level, has been designated as a
                     community park site to take advantage of the scenic outlooks possible
                     from there. The designated residential land use allowed on the
                     adjacent west and north slopes of this hill shall be designed such that
                     its building forms reinforce and emphasize the natural hill form and
                     provide for view corridors from the park both to the west and north.

               Reservation Road Shopping Area
               4.70 The retail and personal-service function of the segment of
                     Reservation Road extending from Del Monte Boulevard to Crescent
                     Avenue shall be retained and enhanced. The following policies
                     address the methods required to achieve this objective.
               4.71  The City shall work with property owners and businesses within this
                     area to attract new retail uses to currently economically under-utilized
                     parcels and to undertake area improvements which would make the
                     area more attractive to shoppers. The overall pattern of development
                     should be such that shoppers or business visitors will park at one
                     location and walk to their various destinations. Specific measures
                     relating to this goal are enumerated below and shown in Figure 4.16.
               4.72  In order to retain the traffic-carrying capacity of Reservation Road,
                     and to promote a safer and more pedestrian-friendly shopping
                     environment, the following policies shall apply:
                     1.     Drive-in facilities shall be given careful consideration in order to
                            reduce single-purpose trips and minimize on-site vehicular
                            circulation which may conflict with pedestrian circulation and
                            increase the total area devoted to pavement.
                     2.     At designated major pedestrian crossings (see Figure 4.16)
                            sidewalks should be bulbed out to minimize road width. Right-
                            turn-only lanes should be prohibited.
                     3.     Multiple points of ingress and egress for single parcels shall be
                            avoided and, where feasible, joint ingress and egress shall be
                            provided for adjacent parcels.
               4.73  As new development and major remodeling of existing structures
                     along this corridor occur, the pedestrian-oriented shopping experience
                     shall be enhanced by taking the following steps:
                     1.     A continuous pedestrian-oriented frontage shall be provided
                            along the street face of the buildings and be integrated, where
                            possible, with neighboring commercial buildings.
                     2.     Commercial buildings should be located at major pedestrian
                            entrances from Reservation Road, and a well-defined pedestrian
                            link shall be provided to commercial uses located back from the
                            street edge.
                     3.     Parking areas shall be well landscaped, with trees to provide
                            rain and sun protection and to contribute to the attractiveness of
                            the area.

                     5.    The rights-of-way of Seacrest Avenue and Crescent Avenue
                           from Carmel Avenue to Reservation Road should be improved
                           to provide safe and attractive pedestrian routes to the
                           Reservation Road shopping area.

               Armstrong Ranch
               4.75 Consistent with the long-term policies of the City of Marina and
                     Monterey County, and recognizing the future need for housing as a
                     result of the presence of the MBEST Center, the CSUMB campus,
                     and other land uses designated in the Fort Ord Reuse Plan which will
                     also generate employment, a major portion of the incorporated
                     Armstrong Ranch (i.e., the area within the City and UGB boundaries)
                     is designated for residential development, a purpose for which the
                     area is ideally suited. This is an area which is immediately contiguous
                     to already-built-up areas of Marina, and urban services are readily
                     available without requiring expensive extensions. The site thus offers
                     the Monterey region an opportunity to channel future residential
                     growth into a location where sprawl and large-scale loss of prime
                     agricultural land may be avoided. (2005-82)
               4.76  Development of the Armstrong Ranch may be allowed commensurate
                     with sound community planning, design and environmental-protection
                     principles. Overall, City land use, transportation, and design policies
                     are based on promoting the following objectives for this area:
                     1.      Emergence of a demographically and economically balanced
                             community.
                     2.      Development of a land use and circulation pattern that
                             supports cost-effective, frequent transit service.
                     3.      Creation of a development pattern and community form which
                             enables and promotes walking and biking for most local trip
                             purposes.
                     4.      Creation of a positive identity and sense of place which
                             contribute to the identity and image of the entire City.
                     5.      Protection of open space having significant natural resource
                             value and maintenance of a clear differentiation between the
                             City and surrounding countryside. (2005-82)
               4.77  Preparation of the following studies and documents will be required as
                     a precondition for development approval:
                     1.      Development of all or any portion of the Armstrong Ranch
                             designated for community development purposes shall only be
                             permitted upon preparation of a specific plan, required
                             environmental review, and, where applicable in compliance
                             with the UGB Initiative, annexation of that portion of the ranch
                             proposed for development and not presently within the City
                             limits. The specific plan shall comply with the requirements of
                             California Law (Government Code 65450 et. seq.). In addition,
                             the plan shall include a development phasing program

                             noise study shall be undertaken to ensure that an adequate
                             buffer is in place (consistent with the noise exposure
                             standards of this plan) between new homes that are planned
                             in proximity to Highway One and Del Monte Boulevard based
                             on future projected traffic volumes and types of vehicles on
                             these roads.
                     3.      The specific plan shall ensure that the development of
                             residential and commercial uses shall be staged so as to
                             ensure that overall ranch development strengthens the City’s
                             fiscal status. Residential development shall be conditioned
                             upon the creation of new jobs and the insurance that an
                             adequate proportion of new housing will be available to
                             persons employed within the City of Marina and to households
                             of low-and moderate-income in accordance with the provisions
                             of Section 5.9 of this plan and any implementing ordinances.
                             Additionally, each successive phase of residential
                             development shall be further conditioned upon the
                             construction and leasing of commercial development on
                             Armstrong Ranch or elsewhere in Marina that can generate
                             tax revenue adequate to pay for the cost of ongoing public
                             services (e.g., fire and police protection, parks and recreation
                             services, schools) needed to support new housing.
                             Accordingly, an independent fiscal analysis shall be prepared
                             for the successive phases of residential development that
                             summarizes the capital, operation, and maintenance costs
                             associated with providing required public services, including
                             public transit, and which project estimated tax revenues from
                             new commercial development, as well as from the new
                             proposed housing. Where estimated tax revenues prove
                             insufficient to cover costs, other funding mechanisms should
                             be explored. The Monterey-Salinas Transit District should be
                             consulted during the preparation and review of such analyses.

               4.78  The specific plan and subsequent development shall adhere to the
                     policies of this General Plan. The overall pattern of development
                     (shown in Figure 2.2) shall be designed to promote the overall policies
                     outlined above.

                     1.       Open space shall be conserved by avoiding extensive low-
                              density development.
                     2.       Average housing densities shall be achieved that help promote
                              affordability.
                     3.       Excessive community-service costs associated with low-

                              shall be avoided.
                     4.       The range of housing shall match the housing needs of
                              persons working within Marina.
                     5.       The density of development shall make provision of frequent,
                              cost-effective transit service, thereby preventing traffic
                              congestion, reducing air emissions, and conserving energy.
                     6.       A sense of community shall be promoted among the residents.
                     7.       Scenic and recreation resources shall be located within
                              immediate vicinity of the residents.
                     8.       By making walking safe, pleasant, and convenient, residents
                              shall be encouraged to walk to local destinations.
               4.79  To promote the City’s objective of creating a demographically and
                     economically balanced community, a wide range of housing options
                     shall be provided, the cost and mix of which shall be approximately
                     proportional to the housing needs of existing and future employed
                     persons within the City. Housing shall be balanced with commercial
                     uses, providing for retail and services and for office, research,
                     commercial-service and industrial uses. To achieve this end, the
                     permitted residential and non-residential-development shall adhere to
                     the following policies and conditions. (2005-82)
               4.80  Single-Family Residential.        Housing within this area shall be
                     comprised primarily of single-family residences. Clusters of single-
                     family detached homes (with varying lot and home sizes), and
                     rowhouses should be intermixed and organized around the three
                     mixed use areas designated the Multi-family Neighborhood Center
                     areas to achieve the overall density goal. This design will allow a
                     distribution that will support local transit service and encourage
                     walking. (2008-42)
               4.81   (2005-82) DELETED (2008-42)
               4.82  Multi-family Housing. Within the mixed use areas designated the
                     Multi-family and Neighborhood Center Zones, housing units may be
                     located above ground-level commercial space along the street or in
                     the rear portion of commercial sites. (2005-82, 2008-42)
               4.83  Office/Research Uses. In addition to industrial uses, provision is
                     made for office and research types of development on both sides of
                     De Forest Road within the airport runway safety Zone #4. Careful
                     consideration must be given to the siting of buildings and their design
                     and landscaping. More detailed site planning and requirements for

4.                     Community Design & Development Element

                     building and landscape design shall be incorporated into the Specific
                     Plan to address this concern. (2005-82, 2008-42)
               4.84  The availability of cost-effective, frequent transit service and the
                     opportunity to walk and/or bike to many destinations shall be
                     promoted by the following means:
                     1.      An integrated network of pedestrian routes consisting of
                             walkways on well-landscaped streets and off-road walking and
                             biking paths shall link residential areas, commercially
                             developed areas of the Ranch, and adjoining neighborhoods
                             and commercial and retail areas.
                     2.      Local residential streets shall be laid out to form small-scale
                             blocks so as to minimize walking distances within the housing
                             areas and to major community destinations such as shopping
                             areas, schools and parks.
                     3.      Multiple pedestrian crossings of Del Monte Boulevard shall be
                             afforded and reduced travel speeds shall be encouraged
                             where the boulevard adjoins the commercial shopping area of
                             the Ranch. Changes in roadway width, landscaping, paving
                             materials, lighting, and traffic controls shall be used here to
                             ensure safe and appealing crossing options for pedestrians.
                     4.      The extension of California Avenue shall serve as the central
                             spine of the Village Homes area and provide a multi-modal
                             corridor, accommodating bicycles, pedestrians, local transit
                             vehicles, and automobiles whose origins or destinations lie
                             within the Village Homes area. Accommodation shall also be
                             provided for bus turnouts and shelters. The streets and
                             pathways of adjoining residential areas (all of which are within
                             1,200 feet of California Avenue) shall provide residents with
                             direct and pleasant walking connections to these transit stops.
                     5.      At such time that passenger rail service is reintroduced to the
                             Monterey Peninsula, a station, shall be provided in the
                             northern portion of Marina. Accordingly, the Specific Plan
                             shall provide a passenger rail station canopy and an adjacent
                             public plaza fronting onto Del Monte Boulevard and shall
                             provide bus shelters along the bus routes in each of the
                             neighborhood centers. The station should be designed to
                             serve multiple-trip purposes. Such purposes should include
                             commuting by rail to jobs within the Armstrong Ranch area or
                             elsewhere in Marina with connecting local bus service; access
                             to Armstrong Ranch areas and nearby coastal destinations for
                             recreational visitors, and out-commuting to jobs in other areas
                             of the Monterey Peninsula by Armstrong Ranch residents
                             using rail rather than automobile. (2005-82, 2008-42)
City of Marina General Plan                                                                  148
4.                     Community Design & Development Element
               4.85   The Armstrong Ranch shall be designed and developed so that it
                      serves as a well-recognized and desirable location in the Monterey
                      Peninsula, enhancing both its and the City’s economic character and
                      image. In addition to the special neighborhood features outlined
                      above, the following major components shall be incorporated into the
                      design of the area.
               4.86   Transit Station and Plaza. The recommended passenger rail station
                      should be designed to serve as an attractive landmark. In connection
                      with a transit station, a plaza shall be provided fronting on Del Monte
                      Boulevard, and shall be sized and designed to facilitate its use for
                      various community activities such as a farmer’s market, art and craft
                      shows, concerts, and food fairs. Building on the adjoining retail sites
                      shall incorporate retail, food-service, and other uses which will
                      contribute to the liveliness of the station area. The station shall be
                      designed as a multi-modal transportation center, accommodating and
                      linking rail passenger service, regional and local bus service, and
                      special-purpose shuttle service to lodging or employment centers.
                      (2005-82)
               4.87   Greenways. The major travel routes through Armstrong Ranch lands
                      - Del Monte Boulevard, Golf Boulevard, and DeForest and/or
                      Crescent Avenues - shall be designed with a parkway appearance
                      that will establish an attractive, understandable, and memorable
                      image for the entire City. (2005-82)
               Civic Center Options
               4.88   One of the primary policies of the General Plan is to create a focus for
                      community life by creating one or more centers which will bring civic,
                      commercial, cultural and recreational uses together. Three potential
                      locations are identified in the Community Land Use Element for this
                      purpose.      More detailed development and design policies and
                      guidance as to how to accomplish this end on one or both of the sites
                      is provided below.
               Existing City Hall Site and Environs
               4.89 The potential exists to increase the size of the site now occupied by
                      the City offices, City Council Chambers, community recreation center,
                      and public safety building. These existing facilities, with associated
                      parking, now occupy approximately 2.24 acres. However, this site
                      could be expanded by acquiring adjacent commercially zoned parcels
                      along Del Monte Boulevard, thereby providing a more public presence
                      and identity for these important civic uses. Such an expansion would
                      also provide the opportunity to integrate public facilities with retail and
                      other commercial activities. An existing strip commercial center on
                      Del Monte Boulevard adjacent to city-owned land occupies 2.69
                      acres. The remainder of the frontage of this block of Del Monte
                      extending to Palm Avenue contains an additional 0.69 acres of
City of Marina General Plan                                                                      149
4.                      Community Design & Development Element

                     commercially zoned land. The City might be able to acquire all or a
                     portion of this frontage for redevelopment for civic and commercial
                     uses.
               4.90  Opportunities for approximately 3 additional acres is also possible
                     along the Hillcrest Avenue frontage west of Sunset Avenue. Site
                     expansion in this direction, however, would require acquisition and
                     replacement of as many as 40 single-family and multi-family units
                     along Hillcrest Avenue west.
               4.91  Any expansion of current City lands for civic center purposes that
                     involves property along Del Monte Boulevard should incorporate the
                     following design features:
                     1.      Multilevel buildings that step up or down to conform to the
                             approximately 25-foot elevation difference between Del Monte
                             Boulevard and existing city property.
                     2.      A public plaza accessible and visible from Del Monte
                             Boulevard. This plaza might occupy two levels, with “grand”
                             stairs connecting the area along Del Monte Boulevard to the
                             upper terrace level of Hillcrest.
                     3.      Street-level shops along a portion of the Del Monte Boulevard
                             frontage to enhance economic vitality and visual interest.
                     4.      Elimination of parking fronting on Del Monte Boulevard and
                             restriction of parking access to Hillcrest Avenue.
               Seaside Circle Site
               4.92 Another potential location for development of civic facilities exists
                     along Seaside Circle, adjoining Locke Paddon Park. One 6.85 parcel,
                     owned by the Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District, is currently
                     the proposed site for a new public library and is not proposed for
                     further civic use. A second, 5.5-acre privately- owned parcel, lying
                     between Locke-Paddon Park and the railroad right-of-way, is
                     substantially undeveloped. At least part of this latter parcel may be
                     suitable for development of civic facilities, such as a new community
                     center, given its location adjoining the park, the new library and the
                     Marina Landing Shopping Center.
               4.93  This latter commercial area currently contains vacant land, the
                     development of which could be integrated with new civic uses to
                     increase the overall attractiveness and vitality of the area. To achieve
                     this objective, new construction in the Marina Landing Shopping
                     Center should provide for a direct pedestrian/handicap access link to
                     Seaside Circle. A plaza type development in the southeast portion of
                     the shopping center would be the preferred design. The purpose and
                     function of the plaza is to serve as an aesthetically attractive, safe and
                     functional link between the library and shopping center while
City of Marina General Plan                                                                    150
4.                     Community Design & Development Element

                      minimizing the impact from car traffic and truck deliveries. This site’s
                      central location within the City and proximity to the major freeway
                      entrance to Marina also contribute to its appropriateness as a location
                      for major civic uses.
               Salinas Avenue/Reservation Road Site
               4.94 The approximately 50-acre site fronting on Reservation Road and
                      along the east side of Salinas Avenue is also a potential site if the
                      proposed high school were to be located elsewhere. If this site is to
                      be used as a center for civic-serving uses, it should be developed in
                      accordance with the following design guidelines:
                      1.      Civic uses, such as City offices, a community theater or hall, or
                              indoor recreation facilities should be complemented by
                              inclusion of community-serving retail and services uses,
                              particularly uses which are entertainment or leisure oriented,
                              multi-family housing units in mixed-use buildings, and
                              landscaped parks.
                      2.      A central plaza, similar to that recommended for the other
                              alternative sites, should serve as the focal point of the entire
                              center.
                      3.      A 50-foot setback should be maintained along the Reservation
                              Road frontage, consistent with that required along the MBEST
                              Center’s Reservation Road frontage, and the setback area
                              should be landscaped in an informal, naturalistic way so as to
                              provide a consistent landscape along Reservation Road from
                              Salinas Avenue to Intergarrision Road.
                      4.      The site should be landscaped so as to achieve a seamless
                              interrelationship to the adjacent habitat preserves and
                              playfields in Preston and Abrams Parks.
                      5.      Existing Salinas Avenue should be realigned to better serve
                              the entire complex and provide for an appropriate buffering of
                              the existing residences along Salinas Avenue.

               4.95   Design and development requirements for the University of California
                      Monterey Bay Educational, Science, and Technology Center are
                      provided in the master plan for the area adopted by the University of
                      California Regents on March 21, 1997. The City shall use the
                      standards and guidelines set forth in this master plan as the basis for
                      approval of all development applications subject to its review. Within
                      that context, City review shall emphasize the achievement of site and
                      architectural design of high quality, characterized by high visual
                      interest and an attractive overall environment. This may permit limited

                     landscaping palette beyond the normal range identified in the master
                     plan. Also, the City’s employment of the master plan’s standards and
                     guidelines may be modified by subsequent amendments to the master

               Public Health and Safety
               4.97  The following policies and conditions complement the policies of the
                     Community Land Use Element which are designed to prohibit or
                     restrict development on land where there is significant potential for
                     threat to life or property.
               Seismic and Geotechnical Hazards
               4.98 The policies of the Community Land Use element prohibit
                     development on land where there is a significant potential threat to life
                     or property due to very high seismic shaking or seismically induced
                     ground failure, flooding, or landslides. They incorporate, by reference,
                     the provisions and policies of the City’s certified Local Coastal
                     Program regarding development in the Coastal Zone. In particular,
                     new structural development, other than essential support facilities for
                     coastal-dependent uses, will not be allowed in the 100-year tsunami
                     runup zone. Areas of high to very high seismic risk are generally
                     delineated in Figures 1, 3 and 4 in Appendix A, and consist of those
                     areas having a high to very high seismic shaking hazard and high to
                     very high susceptibility for liquefaction and lateral spreading. These
                     appendices should be used as a basis for implementing the relevant
                     geologic/ geotechnical policies of this General Plan. There remain,
                     however, several localized areas with high seismic hazard or flood
                     potential where development is permissible.           These areas are
                     generally indicated by Figures 1, 3 and 4 in Appendix A. The hazard
                     of high seismic shaking is confined to an area generally bounded by
                     Highway One and Lakewood Drive. Developable land with potential
                     threat of flooding is limited to a 10-acre parcel to the north of Blanco
                     Road within the Salinas River flood plain and isolated pockets of land
                     shown in the FEMA maps and lying within the 100-year flood plain.
                     The following conditions shall apply to these areas.
               4.99  New development shall be permitted in areas of high seismic risk only
                     when adequate engineering and design measures can be
                     implemented in accordance with a geotechnical investigation and
                     report.
               4.100 To ensure that seismic and geotechnical hazards are adequately
                     minimized, the City shall continue its practice of adopting the most
City of Marina General Plan                                                                   152
4.                     Community Design & Development Element

                     recent edition of the California Uniform Building Code within six
                     months following adoption by the State.
               4.101 The City shall continue to ensure that new development is in
                     compliance with the provisions of the federal flood insurance program.
                     Hydrologic investigations shall be undertaken for all new development
                     proposed within or adjacent to sites identified as “Zone A” areas. i.e.,
                     potential areas of flooding for which the 100-year flood elevation has
                     not yet been determined as shown on FEMA’s Flood Insurance Rate
                     Map for Marina. As new information becomes available, it should be
                     submitted to FEMA for the purpose of updating Marina’s Flood
                     Insurance Rate Map.
               4.102 The following additional safeguards shall be provided:
                     1.      Ensure that critical or sensitive facilities, e.g., hospitals, fire
                             and police stations, schools, major transportation links, high-
                             occupancy structures, emergency communication facilities,
                             utility lines, and sites containing or storing hazardous
                             materials, are located, designed and operated to maximize
                             their ability to remain functional after the expected or
                             maximum credible event on any of the local active fault
                             systems. Critical facilities shall not be located in areas of high
                             to very high seismic shaking hazard.
                     2.      Require that new development be sited and designed to
                             conform to site topography and to minimize grading wherever
                             possible. Recommendations to developers as to how to
                             mitigate geologic or seismic hazards should include mention of
                             the need to avoid massive grading or excavation or structures
                             that might require substantial alteration of natural landforms.
                     3.      Require the preparation of combined geologic and
                             geotechnical reports where new development is proposed on
                             slopes with greater than a 30 percent gradient or within 200
                             feet of slopes with more than a 50 percent gradient. As part of
                             the project approval process, require the implementation of
                             recommended engineering and design measures to reduce
                             the risk of slope instability or failure for these sites.
                     4.      Where new development is proposed within 300 feet of active
                             dune fields (delineated as “Qds” in Figure 1 of Appendix A),
                             require that the geotechnical report include an assessment of
                             dune migration rates and recommend appropriate setbacks.
                             New development in an area of Flandrian dunes (areas shown
                             as “Qfd” on Figure 1, Appendix A) should maintain a minimum
                             setback of 100 feet from the leeward (downwind) dune face,
                             based upon the prevailing northwesterly wind direction, unless
                             other adequate protective measures can be implemented.
City of Marina General Plan                                                                     153
4.                     Community Design & Development Element

                      5.     Where new development or subdivisions are proposed on soils
                             with moderate to potentially severe limitations as substrates
                             for construction or engineering purposes, as shown in Figure 4
                             of Appendix A, require that geotechnical reports be prepared
                             and engineering and design measures be implemented as part
                             of the project approval process.          Allow exceptions for
                             development on existing lots of record where geotechnical
                             reports were completed in conjunction with subdivision map
                             approval or for single-family homes on existing lots of record.
               Hazardous Materials
               4.103 To protect the public from heath threats posed by hazardous
                      materials, the following policies shall be adhered to:
                      1.     The City shall support all local, regional and state efforts
                             directed at preventing injuries and avoiding environmental
                             contamination due to the uncontrolled release of hazardous
                             substances. The City shall follow all applicable regulations
                             and procedures related to the use, storage and transportation
                             of toxic, explosive and other hazardous materials to prevent
                             uncontrolled discharges.
                      2.     The City shall require discretionary review and approval of all
                             commercial and industrial uses which will generate more than
                             27 gallons of hazardous wastes monthly (the limitation
                             imposed by Monterey Regional Waste Management District for
                             non-household hazardous wastes). City approval of these
                             uses shall be contingent upon preparation and approval by the
                             County Health Department of a hazardous-waste-disposal
                             plan for these uses prepared in accordance with the
                             requirements of the Monterey County Health Department.
                      3.     All uses involving the handling of significant amounts of
                             hazardous materials shall be subject to discretionary approval.
                             Hazardous-materials-management and -disposal plans shall
                             be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the
                             Monterey County Health Department for all such projects prior
                             to the granting of any entitlements by the City.
                      4.     The City shall ensure that proposed industrial or commercial
                             projects that will use or generate hazardous materials shall be
                             compatible with surrounding uses as designated by the
                             General Plan. Residential uses and other sensitive uses such
                             as schools shall be adequately buffered from adjoining uses
                             which involve the use or generation of hazardous materials.
               Aviation Hazards
               4.104 Airport operation hazards are addressed by Community Land Use
                      element policies that prohibit development within runway-protection
                      zones. When City acquisition of these lands is not feasible, limited
City of Marina General Plan                                                                  154
4.                     Community Design & Development Element
                     non-residential uses may be allowed in accordance with provisions of
                     the Marina Municipal Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan, unless a
                     proposed development is reviewed by the Airport Land Use
                     Commission or otherwise approved by the City. The City and the
                     Airport Land Use Commission will work cooperatively to address
                     aviation hazards. (2008-224)
               Emergency Preparedness
               4.105 In coordination with other emergency-response agencies within the
                     County, the City shall implement the following emergency-
                     preparedness policies as set forth by the City’s emergency-
                     preparedness plan (i.e., Standardized Emergency Management
                     System Multi-hazard Functional Plan): emergency planning; training
                     of emergency-response personnel; ensuring the provision of adequate
                     resources, supplies and equipment to respond effectively to
                     emergencies; promoting public awareness and education; and
                     formulating measures, including land use, design and construction
                     regulations, to reduce the likelihood and amount of losses from
                     disasters.
               Noise Protection
               4.106 The land use policies contained in the Community Land Use Element
                     are designed to avoid conflicts between noise-sensitive uses (in
                     particular, residences and schools) and major noise sources.
                     Accordingly, land designated for such noise-sensitive purposes has
                     been limited to locations which are unlikely to be exposed to
                     excessive noise. At such time that future development of residences,
                     schools and parks is proposed, more site-specific noise analysis shall
                     be conducted for parcels that are in close proximity to major roadways
                     or that lie in areas affected by aircraft-generated noise. If specific
                     uses are found to be affected by noise levels greater than the
                     standards set forth in Table 4.1 of this plan or, within the Airport
                     Planning Area, Table 4-1 (see Appendix C) of the Airport
                     Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP), the mitigation measures
                     identified in the following sections shall be required.
               4.107 The maximum allowable exterior noise exposure, as measured in Ldn
                     (dBA), (or CNEL for the Airport CLUP noise standards) shall not
                     exceed the “acceptable use” standards shown in Table 4.1 of this
                     plan, or, where applicable, the “permitted use” standards of Table 4-1
                     of the Airport CLUP. In the Airport Planning Area, the noise standards
                     of Table 4-1 of the Airport CLUP shall apply where such standards are
                     more stringent than those of this plan. Where existing or projected
                     exterior noise levels exceed the acceptable limit, construction shall be
                     conditionally permitted only when appropriate mitigation measures are
                     employed, including measures to attenuate exterior noise levels
                     where development of schools, parks and playgrounds is proposed,
                     and, within the Airport Planning Area, as conditionally allowed by
                     Table 4-1 of the Airport CLUP.
City of Marina General Plan                                                                  155
4.                     Community Design & Development Element

               4.108 These measures must reduce interior noise to the maximum allowable
                     limits shown in Table 4.1, and, within the Airport Planning Area, to
                     CNEL 45 dB for all uses which are conditionally permitted as indicated
                     by Table 4-1 of the Airport CLUP. In such instances, the developer of
                     a new building shall provide the City with proof from a professional
                     acoustical consultant that exterior noise levels have been mitigated
                     such that building occupants will not be subject to interior noise levels
                     greater than those in Table 4.1, and, within the Airport Planning Area,
                     in Table 4-1 of the CLUP. Except in the Airport Planning Area, if the
                     City finds the project to be in the public interest, the City may approve
                     a project where the exterior noise level exceeds the conditionally
                     acceptable level. Such approval shall be contingent upon a detailed
                     analysis by a qualified acoustical engineer showing that specific
                     measures included in the project will reduce interior noise to the
                     maximum interior levels shown in Table 4.1.
               4.109 The construction of new or the improvement of existing arterials and
                     collectors as identified in this plan shall require discretionary approval.
                     A cumulative noise impact analysis shall be undertaken prior to
                     approval of all new major new roads or improvements of existing
                     arterials and collectors which would result in significant increases in
                     traffic volumes. If projected cumulative traffic increases in traffic
                     volumes would result in a substantial increase in ambient noise levels
                     which would adversely affect existing noise-sensitive uses or subject
                     future receptors to exterior noise levels in excess of the “acceptable”
                     exterior noise standards of Table 4.1, appropriate noise abatement
                     measures shall be identified and implemented, including increased
                     setbacks for any new sensitive receptors, appropriate architectural
                     design and construction techniques and the use of landscaped earth
                     berms.
               4.110 Site-planning measures such as sound walls along roadways shall be
                     the mitigation measure of last resort so as to avoid the adverse visual
                     impacts of such structures. Where they are necessary, sound walls
                     shall include landscaped earth berms at their bases to minimize
                     visible wall height. Sound wall designs shall also incorporate
                     provisions for screening landscaping and for coverage of walls by
                     plant materials. Sound walls shall be built of attractive, durable
                     materials
               4.111 New and modified stationary noise sources adjoining or in close
                     proximity to residential and other noise-sensitive uses shall adhere to
                     the standards in Table 4.2 of this plan.

               Environmental Protection and Conservation
               4.112 The policies of the Community Land Use Element are designed to
                      protect areas with significant agricultural or natural-habitat value from
                      being displaced by development, and they are designed to protect
                      and conserve air, water and energy resources. To further ensure the
                      protection and conservation of these natural resources from the
                      adverse affects of nearby construction and land alteration, whether for
                      private purposes or to accommodate public facilities, the following
                      requirements and limitations shall apply. The policies and conditions
                      which follow are organized by three major natural resource
                      categories: (1) biological resources, (2) water, soil and mineral
                      resources, and (3) air quality.
               Biological Resources
               4.113 As used in this General Plan, “sensitive species” refers to the
                      following categories of species and “sensitive habitat” refers to habitat
                      identified as supporting one or more of the following: federally
                      proposed and listed threatened and endangered species; species that
                      are candidates for federal listing as threatened or endangered; state-
                      listed threatened and endangered species; and California Native Plant
                      Society list 1B species with extensive portions (i.e., greater than 10
                      percent) of their known ranges within the Marina Planning Area.
               4.114 Within areas identified as supporting sensitive habitat(s), the following
                      requirements shall apply:
                      1.       With the exceptions of areas where an approved Habitat
                               Management Program (HMP) or Habitat Conservation
                               Program (HCP) allows development without restrictions, and
                               for structures erected to maintain, restore or enhance sensitive
                               habitat and species, require discretionary approval for all new
                               structural and road development proposed within sensitive
                               habitat areas or on sites supporting sensitive species and
                               habitat.
                      2.       Site and design those new structures or roads which may be
                               allowed within designated Habitat Reserves or other identified
                               sensitive habitat areas so as to minimize adverse impacts
                               upon habitat areas. This may entail site plan modification
                               and/or the inclusion of appropriate mitigation measures
                               developed by biologists, soils engineers, or hydrologists (e.g.,
                               erosion and storm-drainage controls, wildlife culverts, and
                               grading limitations). (2006-243)
               4.115 Within areas for which there is an approved (HMP) or (HCP) and
                      where avoidance of significant impacts is not feasible as determined
City of Marina General Plan                                                                    158

                     through discretionary review, a seasonal avoidance and/or
                     salvage/relocation program for certain species and habitat areas
                     should be established or undertaken, as appropriate, prior to site
                     development.
               4.116 Where new development may remove all or a portion of identified
                     sensitive habitat in an area not subject to an approved HMP or HCP,
                     and where no less environmentally damaging alternative can be
                     feasibly implemented, comparable habitat should be restored either
                     on-site or off-site on a two-to-one basis (e.g., two acres of habitat
                     shall be restored for every acre of habitat removed).
               4.117 Except where possible “take” of sensitive species is allowed (and may
                     be mitigated in compliance with federal and state laws, regulations,
                     and other applicable legal mechanisms such as an approved HCP or
                     HMP), the City shall designate all areas identified as supporting
                     sensitive habitat as “Habitat Reserve,” and, where occurring on
                     private property, it shall ensure protection through easements,
                     dedications, or other appropriate legal means.
               4.118 Where development sites are adjacent to areas designated as
                     “Habitat Reserves” or other identified sensitive areas, site
                     improvements and buildings shall be located and designed so as to
                     avoid adverse impacts on the biological resource in question.
                     Development shall be conditioned upon the incorporation of adequate
                     mitigation measures in terms of site design. Such measures might
                     include the following: a) providing an adequate buffer between new
                     development and identified sensitive habitat; b) minimizing the need
                     for grading that would substantially alter the existing topography; c)
                     incorporating erosion- and sediment-control techniques during and
                     after construction; d) establishing appropriate native landscaping
                     between new development and sensitive habitat; and e) providing
                     wildlife corridors or connections between the sensitive habitat and
                     other natural open space areas.
               4.119 As part of any application package for development proposed on
                     undeveloped lands in former Fort Ord or on the Armstrong Ranch,
                     seasonally timed surveys for known or suspected sensitive or unique
                     species and habitats shall be undertaken by a qualified biologist
                     approved by the City Community Development Director (except in
                     those areas where such species have already been addressed by
                     approved habitat conservation/management plans or similar plans or
                     agreements). This information shall be provided as part of a
                     preliminary site and development review, and, for development on
                     former Fort Ord, should be submitted to CRMP for review and
                     recommendations. Where such species are found to occur, mitigation
                     plans (or Habitat Management Plans) shall be prepared in
                     coordination with the USFWS and DFG unless approved habitat
                     management plans are already in place.

               4.120 Oak woodland shall be protected to the greatest extent possible in
                     recognition both of its relatively high biological and aesthetic resource
                     value and its important role in California’s and Monterey County’s
                     natural heritage. In areas supporting oak woodland, a site survey of
                     this resource should be completed for all new subdivisions and
                     commercial projects as part of a preliminary site and development
                     review. All stands of oak woodland and individual specimens with a
                     diameter of 6 inches or more when measured 4.5 feet from ground
                     level should be identified on a base map. To the greatest extent
                     possible, development plans shall then attempt to incorporate the oak
                     woodland or individual specimens into the plan as an integral feature
                     of the natural and built environment.
                     All oak trees shall be replaced and maintained with new trees of the
                     same stock as those found onsite or in the site vicinity according to
                     the following replacement formula: a minimum one-for-one (one
                     replacement tree for each tree removed) where replacement trees are
                     proposed to be the same diameter or greater than those to be
                     removed; a minimum three-to-one (three replacement trees for each
                     tree removed) for replacement trees of lesser diameter than those
                     proposed for removal, unless, as determined by arborist, the site’s
                     specific environmental conditions would not sufficiently support a
                     healthy oak habitat. All diameter measurements shall be taken at 4.5
                     feet from ground level. Replacement trees shall be a mixture of sizes.
                     (2006-284)
               4.121  In those areas where the potential for vernal pools exists, a site
                     survey shall be conducted by a qualified biologist. Any development
                     or grading of a site found to have one or more vernal pools shall
                     provide a wetland buffer of sufficient width and size, as determined by
                     a qualified biologist, between the vernal pond habitat, including
                     associated wetland vegetation, and the proposed or existing
                     development to both protect those species most sensitive to
                     development disturbances and complement the habitat value of the
                     wetland resource. Structures allowed within the wetland buffer shall
                     be limited to those required for providing public access and nature
                     observation. Grading within identified vernal ponds shall be limited to
                     that necessary for habitat restoration, enhancement and protection or
                     as may otherwise be recommended by a qualified biologist. No soil
                     disturbance shall occur during the rainy season within the designated
                     vernal pond and buffer area.        Grading within the drainage area of
                     vernal ponds but outside the designated wetland buffer may be
                     allowed in accordance with the provisions of an approved erosion
                     control and landscape plan pursuant to Policy 4.125.1 of this plan with
                     appropriate measures employed as needed to protect the wetland
                     habitat.
               4.122 The City shall require that lighting of streets and other public areas in
                     proximity to areas of natural open space be shielded and as
                     unobtrusive as possible so as to direct light away from habitat reserve

                      areas and other areas of natural open space. The same requirements
                      shall follow for outdoor lighting on private development sites adjacent

               4.123 Existing windrows shall be protected in accordance with the
                      provisions of Policy 4.14 of this plan.
               4.123.5 The City shall avoid and minimize the potential impacts and
                      implement policies 4.113 through 4.123 to the extent possible when
                      planning or implementing development projects on or adjacent to
                      Marina Municipal Airport. If the proposed measures have the potential
                      to pose hazards to aircraft operations or lead to potential
                      encroachment, the City should consider alternative measures (e.g.,
                      off-site mitigation measures, compensatory mitigation, etc.). The City
                      should work with FAA and other regulatory agencies to identify
                      appropriate environmental protection and conservation measures
                      when proposing improvements to Marina Municipal Airport or adjacent
                      areas. (2008-224)
               Soils and Mineral Resources
               4.124 To conserve soil and mineral resources within the Marina Planning
                      Area, the following policies and conditions shall be established:
                      1.       The City shall continue to require erosion-control and
                               landscape plans for all new subdivisions or major projects on
                               sites with potentially high erosion potential. Such plans should
                               be prepared by a licensed civil engineer or other appropriately
                               certified professional and approved by the City Public Works
                               Director prior to issuance of a grading permit. All erosion
                               control plans shall incorporate Best Management Practices to
                               protect water quality and minimize water quality impacts and
                               shall include a schedule for the completion of erosion and
                               sediment-control structures, which ensures that all such
                               erosion-control structures are in place by mid-October of the
                               year that construction begins.         Site monitoring by the
                               applicant’s erosion-control specialist should be undertaken,
                               and a follow-up report should be prepared that documents the
                               progress and/or completion of required erosion-control
                               measures both during and after construction is completed.
                      2.       The City shall support continued agricultural uses on prime
                               agricultural soils and other agricultural lands outside the City’s
                               designated Urban Growth Boundary, i.e., lands designated as
                               “Agriculture” by this plan. The City should oppose any
                               proposed subdivision or use of land which might result in
                               conversion of such lands. (2005-82)
                      3.       The City shall encourage continued agricultural production on
                               lands within the City’s existing and proposed Sphere of
City of Marina General Plan                                                                      161
4.                     Community Design & Development Element

                             Influence as an interim use until such time that annexation and
                             development is approved consistent with this plan.
                     4.      The City recognizes the presence of designated mineral
                             resources west of Highway One, and shall continue to allow
                             the existing sand-mining operation on RMC Lonestar property
                             west of Highway One in accordance with the provisions of
                             Marina’s local coastal plan (LCP) and the approved
                             Reclamation Plan for that site. In accordance with the Marina
                             LCP, new or expanded sand-mining operations shall be limited
                             to the surf zone and already-disturbed areas, and shall be
                             subject to completion and approval of the prerequisite
                             environmental review, Reclamation Plan, and coastal permit
                             process. A coastal permit for new or expanded mining
                             operations may be granted only upon a finding, based upon
                             conclusive evidence, that such an activity will not significantly
                             accelerate shoreline erosion or have significant unavoidable
                             adverse impacts upon the dune and coastal strand’s biological
                             resources.
                     5.      The City recognizes the existence of designated mineral
                             resources east of Highway One within the Armstrong Ranch
                             portion of the City’s Sphere of Influence area. Mineral
                             extraction on a portion of the Ranch may constitute an
                             appropriate interim use, recognizing also that Armstrong
                             Ranch provides one of the last remaining large areas on the
                             Central Coast suitable for housing and other urban
                             development.
                     6.      Mineral extraction on a portion of the Armstrong Ranch
                             mineral resource area may be permitted, provided such use is
                             reviewed and processed in accordance with applicable state
                             laws, including environmental review pursuant to CEQA.
                             Approval should also be contingent on completion and
                             approval of a Reclamation Plan, use permit, and a
                             determination that the proposed mining activity will not
                             significantly conflict with other planned or approved uses
                             within close proximity (i.e., a 1,000-foot radius from the
                             perimeter of the mineral extraction site).
               Water Resources
               4.125 Approval of all future uses and construction within the Marina
                     Planning Area shall be contingent upon compliance with the following
                     policies and conditions intended to protect the quality of the area’s
                     water resources, avoid unnecessary consumption of water, and
                     ensure that adequate water resources are available for new
                     development.
                     1.      Where site size and soils permit, all storm drainage systems
                             for new development shall be designed in accordance with the
City of Marina General Plan                                                                   162
4.                     Community Design & Development Element

                             provisions of Section 3.57 of this plan to retain storm water on-
                             site and provide for its filtering of urban pollutants and its
                             percolation into underlying aquifers.
                     2.      All new roads should be designed to allow the localized
                             retention, filtering of urban pollutants, and percolation of storm
                             water into the underlying aquifer.
                     3.      All potential major sources of water pollution shall comply with
                             state and regional water quality programs, including the need
                             to obtain a discharge permit from the State Water Resources
                             Control Board for storm drain outfalls classified as "industrial."
                     4.      All construction activities involving the alteration of land and
                             the construction or improvement of roads, buildings and other
                             structures, where applicable, shall maintain and enhance the
                             quality of the environment of Monterey Bay in support of the
                             bay’s designation as a national marine sanctuary.
               Scenic and Cultural Resources
               4.126 The following scenic and cultural resources are deemed to be
                     particularly valuable, and the following policies should be pursued:
                     1.      All archaeological resources which may be present in the
                             Marina Planning Area shall be protected and preserved. To
                             this end, development proposed in areas of high
                             archaeological sensitivity, i.e., the terraces and benches along
                             the Salinas River, the peripheries of vernal ponds, and coastal
                             beaches, shall be required to undertake a reconnaissance by
                             a qualified archaeologist, and, where artifacts are identified, to
                             protect and preserve such resources.
                     2.      The historical significance of former Fort Ord should be
                             reflected in new development and/or reuse of at least a small
                             portion of the University Villages area near the 8th Street
                             overcrossing and at the Fort Ord State Park entrance. (2005-
                             128)
                     3.      The visual character and scenic resources of the Marina
                             Planning Area shall be protected for the enjoyment of current
                             and future generations. To this end, ocean views from
                             Highway One shall be maintained to the greatest possible
                             extent; development on the primary ridgeline of the Marina
                             dunes shall be avoided; new development proposed for the
                             Armstrong Ranch should maintain an adequate setback from
                             Highway One; landscape screening and restoration shall be
                             provided as appropriate; new development should be sited
                             and designed to retain scenic views of inland hills from
                             Highway One, Reservation Road, and Blanco Road; and
                             architectural review of projects shall continue to be required to
City of Marina General Plan                                                                     163
4.                     Community Design & Development Element

                            ensure that building design and siting, materials, and
                            landscaping are visually compatible with the surrounding
                            areas.
                     4.     The environmental review for the Armstrong Ranch specific
                            plan shall provide for adequately detailed visual simulations of
                            how proposed development will look when viewed from
                            Highway One. The specific plan for Armstrong Ranch shall
                            give special attention to minimizing visual impacts and
                            ensuring attractive development. In addition to adequate
                            setbacks from the highway, building and site design measures
                            that shall be employed include, but are not limited to, height
                            restrictions, landscape screening, appropriate color and
                            architectural schemes, and the use of non-reflective building
                            materials.

5. Program and Implementation Element
               Function and Content
               5.1   This section lays out the near-term strategy and program for
                     aggressively promoting the objectives embodied in the General Plan.
                     An implementation element is not required of general plans by state
                     planning law, but it is virtually impossible to separate consideration of
                     community goals and policies from the actions needed to achieve
                     them. Moreover, it is difficult to monitor the community’s planning
                     progress unless specific implementation actions are identified. The
                     identified actions in this section are intended to serve three purposes.
                     First, they aim to make the City’s existing development regulations
                     consistent with the policies of the General Plan, and in turn meet the
                     legal requirements of state planning law for zoning consistency with
                     the General Plan.         Second, they identify next-stage planning
                     programs needed to translate General Plan policies into more specific
                     action programs. Third, they identify and prioritize near-term City
                     improvement programs needed to implement the General Plan.
               5.2   This element is organized into the three following sections:
                     1.       Development Regulations. This section documents various
                              changes and additions to the City’s zoning ordinance and
                              other ordinances that will promote development consistent
                              with the General Plan.
                     2.       Near-Term Planning Studies. This section identifies additional
                              planning studies required to translate the more general and
                              long-term policies of the General Plan into specific near-term
                              action-oriented programs. Included in this section is a listing
                              both of recommended specific plans for critical areas of the
                              city and more detailed follow-on studies to resolve policy
                              issues in areas where the General Plan has identified several
                              options.
                     3.       Improvement Programs. This section describes improvement
                              programs recommended for implementation over the next five
                              years. Included are a five-year housing program as required
                              by the state housing element legislation, capital improvement
                              programs, and other programs designed to attract desirable
                              development or correct existing deficiencies which would
                              otherwise inhibit appropriate development. This section is
                              intended to serve as the basis for a detailed capital
                              improvement program.
City of Marina General Plan                                                                    1
5. Program and Implementation Element

               Development Regulations
               5.3   Implementation of the General Plan relies in large part on the City’s
                     regulatory powers, as embodied in its zoning code, subdivision
                     ordinance, and other regulating ordinances governing the use of land
                     and associated development activities. It is essential, therefore, that
                     existing ordinances be updated to be consistent with the intent of the
                     General Plan, and that new ordinances be written to address specific
                     General Plan policies.
               Zoning Ordinance Update
               5.4   A major revision of the City’s existing zoning code is required to
                     implement the General Plan. The initial step should be to thoroughly
                     review and critique the existing code and identify its deficiencies.
                     Readily evident deficiencies include the following:
                     1.      Existing residential, commercial and industrial districts are
                             inconsistent with the major land use categories set forth in the
                             General Plan, and will require creation of new zoning districts
                             which conform to the General Plan land use classifications and
                             intent. For example, the General Plan in certain areas calls for
                             residential use at densities lower than those currently
                             permitted, and in other areas it calls for a greater intermixing of
                             housing types than allowed by existing zoning. Similarly, the
                             General Plan reserves certain areas primarily for visitor-
                             serving commercial uses, multiple-use commercial, and office
                             and research use –land use groupings which are not covered
                             by the existing code.
                     2.      Commercial and industrial district regulations fail to prescribe
                             permitted development intensities, i.e., allowable floor areas.
                     3.      Current City development standards, such as lot size, width
                             and height, and provisions for landscaping in residential,
                             commercial and industrial districts, are inconsistent with
                             contemporary design and development practices. Moreover,
                             the existing standards, or lack thereof, do not address major
                             community-design policies of the General Plan such as the
                             interface between residential and non-residential uses.
                     4.      The current code does not have an adequate use classification
                             system, and its use definitions do not address contemporary
                             conditions.
                     5.      Changes in the existing code are required to bring it into
                             compliance with conditions in the FORA Reuse Plan.

5. Program and Implementation Element

                     6.        Changes are required to implement Housing Element policies
                               and programs.
                     7. Current requirements for off-street parking need review with
                          regards to current practice, historical demand in Marina where this
                          information is available, and parking demands anticipated with
                          new land use patterns. This should include special attention to
                          avoidance of on-street parking congestion, and to the review of
                          current residential areas where parking is perceived to have one
                          or more problems. Standards should also be established which
                          avoid single-family residential garages being situated at the front
                          of lots, unless they are so placed that the garage doors will be
                          perpendicular to the street such that when cars are parked in the
                          garage they are parallel to the street.
                     8. The responsibility and mechanisms for maintenance of landscape
                          strips between curbs and sidewalks should be specified or
                          outlined in the Zoning Ordinance or an alternative development
                          code. For example, this could be made the responsibility of
                          property owners’ associations in larger areas planned for eventual
                          subdivision.
               5.5   Following review, evaluation and identification of needed code
                     changes, a comprehensive update of the zoning code shall be
                     undertaken. Normally, such a program will require a minimum of 18
                     months, and may require as much as two to three years to complete
                     the redrafting and remapping of zoning districts.
               5.6   It would be possible to simplify and expedite the zoning update
                     program by relying more heavily on the use of specific plans. (See
                     further discussion of specific plans in 5.12.) Under state planning law,
                     cities and counties may prepare and adopt specific plans which have
                     the same regulatory effect as zoning. If this approach were used, the
                     zoning code could focus primarily on already-developed portions of
                     the city and on the few remaining infill sites therein, while specific
                     plans could be employed to regulate development in the Armstrong
                     Ranch and South Marina areas. (2005-82)
               Housing Availability Ordinances
               5.7   Preparation and adoption of the following ordinances should be
                     undertaken to address the General Plan objectives of matching
                     housing to the needs of local employees and providing housing to
                     meet the needs of households of all economic levels:
                     1.        Jobs/Housing Link. To promote a balance of jobs and housing
                               and related objectives of the General Plan aimed at reducing
                               the effects of commuting in terms of traffic congestion, air
                               pollution, energy consumption, and community life, the City
                               should draft and adopt an ordinance which encourages
                               housing to remain available to occupants of jobs located within
City of Marina General Plan                                                                    3
5. Program and Implementation Element

                             the City and its immediate environs. The enactment of such
                             an ordinance will be a pioneering effort, and it will require that
                             careful attention be paid to its legal basis, the effectiveness of
                             its incentives, and issues of short- and long-term
                             implementation.
                     2.      Inclusionary Zoning. To help alleviate the housing shortages
                             for households of low and moderate income, and to make
                             housing available to persons employed within Marina in lower
                             wage jobs (thereby promoting both the General Plan’s
                             jobs/housing balance and housing affordability objectives), the
                             City should draft and adopt inclusionary zoning requirements.
                             The ordinance shall require that all projects containing
                             approximately 20 units or more, regardless of zoning district or
                             specific plan area, include and maintain an appropriate
                             percentage of the units as housing affordable to lower and
                             moderate income households consistent with the Housing
                             Element’s inclusionary requirement. The ordinance should
                             also include incentives for providing below-market-rate
                             housing - in addition to that required as inclusionary - that is
                             affordable to households with incomes ranging from 120 to
                             150 percent of the current county median income. The
                             ordinance should determine both the income eligibility for
                             defining affordability, and employment and residence eligibility
                             consistent with the Housing Element, set pricing criteria for
                             affordable units, provide restrictions on resale and re-rental of
                             affordable units, and include incentives to help ensure the
                             economic viability of affected projects. Where affordable
                             housing is provided pursuant to conditions of project approval,
                             resale conditions should be imposed. (2005-82)
               Park Dedication and In-Lieu Fee Ordinance
               5.8   The City’s existing park dedication ordinance should be revised so as
                     to conform to the policies and standards contained in the General
                     Plan. It is essential that the revised ordinance address the distinct
                     differences in conditions between the Armstrong Ranch and the South
                     Marina area and, in particular, the improvement needs of park and
                     recreation sites in South Marina. In the latter area, since the majority
                     of needed park and recreation sites have already been obtained by
                     the City as part of the Fort Ord conveyance process, the primary
                     function of the ordinance will be to acquire sufficient funds to improve
                     the sites. (2005-82)
               Land Development Ordinance
               5.9   A comprehensive revision and consolidation should be prepared for
                     City ordinances regulating development activities involving site
                     alteration such as grading, tree removal, and construction methods
                     which potentially affect water quality, soil conservation, sensitive
City of Marina General Plan                                                                     4
5. Program and Implementation Element

                     habitat protection, and public safety.         The ordinance should
                     encompass the following:
                     1.     Provisions designed to protect and conserve sensitive natural
                            habitats and species. Provisions should be incorporated
                            which establish site-development and building-design
                            standards and guidelines for development permitted within
                            designated habitat preserves, sensitive habitat areas, and
                            adjoining areas where development may effect habitat and
                            related mitigation requirements.
                     2.     Revision of the City’s tree removal, preservation and
                            protection ordinance.         The revisions should require
                            replacement of oak trees on at least a one-for-one basis, and
                            incorporate the standards of the FORA Reuse Plan related to
                            native vegetation and landscaping for oak trees.              The
                            ordinance should also provide for the protection, ongoing
                            management, and incremental replacement of windrows.
                     3.     An update of the City’s regulations affecting soil resources.
                            This should involve revision of the City’s existing grading,
                            erosion-control, and landscape requirements for subdivisions
                            and major projects on sites with potentially high erosion
                            potential. These provisions should include approval by the
                            City Public Works Director for all such projects, use of certified
                            professionals for design, and monitoring by erosion-control
                            specialists to ensure satisfactory completion and performance
                            of required controls.
                     4.     Storm drainage report requirements including: calculations of
                            runoff from new development and any tributary areas to
                            determine the adequacy of both private and city drainage
                            systems to accommodate runoff; hydraulic calculations for all
                            storm drain systems; drainage shed maps, as appropriate,
                            which show all upstream acreage; and runoff coefficients for
                            each tributary area, with overland flow paths and site release
                            points clearly identified. Storm drainage reports shall be
                            prepared by a licensed civil engineer or other appropriately
                            certified professional and reviewed and approved by the
                            Department of Public Works Director.
                     5.     Provisions to protect cultural resources which may be
                            discovered during construction, including a provision that
                            prohibits further disturbance of the area within fifty meters of a
                            potential cultural find until it has been evaluated by an
                            archaeologist and appropriate protective measures can be
                            implemented.       Similarly, the ordinance should include
                            provisions to protect human remains which may be
                            encountered during construction such that all further
                            excavation and disturbance of the site is halted until a
City of Marina General Plan                                                                    5
5. Program and Implementation Element

                               determination by the Monterey County Coroner has been
                               made. If the remains are determined to be of Native American
                               origin, handling of the human remains shall be as provided in
                               Public Resources Code Section 5097.98.
                      6.       As either part of a consolidated ordinance or elsewhere, the
                               City should update its street schedules and standards to
                               implement the various applicable policies of Chapter 4 and
                               elsewhere within the General Plan.
               Planning Programs
               5.10   The following planning programs should be undertaken and
                      completed within the next several years so as to provide as firm and
                      consistent a basis as possible for carrying out the General Plan’s
                      short- and mid-term objectives.
               Specific Plans
               5.11 Specific plans shall be prepared for three major areas: 1) Armstrong
                      Ranch; 2) University Village; and 3) the Downtown Vitalization Area.
                      As discussed above, such plans can serve as an alternative to zoning.
                      Given the uniqueness of each of these areas, the use of specific plans
                      as a primary regulatory tool will be especially advantageous because
                      specific plans permit the use of development requirements that are
                      more location-specific than general municipal zoning. The degree of
                      specificity or generality of the requirements can also vary in a manner
                      not possible with zoning, thereby allowing either greater flexibility or
                      more specific guidance. (2008-111)
               5.12   State planning law allows for the recovery of costs involved in the
                      preparation of specific plans and related EIR’s from affected property
                      owners. In the case of Armstrong Ranch, the property owner or
                      investors should be required to finance the cost of such planning
                      efforts from their outset. Since the North University Village and West
                      University Village are not currently in private ownership, initial public
                      financing of plan preparation will be necessary, but these costs can be
                      recovered at such time that development proceeds. Cost recovery
                      may occur either in conjunction with (and as a condition for) approval
                      of a development proposal or agreement, or at such time as building
                      permits are issued. Costs should be distributed equitably among
                      participating development entities based on projected economic
                      return, residual land value, or other economic criteria.
               Civic Center Study
               5.13 The General Plan identifies three potential sites for accommodation of
                      civic facilities and functions. To determine which site or sites are most
                      appropriate for the purpose, a three-part study should be undertaken
                      to determine future building and site needs for City government
                      functions and other community or civic purposes. The first part should
City of Marina General Plan                                                                     6
5. Program and Implementation Element

                     determine year 2010 and 2020 building space requirements for these
                     uses. The second part should evaluate locational requirements,
                     compatibility and synergy, and site area requirements for each
                     proposed facility, and consider various site and design options for
                     accommodating and combining uses. The third part should consist of
                     implementation analysis, encompassing projected capital costs,
                     sources of financing, and the identification of all beneficial and
                     adverse affects associated with the options under consideration.
               School Site Selection Studies
               5.14 The General Plan designates sites for future schools sufficient to meet
                     the projected 2020 school enrollment. In several instances alternative
                     sites have been designated so as to allow for additional analysis and
                     opportunities to coordinate the site selection with other planning
                     efforts. Still to be determined are the locations of the K-5 school
                     serving future residents in South Marina, a new middle school, and a
                     new high school. (2005-82)
               5.15  Two potential K-5 sites are shown in the General Plan in the Main
                     Garrison area, only one of which is projected to be needed. One of
                     these sites is within the Frederick-Schoonover Park area and has
                     already been conveyed to the Monterey Peninsula Unified School
                     District for this purpose. An alternative site is shown in the Upper
                     Patton Park area adjoining the planned extension of California
                     Avenue. Possible locations for the new middle school remain to be
                     determined. The City of Marina, in collaboration with the Monterey
                     Peninsula Unified School District, should undertake more detailed site
                     evaluations and select the preferred sites. In order to ensure
                     coordination with planning for Armstrong Ranch and Patton Park and
                     Abrams Park, a high priority should be given to these studies. (2008-
                     42)
               5.16  Additional analysis is also required to further evaluate the adequacy of
                     the General Plan-designated high school site on Reservation Road
                     immediately east of Salinas Avenue, and to evaluate other potentially
                     suitable sites. The designated site includes the conveyance parcel
                     identified in the FORA Reuse Plan as an alternative high school site
                     and contiguous outdoor recreation areas in the adjoining Preston Park
                     and Abrams Park areas. More detailed site and building programming
                     and design studies should be undertaken to determine the suitability
                     of this site.
               Housing Element Update
               5.17 Once the year 2000 U.S. Census data is available and AMBAG’s
                     Regional Housing Needs Plan has been completed, a comprehensive
                     review should be undertaken of the housing policies and programs
                     contained in this General Plan.

               Park Planning Studies
               5.18 The City should undertake a park planning and design study jointly
                      with Monterey County and CSUMB for purposes of defining the
                      program and design requirements for the landfill park site and for
                      recreational/equestrian trails in the Main Garrison area and on related
                      BLM open space lands to the south.
               Historical Resources Program
               5.19 The City should undertake a survey of potential historical resources,
                      determine if there are adequate potential historical resources to
                      warrant possible state recognition as a Certified Local Government,
                      and if so, pursue possible recognition, and consider adoption of an
                      historical preservation ordinance as well as policy and permitting
                      requirements for activities which might affect historical resources.
               Annual Water Supply Monitoring Report
               5.20 On an annual basis, information regarding water supply and demand
                      will be compiled and analyzed in a report prepared by the City in
                      collaboration with the Marina Coast Water District (MCWD) as
                      specified by Policy 3.48 of this plan. This report should be completed
                      by the end of the first trimester each year and will then be submitted
                      to the City Council, Planning Commission, MCWD and Fort Ord
                      Reuse Authority for review and consideration.
               Light Rail Feasibility Study
               5.21 By the year 2010, FORA and the City should jointly undertake a
                      feasibility/ engineering study of the proposed light rail facility for the
                      purpose of determining the time frame during which such a facility
                      would be needed, cost effectiveness (relative to other potential
                      transportation alternatives), construction and other costs and funding
                      sources.
               Improvement Programs
               5.23   Described below are a series of programs designed to promote the
                      General Plan objectives. These programs are not intended to serve
                      as a comprehensive list of City capital improvement programs for the
                      next five years, but merely to highlight programs which are critical to
                      the success of the General Plan. The listed programs are either
                      prerequisites for other needed or desired actions, serve as a catalyst
                      to promote General Plan objectives, or are required to meet other City
                      obligations and near-term needs. The listing includes City housing
                      programs and initiatives for the next five years, and thus fulfills the
                      five-year housing program requirement of state planning law.
               Streetscape Improvement Program
               5.24 Undertake a pilot program within existing older neighborhoods to
                      demonstrate the desirability and impact of well-landscaped streets

                      and the use of traffic calming devices. Several blocks should be
                      selected in two or three neighborhoods for the demonstration project.
                      The areas should be selected both on the basis of need (such as
                      existing un-landscaped curbside landscape strips and incompatible
                      vehicular travel speeds), and interest of neighboring residents. The
                      program should include both an initial design phase, done in
                      collaboration with the adjacent residents, and an implementation
                      phase, which would be undertaken with volunteer resident labor.
               Public Safety Programs
               5.25 A public education program should be developed for earthquake
                      safety. The program should include guidelines for retrofitting existing
                      structures, safety procedures during and following an earthquake,
                      necessary survival material, and community resources identification.
                      As a part of this program the City should make available maps
                      showing hazard zones associated with seismically induced ground
                      failure (e.g., liquefaction and lateral-spreading potential).         This
                      information should be updated as new information regarding faulting
                      and seismic shaking in the region become available.
               Habitat Management Program
               5.26 A habitat management program should be established to provide for
                      maintenance and enhancement of General Plan-designated “habitat
                      reserves” under City management. The program should provide
                      funding for professionally qualified staff, ongoing monitoring, and
                      maintenance and enhancement programs.
               Housing Programs
               5.27 Implementation of the following housing programs is underway or is
                      planned for the period 2000-2005:
                      1.      Marina       Development    Agency/20      Percent      Set-Aside
                              Requirement. 354 units in Preston Park of former Fort Ord
                              have been refurbished and are presently occupied on a rental
                              basis, with 71 units reserved for households of very low
                              income. An additional approximately 832 multi-family units in
                              the Abrams Park area of former For Ord will be subject to the
                              agency’s policy that 20 percent of all units built or refurbished
                              be made available to very low-, low-, and moderate-income
                              households.
                      2.      Senior Citizen Housing. The Marina Redevelopment Agency
                              will assist in the combined replacement and new construction
                              of about 712 units of former Fort Ord housing for use as a
                              retirement community. (2006-284)
                      3.      First Time Homebuyer Program. The City’s Redevelopment
                              Agency will continue to implement its $1 million first-time
                              homebuyer program which it initiated in 1999.

                     5.       Emergency Shelters/Transition Housing. Some 100 housing
                              units conveyed have been or are currently being processed for
                              McKinney Act sponsors (i.e., nonprofit or agency homeless
                              providers). Redevelopment Agency financial assistance has
                              and will continue to be provided to the sponsors on an Aas-

               Implementation of EIR Mitigation Measures
               5.28  A number of mitigation measures were identified in the draft and final
                     environmental impact report on the draft Marina General Plan as
                     necessary to mitigate identified significant environmental impacts to a
                     level of less than significant. Many of these mitigation measures have
                     been incorporated as policy provisions of this plan. However, others
                     were not and these are itemized verbatim in Appendix D of this plan.
                     Some will be included as implementing provisions of ordinances
                     identified in this section; others may entail the preparation and
                     adoption of separate ordinances or programs.

                                                 Appendix D:
                   Mitigation Measures from Final EIR and Mitigation Monitoring Plan
               The following measures include those from the Final EIR and associated
               Mitigation Monitoring Plan which are not specifically incorporated in the text
               of this plan and which have been determined as necessary to reduce
               significant environmental impacts to a level of less than significance. In one
               instanceB exposure to unexploded ordnanceBmitigation measures are
               specified, but the residual impact has been determined to still be significant
               and unavoidable. Except as indicated otherwise, the mitigation measures
               itemized below are not intended to be used alone, but must be implemented
               along with other mitigation measures identified by the certified Final EIR and
               approved Mitigation Monitoring Plan. The number following each mitigation
               measure listed herein references the actual mitigation measure of the Final
               EIR and Mitigation Monitoring Plan.
               MITIGATION MEASURE 4.3: Erosion Control Measures and Dune
               Setback
               Marina General Plan Policy 4.126.1 requires the preparation of erosion
               control and landscape plans for all new subdivisions and major projects with
               a high potential for erosion. The following measures should be implemented,
               where appropriate, to control erosion:
               Keep construction machinery off of established vegetation as much as
               possible, especially the vegetation on the upwind side of the construction site.
               Establish specific access routes at the planning phase of the project, and
               limits of grading prior to development, which should be strictly observed.
               Utilize mechanical measures (i.e., walls from sand bags and/or wooden slat
               or fabric fences) to reduce sand movement.
               Immediate revegetation (plus the use of temporary stabilizing sprays), to
               keep sand movement to a minimum.
               For larger-scale construction, fabric or wooden slat fences should be placed
               around the construction location to reduce sand movement.
               These measures should be incorporated as provisions of the new Land
               Development Ordinance outlined in Section 5.11 of the General Plan.
               MITIGATION MEASURE 4.5: Appropriate Setbacks to Mitigate Coastal
               Erosion Impacts
               In accordance with the city’s certified Local Coastal Program, all coastal
               development should incorporate a setback from the coastal bluff large
               enough to insure that the development is not subject to direct wave impact or
               undermining during the project's economic lifetime. This would reduce the
               impact to a level of less than significant.

5. Program and Implementation Element

               MITIGATION MEASURE 5.3: Compliance with Flood Insurance Program
               All development proposed within the City of Marina shall be required to be in
               full compliance with the provisions of the federal flood insurance program.
               Specifically, no new development shall be permitted unless all proposed
               foundations are at least one foot above the elevation of stormwater within the
               floodplain following a 100-year storm, as shown in the appropriate FEMA
               maps. This would reduce the hazards associated with flooding within the
               Marina Planning Area to a level of less than significant.
               MITIGATION MEASURE 6.2 DELETED (2006-243)
               MITIGATION MEASURE 6.3: Avoiding Impacts to Wetlands and
               Obtaining Required Permits
               All proposed development projects shall be designed to avoid construction in
               wetlands to the extent practicable. In those instance where it is not possible
               to avoid wetlands through design measures, the U.S. Army Corps of
               Engineers, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and
               Wildlife Service, the California Department of Fish and Game and the
               California Regional Water Quality Control Board shall be contacted in order to
               achieve compliance with the appropriate regulations and to obtain all required
               permits prior to project approval. The granting of the required permits may be
               conditional on the implementation of site-specific measures designed to
               mitigate any modification of riparian areas or wetlands which may result from
               construction of the projects. Avoiding completely all wetlands through design
               measures would reduce this potential impact to a level of less than
               significant. However, depending on the character and purpose of a
               proposed project, it may not be possible to design it in such a way as to
               completely avoid these areas. In these instances, project-related impacts
               would need to be mitigated to the satisfaction of the appropriate regulatory
               agencies prior to the issuance of the permits necessary to allow project
               construction to proceed. In granting the necessary permits, the regulatory
               agencies would require that all project-specific wetlands impacts be reduced
               to a level of less than significant.
               MITIGATION MEASURE 6.4 DELETED (2006-243)
               MITIGATION MEASURE 7.1: Best Management Practices/PM10 Analyses
               for Reducing Construction-related Air Quality Impacts
               Best Management Practices for dust suppression (such as watering exposed
               soil surfaces, covering stockpiles of debris, the routine sweeping of the
               construction area and adjacent streets, and the suspension of grading and
               other earthmoving activities during high winds) and for the operation of
               construction equipment shall be used to reduce adverse construction-related
               dust and emissions. Project-level analyses shall be required for those
               development projects which would involve the grading and/or excavation of
City of Marina General Plan                                                                   15

               1.2 acres or more per day, to determine whether daily PM10 impacts from
               construction activities would exceed the Monterey Bay Area Unified Air
               Pollution Control District=s significance threshold of 82 pounds per day. If
               significant impacts are anticipated, then those projects shall undertake
               dispersion modeling to conclude whether construction activities would
               generate significant levels of PM10. The use of ABest Management
               Practices@ would generally be expected to reduce the construction-related air
               quality impacts associated with the implementation of the Marina General
               Plan to a level of less than significant. Feasible mitigation measures
               identified in the CEQA Air Quality Guidelines (Monterey Bay Unified Air
               Pollution Control District, October, 1995) include:
               Water all active construction areas at least twice daily. Frequency should be
               based on the type of operation, soil, and wind exposure (Effectiveness =
               50%).
               Prohibit all grading activities during periods of high wind (over 15 mph)
               (Reduces potential for exceedance).
               Apply chemical soil stabilizers on inactive construction areas (disturbed lands
               within construction projects that are unused for at least four consecutive
               days) (Effectiveness up to 80%).
               Apply non-toxic binders (e.g., latex acrylic copolymer) to exposed areas after
               cut and fill operations and hydroseed area (Effectiveness up to 80%).
               Haul trucks shall maintain at least 2'0" of freeboard (Effectiveness = 90%).
               Cover all trucks hauling dirt, sand, or loose materials (Effectiveness = 90%).
               Plant tree windbreaks on the windward perimeter of construction projects if
               adjacent to open land (Effectiveness = 4% [15% for mature trees]).
               Plant vegetative ground cover in disturbed areas as soon as possible
               (Effectiveness ranges from 5%-99% [based on planting plan]).
               Cover inactive storage piles (Effectiveness up to 90%).
               Install wheel washers at the entrance to construction sites for all exiting
               trucks (Effectiveness = 50%).
               Pave all roads on construction sites (Effectiveness = 90%).
               Sweep streets if visible soil material is carried out from the construction site
               (Effectiveness = 34%).
               Post a publicly visible sign which specifies the telephone number and person
               to contact regarding dust complaints. This person shall respond to complaints
               and take corrective action within 48 hours. The phone number of the

               Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District shall be visible to ensure
               compliance with Rule 402 (Nuisance) (Minimizes nuisance levels).
               Limit the area under construction at any one time (Effectiveness = 71 pounds
               per acre per day).
               The above measures should be incorporated in the city=s new Land

               within one mile of the boundary of either the landfill facility or the Monterey
               Regional Water Pollution Control Agency's wastewater treatment plant shall
               be required to issue a disclosure document that would run with each property
               title which informs prospective property owners of the nature of operations at
               the nearby landfill and wastewater treatment facility so that they may be
               aware of the possibility of exposure to objectionable odors under certain wind
               and weather conditions. In combination with the required 1,000-foot buffer
               between the landfill and/or wastewater treatment facility and the nearest
               housing required by Marina General Plan Policy 2.34.4 and (renumbered)
               Policy 4.82, these measures can be expected to result in a reduction in the
               number of potential odor complaints from adjacent property owners, reducing
               the impact to a level of less than significant.
               MITIGATION        MEASURE          7.3:    Reducing      Traffic   Volume    at
               Intersections/Air Quality Modeling
               Major development projects which could be expected to result in significant
               adverse localized carbon monoxide impacts at intersections within the Marina
               Planning Area shall be subject to air quality modeling to determine the
               intersection-specific effects of such projects. As indicated in the CEQA Air
               Quality Guidelines (Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District,
               October, 1995), mitigating localized carbon monoxide impacts on existing or
               reasonably foreseeable sensitive receptors can be accomplished by
               improving traffic circulation at those intersections or roadway segments which
               may exceed ambient air quality standards for carbon monoxide as a result of
               future development under the Marina General Plan. This can be done by:
               Reducing travel to and from project sites; and
               Shifting travel away from peak periods.
               Feasible Transportation Demand Management (TDM) mitigation measures
               which may be employed to reduce traffic congestion by those proposing
               development projects under the Marina General Plan include:
City of Marina General Plan                                                                    17

                        Providing preferential car pool/van pool parking spaces;
                        Implementing a parking surcharge for single occupant vehicles;
                        Providing for shuttle/mini bus service;
                        Providing shower/locker facilities;
                        Providing on-site child care centers;
                        Providing transit design features within the development;
                        Developing park-and-ride lots;
                        Employing a transportation/ride share coordinator;
                        Implementing a ride share program;
                        Providing incentives to employees to ride share or take public
                         transportation;
                        Implementing compressed work schedules; and
                        Implementing tele-commuting program.
               These measures are all part of the city’s current transportation management
               ordinance which shall be implemented in order to attain the minimum trip
               reduction mandated by Marina General Plan Policy 3.22.
               In addition to the feasible TDM mitigation measures identified above,
               Transportation System Management (TSM) mitigation measures such as
               synchronizing traffic signals may also improve traffic circulation by increasing
               vehicle capacity.
               For each development project which may be found to contribute to any
               exceedance of the ambient air quality standards for carbon monoxide at local
               intersections, the quantification of the effectiveness of the mitigation
               measures employed to reduce this impact can be determined through the use
               of CALINE or CAL3QHC modeling, first conducted without the mitigation
               measures in place, and then conducted with the mitigation measures in
               place. The effective implementation of all feasible mitigation measures
               necessary to avoid exceeding ambient air quality standards for carbon
               monoxide would reduce potential "hot spot" impacts to a level of less than
               significant.
               MITIGATION MEASURE 8.1 (B): Marina Participation in Fair-Share
               Regional Financing Program.
               Marina will participate in a regional transportation financing mechanism, if
               and when adopted by TAMC, and will undertake the steps necessary to fund
               its ‘fair share’ of regional roadway and transit capital improvements (through
               traffic impact fees exacted from developers in portions of Marina outside of
               former Fort Ord) based on a nexus analysis of the updated regional
               transportation model. If such a financing mechanism is not in place at the
               time a Specific Plan application for Armstrong Ranch is submitted to the City
               for consideration, the City’s capital improvement program should be updated
               to include a nexus study for the affected section of Highway 1 within the
               Marina Planning Area for the purpose of determining needed interchange
               improvements, the cost of such improvements, and the fair-share portion of
               such improvement costs which should be assumed by Armstrong Ranch
City of Marina General Plan                                                                     18

               those highway segments within the planning area.
               MITIGATION MEASURE 8.1 (C): Update of Regional Traffic Impact
               Analysis by Armstrong Ranch
               As part of the environmental review undertaken for the required Armstrong
               Ranch Specific Plan, an update of the regional and cumulative traffic impact
               analysis contained in the Marina FORA Reuse Plan EIR shall be undertaken
               for the purpose of identifying traffic-related impacts (and corresponding Afair
               share funding of needed improvements) on the regional road system related
               to build-out of the Armstrong Ranch as allowed under the Marina General
               Plan.
               MITIGATION MEASURE 8.1 (D): Implementation of a Traffic Impact Fee
               Program
               All new residential and commercial development within Marina, including
               development on lands owned by U.C. MBEST and CSUMB, should be
               subject to payment of traffic impact fees based upon the volume of traffic that
               would be generated by said development as established by a traffic fee
               impact study. This fee should be set by ordinance.
               MITIGATION MEASURE 9.1 Site-Specific Noise Mitigation
               (B) DELETED (2006-243)
               (C) Along the southern portion of the California Avenue Extension (that is,
               the segment south of Reindollar Avenue, in the Cypress Knolls area and in
               upper Patton Park where redevelopment is proposed), projected noise levels
               would not be expected to exceed Marina General Plan standards (e.g.,
               anticipated noise levels would remain below the acceptable 60 dBA Ldn level
               standard for residential and schools/library uses).
               (D) Existing and future residential development and other noise-sensitive
               uses immediately adjacent to the Imjin/12th Street Expressway (i.e., in the
               Preston Park, Abrams Park, Schoonover Park and North University Village
               areas) and to 8th Street and 2nd Avenue could be subject to noise levels
               greater than 60 dBA Ldn, but less than the ‘conditionally acceptable’ standard
               of 70 dBA Ldn for such uses. New development or major renovation in these
               areas would be conditioned upon the use of appropriate site design and noise
               abatement construction measures in those areas subject to the City’s land
               use jurisdiction. Appropriate setbacks and/or noise abatement construction
               techniques should also be imposed by CSUMB for new residential and
               educational development along 8th Street and 2nd Avenue on CSUMB lands
               to meet the noise standards of Table 4.1 of the Marina General Plan or other
               noise standards which may be applicable to development on State University
               lands.
City of Marina General Plan                                                                    19

               (E) Portions of the designated high school site along Reservation Road, and
               the middle school and elementary school sites along Golf Boulevard, lie
               within the projected 60 dBA Ldn noise contours. However, projected noise
               levels would not exceed conditionally acceptable levels for these uses (e.g.,
               70 dBA Ldn), and appropriate noise abatement could be accomplished either
               by siting buildings outside the 60 dBA Ldn noise contour or through the use of
               noise-abating construction techniques.
               (F) Any adverse noise impacts for residences or other noise-sensitive uses
               along major roadways (i.e., 12th Street/Imjin) could be effectively mitigated
               through the use of noise-abating construction techniques, and based upon
               the projected noise levels, the use of sound walls is not justified in these
               areas. The ultimate development of a light rail system would not be expected
               to significantly alter the projected 2020 noise contours, although project-
               specific noise analysis will be necessary when the development of a light rail
               system is formally proposed, once the specific type of equipment to be
               operated on that system has been identified.
               MITIGATION MEASURE 9.2: Construction Noise Abatement
               With reasonable construction practices (limiting construction hours to avoid
               early morning and evening activity, muffling and properly maintaining
               construction equipment used at project sites, etc.), this impact would be
               reduced to a level of less than significant.
               MITIGATION MEASURE 10.1: Site-Specific Analysis/Mitigation by
               School District and Marina
               As the construction of new schools is proposed to meet the increased
               demand for such facilities anticipated under the Marina General Plan, each
               project shall be required to undergo environmental review to determine the
               extent of any physical effects associated with the construction of the
               proposed facility that could have adverse impacts on the environment. If such
               effects are identified through the site-specific environmental review process,
               then the City of Marina and the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District
               shall identify and implement appropriate measures which would mitigate
               these effects to a level of less than significant.
               MITIGATION        MEASURE          10.2:    Site-Specific  Analysis/Mitigation
               Associated with Parks and Recreational Facilities Construction
               As the construction of new parks and recreational facilities (or the expansion
               of existing recreational facilities) is proposed to meet the increased demand
               for such facilities anticipated under the Marina General Plan, each project
               shall be required to undergo environmental review to determine the extent of
               any physical effects associated with the construction of the proposed facility
               that could have adverse impacts on the environment. If such effects are
               identified through the site-specific environmental review process, then the
               City of Marina shall identify and implement appropriate measures which
               would mitigate these effects to a level of less than significant.

               MITIGATION MEASURE 10.3: Developer Contributions to Parks and
               Recreational Facilities/Capital Improvement Program Scheduling
               In accordance with Marina General Plan Policy 2.16.1, Policy 2.16.3 and
               Table 2.3, the City shall continue to require new development to contribute to
               the provision of new parks and recreational facilities needed to meet the
               increased demand for these facilities resulting from their proposed
               developments. The City of Marina shall also ensure that the Capital
               Improvement Program accurately reflects the increased demand for parks
               and recreational facilities which would be expected to result from an increase
               in residential development within the planning area, so that proposed park
               and recreational facilities can be completed and operational prior to any
               significant increase in the local demand for such facilities. The combination of
               these two measures would effectively reduce the potential impact to a level of
               less than significant.

               Associated with Construction of New City Fire/Police Substation(s)
               When the construction of a new fire/police substation is formally proposed,
               said project shall be required to undergo environmental review to determine
               the extent of any physical effects associated with the construction of the
               proposed facility that could have adverse impacts on the environment. If such
               effects are identified through the site-specific environmental review process,
               then the City of Marina shall identify and implement appropriate measures
               which would mitigate these effects to a level of less than significant.
               MITIGATION        MEASURE         10.6:  Site-Specific      Analysis/Mitigation
               Associated with Construction of New Government Facilities
               When the construction of the new government facilities is formally proposed,
               each project shall be required to undergo environmental review to determine
               the extent of any physical effects associated with the construction of the
               proposed facility that could have adverse impacts on the environment. If such
               effects are identified through the site-specific environmental review process,
               then the City of Marina shall identify and implement appropriate measures
               which would mitigate these effects to a level of less than significant.
               MITIGATION MEASURE 13.1: Information Program/Regulation                       to
               Reduce Possible Exposure to Unexploded Ordnance
               Section 15.56 of the Marina Municipal Code currently reduces the hazard
               posed by exposure to unexploded ordnance by requiring notification of all
               users, owners or occupants in former Fort Ord and by limiting ground
               disturbance as reiterated in Mitigation Measures (A) and (B). The following
               measures should be implemented either through amendment of Section
               15.56 or through adoption of a new ordinance:
City of Marina General Plan                                                                     21
5. Program and Implementation Element
               (C) The entire road and trail system on open space and parks and recreation
               portions of the former Fort Ord should be scrutinized to preclude easy access
               onto Unexploded Ordnance sites. Roads and trails that "dead-end" at sites
               known to contain Unexploded Ordnance should be closed at the intersection
               prior to the Unexploded Ordnance site. This would preclude a person
               inadvertently walking/riding into an Unexploded Ordnance site and leaving
               such person with no alternative other than to reverse their course or traverse
               the site.
               (D) Field personnel (including biologists, archaeologists, wildland firefighters,
               and others who may need to access or excavate in areas away from existing
               roads, trails or other public access areas in Unexploded Ordnance sites) are
               subject to a higher probability of exposure than a general public that complies
               with land use regulations (i.e., by staying on designated trails and roads).
               Field personnel should be fully apprized of the dangers of Unexploded
               Ordnance, receive safety briefings, and be escorted by Unexploded
               Ordnance monitors whenever their work might involve activities that exceed
               the land use limitations placed on individual areas. For example, a wildland
               firefighter would not construct a fire line in open space areas in Unexploded
               Ordnance sites that have received a surface removal. In these instances,
               either a "let burn" policy should be developed, or individual crew leaders be
               accompanied by an Unexploded Ordnance monitor upon initial attack and
               during fire-line construction.
               Although the mitigation measures identified above would reduce the risks
               associated with possible exposure to Unexploded Ordnance to the maximum
               extent feasible given the existing technology and costs associated with the
               identification and removal of Unexploded Ordnance, the potential hazard to
               those using the "low-density" and "moderate-high-density" sites would still
               exist, and it would remain a potentially significant UNAVOIDABLE
               environmental impact associated with the implementation of the Marina
               General Plan.
