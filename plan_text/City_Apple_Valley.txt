LAND USE ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Land Use Element establishes the vision of Apple Valley for its long-term development. The
Town has carefully reviewed development patterns, and made changes where it felt that the
historic pattern may need redirection. This Element reflects the Town’s core values as they relate
to long-term development activity. It focuses on the protection and enhancement of existing
neighborhoods, and establishes goals, policies and programs to assure that development in the
future enhances what already exists in Town.
BACKGROUND
The Land Use Element is pivotal to
a successful General Plan. It affects
all other Elements, but most
particularly     the     Circulation
Element, which is designed to
assure that the land use pattern can
be supported through an effective
and efficient circulation system.
The Land Use Element is also
dependent on other Elements, such
as the Biological Resources and
Open Space elements, which
provide the basis for the
preservation of lands for these
resources, which are then defined
in the Land Use Element.
The framework for the Land Use Element is established in Government Code Section 65300 et.
seq., which requires that all municipalities adopt land use plans for residential, commercial,
industrial, open space and other land uses for all lands within their boundaries.
The Sphere of Influence
Apple Valley’s Sphere of Influence – that area determined by the Local Agency Formation
Commission to be a logical extension of the Town in the long term – encompasses lands to the
east and south of Town boundaries. The Sphere covers a large area, almost the same size in acres
as the Town, totaling 122,921.2 acres, or 192 square miles. The Sphere was assigned General
Plan land use designations prior to the adoption of this General Plan, which remain in effect after
the adoption of this General Plan. Most of the Sphere lands, however, will not be included in this
General Plan until such time as they are annexed to the Town. At that time, this General Plan
will be amended to include annexed lands.
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                                   II-2

                                                                          Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                            General Plan/Land Use Element
There are two exceptions to the Sphere lands, which were incorporated into this General Plan,
and were analyzed as part of the preparation of this General Plan.
The first area is that area known as the “Golden Triangle” (Annexation 2008-001), which occurs
on the northwestern corner of the Town. The area is bounded by Interstate 15 on the west, Morro
Road on the north, Dale Evans Parkway on the east, and Johnson Road on the south. This area
was proposed for annexation concurrent with the development of this General Plan, and was
assigned detailed land uses in the General Plan process. The area totals 2,774.6 acres.
The second area, Annexation 2008-002, consists of 808.6 acres located on the east side of
Central Road and the south side of Quarry Road, and encompasses all of Section 14, and a
portion of Section 23, Township 6 North, Range 3 East. This area is proposed as an extension of
the North Apple Valley Industrial Specific Plan, and was also proposed for annexation
concurrent with the preparation of this General Plan.
The annexation efforts for these two areas occurred immediately following the adoption of the
General Plan. Following completion of the annexation process, these lands will become part of
the Town’s incorporated boundary.
Exhibit II-1 illustrates the Town’s boundary and the Sphere of Influence. The Land Use Map is
provided as Exhibit II-2.
General Plan Land Use Designations
The land use types in Apple Valley are all related to a single, over-arching concept: that Apple
Valley’s quality of life is tied to its rural character, and that this character is to be preserved and
protected for the long term health of the community. In Apple Valley “rural” means space --
unscarred mountains and vistas of desert valleys, neighborhoods of large lots where keeping
horses is allowed, an extensive multi-use trail system, and landscaping consistent with the desert
environment.
The land use designations established in this General Plan are provided below. The single family
land use designations are consistent with those defined in Measure N (see further discussion
below). Three land use designations are new to this General Plan: Estate Residential ¾, Mobile
Home Park and Mixed Use.
Very Low Density Residential (R-VLD; 1 dwelling unit per 5 or more gross acres): This land use
designation allows detached single family homes on lots of at least five gross acres. Multi-use
trails should be integrated into all new projects in this designation, as appropriate. Also permitted
are agricultural and ranching activities, animal keeping (both personal use and commercial) and
home occupations. May be appropriate for bed and breakfast and similar uses, and animal-
keeping or agricultural-related commercial enterprises, such as feed stores, commercial stables
and similar uses with approval of a conditional use permit.
Low Density Residential (R-LD; 1 dwelling unit per 2.5 to 5 gross acres): This land use
designation allows detached single family homes on lots of two and a half to five gross acres.
                                                                                  Community Development
                                                                                                      II-3

                                                                       Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                         General Plan/Land Use Element
This designation provides for the rural and suburban environment. Multi-use trails should be
integrated into all new projects in this designation, as appropriate. Also permitted are agricultural
and ranching activities, animal keeping (both personal use and commercial) and home
occupations. May be appropriate for bed and breakfast and similar uses, with approval of a
conditional use permit.
Estate Residential (R-E; 1 dwelling unit per 1 to 2.5 gross acres): This land use designation
allows detached single family homes on lots of one to two and a half gross acres. Access on local
roads in new subdivisions within this designation should be paved. Multi-use trails should be
integrated into all new projects in this designation, as appropriate. Animal keeping for personal
use, ranching activities and home occupations are appropriate land uses in this designation. May
be appropriate for bed and breakfast and similar uses, with approval of a conditional use permit.
Estate Residential ¾ (R-E; 1 dwelling unit per 0.75 to 1.0 net acre): This land use designation is
specifically designed for animal keeping. Multi-use trails should be integrated into all new
projects in this designation, as appropriate. Animal keeping for personal use, ranching activities
and home occupations are appropriate land uses in this designation. Centralized stables, corrals,
show rings and similar facilities, available to all residents of a development project are
encouraged. May be appropriate for bed and breakfast and similar uses, with approval of a
conditional use permit.
Single Family Residential (R-SF; 1 dwelling unit per 0.4 to 0.9 net acre): Lots in this designation
must be a minimum of 18,000 square feet net, and may range to 39,200 square feet. This
designation is intended to be composed of planned subdivisions with all utilities and public
services. Animal keeping is permitted on lots zoned Equestrian Residential in the Development
Code. Multi-use trails should be integrated into all new projects in this designation, as
appropriate.
Medium Density Residential (R-M; 4 to 20 dwelling units per net acre): This designation is
intended to promote a wide range of higher density residential units, including: single family
attached; and multi-family units, including condominiums, townhomes and apartments. Projects
restricted to senior citizens (age 55 and older) and providing various levels of care are also
appropriate in this designation. Single family detached units are only permitted on lots of 18,000
square feet or greater in the Mountain Vista Estates area, as defined in Program 2.G.1. On all
other lands designated Medium Density Residential within Town limits, single family detached
units are prohibited. This land use designation should be a buffer between less intense residential
designations and commercial or industrial designations, or major roadways. Future projects
should be located in close proximity to commercial services, public transit and schools.
Mobile Home Park (MHP; 5-15 units per acre): This designation is applied to mobile home parks
that existed upon adoption of this General Plan. New mobile home parks would be required to
file a General Plan Amendment and Change of Zone to assign this designation to the project.
This designation applies to mobile home parks and mobile home subdivisions. Home
occupations and recreational facilities and amenities associated with the mobile home use are
also appropriate in this designation.

                                                                                                   II-4

                                                                       Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                         General Plan/Land Use Element
Mixed Use (M-U): The land use designation has been created to allow for the development of
projects that include residential and retail and office commercial development in an integrated,
master planned project. Residential development should occur over commercial development, or
within a commercial complex (i.e. residential building abutting a commercial building).
Residential development must occur at a density of 4 to 30 units per acre. Mixed Use projects are
encouraged in The Village, on major roadways, and in close proximity to employment centers,
such as the North Apple Valley Industrial Specific Plan area. Projects that propose residential
parcels adjacent to commercial parcels, and do not truly integrate the land uses, will not qualify
for this designation. The minimum size for a Mixed Use project is 1 acre.
Office Professional (O-P): This designation allows professional offices, and is intended to act as
a buffer between General Commercial and residential land uses. This designation encourages
high quality professional services with only ancillary retail commercial components. There is no
minimum size for project sites in this designation, but assemblage of smaller parcels is
encouraged.
General Commercial (C-G): This designation allows a broad range of retail uses, as well as
office and service land uses. Typical uses will serve the needs of the Town’s residents and
businesses, in a shopping center setting. General retail stores, including all types of consumer
goods, furniture and appliance sales, auto repair and sales are permitted in this designation.
Restaurants, both sit-down and fast food, gasoline service stations and general office (secondary
to retail uses) are also permitted in this designation. There is no minimum size for project sites in
this designation, but assemblage of smaller parcels is encouraged.
Service Commercial (C-S): This designation is assigned to lands in The Village, and is intended
as a transition designation allowing commercial and industrial land uses on a smaller scale. Its
location in an established area of Town necessitates flexibility in development standards, due to
existing development and infrastructure constraints. Land uses in this designation include vehicle
sales and service; lumber, home repair and building supply, general retail, warehousing and
manufacturing uses completely contained within an enclosed structure. There is no minimum
size for project sites in this designation, but assemblage of smaller parcels is encouraged.
Regional Commercial (C-R): This land use category allows retail uses that serve not only the
residents and businesses of Apple Valley, but also of the surrounding region. Permitted uses in
this designation include auto malls, regional malls, business parks, factory stores and outlets,
entertainment commercial, hotels and motels, restaurants, institutional and public uses. The
minimum size for a Regional Commercial project site is 10 acres.
Planned Industrial (I-P): This land use designation allows high quality, non-polluting industrial
land uses, either as free-standing uses or as part of master planned industrial parks. Uses
permitted include warehousing, light manufacturing, research and development and
administrative facilities. The minimum size for a Planned Industrial project site is 5 acres.
Public Facility (PF): This land use designation is assigned to public and quasi-public land uses,
including Town Hall and other Town facilities, fire stations, schools, facilities of the County,
                                                                                Community Development

State and federal government, water and sewer district, and utility substations and facilities.
There is no minimum size in this land use designation.
Open Space (OS): This land use designation is applied to natural and active open space areas,
including the knolls, Bell and Fairview mountains, the Mojave River, lands owned by Town,
County, State and federal agencies for the purposes of recreation or conservation, and golf
courses, parks or other recreational facilities.
Mineral Resources (MR): This land use designation is applied to lands in active mining
operations. One such operation exists in Town at the present time, located near Interstate 15.
This land use designation allows mining operations permitted by the State for lands with
significant deposits of concrete aggregate (please see the Mineral Resources Element).
Specific Plan: This designation is applied to lands on which a specific plan has been approved by
the Town Council. The Specific Plan must conform to State law, and include maps and text that
establish the land use designations; standards and guidelines for development; infrastructure
requirements; and phasing for the specific plan area. Specific Plans will be prepared for projects
consistent with Land Use Policies 3.B., 4.J., 4.J., and 4.K.

Build Out Potential and Population
As indicated in the Tables above, the Land Use Map creates a potential for up to 60,877 housing
units. Based on 2008 average household size, these units could support a build out population of
185,858 people.
The Land Use Map further establishes 4,791.3 acres of commercial land, which has a potential to
generate 51,685,423 square feet of commercial space. There is also a potential for 58,629,920
square feet of industrial space, mostly to be located in the North Apple Valley Industrial Specific
Plan area. This Land Use Element also provides 3,068.5 acres of Open Space, and 481.2 acres of
Public Facilities, which include schools, parks, fire stations and government buildings.
Specific Plans
State law allows for the preparation of Specific Plans, which become site-specific General Plan
and Zoning standards for a property or properties. The Specific Plan is required to include
mapping, design standards and guidelines, analysis of infrastructure and phasing and other
components necessary to allow the orderly development of the property or properties, in a
manner consistent with the General Plan.
Specific Plans have been adopted by the Town Council for a number of projects. Although
existing Specific Plans are primarily residential in nature, a notable exception is the North Apple
Valley Industrial Specific Plan, which governs land uses for a 5,100 acre area in the North Apple
Valley area. Specific Plans can be prepared for any land use type, consistent with General Land
Use Policy 3.B, 4.J., 4.J., and 4.K.
For Specific Plans consisting of single family residential development, the average density of the
Specific Plan cannot exceed two units per acre. The average density can include Open Space and
Parklands, but does not include Commercial, Industrial, or Public Facility land uses.
The standards and criteria for Specific Plans are contained in the Town’s Development Code.

are included in the Development Code.
Apple Valley Airport
The Apple Valley Airport is a County of San Bernardino airport located within the boundaries of
the North Apple Valley Industrial Specific Plan. The County has assigned, in the Airport Master
Plan, land use and noise impact areas. The land use influence areas pertain to the intensity of
development allowed, and the height of structures within the influence areas. The influence areas
are shown in Exhibit II-4. The standards and criteria for development within these influence
areas are included in the Development Code. The noise impact areas are discussed further in the
Noise Element.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The Town experienced significant growth from 2000 through 2005. This development expanded
residential neighborhoods, enhanced commercial opportunities, and expanded the Town’s jobs.
The future of Apple Valley will be dependent on the balance of growth and the preservation of

CIRCULATION ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Circulation Element addresses both the local transportation system within Town, and those
segments of the local transportation system that interface with, and serve as extensions of, the
regional roadway system connecting the Town of Apple Valley with the broader Victorville
Valley region and other communities in Southern California. The Element also describes
alternative means of transportation, such as bicycle, equestrian and pedestrian travel through
Town. The Circulation Element provides maps to guide the orderly development of all aspects
of the transportation system, as well as goals, policies and programs that correlate the Town’s
transportation system with the types, intensities and locations of land uses within the planning
area.
BACKGROUND
The Circulation Element both
affects and is influenced by
Town and regional land use
planning. It has fundamental
effects on the physical, social
and economic environment of
the Town, and it is also
directly linked to the Housing,
Open Space and Noise
Elements. The Circulation
Element is also closely
connected to the Air Quality
Element, as the efficiency of
local        and         regional
transportation systems has a
direct impact on air quality
issues. As the Town and the Victorville-Apple Valley region as a whole continue to grow and
develop, vehicle miles will increase and travel speeds will be reduced, resulting in higher
emissions per mile traveled. The Circulation Element sets forth policies and programs that can
play an important role in maintaining and enhancing the flow of traffic and preserving air quality
in the community.
The Circulation Element serves as a comprehensive transportation management strategy defining
a transportation system for the Town that responds to the demands of current and planned land
uses, as set forth in the Land Use Element. In addition to vehicular traffic, it also addresses other
modes of transportation such as air traffic, rail traffic, public transportation and alternative
transportation. It examines existing conditions in the planning area and includes an analysis of
                                                                              Community Development
                                                                                                   II-31

                                                                       Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                        General Plan/ Circulation Element
projected future development, based on build out of the General Plan Land Use Map (see Land
Use Element).
Through the use of engineering principles and computer modeling analyses of existing and
projected future traffic conditions, the Circulation Element establishes the backbone circulation
system needed at build out, the standards for each type of roadway, bicycle routes and pedestrian
trails. These standards are bolstered by a comprehensive group of goals, policies and programs
which provide the Town’s elected and appointed officials, as well as staff and the public, with
guidance on the development of these systems throughout the community.
California Government Code sets forth the information and data analysis requirements of the
Circulation Element. Government Code Sections 65103(f) and 65080, et seq., require the Town
to coordinate Circulation Element provisions with applicable regional and state transportation
plans. The state is also required to coordinate its planning efforts with those of local jurisdictions
(§65080(a)), with the federal government being under a similar mandate (§134, Title 23 of the
U.S. Code). California Government Code also requires the Circulation Element to include
development or improvement standards that are responsive to changes in demand resulting from
build out of the General Plan. In accordance with Government Code Section 65302(b), the
Circulation Element is to include descriptions of major thoroughfares and ensure that their
planned development is closely coordinated with the Land Use Element of the General Plan.
Indicators of Roadway Efficiency
The efficient movement of vehicular and non-vehicular traffic on local and regional roadways is
critical to the normal day-to-day functioning of a community. A range of consequences result
from obstructions in traffic flow, including among others, economic loss due to delays in
transporting goods, increased psychological stress for the traveling public, and increased risk for
motor vehicle accidents.
The efficiency of a roadway can be determined by assessing the roadway’s capacity, level-of-
service, and average daily traffic volume. Each category is described below. Table II-6 defines
the various Level of Service (LOS) classifications.
Level of Service
Roadway capacity is defined as the number of vehicles that may pass over a section of roadway
in a given time period under prevailing conditions. The “Level of Service” (LOS) typically
describes the capacity of a roadway and the degree to which it is being utilized. LOS is a
qualitative measurement. It describes operational conditions within a traffic stream and considers
speed, travel time, driving comfort, safety and traffic interruptions. Levels of Service are
described as a range of alphabetical connotations, “A” through “F,” which are used to
characterize roadway operating conditions. LOS A represents the best, free flow conditions, and
LOS F indicates the worst conditions, and system failure. Levels of service are also sometimes
represented as volume to capacity ratios, or vehicle demand divided by roadway capacity. As the
ratio approaches 1.00, roadway operations approach LOS F.
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                     II-32

                                                                    Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                    General Plan/ Circulation Element
Traffic engineers and transportation planners are involved in on-going efforts to strike a balance
between providing ideal roadway operating conditions and controlling the costs of infrastructure
and right-of-way needed to assure those conditions. Roadway capacity can be increased by
adding travel or turning lanes, constructing raised medians and/or restricting vehicle access to a
roadway. Traffic flow can be substantially improved by reducing the number of vehicle conflict
points and thereby avoiding the loss of capacity caused by disruptions to traffic flow caused by
vehicles entering or leaving the roadway. Roadway capacity can also be influenced by the
availability of alternative means of transportation The Town has traditionally used LOS C as its
standard for acceptable roadway conditions. As the Town builds out, however, this standard may
not be maintained in all locations. The need for changes in the Town’s standards is further
discussed below.
                                                                            Community Development

                                Roadway Level Of Service Description
Level of
Service                                Quality of Traffic Flow
A            Primarily free-flow operations at average travel speeds usually about 90 percent of
             the free-flow speed for the arterial classification. Vehicles are completely unimpeded
             in their ability to manoeuvre within the traffic stream. Stopped delay at signalised
             intersections is minimal.
B            Reasonably unimpeded operations at average travel speeds usually about 70% of the
             free-flow speed of the arterial classification. Ability to manoeuvre within the traffic
             stream is only slightly restricted. Stopped delays are not bothersome, and drivers
             generally are not subject to appreciable tension.
C            Traffic operations are stable. However, mid-block maneuverability may be more
             restricted than in LOS B. Longer queues, adverse signal coordination, or both may
             contribute to lower average travel speeds of about 50% of the average free-flow speed
             for the arterial classification. Motorists will experience some appreciable tension
             while driving.
D            Borders on a range where small increases in flow may cause substantial increases in
             approach delay and decreases in arterial speed. LOS D may be due to adverse signal
             progression, inappropriate signal timing, high volumes, or some combination of these
             factors. Average travel speeds are about 40% of the free-flow speed. For planning
             purposes, this level-of-service is the lowest that is considered acceptable.
E            Characterized by significant approach delays and average travel speeds of one-third
             or less of the free-flow speed. Typically caused by some combination of adverse
             progression, high signal density (more than two signalised intersections per mile),
             high volumes, extensive queuing, delays at critical intersections, and/or inappropriate
             signal timing.
F            Arterial flow at extremely slow speeds, below one-third to one-fourth of the free-flow
             speed. Intersection congestion is likely at critical signalised intersections, with high
             approach delays and extensive queuing. Adverse progression is frequently a
             contributor to this condition.

Average Daily Traffic Volumes
Average Daily Traffic (ADT) is a useful benchmark number for determining various roadway
configurations and design aspects. It represents the total number of vehicles that travel a defined
segment of roadway over a twenty-four hour period. The highest volume of traffic to pass over a
segment of roadway during an hour period is defined as the peak hour ADT, and is a useful
                                                                                      Community Development
                                                                                                           II-34
                                                                           Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                            General Plan/ Circulation Element
means of determining a roadway's capacity and level-of-service. In addition to the roadway
segment analysis provided by ADT, the focused analysis of intersections is an important tool in
determining the long-term operation for intersections, which are a critical component of the
roadway system.
Roadway Capacity
Roadway capacity is influenced by site-specific factors such as the number and configurations of
intersections, roadway grades, sight distance, percentage of truck and bus traffic, as well as the
degree of access control.
Intersection Capacity
Roadway capacity is most restricted by intersection design and operation. The level of service is
determined at intersections by the quality of traffic flow and the length of delays. The 2000
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM)1 methodology expresses the level of service at an intersection
in terms of delay time for the various intersection approaches. The procedures used to determine
levels of service vary with the type of intersection controls, including stop signs and signals.
Trip Distribution
Trip distribution is the directional orientation of traffic to and from a particular site. The
geographical location of a particular site in relation to residential developments, shopping centers
and places of employment has great influence on how traffic is distributed. Traffic distribution is
also significantly affected by the local and regional roadway network, which impacts decisions
about which routes to take to and from a development. The directional orientation of traffic
generated by build out of the General Plan can be projected by evaluating existing and planned
land uses, major roadways in the area, existing traffic patterns and volumes, the regional
roadway network, and through consultation with Town staff.
Trip Distribution and Assignment
The general directional characteristics of projected traffic flows are determined and given a
general distribution on the roadway network. Traffic is then assigned to specific streets, whether
currently existing or planned for construction. The character of the trips generated, distribution
characteristics, and existing and planned roadways that will serve the planning area are all
considered in trip assignment.

Trip Generation
Trip generation rates are based on data collected by the Institute of Transportation Engineers
(ITE).2 Trip generation represents the amount of traffic that is attracted to a site or that is
produced by the development that occurs there. Trip generation estimates for the Town of Apple
Valley have been calculated using the trip generation model from the Apple Valley Traffic
Model (AVTM) and have been calibrated to reflect conditions in the Town.
A functional efficiency that may temper the trip generation of a particular project is the “internal
capture” of trips within a project site, trips that would otherwise end up on area roadways.
Internal capture is the reduction in overall traffic volumes due to the compatible and
complementary mix of land uses within a project site or in adjacent areas.
CURRENT CONDITIONS
Circulation Network
The Town of Apple Valley currently (2008) includes approximately 500 miles of paved roads.
The roadway system is established on a one-mile grid, and about 80% of all the roads in Town
are local streets that serve existing residential neighborhoods.
The roadway system in Town has developed based on six roadway classifications that are used
as a standard for all roads within the Town boundary. This Circulation Element adds a new
seventh classification for Collector roads, which is further described under “Traffic and
Circulation Planning for General Plan Build Out,” below.
Existing Traffic Volumes
Roadway segments throughout Town have been evaluated to determine their current operating
conditions. As described below, volume-to-capacity ratios of 0.80 or less represent acceptable
traffic flow. Volume-to-capacity ratios between 0.81 and 1.00 generally indicate that the
roadway is near capacity and vehicles encounter congestion. Table II-7 describes the existing
roadway segments, the type of roadway, the average daily traffic volumes, the roadway capacity,
the volume-to-capacity ratios and the resulting daily traffic threshold.

Existing Transit Service
The Victor Valley Transit Authority (VVTA) operates a total of 16 bus routes throughout the
region, three of which operate regularly in Apple Valley. The three dedicated routes include
Route 40 (Apple Valley North), Route 41 (Apple Valley/Victorville), and Route 43 (Apple
Valley/Victor Valley College).
Truck Routes
San Bernardino County has identified two types of truck routes: National Network and Terminal
Access. The U.S. I-15 Freeway is considered part of the National Network. State Route 18 is
identified as a Terminal Access route. Terminal Access routes allow travel by trucks meeting
Surface Transportation Assistance Act3 standards between National Network routes and access
to an operating, destination, origination or handling facility. In addition to the regional truck
routes defined by the County of San Bernardino, the Town of Apple Valley has also identified
several key truck routes, including Corwin Road, Navajo Road, Yucca Loma Road, and Apple
Valley Road.
Transportation Programs and Plans
Traffic system planning in Apple Valley is not only affected by the Town’s own policies and
programs, but also by policies of other jurisdictions and regional planning agencies, including:

       The County of San Bernardino Congestion Management Plan (CMP), a State mandated
        program which is designed to promote effective growth management, and link
        transportation planning to land use and air quality issues.
       The County of San Bernardino General Plan Network, which provides the policy
        framework for lands under the County’s jurisdiction, and establishes roadway standards
        throughout the unincorporated County area.
       The Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), prepared by the Southern California
        Association of Governments (SCAG) to address transportation planning throughout its
        region, including San Bernardino County.
       The Victor Valley Area Transportation Study (VVATS), currently (2008) being prepared
        to identify long term regional roadway system needs in the Victor Valley.
       The High Desert Corridor (E-220), a joint project of San Bernardino County, Victorville,
        Apple Valley, SanBAG and the California Department of Transportation (CalTrans),
        which is planned to bisect Apple Valley, and ultimately provide access between the
        Victor Valley and Antelope Valley to the west.
       The Interstate 15/Nisqually Road Interchange, which is proposed by Victorville as a new
        east-west connection to the Interstate 15 freeway.
       Measure I, which was adopted and is being implemented throughout San Bernardino
        County as a ½ cent sales tax, earmarked specifically for regional roadway improvement
        projects. In Apple Valley, 65% of the sales tax generated by Measure I is applied to
        regional roadways, 30% to local roadways, and 5% to transit projects.
       SB 375 Sustainable Communities Strategies, adopted in 2008, which require that regional
        transportation agencies reduce vehicle miles traveled on RTP roadways through land use
        planning strategies which incorporate sustainable growth and reduce air emissions.
Local Programs
The Town is currently (2008) working on major transportation programs within its boundaries.
These include the widening of State Route 18 from the Narrows to Tao Road, to improve the
Apple Valley Road/State Route 18 intersection, and reduce traffic into Town in the evening rush
hour; the construction of the Yucca Loma Bridge, which will result in a four lane bridge and an
additional crossing over the Mojave River into Victorville; and the recently completed widening
portions of of Apple Valley Road to its ultimate cross section.
                                                                             Community Development

TRAFFIC AND CIRCULATION PLANNING FOR GENERAL PLAN BUILD OUT
A traffic study and associated model were prepared to analyze the impacts of the land use map
on the Town’s street system. 4 The circulation system is an integral part of the General Plan and
effective distribution of traffic is essential. The traffic study identified potential deficiencies in
the Town’s network of roadways, and proposed future improvements to assure the smooth flow
of traffic. The traffic analysis is summarized below and described fully in the General Plan EIR,
to which it is attached in entirety as an appendix.
The traffic study evaluated the Apple Valley road network by developing and analyzing long-
range future traffic volume forecasts for the study area. The Apple Valley Traffic Model
(AVTM) was developed for this purpose, by disaggregating and refining the Victorville Traffic
Analysis Model (VTAM). The basis for both the AVTM and VTAM is the Victor Valley Area
Transportation Study (VVATS) sub-regional model.
The traffic model divided the planning area into Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs). Each
component contained data on the land use in that zone, and the traffic which that land use would
generate. Once the traffic model TAZs were assigned and their land use trip generation
calculated, the trips were distributed on the roadway system.
The traffic modeling considered both intersection impacts and street segment impacts. Impacts
at intersections were analyzed for morning and evening peak hours (the hour in the morning or
evening when the highest concentration of trips occurs, primarily controlled by commuter trips),
while street segments were analyzed for average daily trips (ADT). A total of 46 intersections
were analyzed. The resultant data indicated what size of street would be required to allow
smooth flow of traffic, and identified where the existing street system would not function
effectively. The study set forth a range of recommended improvements that would enable the
street system to function effectively.
Street Cross Sections
The analysis in the traffic study also resulted in refinements to the Town’s roadway classification
descriptions, as well as the creation of a new roadway classification, the Collector road. Each of
the roadway classifications is described below, and depicted in Exhibit II-5.
Major Divided Parkway: This classification has a minimum 142-foot right-of-way. This roadway
type includes a 20 foot median and 15 foot parkways on each side of the roadway, as well as
three lanes of traffic in each direction, bike or parking lanes in each direction, curb, gutter and
sidewalk.
Major Divided Arterials: This roadway classification connects freeways to major and secondary
arterials. Major Divided Arterials have a minimum 128-foot right-of-way, including six traffic
lanes, two ten-foot bike or parking lanes, a twelve-foot wide center left turn lane or median, curb,
gutter and sidewalk.

Major Roads: This classification requires a minimum 104-foot right-of-way, including four
traffic lanes, two bike or parking lanes, a twelve-foot wide center left turn lane or median, curb,
gutter and sidewalk.
Secondary Roads: Secondary roads connect Major Roads to local streets. They have a minimum
right-of-way of 88 feet, including two travel lanes in each direction, and a bike or parking lane.
Secondary Roads may not be required to include curbs and gutters in low-density residential
areas, but are required to do so in industrial areas such as the North Apple Valley Industrial
Specific Plan.
Collector Streets: This new classification allows for a 66 foot right of way, to contain one lane of
travel in each direction, a bike or parking lane, and a 10 to 11 foot wide parkway. Collector
streets will not include a center turn lane or median.
Local Industrial/Commercial Streets: This classification requires a right of way of 66 feet,
accommodates the increased trip generation associated with industrial areas, and the turning
radius needed by delivery trucks. Local Industrial/Commercial Streets transport local traffic from
commercial and industrial areas to higher volume, higher speed roadways.
Local Streets: Local streets have a 60-foot right-of-way with two traffic lanes, parking lanes in
each direction, curbs and gutters. Sidewalks may be provided within the 10-foot, non-paved
right-of-way. Most of the streets in residential neighborhoods throughout the Town are
designated as Local Streets.

The General Plan Street System map, Exhibit II-6, shows the functional classification of roads
within the Town at build out of the General Plan. The map reflects the land use pattern
contained in the Land Use Element, the roadway classifications previously implemented by the
Town, and the land use and circulation plans of surrounding jurisdictions, including the City of
Victorville and the County of San Bernardino. It includes the assignment of a new roadway
classification, Collector roadway, to the Town’s hierarchy of roads, in order to enhance the
circulation network. In addition, existing and future roadways have been reclassified in the
northerly part of the Town to provide needed parallel capacity to key north-south routes. These

Future Traffic Volumes
Based on the land use distribution presented on the Land Use Map for build out of the Town, the
Apple Valley Traffic Model (AVTM) estimated the number of trips that would be generated on
the Town’s principal roadways. This analysis resulted in the build out trip generation depicted in
Table II-8, below.

Intersection Analysis
Because intersections are generally the most constrained locations within the street systems,
service levels at these points are of the highest concern. The level of service is characterized by
the quality of traffic flow and the length of delays. The procedures used to determine levels of
service vary with the type of intersection controls, including signs and signals. Table II-9
quantifies LOS based on the number of seconds a vehicle is delayed in the intersection.

          The traffic model estimated intersection operations at 46 locations, during the morning and
          evening peak hour, to determine the level of service that would result at these intersections at
          General Plan build out. The results of this analysis are depicted in Table II-10, below. The Table
          includes listings of the roadway improvements needed to assure that adequate capacity is
          achieved at General Plan build out, as well as the ultimate volume to capacity ratio and level of
          service.

achieved. Exhibit II-7 indicates where intersection peak hour volumes approach capacity.
Transportation Demand Management
The continued urbanization and growth of the Victorville-Apple Valley region will generate
increased demand for transportation and require effective transportation systems management to
preserve and increase available roadway capacity. Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
requires the development and implementation of policies, plans and programs that result in the
use of a wider range of transportation alternatives, including public transit and bicycles. A TDM
can include alternative travel modes, such as carpooling, van pooling and mass transit. In
addition, employee flex-time work schedules that reduce peak hour travel and associated traffic
congestion may also be considered.

ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION
Pedestrian, Equestrian and Bicycle Circulation
The General Plan supports planning that allows and enhances access to schools, commercial
services, and places of employment and recreation without the essential use of motorized
vehicles. In this regard, master planning sidewalks, bike lanes, and off-street trails is especially
important along major roadways in the community. New development should be required to
provide separate paths for bicycles, equestrians, and pedestrians wherever possible to ensure
safety and avoid conflicts. Connectivity should be a primary goal of residential design and
should emphasize easy accessibility within and between neighborhoods, schools, places of
employment, commercial services, and recreational facilities to maximize the opportunities for
pedestrian, bicycle and equestrians. This planning focus will also help to shorten vehicle trips
for residents who must use their automobiles.
Multi-Use Trails and Bikeways
An interlinked network of bikeways and pathways within an urban environment encourages the
use of alternative means of transport and healthy physical activity, while a trails system connects
the urban and natural environments by facilitating access to natural open spaces. A well-
connected network of bikeways and pathways that is effectively integrated with the urban
environment enables residents and visitors to bike or walk to any destination in Town, and it also
promotes a sense of community, by encouraging people to interact and enjoy local amenities.
Bikeways, pedestrian and equestrian paths and trails are an important community resource and
recreational opportunity that reduce the need for the private car, contribute to a healthier urban
environment and promote a sense of community.
Bikeways and Multi-Use Trails in the planning area are also discussed in the Parks and
Recreation Section of the General Plan, the Recreation Trails Plan for Apple Valley, and the
Town of Apple Valley Master Plan Strategies for Parks and Facilities. The Recreation Trails
Plan is shown on Exhibit II-9. It consists of Lifeline Trails for equestrian use and multi-use,
along with recorded bridle trails. Multi-use trails are used for walking, bicycle riding, horseback
riding, and “for any other device moved by human propulsion”. Motorized vehicles are
prohibited, except authorized maintenance, utility, law enforcement and emergency vehicles.

Bicycle Facilities
Bicycle lanes are shown in Exhibit II-10. Three types of bicycle lanes are proposed in Town, as
described in the Parks and Recreation Element. Bicycle lanes have been expanded to insure
greater connectivity and access throughout the community, and promote non-motorized modes of
travel. Bicycles lanes in Town are also designed to connect to regional bikeways, and the Town’s
continued coordination with the City of Victorville and San Bernardino County will be essential
in the ultimate development of an effective regional bikeway system.
California has established three types of bicycle lanes:
       Class I Bikeway – provide a separate, paved right-of-way for bicycle travel, outside the
        roadbed, but within the right of way.
       Class II Bikeway – provide a striped and stenciled lane for one-way travel on a street or
        highway.
       Class III Bikeway –are unmarked routes identified only by signage, which allow shared
        travel with pedestrians and motor vehicles.
It is important to recognize that all public roadways, except where prohibited, are open to travel
by bicycle. Freeways and freeway ramps are the only roadways in Apple Valley where bicycle
travel is prohibited.

As described above, some bicycle routes have been changed from Class I to Class II in this
Circulation Element. The change generally applies to roadways with high volumes, near freeway
access points, in order to limit the potential for conflicts at freeway on and off ramps.
                                                                                 Community Development

                                                                        General Plan/ Circulation Element
Sidewalks
When considering future development, pedestrian and bicycle accommodation and safety should
be given emphasis equal to that currently given to automobile access. Traffic levels on major
roadways and secondary roadways present hazards for pedestrians and sidewalks will be
included on both sides of the right of way. Sidewalks on local, neighborhood roadways may not
always be necessary however, particularly in established neighborhoods where roadways have
been developed to their ultimate right-of-way and the addition of sidewalks would impact front
yards and affect the character of the neighborhood.
Pedestrian Crossings
The California Vehicle Code states that a crosswalk implicitly exists on every leg at every
intersection, but that the reality of pedestrian travel is such that visibility and safety play
important roles in determining where people will attempt to cross a street.
Public Transportation
Public transit is a critical component of the Town’s future growth, and the maintenance and
enhancement of its quality of life. Use of public transit reduces private vehicle trips on Town and
area roadways, thereby reducing emissions from vehicles. Public transit can also be effective in
lowering the number of trips that will be generated by the Town’s employment centers, including
the commercial districts on Bear Valley Road, and the North Apple Valley Industrial Specific
Plan area. Public transit also promotes walkable neighborhoods, since transit stops are generally
located on larger streets, and transit users must walk to the bus stop from their neighborhood.
Improving transit opportunities in Apple Valley will expand residents’ transportation choices,
and allow them to put less emphasis on the personal automobile, thereby minimizing the need for
roadway improvements and improving overall traffic flow.
As previously noted, the Victor Valley Transit Authority (VVTA) presently operates a total of 16
bus routes throughout the region, three of which operate regularly in Apple Valley. The three
dedicated routes in the Planning Area include Route 40 (Apple Valley North), Route 41 (Apple
Valley/Victorville), and Route 43 (Apple Valley/Victor Valley College). The fixed route system
can be augmented through Route Deviation or Point Deviation, which is an allowance to pick up
or drop off transit riders within three-quarter miles of a fixed bus stop. This system is particularly
effective in less dense areas, where the need for service may be limited, and not justify an
extension to an existing route.
Apple Valley will rely on the regional services provided by VVTA to operate transit services
within the Town. Because of this dependence, regional cooperation is crucial to ensure that the
transit network operates effectively. Collaboration with VVTA is needed to ensure the ongoing
operation and expansion of fixed route bus and demand responsive systems. In addition, facility
needs should be incorporated into development proposals allowing for joint use of parking
facilities, construction of bus stops as part of a development’s off-site improvements, and as a
component of Transportation Demand Management programs for large employers.
Proposed public transportation routes in Apple Valley shown on Exhibit II-11. Future on-road
transit routes are anticipated to provide additional connectivity throughout the northern parts of
the Town, in particular. Transit routes are shown for each crossing of the High Desert Corridor,

Major Utility Corridors
The need for utility corridors in Town is generally met through the provision of easements in or
adjacent to Town streets and along common lot lines. Major corridors and easements for the
transport of natural gas, electricity, communications, domestic water and sewage, and storm
drainage form important components of the Circulation Element. Future land use planning,
including the development of subdivisions and the processing of development applications, will
require coordination between the Town, developers, utility companies, and other service
providers to ensure the availability and provision of easements and rights of way for the
extension of roads, utility lines, and public services. Utility corridors are discussed in detail in
the Water, Wastewater and Utilities Element as well as the Public Buildings and Facilities
Element.
                                                                              Community Development
                                                                                                   II-73
                                                                        Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Sustainable transportation networks are designed to improve the balance between environmental
concerns, community objectives, and performance (mobility and safety). In Apple Valley, a
sustainable transportation system can be advanced by focusing on the following objectives:
       Network connectivity (more than one route between land uses wherever possible);
       Operational balance (flexibility to achieve community objectives and place making
        without sacrificing safety and mobility);
       Emissions reduction / Energy Efficiency (prioritize designs which minimize idling times
        and vehicle miles traveled, help conserve resources and minimize waste);
       Pedestrian accommodations (walkways and bikeways fully integrated);
       Transit readiness (access to transit stops and effective interface of modes);
       Quality public space (roadways spatially defined with structures and landscaping).

PARKS AND RECREATION ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Parks and Recreation Element is intended to plan and provide for a diverse and integrated
parks and recreation system. An integrated recreation system that reflects and responds to the
needs of the community and the standards of the Town will create active and passive recreational
opportunities, while enhancing local amenities. Therefore, this Element includes an inventory of
existing parks, trails and recreational amenities, together with an evaluation of lands that have
potential for integration into the system. Implementation strategies and possible funding sources
for the construction of future parks and trails are also provided. This Element also discusses the
further development of a comprehensive bikeways and trails system, which present additional
recreational opportunity and amenity value.
The goals, policies and programs set forth in the Parks and Recreation Element consider and
respond to the needs of the Town. Lands that occur within Parks District boundary and outside
the Town boundaries are also considered, to as to ensure the planning and provision of adequate
parkland and recreational space.
BACKGROUND
The Parks and Recreation Element relates directly to the Land Use Element of the General Plan
and it is also linked to several other elements. Trails and open recreational areas are discussed as
components of open space in the Open Space and Conservation Element. Bicycle and equestrian
trails are included as alternative means of transportation in the Circulation Element.
In        accordance        with
Government Code 65560, this
Parks and Recreation Element
includes discussion of areas
particularly suited for parks
and recreational uses, as well
as considering areas that
could effectively provide
links or corridors between
recreational        components.
Section 65561 affirms the
primary       importance       of
parkland to the maintenance
of the economy of the state, as
well as its essential role in the
provision of land for the
appreciation of scenic beauty and recreation. In accordance with Sections 66477 and 66479,
local governments may require park site dedications, or fees in lieu of dedication, based upon
                                                                                 Community Development
                                                                                                     II-79
                                                                        Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                               General Plan/ Parks and Recreation Element
existing and projected population figures and General Plan land use designations. Section
65302(a) includes recreational uses as within the range of land uses that are normally included in
a Land Use Element. Finally, Section 5076 of the Public Resources Code establishes that the
General Plan shall consider the designation of trails as part of its open space plan.
PARKS
Well-designed and maintained parks and recreational facilities are multi-functional spaces that
make a fundamental contribution to a community’s sense of place. Parklands form an interface
between the built and natural environments, providing public gathering places and both active
and passive recreational opportunities. A principal feature of a major public park is an
uninterrupted expanse of landscaped open space, supported by essential amenities, and it may
also include areas for organized sports areas and structures to house recreational facilities.
Parks enhance and soften the built environment and permeate developed areas, offering traffic-
free open spaces and relief from dense urban settings to residents and visitors. Public parks
should be well connected within the community to encourage consistent use, and designed in an
orderly and inviting manner that incorporates safety features. Effective design will provide a
wide range of amenities and accommodate a diversity of complementary activities that facilitate
extended periods of active use.
Parks Classifications
Parks in the Town of Apple Valley are divided into four categories.
Tot Lots, Mini Parks, or Pocket Parks
These small parks are modest open spaces situated in residential, business, commercial or office
areas and they provide public space for rest, relaxation and socializing. They are a popular
component of high-density residential areas and new housing developments, where they are
sometimes known as ‘tot lots’ or ‘sitting parks’, and provide a place for family socialization.
Mini parks range between 0.5 and three acres in size; the location and function of the particular
park generally determine the amenities and facilities provided. However, most parks of this size
usually include shade trees, tables and barbeques, exercise and play equipment.
Neighborhood Parks
Parks within this category function as a social hub in the immediate locality and they are usually
located within walking or bicycling distance of residential areas. They are a fundamental
component of the park system, providing an inviting, versatile public gathering place and
offering both active and passive recreational opportunities. Neighborhood parks are particularly
efficient in terms of both recreational use and man-hours for maintenance purposes due to their
size, scale and the facilities they typically include.
A typical neighborhood park usually provides restrooms and off-street parking, other amenities
oriented towards the recreational needs of children, and sports facilities and picnic areas. The
size of a neighborhood park is determined by the surrounding urban density and on availability
of land, but generally ranges from five to ten acres. It is essential that the principles of good
                                                                                 Community Development
                                                                                                     II-80

                                                                         Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                               General Plan/ Parks and Recreation Element
design are practiced and effective maintenance implemented, so that the park provides a safe,
inviting and versatile open space that facilitates social activity and the formation of a distinctive
sense of place.
A major use for neighborhood parks in Apple Valley is team practices for Little League baseball,
soccer, adult softball and flag football.
Community Parks/Athletic Fields
Community Parks provide inviting, versatile public gathering places and offer both active and
passive recreational opportunities, similar to those provided by the Neighborhood Park, although
on a larger scale and catering to all age groups. While still serving the local community, they
should be well connected and serve a wider area within a three to five mile radius. The optimal
size for such parks ranges from 20 to 50 acres. Additional amenities at Community Parks may
include facilities for larger and competitive sports events, as well as civic buildings or spaces for
community use.
School Parks
These are usually equivalent to neighborhood parks, but typically include additional sports
facilities. School parks consist of parks or playgrounds adjacent to, but separate from,
educational institutions. Establishing joint use agreements with school districts can greatly assist
the Town in meeting the demand for parklands.
Special Parklands
Special use lands vary considerably in size and in the amenities and facilities available. They are
typically linked to special events such as fairs, or specific uses such as skate boarding or
equestrian activities. They may be combined with other categories of parks and occupy a portion
of a larger area. Where they provide for activities that are incompatible with other uses, they
may be established in a remote area.
Park and Recreational Service Provider
In 2001, the Town of Apple Valley took responsibility for the Apple Valley Park and Recreation
District. The Town offers a comprehensive, year round recreation program providing leisure time
activities to all segments of the Apple Valley population. The Town offers programs designed
for physically and mentally challenged children, adult athletic leagues, family activities, puppet
theater, toddler and pre-school activities, as well as youth activities and athletics.
Existing Park Facilities
Within the Town of Apple Valley and associated Sphere of Influence there are presently seven
Mini-Parks, two Neighborhood Parks, three Community Parks and two Special Use Parks. Table
II-11 lists these parks.
Exhibit II-12 shows the locations of existing and future parks in the Town of Apple Valley.

                                                                       General Plan/ Parks and Recreation Element
Other Recreational Facilities
In addition to the parks listed above, the Town has an additional recreational facility at the Hall
Recreation Center, located to the east side of the Town Hall, at 14955 Dale Evans Parkway. The
Center includes activity rooms, kitchen facilities, meeting rooms, and restrooms. Regularly
scheduled programs and classes are held at the Recreation Center, including dance classes,
martial arts classes, arts and crafts classes, pre-school classes, and guitar lessons.
In November 2008, the Town Council announced that the Town will purchase the Apple Valley
Country Club, pending resolution of water rights issues. The 148.8-acre facility, which include
an 18-hole golf course, lighted tennis courts, a pool, pro shop, sports bar, lounges and locker
rooms, meeting and dining rooms and a banquet facility, will be open to the public.
Future Parks
The Apple Valley Parks and Recreation Services Master Plan identifies a need for the
development of additional Community Parks and Neighborhood Parks throughout the Town. The
need for further neighborhood parks in particular is stimulated by continued residential
development in the area.
The Town of Apple Valley has two parks proposed as part of approved Specific Plans, which are
not yet developed: the Bridle Path park will be 5 acres, and the North Pointe park will be 60
acres.
In addition to the existing and proposed parks described above, the Town owns 27.0 acres5 of
undeveloped lands planned for use as parklands.
At build out of future parks facilities, the Town will include 438.87 acres of developed
parklands.
Parks Planning and the Parks Master Plan
The Parks and Recreation Services Master Plan is an essential component in the planning and
design of the Town’s parks and recreational facilities. It is based on a local needs analysis that
takes into account the particular demographics of the Town’s residents and visitors. Such a plan
identifies where parks are needed, establishes standards and policies for meeting the desired
conditions, as well as considering and responding to community needs. The plan must also allow
sufficient flexibility to respond to present and future opportunities and constraints.
Standards adopted from such sources as the Urban Land Institute, National Recreation and Park
Association (NRPA) Standards, and the American Society of Landscape Architects are included
in the park master plan and typically regulate the distribution, size and service radii of the area’s
parks.

    Vacant parklands not associated with Specific Plans include the Standing Rock site (20.0 acres); Sitting Bull
    site (2.0 acres) and the Dale Evans/Stoddard Road site (5.0 acres).
                                                                                         Community Development

Through the provisions of Government Code Section 66477 and the Quimby Act, a local
government may adopt an ordinance requiring the dedication of land or the payment of fees for
park and recreational purposes. The powers are specifically directed towards the provision of
parks and recreational areas and are applied as a condition of approval to a proposed tract or
parcel map, as well as to non-subdivision development such as apartment complexes. The
amount of land dedicated, or fees paid, is based on intended residential densities. Quimby Act
fees can be used for the purchase of land for park and recreational use, but not for maintenance
or improvement of existing parks. The Town presently allows the following:
               In lieu fees for parks under 1 acre
               Staff discretion of in lieu fees or deductions for parks of 1 to 2.5 acres
               Dedication is required for parks of 2.5 acres or more.
In its Master Plan Strategies for Parks and Facilities1, the Town of Apple Valley identifies a
range of elements crucial to the maintenance and future development of its parks and recreational
facilities. The document is intended to be a flexible planning tool to guide the future growth and
development of park and recreation services in the Town and Sphere of Influence. It delineates a
number of individual Recreation Service Areas to more effectively identify future park
development sites, and discusses the redefinition of the role of several parks and the
revitalization of others. The provision of additional facilities and the enhancement of existing
amenities at many of the Town’s parks are supported, together with the need for effective
maintenance and safety measures. The Master Plan acknowledges that park signage has been
inadequate in the past and describes the benefits of a legible signage system.
Land Acquisition and Funding Mechanisms
Funding for the acquisition of additional parks and recreational areas may pose difficulties, and
the Town may have, as a result of the last economic boom, been priced out of the land
acquisition market. In addition to the Quimby Act, other legislation and statewide programs can
facilitate parkland financing.

Development agreements are contracts between the Town and a developer that identify the
responsibilities of each party and assure the developer the right to subdivide and develop, subject
to negotiated exactions, which can include parks or park fees.
Development Impact Fees. Although limited in application, Park Facility fees may be applied to
all land uses on the basis that residents, workers, shoppers and visitors use local parks and
recreational facilities. However the fee applies only to new development and may be assessed for
new capital costs related to the new development, where a defined beneficiary relationship to
cost can be established.
In addition to the above mechanisms, which result directly from specific project development,
other funding sources may accrue from individual projects and include:
               Adopt-A-Park
               Benefit Assessment District
               Concessions
               Franchising commercial recreation facilities
               General and Limited Obligation Bonds
               Homeowners Associations
               Joint Powers Agreements
               Mello Roos Districts
               Municipal lease-purchase
               Redevelopment Agency Funding and Special Tax Revenues
               User fees
Park Development and Funding Mechanisms
Development of parkland already in the possession of the Town may be funded through various
federal and state programs and legislation.
Community Development Block Grants. CDBG is a federal program to facilitate the development
of viable urban communities and the Town should identify its programming and funding
priorities. With some restrictions, projects for which funds may be allocated include economic
development, public services and the acquisition, rehabilitation or construction of various public
works facilities.
Land and Water Conservation Fund Grants provide assistance to state and local jurisdictions in
the preparation of Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plans (SCORPS). The fund is a
federal program to provide for the acquisition and development of outdoor, public recreation
areas and facilities. Funds allocated to California are administered by the State Liaison Officer
(SLO), who is the Director of the State Department of Parks and Recreation. The California
Department of Parks and Recreation, Office of Grants and Local Services, processes applications
for these grants.
Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Program provides matching grant funds (50%
federal/50% local) for the development of local park and recreation system recovery plans.
Rehabilitation Grant funds (70% federal/30% local) are for the purpose of rebuilding,
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                    II-88

                                                                      Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                             General Plan/ Parks and Recreation Element
remodeling or expanding existing facilities. Innovation Grants (70% federal/30% local) are
intended to cover the costs of personnel, facilities, equipment, supplies and services that
demonstrate innovative and cost effective ways to enhance park and recreation opportunities at
neighborhood level.
Further legislation has been enacted by the State of California to assist local jurisdictions in the
acquisition and development of parkland.
Proposition 40; California Clean Water, Clean Air, Safe Neighborhood Parks and Coastal
Protection Act. This legislation funds two resource Bonds to fund park improvements and
enhance recreational programs:
        - State Urban Parks and Healthy Communities Program
        - Youth Soccer and Recreation Development Program
The Urban Park Act of 2001 finances the acquisition and development of parks, recreation areas
and facilities in neighborhoods that are currently under-provided with park and recreation
opportunities.
Funding for Park Maintenance
The long-term maintenance costs of parks in the Town of Apple Valley and the Sphere of
Influence are provided for through General Fund expenditure. The Town has been investigating
alternative funding sources, including assessment districts and similar funding mechanisms.
TRAILS, PATHS AND BIKEWAYS
An inter-connected network of bikeways and pathways within an urban environment encourages
the use of alternative means of transport and healthy physical activity, while a trails system
connects the urban and natural environments by facilitating access to natural open spaces. A
well designed network of bikeways and pathways that effectively links the various elements of
the urban environment enables residents and visitors to bike or walk to any destination in Town,
and promotes a sense of community, by encouraging people to interact and enjoy local amenities.
Bikeways, paths and trails are an important community resource and recreational opportunity
that reduce the need for automobiles, contribute to a healthier urban environment and promote a
sense of community.
The Recreation Trails Plan for Apple Valley provides a framework for future planning and
development of trails throughout the Town. The plan addresses the demands for recreation while
preserving and enhancing the existing rural environment. The Town currently has a bicycle path
system and an equestrian “multi-use” trail system.
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                                   II-89

                                                                      Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                             General Plan/ Parks and Recreation Element
Bikeways
The system of bicycle paths is intended to complement the Recreational Trails Plan and provide
safe bicycle access to all existing and planned school sites. (Please see Exhibit II-10, Town of
Apple Valley Parks & Recreation: Bike Paths). The Plan includes development standards that
illustrate where road improvements should include bicycles as part of the typical section. The
recent widening of Apple Valley Road resulted in the construction of an off-road bicycle path
along a portion of the widened roadway, allowing access to the shopping areas on Bear Valley
Road.
                                                      Three classifications of bikeways are
                                                      recognized in urban areas:
                                                      A Class I bikeway is often combined with
                                                      a pedestrian pathway and it is entirely
                                                      separate from the roadway or highway.
Class II bikeways provide a restricted
right-of-way within the paved section
of a roadway, with through travel by
motorists or pedestrians prohibited,
while permitting cross traffic by
motorists or pedestrians. The
bikeway comprises a signed and
striped lane within the paved area of
a street.
                                                       Class III bikeways are designated but
                                                       unmarked bike routes located on the
                                                       street, but not separated from vehicular
                                                       traffic.
The proposed bike path system in Apple Valley is shown on Exhibit II-10 in the Circulation
Element.
Bicycle Parking
The provision of secure bicycle parking facilities at appropriate locations on designated
bikeways is an integral part of an effective bikeway plan. All public buildings and commercial
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                                   II-90
                                                                        Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                               General Plan/ Parks and Recreation Element
developments accessed by bike paths should provide accessible and safe bicycle parking racks or
stands to encourage the use of bikes as an alternative method of transport.
Hiking and Equestrian Trails (Multi-Use Trails)
Hiking and equestrian trails are a valuable recreational resource that offer many benefits to the
community and connect the urban and natural environments. Hiking trails offer physically and
spiritually rewarding recreational opportunities by providing access to adjacent natural areas that
allow people to appreciate natural resources and open spaces.
The Recreation Trails Plan for Apple Valley provides a framework for future planning and
development of trails throughout the Town. The trails system consists of three categories:
       Multi-Use Primary or Lifeline Trails that connect with the trails systems of adjacent
         jurisdictions and form the backbone of the trails network.
       Secondary Trails form the principal horse-riding network within the Town and may also
         be for multi-purpose use.
       Feeder Trails are provided to the rear of single family residential lots and they are
         exclusively for equestrian use. Many of these trails are combined with utility easements.
         The trails form an interconnecting grid with the primary and secondary trails systems.
The trails system will include a number of rest stops; the Trails Plan proposes inter-connecting
the Apple Valley system to recreation trails within adjacent jurisdictions. Overall, the Trails
Plan provides for a comprehensive network of Town-wide equestrian/recreational trails that will
promote a continued rural lifestyle in the Town of Apple Valley.
Trail System Costs
The cost of acquiring land for trail purposes varies according to the value of lands for other uses
and existing rights-of-way. Costs, including acquisition, trail construction and ongoing
maintenance can be considerable and may be quite variable over time based on these and other
factors. It is therefore important to secure the use of appropriate and cost-free easements from
public and private landowners whenever possible. Construction costs are generally estimated on
a per mile basis, and may be higher for a paved trail than for an unpaved trail based on the types
of materials used. Other costs include those directly related to facilities such as signage, parking
lots, bridges and wash crossings, landscaping, fencing and rest stations,
Funding Programs and Mechanisms
Several funding mechanisms and other methods are available to assist with securing rights of
way and the costs of trail construction and maintenance. The options include Adopt-a-Trail
programs, developer impact fees, dedication of easements and rights of way, granted
conservation easements, the Local Transportation Fund and the use of donated labor and
materials.
The proposed Recreation Trail System is shown on Exhibit II-9 in the Circulation Element.
                                                                                 Community Development

                                                                        Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The Town has adopted the Park Standards of the National Recreational Park Association, which
require 5 acres of parkland per 1,000 persons. In 2007, the Town of Apple Valley was estimated
to have a population of 70,297 and based on these standards, the Town should have a total of
351.5 acres of parkland. Including both developed and undeveloped but planned parklands, the
Town has approximately 438.8 acres identified for parks, which exceeds the National
Recreational Park Association standard. In future, however, to serve the build out General Plan
population and meet its adopted park standard, the Town will need to acquire additional lands for
park use and allocate resources for further park and recreational facilities development. Joint use
agreements could be pursued to both reduce the financial burden of new facilities and to expand
the use of existing private facilities.
As the Town continues to develop, so too will parks in order to keep pace with community
growth. The Town will need to maintain an active acquisition program to assure that parkland is
available for the future.

HOUSING ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Housing Element provides the Town direction in the distribution of housing throughout the
community. Of particular concern to the Town is the provision of housing which is affordable to
all its residents, both now and in the future. Apple Valley has traditionally been a residential
community with a focus on rural character and quality of life. This Housing Element includes
goals, policies and programs to assure that the Town’s character and quality of life are available
to all residents.
BACKGROUND
The Housing Element works hand in hand with the Land Use Element, by assuring that adequate
lands are available to provide housing for the period from 2014 through 2021. Land use
designations are designed to accommodate all types of housing, to allow for the development of
single family and multi-family units to meet the needs of the Town’s residents, now and in the
future.
The Housing Element describes existing housing types, the condition of the existing housing
stock, overcrowding, overpayment, special housing needs, and the demand for affordable
housing in the Town. The Element also includes an analysis of the progress made since the
drafting of the last Housing Element, and projections of needs for the current planning period.
California Law
California Government Code requires that every City and County prepare a Housing Element as
part of its General Plan. In addition, State law contains specific requirements for the preparation
and content of Housing Elements. According to Article 10.6, Section 65580, the Legislature has
found that:
(1) The availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the early attainment of
    decent housing and a suitable living environment for every California family is a priority of
    the highest order.
(2) The early attainment of this goal requires the cooperative participation of government and the
    private sector in an effort to expand housing opportunities and accommodate the housing
    needs of Californians of all economic levels.
(3) The provision of housing affordable to low and moderate income households requires the
    cooperation of all levels of government.
(4) Local and state governments have a responsibility to use the powers vested in them to
    facilitate the improvement and development of housing to make adequate provision for the
    housing needs of all economic segments of the community.
(5) The legislature recognizes that in carrying out this responsibility, each local government also
    has the responsibility to consider economic, environmental, and fiscal factors and community
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                                   II-96

                                                                        Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                           General Plan/ Housing Element
     goals set forth in the General Plan and to cooperate with other local governments, and the
     state, in addressing regional housing needs.
Section 65581 of the Government Code states that the intent of the Legislature in enacting these
requirements is:
(1) To assure that local governments recognize their responsibilities in contributing to the
     attainment of the State housing goal.
(2) To assure that cities and counties prepare and implement housing elements which, along with
     federal and State programs, will move toward attainment of the State housing goal.
(3) To recognize that each locality is best capable of determining what efforts are required by it
     to contribute to the attainment of the State housing goal as well as regional housing needs.
(4) To ensure that each local government cooperates with other local governments to address
     regional housing needs.
Government Code Section 65583 outlines the required content of all housing elements including
identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs, and a statement of goals,
policies, quantified objectives, and scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement, and
development of housing. Specific requirements include the following:
(1) An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to the
     meeting of these needs. The analysis should include population and employment trends;
     documentation of household characteristics; inventory of land suitable for residential
     development; governmental and other constraints to new housing development; analysis of
     any special housing needs and an assessment of existing affordable housing developments.
(2) A program which sets forth a five-year schedule of actions the local government is
     undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the objectives of
     the housing element in order to meet the housing needs of all economic segments of the
     community.
Consistency with the General Plan
The Housing Element, as with all Elements of the General Plan, must be consistent with all other
Elements. The Town’s procedures for amendment of the General Plan are contained in Chapter
I., Introduction and Administration. The Town will continue to evaluate any amendment to the
General Plan, including updating of the Housing Element as required by State law, to assure that
internal consistency is maintained.
Evaluation of Existing Housing Element Policies and Programs
The Town’s Housing Element 2009 included a number of policies and “action” items to address
housing needs for the 2006-2014 planning period. The effectiveness of these policies and their
associated action items is reviewed below.
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                    II-97

                                                                     Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                       General Plan/ Housing Element
Policy 1.A
Ensure that new residential development conforms to the voter-approved Measure “N.”
Evaluation: The Town’s Measure N was re-affirmed by the voters in 2006 and will continue to
be implemented for all single-family land use designations.
Policy 1.B
Maintain a wide range of residential land use designations, ranging from very low density (1.0
dwelling unit per 5 acres) to medium density (4 to 20 dwelling units per acre) and mixed use (4
to 30 units per acre), on the Land Use Map.
                Action: Provide a range of residential development opportunities including
                locating higher density residential development near public transportation.
                Anticipated Impact: Accommodate Town’s estimated RHNA of over 3,000
                dwelling units
                Responsible Agency: Community Development Department
                Financing: Department Budget
                Schedule: Ongoing (2014-2021)
Evaluation: The Town’s General Plan maintained the same range of land use designations
throughout the previous planning period. The Mixed Use land use and zoning designations were
also added to the General Plan and Development Code, broadening the opportunities for
residential development at higher densities. This range allowed the construction of 465 single-
family homes, 4 second units, 45 condominiums/attached single-family homes, 46 apartments,
and 9 retirement/care living units. The Town’s land use designations have been effective in
allowing a range of housing types.
Policy 1.C
Encourage housing for special needs households, including the elderly, single parent households,
large households, the disabled and the homeless.
                Action: Promote development and financing of senior housing through density
                bonuses, reduced parking requirements, and other development incentives.
                Anticipated Impact: Two senior projects (minimum of 125 units); 10 second
                senior units (granny housing)
                Responsible Agency: Community Development Department
                Financing: Department budget
                Schedule: Ongoing 2014-2021
                Action: Process and approve requests for the establishment of residential care
                facilities, in accordance with Section 1566.3 of the Health and Safety Code, as
                means of providing long-term transitional housing for additional very low income
                persons.
                Anticipated Impact: Further establishment of residential care facilities to serve
                the population.
                Responsible Agency: Community Development
                                                                             Community Development
                                                                                                II-98

                                                                     Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                       General Plan/ Housing Element
               Financing: Department Budget
               Schedule: Ongoing
Evaluation: As stated above, there were 9 retirement/care units built for seniors in the Town
during the previous planning period. In addition, 245 units were built within the Del Webb/Pulte
project, which are all age restricted units. The project was reviewed expeditiously, and did not
require incentives for completion.
Evaluation: The Town enforces the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
for all construction projects. The Town will continue to implement these standards as new
projects are brought forward. On April 27, 2010, the Development Code was amended in
Ordinance No. 405 to state that handicapped ramps are permitted in the front, side or rear yard
setback of any residential structure. A reasonable accommodation procedure has also been
established to provide exceptions in zoning and land use for persons with disabilities. The
reasonable accommodation Ordinance No. 436 was adopted on June 26, 2012.
Evaluation: Second units are encouraged and regulations within the Development Code are
consistent with State law. The Town has updated its second unit requirements as State law has
changed, and currently enforces the latest requirements. There were 4 second units, and 3 guest
houses built during the previous planning period.
               Action: Development of housing projects for the elderly, low and moderate
               income housing shall be expedited. All fees shall be waived for shelters and
               transitional housing projects.
               Anticipated Impact: Renovations to an existing four-plex for transitional housing
               will receive funding through the NSP3 program and will have fees waived for
               development. Future housing projects of similar type will also have fees waived.

               Financing: Departmental budget
               Schedule: Ongoing
               Action: Support the efforts of non-profit organizations, private developers, and
               the County of San Bernardino Housing Authority to obtain State and/or Federal
               funds for the construction of affordable housing for extremely low, very low and
               low income households by writing letters of support, and expediting permit
               processing for projects requiring pre-approval of development projects.
               Anticipated Impact: There are four projects that should be developed within the
               next planning cycle that will house seniors and/or lower and extremely lower
               income households. Three of these projects are joint participation of the Town
               and private non-profit organizations and one is under the control of the County of
               San Bernardino Housing Authority. These projects would equate to a minimum of
               200 units.

                                                                                                II-99
                                                                     Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                       General Plan/ Housing Element
Evaluation: Due to the recent downturn in the economy and the dissolution of redevelopment,
the Town has not had the opportunity to process, through completion, an affordable housing
project. The Town partnered with the San Bernardino Housing Authority and began the process
for the approval of an 80-unit senior development. Fees were waived for the processing of the
project and the project received Planning Commission approval. The project was tabled due to
the inability to qualify for tax credits, which was required to make the project feasible for the
Housing Authority and the Town. The Town also entered into an agreement to construct an
affordable 50-unit family project which would have used Redevelopment Tax Increment set aside
funds. Due to the dissolution of redevelopment by the State legislature, the project has not
progressed and is held up due to the Department of Finance review.
The Town was able to partner with a private developer to complete the construction and sale of
34 townhomes. These abandoned townhomes were 80% complete and bank owned, due to the
down-turn of the housing market. The Town partnered with an approved CHDO developer and
used federal funding to make available 8 of these units to low-income qualified buyers. These
units qualified for federal low income regulations and covenants, but would not qualify for state
regulations, thus not allowing them to qualify as part of the Town’s RHNA obligation.
                Action: Maintain the Down Payment Assistance Program as a tool to increase
                affordable homeownership opportunities for low and moderate income persons.
                Anticipated Impact: In the previous cycle Down Payment Assistance was given
                to 106 qualified buyers for the purpose of home ownership.
                Responsible Agency: Community Development
                Financing: State and Federal Housing Grants and Department Budget
                Schedule: Ongoing
Evaluation: The Town has assisted 106 qualified low income buyers to purchase residences
within the Town during the last cycle. This project has been funded through CDBG, HOME,
CalHOME and NSP funding. This program will continue through the next Housing Element
cycle.
Policy 1.D
Continue to encourage mobile homes as an affordable housing option for all segments of the
community.
                Action: Facilitate placement of manufactured units on residential lots.
                Anticipated Impact: Conservation of the Town’s existing inventory of mobile
                home units.
                Responsible Agency: Community Development Department
                Financing: Department budget
                Schedule: 2014-2021
Evaluation: The Town’s Development Code continues to allow mobile homes and manufactured
housing in single-family residential zones. In the last planning period, the Town created a new
General Plan land use designation for mobile home parks as a way to conserve the existing
                                                                             Community Development
                                                                                               II-100

                                                                       Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                         General Plan/ Housing Element
inventory. The Town has limited jurisdiction over mobile home parks, but enforces code
compliance in the parks as it relates to life safety issues. There were 3 mobile homes installed as
primary residences during the previous planning period. In 2010, the Department of Finance
reports that there are a total of 1821 mobile homes in Apple Valley.
Policy 1.E
Affordable housing should be distributed throughout the community, and should blend with
existing neighborhoods
                Action: As projects are reviewed by staff, distribution of Low/Mod housing shall
                promoted to blend in with the existing residential neighborhoods and shall not be
                concentrated in any single area of the Town.
                Anticipated Impact: Integration of all income levels of housing throughout Town.

                Financing: Department budget
                Schedule: 2014-2021
Evaluation: Low/Mod housing is not concentrated in any single area of Town. The Town
continues to place Medium Density land use designations in areas where commercial, transit
and school facilities are located, in order to assure that such development have access to
transportation, jobs and services. Projects as they are proposed will continue to be considered
on this basis.
Policy 1.F
Permit childcare facilities in single-family and multi-family residential zones, as well as in
commercial and industrial areas where employment is concentrated.
                Action: Continue to promote the establishment of childcare facilities in the
                residential, commercial and industrial zones.
                Anticipated Impact: Adequate facilities for childcare throughout Town.
                Responsible Agency: Community Development Department
                Financing: Department budget
                Schedule: 2014-2021
Evaluation: The Development Code permits child care facilities in both large and small, in
multiple zones. The Town has also included childcare facilities as either an SUP or a CUP in its
North Apple Valley Industrial Specific Plan, adopted in 2006, to encourage these facilities at
what will be the Town’s largest employment center.
Policy 1.G
New residential development must assure the provision of infrastructure and public services.
                Action: Staff shall continue to review projects and identify the existing
                infrastructure system and the necessity to extend or improve upon the
                infrastructure to meet the needs of new development.

Evaluation: All projects are evaluated for their proximity to existing services. Development in
the Town has occurred in a well planned manner, with little “leap frog” development, primarily
due to the lack of infrastructure in outlying areas, and the cost of extending this infrastructure.
The Town will continue to encourage development which connects to existing facilities and
services.

 Evaluation: On July 13, 2010 the Town adopted a Climate Action Plan that was amended to
include implementation guidelines on December 14, 2010. In addition, the California Green
Building Code was adopted by the Town in January 2011. As projects are submitted for review,
they must comply with these regulations to promote energy conservation measures and a
reduction in the Town’s green house gas emissions. Assistance to comply with these regulations
is a qualifying project for the Town’s Residential Rehabilitation Program. Education materials
for energy efficiency opportunities are available to at the public counters of Town Hall.
Evaluation of the Climate Action Plan implementation is scheduled during this Housing Element
cycle.

The median housing unit value in 2010 was $170,500. For renters, the median contract rent at
that time was $1,012. Housing costs in Apple Valley in 2010 were therefore, affordable. 2010
housing values and rental rates are discussed below in the section titled “Economic
Constraints”.
SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
This section of the Housing Element quantifies households with special needs such as farm
workers, the homeless and the elderly living in Town. These households can have housing needs
which may be more difficult to address, and which require special attention.
Farm Workers
The American Community Survey reports workers by place of residence that have an occupation
in farming. The 2005-2009 Survey reports 59 farm workers within the Town of Apple Valley, 51
male and 8 female. In 2010, the Census identified that there were 215 persons employed in
“agriculture forestry, fishing, hunting and mining” in Town. However, the location of one mine
within Town limits, and another immediately northeast of Town limits, makes in likely that the
majority of these workers are in mining. Animal keeping and equestrian facilities occur in the
Deep Creek area, at the southern end of Town, but no significant crop farming occurs within
Town limits or in the immediate area.
Homeless, Transitional and Single Room Occupancy Housing
The County of San Bernardino Homeless Partnerships conducted a survey of homeless persons
in 2013. That survey counted homeless persons on the streets, in shelters, and at other locations,
to estimate the number of homeless persons in the County. There were a reported 2,321 adults,
and children who were homeless on a given day in San Bernardino County. In the Victor Valley
there were 352 reported homeless, with 292 of those in the neighboring city of Victorville, There
was only one homeless person reported in Apple Valley. Assuming that because the survey was
conducted on a cold January day, there may have been a few more homeless that could not be
located, due to seeking shelter in other locations.
                                                                            Community Development
                                                                                               II-112

                                                                     Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                        General Plan/ Housing Element
The 2010 Census reports 461 people living in group quarters and 161 people in non-
institutionalized group quarters. Three shelters are available in the adjacent city of Victorville:
two domestic violence shelters, High Desert Domestic Violence and Victor Valley Domestic
Violence shelters, which offer safe housing (a total of 44 beds) and services to women and their
children; and High Desert Homeless Services, which provides 55 beds, as well as support
services. In addition, a number of organizations, including Catholic Charities, Church of the
Valley, Feed My Sheep, High Desert Communities Food Bank and the Salvation Army provide
support services to the homeless in Apple Valley and the region.
Since the last update of the Housing Element in 2009 the Development Code was amended to
allow the development of shelters and transitional housing with approval of a Special Use Permit
in commercial zones. On November 8, 2011, Ordinance No. 425 was adopted to allow
emergency shelters and transitional housing to be located in a second Commercial Zone
(Commercial Village C-V) with an SUP. Emergency Shelters and transitional housing was
already permitted with an SUP in the Service Commercial (C-S) zone. After the adoption of the
2009 Housing Element, the Development Code was also amended under Ordinance No. 405 on
April 27, 2010, to include Single Room Occupancy facilities, Transitional Housing, and
Supportive Housing requiring a conditional use permit in residential locations. The entitlement
required is the same regulations that apply to other multi-family housing projects in the
residential zones. This amendment also included the allowance of emergency shelters,
transitional housing and supportive housing as an outright permitted use in the Industrial zone.
These amendments are consistent with the provisions of Government Code 65583. However, the
Town intends to make future changes to the Development Code as follows: The Transitional and
Supportive housing shall be considered a residential use and only subject to those restrictions
that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. These changes will be
made to the Development Code within the first year of this housing cycle.
There are currently more than 3,000 acres of vacant commercial land and more than 600 acres of
vacant industrial land in Town, indicating that there is more than enough land available for
homeless and transitional housing in Apple There are currently over 19,000 acres of vacant
residential land and with the vacant 600 acres of industrial land, mentioned above, there is
adequate land available for Single Room Occupancy facilities.
The Elderly
The 2010 Census identified 10,666 persons 65 years of age or older in Apple Valley. The Census
further identified that there were 7,636 households with one or more of the members of the
household being 65 years of age or older. Of the Town’s owner-occupied units, 5,522 consisted
of a householder of 65 years or age or older, while 1,151 renter-occupied units were occupied by
a householder of over 65.
The 2000 Community Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), determined that 31.5% of
persons over 65 were paying more than 30% of their income for housing.
Disabled Persons
The 2010 Census identified 8,410 persons in Town with disabilities, of which 3,238 were
persons over the age of 65.
                                                                             Community Development
                                                                                                II-113

                                                                        Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                          General Plan/ Housing Element
The California Building Code requires that all new multi-family construction include a
percentage of units accessible to persons with disabilities. The Town’s Building Department
requires compliance with these standards as part of the Building Permit review and inspection
process, as does every other community in the country. The Town has no requirements which
would constrain the development of housing for disabled persons – housing for disabled persons,
whether in a group setting, apartment or condominium project, or a single family home, is not
considered any differently than housing for any other member of the community. There are no
requirements for concentration of residential care facilities; no site planning requirements that
constrain housing for persons with disabilities; the Development Code defines family consistent
with the federal definition, as one or more individuals in a household; and no parking
requirements for any and all housing types that serve persons with disabilities. In order to
accommodate reasonable accommodation, a program has also been added to this Element which
requires that the Development Code be clarified to state that access ramps may be constructed
within the front, side or rear yard setback of any residential structure, as part of the building
permit plan check. No variance or Conditional Use Permit is currently required, nor will it be.
Persons with Disabilities
Per Senate Bill No. 812, the Housing Element must include analysis of the special housing needs
of individuals with developmental disabilities. A developmental disability is defined by Section
4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code as “a disability that originates before an individual
becomes 18 years old, continues or can be expected to continue indefinitely, and constitutes a
substantial disability for that individual.” This includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy,
epilepsy, and autism, as well as disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental
retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation,
but does not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.
The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) implements a statewide system of
community-based services for people with developmental disabilities and their families. DDS
contracts with the Inland Regional Center in Riverside to provide and coordinate local services in
San Bernardino County, including the Town of Apple Valley. The developmentally disabled
population in the Apple Valley area that is being served by the Inland Regional Center includes
348 people within the 92307 zip code, and 227 people within the 92308 zip code. It should be
noted that the 92307 and 92308 zip codes encompass the Town of Apple Valley and extend well
beyond town limits into the County of San Bernardino. As such, the disabled population counts
are regional in nature and not strictly limited to town limits.

Persons with Developmental Disabilities
Housing needs for individuals with developmental disabilities can range from traditional
independent living environments, to supervised group quarters, to institutions where medical
care and other services are provided onsite. Important housing considerations for this group
include proximity to public transportation, accessibility of the home and surroundings, access to
medical and other public services, and affordability.
A variety of housing options in the Town of Apple Valley are provided by local and regional
service agencies, including the following:

Large Households
In 2010, there were 4,020 households with 5 or more persons in Town, of which 2,357 lived in
owner-occupied units, and 1,663 lived in renter-occupied housing units.
Single-Parent Families
There were 2,059 male-headed single parent families and 4,177 female-headed single parent
families in Apple Valley in 2010. 892 of the households with male-headed families had children
under 18, while 2,618 of the female-headed single parent households included children under 18.
Extremely Low Income Households
The 2010 Census estimated that 2,247 households in Town had household incomes of less than
$15,000. The Census further estimated that of those households with incomes of less than
$19,999, 740 households were paying more than 30% of their household income for rent, and
1,129 households were paying more than 30% of their household income for owner occupied
units. It is estimated that there will be a need for 456 very low income units during this planning
period (See Table II-28). Extremely low income households are expected to require rental
housing in the planning period. In the previous planning cycle, the Town has acquired Multi-
Family zoned land that will allow for approximately 200 units of affordable housing to extremely
low, very low and low income housing. It is expected that half of these units will be restricted to

Town expects to negotiate contracts for the construction and ownership of these projects within
the next planning cycle. In addition to developing vacant land, the Town has purchased three (3)
single-family units, for the purpose of rehabilitation and resale to very low income qualified
buyers. This has been accomplished through the use of NSP funding. NSP funding has also
allowed the Town to purchase a four-plex, rehabilitate the units and turn it over to a local
domestic violence non-profit to be used as transitional housing. With the elimination of the
Town’s Redevelopment Agency, additional units will be constructed through private
development efforts and the County of San Bernardino Housing Authority.
EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS
This section of the Housing Element addresses existing programs available in Apple Valley and
the region relating to affordable housing. The Town participates in the Apple Valley/Victorville
Consortium, which prepared the Consolidated Plan for Fiscal Years 2012-2016 for the two cities.
The Consortium has been successful in establishing an agreement which resulted in a direct
allocation of HOME funds. The Town has been successful in obtaining NSP1 and NSP3 funds
which have contributed the Town’s affordable housing efforts. Additionally, funding from
CDBG and CalHome funds have provided funding for some of the programs listed below.
Finally, since the elimination of redevelopment agencies by the State legislature, Community
Development Department operates programs and strategies for affordable housing in the Town.
Existing Programs
Residential Rehabilitation Loan Program
The Town provides no interest deferred loans to improve unsafe living conditions or correct code
violations in the owner-occupied homes of very low and low income households. The maximum
amount available per household is $20,000. This program will continue through the 2014-2021
cycle of the Housing Element. Monies for this program are funded through CDBG, HOME,
CalHOME and NSP3 funding sources.
Down Payment Assistance Program
The Town will provide very low and low income households with up to $55,000 toward the
purchase of a home within Town limits. The down payment assistance is provided as a deferred
loan for up to 30 years, applied to homes with a purchase price of no more than $210,000.
During the previous planning cycle, 106 units were purchased with the assistance of the Down
Payment Assistance Program. This program will continue through the 2014-2021 cycle of the
Housing Element. Monies for this program are funded through CDBG, HOME, CalHOME and
NSP3 funding sources.
Tenant Based Rental Assistance
The Consortium may allocate HOME funds toward rental assistance programs for very low and
low income renters within the Town.
                                                                             Community Development

Rehabilitation Grants for Mobile Homes
The Town will provide grants to improve unsafe living conditions or correct code violations of
owner-occupied mobile homes of very low and low income households. The maximum amount
available per household is $10,000. This program is funded through CDBG funding.
County and Federal Programs
County, State and federal programs available to the Town are described below.
Section 8 Housing Assistance
San Bernardino County provides HUD Section 8 rental assistance to lower income renters within
the Town. There are currently three units of public housing owned and operated by San
Bernardino County Housing Authority within Apple Valley. In addition, Section 8 certificates
are provided to Apple Valley residents, and generally assist between 350 and 375 households at
any given time.
Fair Housing Programs
The Town works with the County of San Bernardino to provide anti-discrimination, landlord-
tenant mediation, fair housing training and technical assistance, enforcement of housing rights,
administrative hearings, home buyer workshops, lead-based paint programs, and other housing
related services for Town residents.
County Mortgage Revenue Bond Funds
San Bernardino County annually issues bonds to fund a mortgage assistance program for low and
moderate income households. The program allows the County to provide low interest mortgages
to eligible households.
CalHFA Housing Assistance Program
This program is available to low and moderate income first time homebuyers who secure a CalHFA 30
year fixed mortgage. The program allows a deferred loan of up to 3% of the purchase price or appraised
value of the home, to be applied as a down payment.
California Homebuyer’s Downpayment Assistance Program
Moderate income households may receive a deferred loan of up to 3% of the purchase price or
appraised value of a home, to be applied to either the down payment or the closing costs for the
residence.
Home Choice Program
This State program provides disabled moderate income households with a low-interest 30 year
mortgage for a first time home.
Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program
This competitive program provides tax credits to those private sector developers who provide
affordable rental units within their projects. The units can consist of all or part of a project, and
must meet certain specified criteria. Units must be restricted for a period of at least 30 years.
                                                                               Community Development

CONSTRAINTS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING
Governmental Constraints
Application Fees
The Town of Apple Valley has a “fee for service” application fee schedule. A deposit is applied
to most applications made to the Town. Staff time and expenses are billed against the deposit. In
most cases, the deposit is not exceeded; and any unused deposit is returned to the applicant upon
completion of the case. Table II-25, below, illustrates typical permit fees, and shows that the fees
are not unusually high when compared to other communities in San Bernardino County. Since
2008, Apple Valley has not increased fees.

General Plan and Zoning Ordinance Constraints
The Land Use Element includes a number of residential land use densities. As governed by
Measure N, single family home lots are allowed at densities ranging from over 5 acres to 2 per
acre. The Land Use Element also includes the Medium Density Residential land use designation,
which allows 4 to 20 units per acre; and a new designation being created with the General Plan
Update of 2009, Mixed Use, which allows densities of 4 to 30 units per acre. The Mixed Use
designation also requires that both commercial and residential components be integrated into all
proposed projects in the designation, thereby assuring that higher density residential
development will occur within commercial projects. This land use designation has been applied
primarily along major transportation and employment corridors, including Bear Valley Road,
Highway 18, and Dale Evans Parkway.
The Development Code includes residential zones consistent with the General Plan, as required
by law. Single family residential zones include sub-zones focused on equestrian communities
and other specified needs of the community. The development standards allow lot sizes of 5
acres or more, ranging to up to 2 units per acre. The Multi-Family District, which corresponds to
the Medium Density Residential land use designation, allows up to 20 units per acre. The Mixed
Use District, allows up to 30 units per acre, when integrated with a commercial project. The
                                                                              Community Development

Town’s development standards are consistent with those of all surrounding jurisdictions, the
County of San Bernardino, and all other communities in southern California. None of the Town’s
standards can be characterized as excessive, or as consisting of a constraint on the development
of affordable housing.
The Development Code also includes the State’s density bonus provisions, and the second unit
standards.
Table II-26 illustrates the development standards in the Low Density, Estate, Single Family
Residential and Multi-Family Residential districts.

The Multi-Family zone allows 20 units per acre with 60% building coverage in structures of 50
feet in height (4 stories). Assuming an average unit size of 1,200 square feet, and allowing for
open space and surface parking requirements, a density of 20 units per acre can be achieved
within 2 and 3 story buildings. Therefore, the Town’s development standards do not constrain
the development of affordable housing.
Permit Processing
Permit processing in Town is consistent for all land use districts. Permitted uses of any kind in
any zone require approval of a site plan, which is generally processed in a period of 60 to 120
days, as are tentative tract maps for single family homes.
Single family homes on infill lots are not subject to any Planning Division review, and require
only a building permit. The Development Plan review and approval process consists of a review
of development standards for consistency at the staff level, and review and approval by the
                                                                                         Community Development

Planning Commission. The findings required to approve a project are consistent with all
communities in California, and relate to General Plan and Zoning consistency, the physical
ability of the site to accommodate the proposed project, and the California Environmental
Quality Act, as follows:
A.      That the location, size, design, density and intensity of the proposed development is
        consistent with the General Plan, the purpose of this Code, the purpose of the zoning
        district in which the site is located, and the development policies and standards of the
        Town;
B.      That the location, size and design of the proposed structures and improvements are
        compatible with the site's natural landforms, surrounding sites, structures and
        streetscapes;
C.      That the proposed development produces compatible transitions in the scale, bulk,
        coverage, density and character of development between adjacent land uses;
D.      That the building, site and architectural design is accomplished in an energy efficient
        manner;
E.      That the materials, textures and details of the proposed construction, to the extent
        feasible, are compatible with the adjacent and neighboring structures;
F.      That the development proposal does not unnecessarily block public views from other
        buildings or from public ways, or visually dominate its surroundings with respect to mass
        and scale to an extent unnecessary and inappropriate to the use;
G.      That the amount, location, and design of open space and landscaping conforms to the
        requirements of this Code, enhances the visual appeal and is compatible with the design
        and function of the structure(s), site and surrounding area;
H.      That quality in architectural design is maintained in order to enhance the visual
        environment of the Town and to protect the economic value of existing structures;
I.      That excessive and unsightly grading of hillsides does not occur, and the character of
        natural landforms and existing vegetation are preserved where feasible and as required by
        this Code;
J.      That historically significant structures and sites are protected as much as possible in a
        manner consistent with their historic values;
K.      That there are public facilities, services and utilities available at the appropriate levels or
        that these shall be installed at the appropriate time to serve the project as they are needed;
L.      That access to the site and circulation on- and off-site is safe and convenient for
        pedestrians, bicyclists, equestrians and motorists;
M.      That the proposed development's generation of traffic will not adversely impact the
        capacity and physical character of surrounding streets;
N.      That traffic improvements and or mitigation measures are provided in a manner adequate
        to maintain a Level of Service C or better on arterial roads and are consistent with the
        Circulation Element of the Town General Plan;
O.      That environmentally unique and fragile areas such as the knolls, areas of dense Joshua
        trees, and the Mojave River area shall remain adequately protected;
P.      That there will not be significant harmful effects upon environmental quality and natural
        resources;
                                                                                 Community Development

Q.      That there are no other relevant negative impacts of the proposed use that cannot be
        mitigated;
R.      That the impacts which could result from the proposed development, and the proposed
        location, size, design and operating characteristics of the proposed development, and the
        conditions under which it would be operated or maintained will not be detrimental to the
        public health, safety and welfare of the community or be materially injurious to
        properties or improvements in the vicinity nor be contrary to the adopted General Plan;
        and
S.      That the proposed development will comply with each of the applicable provisions of this
        code, and applicable Town policies, except approved variances.
Single family homes do not require discretionary review, and are processed through the Building
Department, unless part of a master planned community. Should a Conditional Use Permit be
required for any reason, it is processed concurrently with the site plan review, and does not
extend the permit processing timeline. The Town always provides expedited permit processing,
and even when required to process a General Plan Amendment and Zone Change, can process
applications in less than six months. The Town’s permit processing, therefore, does not represent
a constraint on development.
For Multi-Family development construction of units from 1-15 administrative review is
completed through the plan check process and no additional entitlements are required. Units of
16-50, require Planning Commission review and approval of a Development Permit. The same
findings listed above for single-family development, requiring a Development Permit, is required
for the Planning Commission approval of a Development Permit. Projects that include more
than 50 units requires a Conditional Use Permit reviewed and approved by the Planning
Commission.
Transitional and supportive housing for six (6) or fewer residents is not regulated by the Town.
Transitional and supportive housing of seven (7) or more is subject to only the requirements of
residential uses of the same type, such as group homes, residential care facilities of seven (7) or
more, and require the review and approval of a Conditional Use Permit, as described in the
paragraph below. On June 26, 2012, the Town adopted the Reasonable Accommodations
Ordinance No. 436, which waives permit fees and allows those with disabilities to request
modifications to Development Code requirements.
Conditional Use permits are typically processed in the same time frame of a maximum of 120
days and include a public hearing before the Planning Commission. The findings required to
approve a project are consistent with all communities in California, and relate to General Plan
and Zoning consistency, the physical ability of the site to accommodate the proposed project, and
the California Environmental Quality Act, as follows:
A.      That the proposed location, size, design and operating characteristics of the proposed use
        is consistent with the General Plan, the purpose of this Code, the purpose of the zoning
        district in which the site is located, and the development policies and standards of the
        Town;
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                                 II-123

                                                                         Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                            General Plan/ Housing Element
B.      That the location, size, design and operating characteristics of the proposed use will be
        compatible with and will not adversely affect nor be materially detrimental to adjacent
        uses, residents, buildings, structures or natural resources;
C.      That the proposed use is compatible in scale, bulk, lot coverage, and density with
        adjacent uses;
D.      That there are public facilities, services and utilities available at the appropriate levels or
        that these will be installed at the appropriate time to serve the project as they are needed;
E.      That there will not be a harmful effect upon desirable neighborhood characteristics;
F.      That the generation of traffic will not adversely impact the capacity and physical
        character of surrounding streets;
G.      The traffic improvements and/or mitigation measures are provided in a manner adequate
        to maintain the existing service level or a Level of Service (LOS) C or better on arterial
        roads and are consistent with the Circulation Element of the General Plan;
H.      That there will not be significant harmful effects upon environmental quality and natural
        resources;
I.      That there are no other relevant negative impacts of the proposed use that cannot be
        reasonably mitigated.
J.      That the impacts, as described in paragraphs 1 through 9 above, and the proposed
        location, size, design and operating characteristics of the proposed use and the conditions
        under which it would be operated or maintained will not be detrimental to the public
        health, safety or welfare, nor be materially injurious to properties or improvements in the
        vicinity, nor be contrary to the adopted General Plan.
K.      That the proposed conditional use will comply with all of the applicable provisions of this
        title.
L.      That the materials, textures and details of the proposed construction, to the extent
        feasible, are compatible with the adjacent and neighboring structures;
M.      That the development proposal does not unnecessarily block public views from other
        buildings or from public ways, or visually dominate its surroundings with respect to mass
        and scale to an extent unnecessary and inappropriate to the use;
N.      That quality in architectural design is maintained in order to enhance the visual
        environment of the Town and to protect the economic value of existing structures; and
O.      That access to the site and circulation on- and off-site is safe and convenient for
        pedestrians, bicyclists, equestrians and motorists.
Infrastructure Requirements
As with most communities, adjacent roadways must be improved to their ultimate half width
when development occurs. Generally, the Town requires half width improvements to include
curb, gutter and sidewalk; in more rural areas, however, the Planning Commission has the ability
to allow rolled curb and/or no sidewalk. Roadway standards for local or local streets require a
paved width of 40 feet within a 60-foot right of way. The Town will also allow deviations to
these standards, including the narrowing of streets within planned communities.
                                                                                 Community Development
                                                                                                    II-124
                                                                       Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                         General Plan/ Housing Element
Water and Sewer Services
Water and sanitary sewer services are provided by the Apple Valley Ranchos Water Company
and other independent water companies, and the Victor Valley Waste Water Reclamation
Authority, respectively. Lands designated for Multi-Family or Mixed Use development in Town
are located on major roadways, which are serviced by water and sewer mains currently. The
water purveyors, and the sanitary sewer system, have current capacity, or expansion plans
sufficient to accommodate growth in Town, including the Town’s regional housing need
allocation. The Town will, as required, provide the water purveyors and the Reclamation
Authority with copies of the adopted Housing Element. These purveyors are also required by law
to provide priority service for affordable housing projects.
Development Impact Fees
As new development occurs, it increases the need for Town services and facilities. In order to
offset these increased needs, the Town has established Development Impact Fees, as shown in
Table II-27. Since the previous planning period, only the Transportation Impact fee has changed.

Building Code Requirements
As with most communities in California, the Town has adopted the California Green Building
Code (CBC), and updates the Code periodically as State-wide updates are developed. Currently
(2013), the Town is enforcing the provisions of the 2010 CBC. The Town cannot adopt
standards that are less stringent than the CBC. Since all communities in the State enforce similar
provisions, the Town’s CBC requirements are not an undue constraint on the development of
affordable housing. In addition to the California Green Building Code, the Town adopted a
Climate Action Plan (CAP) in 2010, which includes an implementation plan. The CAP requires
energy efficiency measures in new development to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions as required
by AB 32 and SB 375.
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                                 II-125

                                                                       Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                          General Plan/ Housing Element
Building Permit Fees
The Building Department charges on a per square foot basis for building permit plan checks and
inspections. Fees are based on the CBC components, and include electrical, plumbing, structural
and architectural fees.
In addition to the Town’s fees, residential developers are responsible for the payment of the State
mandated school fees, as well as connection and/or metering fees for public utilities. The current
(2008) school fees in Apple Valley are $4.02 per square foot.
Economic Constraints
During the past planning cycle (2006-2013) all of Southern California, but especially the High
Desert of San Bernardino County, suffered through an economic downturn that resulted in very
little residential development. In 2011, the dissolution of Redevelopment Agencies by the State
of California, took away the primary funding source for affordable housing projects. With these
two major events occurring, it is not anticipated that the market will turn around until possibly
mid cycle of 2018. Economic constraints of financing these projects will depend on the banks
willingness to loan money and how quickly the existing residential units are absorbed by market
demand. Public funding of affordable housing projects in Apple Valley will be limited to grant
funds and will rely on non-profit and private sectors to provide additional units. Apple Valley
does control about 17 acres of medium residential zoned land that can be used in partnership
with these two sectors to facilitate new construction, but because of the elimination of
redevelopment, does not have funds to develop the land.
Land and Housing Costs
The cost of land has the potential to impact the overall cost of housing. Land for single family
homes in Apple Valley, ranging from half-acre to whole tracts, is available in the $25,000 to
$175,000 per acre range.
The median sales price for a single family home in Apple Valley is currently (April 2013)
approximately $138,000, a significant decrease from the same period in 2008, when the median
listing price stood at $220,000. The current economic downturn makes single family homes
affordable to the moderate income household in Apple Valley.
Apartment projects in Apple Valley are generally smaller, and may be characterized as duplexes,
or projects of 10 units or less, privately owned. Such projects for sale in 2013 range in price from
$40,000 to $80,000 per unit. These prices represent a drop of 50% in value from 2008.
The rental rates for typical apartment units in Apple Valley range from $700 per month for a two
bedroom, one bath unit to $850 for a three bedroom, 2 bath unit.
Construction Costs
Construction costs have been similarly affected by current economic conditions. Single family
construction costs range from $95 to over $200 per square foot (excluding site improvements),
varying based on the size of the home and the materials selected. Multi-family construction costs
generally range from $90 to $150 per square foot.
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                                  II-126

                                                                         Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                           General Plan/ Housing Element
Financing Costs
The cost of financing can also impact the development community’s ability to fund projects. The
current mortgage crisis has made single family loans extremely difficult to secure. Although this
condition is not expected to continue through the entire planning period, the duration of the
current economic downturn could impact the ability of developers to fund and construct
affordable housing in Town.
Physical Constraints
Age of Housing Stock
The 2010 Census determined that 32.9% of the Town’s housing stock was built before 1980,
meaning that 8,709 units are 32 years old or older. The cost of maintaining older residential units
can escalate, however, the mild climate and moderate conditions in Apple Valley help to
preserve housing in better condition. The Town also maintains a Residential Rehabilitation Loan
Program to assist very low and low income households in making repairs to their properties.
Environmental Constraints
Apple Valley’s primary environmental constraint is associated with storm water management.
Although a Master Plan of Drainage was prepared for Apple Valley, its implementation has been
limited, and sheet flow flooding during major storms remains an issue of concern. In addition,
the Dry Lake area, located in the east-central area of Town, has limited development potential
due to flooding. Sites identified for Multi-Family or Mixed Use on the Land Use Map are located
outside flood channels, and will not be significantly impacted by flooding requirements, other
than those imposed on all developments by the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) As with all of California, the Town’s water suppliers face continued challenges in
providing water in the long term. The Town, as required by law, will provide this Housing
Element to all its water providers upon its adoption. As described below under Land Inventory,
however, sufficient lands are available to meet the Town’s RHNA allocation during the current
planning period.
Energy Conservation
In addition to the requirements of Title 24 of the Building Code, the Town requires the
installation of water conserving landscaping for all new projects. Although the cost of
installation of energy efficient, “green” or similar products in a home or apartment may increase
the initial cost, the affordable housing providers and residents who participated in the Town’s
workshops, clearly indicated that the cost differential was becoming smaller as technologies
improved; and that the long term benefit to the home owners or renters was worth the added
initial expense. The Town will continue to work with the development community in
implementing energy efficient and ‘green’ technologies in new projects in the future.
HOUSING NEEDS
Affordable Units at Risk
There are no units at risk of losing their affordability restrictions in Apple Valley in the next ten
years.
                                                                                 Community Development

San Bernardino County Income Limits
Income limits for affordability are established annually on a regional basis by the Department of
Housing and Community Development. Table II-28 provides the current (2012) income limits
applicable to the Town of Apple Valley. The median household income for a family of four in
2012 is $63,300.
                                            Table II-28

Households Overpaying for Housing
When a household pays more than 30% of its income toward its housing expenses, it is
considered to be over-paying. The 2010 Census identified 2,539 4,571 renter households paying
30% or more for housing, and 5,591 owner households overpaying for housing.
Affordability of Housing
In order to determine the level of affordability for market housing in Apple Valley, a comparison
of for-sale and for-rent market housing was undertaken. Table II-29 illustrates that the low
income household of 4 is able to find rental housing well within its ability to pay, but falls $159
per month short in being able to afford to purchase a median priced home. The Table
demonstrates that although rental units are still affordable to low income households, the low
income household may not be able to purchase a home in Apple Valley.

If the analysis in Table II-29 is completed for a moderate income 4-person household, that
household can afford monthly housing costs of $1,899 The current market rate housing in Apple
Valley would be affordable to that household, with an overage of $400 for an ownership unit,
and $887 for a rental unit. This analysis concludes, therefore, that moderate income households
can generally be housed in market housing in Apple Valley, and do not require subsidy.
Mobile Home Parks
There are 12 mobile home parks in Apple Valley, located throughout the community, providing
more than 1,500 mobile home spaces. These projects provide an affordable housing option, as
mobile homes currently (2013) sell in the range from $20,000 to $120,000 per unit. In the 2009
General Plan update and the subsequent Development Code update, mobile home parks were
given a separate land use and zoning designation identified as Mobile Home Park (MHP).
Second Units
The Town in 2004 adopted the State’s model ordinance for second unit development, in order to
facilitate the development of such units on single family lots, and has updated the standards as
State legislation required. The ordinance allows second units, consistent with state law, on single
family lots, as long as the development standards in the zone are met. Second units can provide
an affordable option for rental units within the community.
Regional Housing Needs Allocation
The State and Southern California Association of Governments develop housing allocations for
each Housing Element planning period. For the 2014-2021 planning period, Apple Valley’s
share of the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) is:

   LAND INVENTORY
   The Town’s Regional Housing Needs Assessment for 2014-2021 estimates that a total of 3,334
   housing units will be built in Apple Valley. Of these, 1,407 are expected to be constructed for
   those of above moderate income. These units are expected to be market-driven, and constructed
   as single family homes typical of those already occurring in Apple Valley. As shown in the
   analysis under ‘Affordability of Housing,” above, the moderate income households in Apple
   Valley are also able to afford the currently marketed housing available in the community.
   Therefore, the Town will need to assure that sufficient land is available for all extremely low,
   very low and low income housing units needed during the planning period, or a total of 1,305
   units.
   The cost of land and housing makes it likely that these units will be of higher density, although
   they may be either for-sale or for-rent units. Table II-32 and II-33 list the available vacant lands
   in the Town by Assessor’s Parcel Number, provides the size of each parcel, and the potential
   number of units that could be developed on that parcel. For the Multi-Family District, a density
   of 15 units per acre has been assumed, to allow for infrastructure and open space. The estimate is
   based on constructed and approved projects in this designation. There are currently 430 multi-
   family units, including 44 mobile home spaces, currently entitled. In the previous planning cycle,
   80 units were constructed.
   The dissolution of Redevelopment altered the future plans for a fifty (50)-unit senior affordable
   housing project to be built at the northwest corner of Thunderbird and Dale Evans Parkway. The
   Redevelopment bond proceeds allocated for this project were taken by the State. The Town is
                                                                                  Community Development
                                                                                                     II-130

                                                                        Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                           General Plan/ Housing Element
left with a five (5) acre parcel that will be used for a future affordable housing project built by
private or non-profit funding. The Town has a total of 17.5 acres of land in three separate areas
that will be marketed to the affordable housing community of developers for the best projects to
partner with the Town.
As previously stated, land cost in Apple Valley ranges from $20,000 to $75,000 $25,000 to
$175,000 per acre. At a density of 15 units per acre, this equates to $1,666 to $11,666 per unit.
The affordable housing community in Apple Valley estimates that construction costs for
affordable housing units are approximately $125,000 to $176,250. When added to land cost, this
represents a total cost per unit of $126,666 to $187,916 per unit. Projects in this cost range can
be funded, when including HOME funds, tax credit funds or other programs, and built in the
range of 14 to 16 units per acre. Most importantly, the affordable housing community has
indicated that projects above this range are not marketable, insofar as more dense projects cannot
be built and include the amenities and common areas which make a project a liveable community
for the families who are looking for rental units. Palm Desert Development Company, which
attended the Town’s affordable housing workshops for the General Plan, clearly stated that they
will not plan projects at densities over 16 units per acre, since the higher densities do not allow
them to create communities which they can lease, because they cannot provide the services and
amenities which create a healthy living environment. These same developers have stated that a
density of 15 units per acre is financially feasible in the Apple Valley market. The Development
Code allows up to 20 units per acre.
The Mixed Use District assumes a density of 22 units per acre on 25% of the parcel, to account
for infrastructure and open space, and also for the commercial component of the Mixed Use
project. This District is new to the General Plan, and has not been implemented. However, the
development standards and policies in the Land Use Element require that residential
development be included in all Mixed Use projects, and the maximum density allowed is 30
units per acre. As a result, the density calculated below, at 22 units per acre, is conservative.

As shown in the two Tables, the Town has vacant lands available to accommodate over 15,155
units in its Multi-Family and Mixed Use Districts. The lands available are generally served by
trunk lines, and occur on Town streets which are paved. There is therefore more than enough
land available to meet the Town’s RHNA for the planning period. A map of vacant lands is also
provided below, as Exhibit II-13.
As described in the Land Use Element, there are 229.7 acres of vacant land designated Mixed
Use within the Town boundary. These lands have the potential to generate 6,891 units of
housing. Although not all these units are expected to develop as affordable housing units, there is
more than enough land available to provide the 1,309 affordable housing units needed to meet
the Town’s very low and low income housing need in the planning period. Development

structures, the Development Code standards facilitate the construction of projects at a density of
30 units per acre.
DISOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT
In 2011 the State of California eliminated Redevelopment Agencies and tax increment financing,
including the 20% set aside funds dedicated to development of low income housing projects.
The Town of Apple Valley also had $4.5 million dollars in Redevelopment Bond proceeds that
were earmarked for the construction of affordable housing. All of the Redevelopment funds
were taken by the State. The bond proceeds were included within the Town’s Recognized
Obligation Payments (ROPs) for the construction of a 50-unit senior affordable housing project.
The State has not accepted this project as an obligated contract enacted prior to the dissolution of
Redevelopment. As such, it is still undetermined if the Town will be able to utilize these funds
for future projects.
The funding in the past that would allow the Town the ability to administer programs and
construct affordable housing projects is gone and not anticipated to return in any other format
during this planning cycle. The Town currently operates the Down Payment Assistance program
and the Residential Rehabilitation program through CDBG and HOME funds. The Town was
successful in obtaining Neighborhood Stabilization Program grant funds that have also
contributed to this program, purchased existing units for rehabilitation and land for future
affordable housing projects. Since many of these programs do not provide adequate funding to
administer the projects, and some with no administrative funding at all, the Town’s general fund
provides some relief to cover these costs. The Town’s Five Year Consolidated Plan identifies
that from the years 2013-2018 the Town will allocate $1,633,000 towards the Residential
Rehabilitation Program and $1,074,000 towards the Down Payment Assistance Program and
receive approximately $2,496,000 in CDBG funds, $926,000 in HOME funds and $1,074,000 in
Cal HOME funds. With these funding sources the Town anticipates that it will be able to assist
52 homeowners in the Residential Rehabilitation Loan program and 20 buyers in the Down
Payment Assistance Program during the period of 2014 -2021. In addition the Town anticipates
contributing over 17 acres of land to accommodate the new construction of a minimum of 200
affordable units and rehabilitate three (3) existing single-family residential units for resale to
qualified buyers.

PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
In May 2013, the Town held two public workshops that focused on housing issues. The
workshops were advertised in the local newspaper, on the Town’s website, and flyers and
invitations were distributed to a number of individuals and organizations. These organizations
targeted were primarily those involving affordable housing, homeless and other supportive
groups of regional and local housing issues. The public was also invited to these meetings. The
email distribution lists are appended to this Element as Appendix A. At these workshops, issues
were discussed regarding providing adequate housing for seniors, low-income and the homeless.
Specifically, adequate transportation to service areas and job centers was seen as an issue for the
low-income and homeless in the community. The importance of dispersing low-income housing
throughout the community and specifically close to transit was discussed. These issues have
been discussed at previous workshops and are addressed in the Goals, Policies and Programs
provided below. Finally, public hearings were held before the Planning Commission and City
Council for the adoption of the Element, in August and October 2013.
SB 244
Compliance with SB244 requires the Town to include an analysis of the presence of
disadvantaged unincorporated communities of the Town’s Sphere of Influence, in the Land Use
Element of the General Plan. This is required before or at the same time of the adoption of the 5th
planning cycle of the Housing Element update. The Analysis has been prepared and will be
adopted with the Housing Element Update. The Planning Commission is scheduled to review
both revisions to the Land Use and Housing Elements in August 2013 and the Town Council will
review and adopt in September 2013.
GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
Due to the recent down-turn in the housing market, opportunity to implement the goals, policies
and programs identified within the last housing element were not possible. Therefore, with the
exception of modifying regulations to comply with the Government Code, the same goals,
policies and programs from the last cycle have not changed. The Housing Element, General
Plan, Development Code and town programs now comply with the Government Code and can be
fully implemented in this cycle. With the dissolution of redevelopment by the State legislature,
some of the programs funded with redevelopment tax increment monies have been eliminated.
In addition the programs previously implemented by the Redevelopment Agency, have been
taken over by the Community Development Department.

WATER RESOURCES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Water Resources Element of the General Plan addresses water sources, availability, current
and future demand, conservation, water quality, and the future of the water resources serving the
community. A discussion of local water purveyors and the importance of coordination between
the purveyors and the Town is also included below. The topics covered by this element include
regional and local water supplies, consumptive demand within the Town and Sphere-of-
Influence, and groundwater conservation and protection. And finally, the goal, policies and
programs are set forth in this element which direct Town staff and other officials in the
management of this vital resource.
BACKGROUND
The Water Resources Element is directly related to both the Land Use Element and considers the
management of water demand and water quality as essential to land use planning. This Element
is also directly related to the Flooding and Hydrology Element, which discusses the protection
and enhancement of groundwater recharge, as well as the protection of life and property from
flood       damage.        The
Emergency        Preparedness
Element, Police and Fire
Protection, and the Water,
Sewer and Utilities Element
also are related to and
address water availability
and water quality issues.
The      Water      Resources
Element addresses          key
topics      of      California
Government Code Section
65302(d), including the
discussion and evaluation of
available water supplies,
conservation      of     water
resources, and water quality control. In addition, the Town is authorized by the California
Environmental Quality Act, Section 21083.2(g), to require the research and documentation of
potential water resource impacts associated with projects within the Town that may have
significant impacts to water and other important resources.
                                                                           Environmental Resources

WATER RESOURCES
Mojave River Groundwater Basin
The Town of Apple Valley is located within the boundaries of the Mojave River Groundwater
Basin, which encompasses approximately 1,400 square miles along the Mojave River within the
management area of the Mojave Water Agency (MWA). The management area for the MWA
covers approximately 4,900 square miles. MWA is responsible for managing the long-term
reliability of surface and groundwater within its service area, and as a State Water Project (SWP)
contractor, has an SWP water allocation of 75,800 acre-feet per year. Local water purveyors
contract with MWA for water, which is delivered from the SWP facilities extending as far north
as Lake Oroville to Lake Perris in the south. The SWP includes 660 miles of aqueduct and
conveyance facilities, and delivers SWP water to MWA for storage and distribution.
The MWA Urban Water Management Plan utilizes SWP reliability factors of 69% to 77%,
which yield a conservative 53,800 to 58,400 AF of entitlement for MWA. However, recent
events involving water deliveries and impacts to endangered species in the San Joaquin River
basin have reduced current (2008) and may reduce future deliveries of SWP water allocations to
SWP contractors, including MWA.
The MWA service area is underlain by several subsurface aquifers known as subareas. Within
the Mojave Basin Judgment Area (see Water Demand, below), these subareas include the Alto,
the Baja, the Centro, the Este, and the Oeste Subareas (see Exhibit III-1, Groundwater Basins
within the MWA Service Area). The Morongo Basin/Johnson Valley Subarea lies to the
southeast of the Este Subarea, and is outside the Mojave Basin Judgment Area. Geologic (faults)
and topographic features that restrict groundwater flow and surface water drainage define these
subareas. The Town of Apple Valley is located near the center of the Alto Subarea of the Mojave
River Groundwater Basin.
The Mojave River is the primary natural source of recharge for the Mojave River Groundwater
Basin; however, most of the streambed is dry much of the year except for periods of spring
runoff and at other times from flows associated with intense rainstorms. The topographic relief
that runs along the Mojave River on the west side of the Town generally divides local drainage.
To the east of these hills, most of the drainages from the surrounding hills and mountains in
Apple Valley flow towards the Apple Valley Dry Lake. The drainage channels in the local
mountains are well defined but lose their strong definition when they reach the valley floor,
where they spread out into ephemeral stream channels and sheet flow. Drainages along the
western side of Apple Valley eventually discharge into the Mojave River. The largest tributary to
the Mojave River within Apple Valley is Bell Mountain Wash, a natural channel that collects
runoff primarily in the area north and west of Bell Mountain. Numerous small, unnamed
drainages drain the western part of the Ord Mountains and flow towards the Mojave River.
Elevations within the Town average approximately 3,000 feet above sea level, ranging from
about 2,700 feet above sea level along the Mojave River and up to 3,897 above sea level at Bell
Mountain peak.

Alto Subarea
The Alto Subarea consists of water-bearing strata underlying a 35-mile length of the Mojave
River, generally encompassing the communities of Apple Valley, Victorville, Adelanto,
Hesperia, Helendale, and Phelan.
The Alto Subarea is generally bounded by the non-water-bearing rocks of the San Bernardino
Mountains to the south, by the non-water bearing rocks of the San Gabriel Mountains to the
west, and by the Helendale Fault to the northeast. However, it is not wholly isolated from the
surrounding subareas. The headwaters of the Mojave River occur to the south, at the confluence
of the West Fork and Deep Creek streams. To the east, the Alto Subarea merges with the Este
Subarea, to the west it merges with the Oeste Subarea, and to the north (down-gradient) it merges
with the Centro Subarea. The Alto Subarea is recharged by snowmelt of the San Bernardino
Mountains via the Mojave River. Due to its proximity to the headwaters of the Mojave River, the
Alto Subarea has the largest water supply in the Mojave Basin.

The subbasin that comprises the Alto Subarea contains approximately 82,400 acre-feet of water
with out-flows and losses calculated at 47,700 ac-ft. Thus the net volume of water in the Alto
Subarea is estimated to be 34,700 ac-ft of water, plus importation of 75,800 acre-feet of State
Water Project entitlements available to the MWA. Water withdrawals are from wells in the
Subarea.
Factors that contribute to increases and decreases in the amount of water stored in the Alto
Subarea include variations in local and regional precipitation, percolation rates, the movement of
water from dams and river basins, and water transmission lines into the basin. The amount of
water withdrawn supplies residential, commercial, industrial, institutional and all other uses by
water purveyors in the Alto Subarea. The annual production in the subarea between 1994 and
2007 is shown in the following table.

Apple Valley Ranchos Water Company
Apple Valley Ranchos Water Company (AVRWC or AVR) is an investor-owned water utility,
regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) that provides water service to
the majority of the Town of Apple Valley and the General Plan area.
AVRWC currently serves over 19,000 customer connections. The sole source of water is
groundwater with the majority of its 23 wells located along the Mojave River. These wells pump
groundwater into the distribution system, which is equipped with over 11 million gallons (MG)
of elevated storage. Many of the wells are equipped with stationary emergency generators or
quick connections for mobile generator hook-ups. The water distribution system consists of over
400 miles of pipelines generally ranging in size from 4 inches to 20 inches in diameter.
Golden State Water Company
Golden State Water Company is a subsidiary of American States Water. It is a public utility
company that serves the northeastern and southern portions of the Town, and encompasses
nearly 4± square miles. Golden State’s system currently (2008) includes approximately 2,847
active service connections. Historical water demand for productions for the years 1996 to 2005
averaged 0.64 acre-feet per year per connection.
Small Water Purveyors and Private Companies
A number of other, smaller water purveyors serve portions of the Town of Apple Valley and/or
its Sphere of Influence. Several of these are San Bernardino County Service Areas (CSA) that
were established to provide domestic water services and facilities to specific development. Other
purveyors are private water companies.
Apple Valley Foothill County Water District encompasses an approximately 2 square mile
service area located at the southeastern edge of the Town’s corporate limits near Central Road
and Del Oro Road. It serves 180 service connections, and has 2 wells and 2 elevated storage
units, with approximately 150,000 gallons of capacity.
Apple Valley Heights County Water District covers a service area of approximately 2 square
miles, and is located south of the Town corporate limits and its Sphere of Influence. The district
has approximately 290 service connections, with two wells and has 260,000 gallons of elevated
storage.
Apple Valley View Mutual Water Company has a service area of approximately 1 square mile. It
currently (2008) has 100 service connections, of which 81 are active. There are 3 wells, one
storage tank with a capacity of 20,000 gallons, and one 5,000-gallon pressure tank. It is
estimated that the service area has potential to build out with up to 301 connections, which
would require a facilities upgrade. The company has purchased lands to upgrade through
construction of a larger capacity storage tank.
County Service Area (CSA) 64 covers an approximately 3 square mile service area, which is
bisected east to west by the Mojave River. The eastern portion is within Apple Valley and the
largest portion is to the west in the City of Victorville. CSA 64 serves approximately 3,801
                                                                            Environmental Resources

facilities include five wells, three elevated storage tanks, and approximately 2.65 million gallons
of storage capacity.
Juniper Rivera County Water District service area encompasses approximately 2 square miles
and serves 168 connections. There are two wells and two storage tanks with approximately
150,000 gallons of capacity.
Mariana Ranchos County Water District encompasses approximately 7 square miles, most of
which is located south of the Town’s corporate limits but within its Sphere of Influence. It serves
650 service connections with 2 wells and three elevated storage tanks with approximately
900,000 gallons of storage capacity.
Rancheritos Mutual Water Company has a service area of approximately 1.25 miles in the
southern portion of Apple Valley and within its Sphere-of-Influence. It serves 269 service
connections with three wells. Rancheritos has no elevated storage; wells are equipped with small
reserve storage tanks and pressure is maintained hydro-pneumatically. Water is distributed via
small distribution tanks directly to service connections. Rancheritos may erect additional,
possibly elevated storage on two sites in the future, however plans are not complete and site
selection has not been finalized.
Thunderbird County Water District serves approximately 325 service connections within its
approximately 2 square mile service area. It is located east of the Town limits and includes
service area within the Town's Sphere of Influence. Thunderbird has three wells and three
storage reservoirs with a capacity of approximately 410,000 gallons.
ADDITIONAL WATER SOURCES
Imported Water
The Alto subarea of the Mojave River Groundwater Basin is currently the primary water supply
for the Town and General Plan area. Additional water sources are considered as a supplement to
groundwater in that they are used to either recharge the subarea or serve as a source substitution
for groundwater.
As noted above, MWA imports water from the California State Water Project (SWP) to recharge
groundwater in the Mojave River Basin. The SWP system also allows the MWA to purchase
and/or facilitate delivery of additional water from sources other than the SWP. The Mojave
Water Agency is subject to the Mojave Basin Area Adjudication, which requires that additional
surface water be imported to help balance the Basin. The Adjudication provides a court-approved
mechanism for MWA to finance and obtain supplemental water to recharge the Basin and
augment water supplies for parties to the Judgment, including AVRWC.1
In addition to the Mojave Water Agency's contract with the SWP, in 2003, MWA reached
agreement with the Metropolitan Water District (MWD) of Southern California to allow MWD
to store up to 75,000 acre-feet of water in the Mojave basin. This "water banking" or conjunctive

use of the water basin, was in exchange for MWD’s right to receive an equal amount of water in
the future, through entitlement exchange, should there be a significant drought.
Reclaimed Water
The treatment and use of reclaimed and recycled water will further reduce the impacts of
development on groundwater resources. Wastewater typically undergoes two levels of treatment
before it is released to percolation ponds and reintroduced into the groundwater table. Tertiary
treated wastewater, however, undergoes an additional stage of treatment, making it suitable for
irrigation purposes.
No reclaimed water is currently available to the Town of Apple Valley or the planning area.
However, the Victor Valley Wastewater Reclamation Authority (VVWRA) is considering the
construction of interceptors to serve the Town of Apple Valley pending approval of funding by
the VVWRA Board. Assuming that these facilities are constructed in the future, the Town may
have access to recycled water. The wastewater treatment capacity of VVWRA is currently
(2008) 18 mgd.
WATER DEMAND
The Town currently relies on groundwater that is recharged by precipitation and runoff from the
adjacent mountains, and from water imported into the subarea serving the Town and planning
area. MWA will continue to recharge the aquifer so that it will remain a reliable source of water
for the foreseeable future. Among other things, MWA has established its groundwater
replenishment program for the Mojave Water Basin, including the Alto Subarea, the purpose of
which is to reduce annual and cumulative groundwater overdraft through artificial recharge to
the groundwater basin.
Based on historic water withdrawals from the Alto Subarea it is clear that the subarea water table
has experienced a steady decline. Water production within the Apple Valley Ranchos service
area from 1999 through 2007, is shown in Table III-2. Water production within the Apple Valley
Golden State north and south service areas for years 1996 through 2005 is shown on Table III-3.

Overdraft or depletion of the groundwater in storage has continued with the expansion of
development of the Town of Apple Valley and other areas within the subarea. As shown in the
table above, groundwater production has increased within the Town, which coupled with low
precipitation within the region has led to a decline in groundwater levels within the Alto Subarea,
resulting in a condition of overdraft. In overdraft conditions, the demand for groundwater
exceeds the amount of recharge into the groundwater basin over a period of time. According to
AVR's 2005 Urban Water Management Plan, the Alto Subarea experienced a groundwater level
decline of approximately 60 feet from 1960 to 1995, declining from an elevation of 2,815 feet in
1960 to approximately 2,755 feet over that period. Presently, overdraft conditions continue to
exist in almost all of the basins within the Mojave River Basin.
Overdraft conditions can produce significant adverse social, environmental and economic
impacts, including an increased potential for land subsidence, which can result in ground
fissuring and damage to buildings, sidewalks, and subsurface pipelines. Other adverse impacts
                                                                                             Environmental Resources
                                                                                                               III-11

                                                                                 Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                                             General Plan/Water Resources Element
associated with overdraft conditions include increased infrastructure and energy costs associated
with drilling deeper wells and installing larger pumps, and the threat of a diminishing long-term
water supply.
In order to avoid an overdraft condition, and to maintain a safe water balance within the Alto
Subarea and the other subareas throughout the Mojave Basin, a Free Production Allowance
(FPA) has been established for each subarea. The FPA was established when the Mojave River
Groundwater Basin was adjudicated through the Mojave Basin Area Judgment. As a result, a
court reviews and adjusts the FPA on an annual basis. The MWA serves as the court appointed
"Watermaster" for the Mojave Water Basin. The role of the Watermaster is to avoid overdraft by
assuring that extractions do not exceed supply. This is accomplished, in part, by the assigned
FPA.
All groundwater pumped beyond the FPA is subject to replacement, which can be achieved
through payment to the Watermaster of a replenishment fee ($277 acre-feet for 2007-08) to be
used to acquire additional water, or through the transfer of unused water rights within the Alto
Subarea from another party to the Judgment. For water year 2005-06, AVR’s consumption
achieved a safe yield (imports, inflows, return flows and outflows equal consumption).2
Each year the Watermaster takes an account of the average and minimum annual flows, which
must be maintained between subareas making up the Mojave Basin. The Judgment requires that
all water extracted in excess of any producer’s share of the FPA must be replaced by the
producer, which is typically in the form of payment to the Watermaster of funds sufficient to
purchase an equal amount of replacement water. It should be noted that an underlying
assumption of the Judgment is that sufficient water supplies will be available to the MWA to
meet the needs of the basin from future supplies that are a combination of natural recharge,
imported water (SWP and other sources), water conservation, water reuse and transfers of FPA
among producers.
According to the MWA 2005 Urban Water Management Plan Update, as water demands increase
over the next 20 years, additional projects and water management actions are needed to continue
to recharge the groundwater basins to maintain groundwater levels and protect groundwater
quality for municipal, agricultural, industrial, recreational, and environmental uses. If such
projects are not implemented and groundwater overdraft persists or intensifies, the presiding
Judge for the Mojave Basin Area Judgment could require mandatory cutbacks in production.
WATER CONSERVATION EFFORTS
To enhance water conservation, local stakeholders in and around the Apple Valley planning area
established the Alliance for Water Awareness and Conservation (AWAC) in August of 2003.
According to the MWA Regional Water Management Plan (2004), the purpose of the AWAC is
2
      Under the Mojave Basin Judgment, “production safe yield” is defined as: “The highest average Annual
      Amount of water that can be produced from a Subarea: (1) over a sequence of years that is representative of
      long-term average annual natural water supply to the Subarea net of long-term average annual natural outflow
      from the Subarea, (2) under given patterns of Production, applied water, return flows and Consumptive Use,
      and (3) without resulting in a long-term net reduction of groundwater in storage in the Subarea.”
                                                                                         Environmental Resources
                                                                                                            III-12

                                                                         Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                                     General Plan/Water Resources Element
to “provide a vehicle to attract support for a regional water conservation program and coordinate
implementation of activities by forming partnerships to obtain common measurable goals.”3
Goals of the AWAC include the reduction of regional water use by 10% gross per capita by 2010
and 15% gross per capita by 2015.
The California Public Utilities Commission adopted a Water Action Plan in 2005 with the
primary objective to strengthen water conservation programs of regulated water utilities. This
plan also contains a number of specific actions designed to increase water conservation
programs.
AVR and Golden State work closely with the County of San Bernardino and the Town of Apple
Valley to encourage water conservation. The County has promulgated several General Plan
policies that both require and encourage water conversation. Furthermore, the County requires
the use of drip irrigation systems or systems of equivalent efficiency for all landscaping at
commercial facilities and all common areas of residential developments.
The Town of Apple Valley adopted a Water Conservation Plan ordinance (Development Code
Chapter 9.75) that includes water regulations prohibiting wasteful water use practices, including
washing driveways and walkways with water and excessive runoff of landscape irrigation water.
Penalties have been established for violation of these regulations. In addition, a goal of 10%
municipal conservation by 2020 has been established by MWA, and in an effort to meet this goal
development within the Town shall follow the recently adopted MWA 2005 Urban Water
Management Plan.4
The availability of water supplies for local purveyors to meet the demand associated with build
out of the General Plan is dependent upon MWA’s ability to manage the basin and to implement
whatever additional infrastructure projects and water management actions are needed to continue
to recharge the groundwater basin, maintain groundwater levels, secure additional sources of
supply and protect groundwater quality. MWA’s Supplement A: 2005 Urban Water Management
Plan Update, concludes that adequate supplies will be available through 2030. This availability is
based on a combination of project demand management measures, increased reliance on stored
groundwater, and management mechanisms implemented through the Mojave Basin Judgment,
Warren Basin Judgment, and the MWA Regional Water Management Plan.
WATER QUALITY
Groundwater quality is dependent upon a number of factors, including the water source, type of
water-bearing materials in which groundwater water occurs or is stored, depth to the water table,
proximity to faults, presence of surface or subsurface contaminants, and quality of well
maintenance. The Consumer Confidence Report generated by AVR states that the local water
quality within the Town is considered to be very high. According to this report, hundreds of
water samples are taken every month and analyzed to assure AVR complies with all federal and
state drinking water standards. Similarly, Golden State Water Annual Water Quality Report
provides testing results for approximately 80 types of constituents. In many instances, water

quality in Golden State wells exceeds U.S. EPA and California Department of Health Services
standards.
Total Dissolved Solids
Based on data provided in the AVR 2006/2007 Annual Water Quality Report, AVR water wells
within the Town of Apple Valley contain total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations ranging
from 120 to 960 milligrams per liter (mg/L), with an average of 248 mg/L. The State Maximum
Contaminant Level (MCL) is 1,000 mg/L. AVR indicates that run-off and leaching from natural
deposits are the potential sources of TDS.
The Golden State Water Company Water Quality Report for 2007 shows TDS concentrations in
its wells ranged from 400 to 470 mg/L (average 435 mg/L) based on year 2005 sampling data for
the Apple Valley North system. In the Apple Valley South system, year 2006 sampling data
show these concentrations within a range of 120 to 680 mg/L, averaging 310 mg/L.
Nitrates
The long-term discharge from on-lot septic systems has the potential to adversely impact
groundwater supplies. The greatest impacts to groundwater quality are expected to occur where
septic systems serve large populations in high densities. Well-maintained community sewer
systems provide excellent protection of groundwater resources through the prompt removal of
sewage materials and levels of treatment at the plant and in the soil column to assure safe
recharge into the subsurface groundwater basin.
AVR water quality data for 2006/2007 indicate that AVR wells average concentrations range
between 2.5 and 17 parts per million (ppm) of nitrates as NO3, with an average of 6.4 ppm. The
State MCL and Public Health Goal (PHG) or Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) is 45
ppm.
Golden State water quality data for nitrates shows concentrations at a range of between 5.7 to 7.7
mg/L, averaging 6.7 mg/L in the Apple Valley North system. For Apple Valley South, nitrate
concentrations ranged from "not detectable" to 5.0 mg/L, with an average of 2.8 mg/L.
Sampling data for both systems was from year 2006.
As discussed in the Water, Wastewater and Utilities Element, approximately 30 percent of the
Town of Apple Valley is connected to the existing sewer system. The Town adopted a Sewer
Connection Policy in January 2006 requiring all new single-family subdivisions with lots less
than one acre and within one-half mile of existing sewer infrastructure to connect to the Town
sewer system. Developers of subdivisions with less than one-acre lots and located further than
one-half mile from existing sewer lines are required to install a dry sewer system on-site. The
policy provides for options to the dry sewer requirement, which are subject to Town and/or
California Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB) approval. These include an
interim holding tank system or a community septic system, both of which are designed as sewage
collection and treatment systems located within the developments they may serve. Many of these
systems will be abandoned over time, as future development occurs and infrastructure is
expanded, thereby allowing projects on their own collection and treatment systems to connect to
the larger community system. Given the costs to convey wastewater from many areas of the
                                                                           Environmental Resources
                                                                                               III-14

Town that are outside the existing wastewater treatment system to the VVWRA, the Town has
identified areas where sub-regional wastewater treatment plants might be located to serve
existing and future development. The possible expansion of these facilities is further discussed in
the Water, Wastewater and Utilities Element.
WATER QUALITY REGULATION
Water quality control efforts are legislated through a variety of federal and state laws and
regulations that are intended to ensure that water quality control efforts are adequately planned,
implemented and enforced. On the federal level, these include the Clean Water Act and the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The State of California has enacted water quality
statutes and administrative laws such as the California Water Code, California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) and California Code of Regulations, as well as other applicable codes that
include the Health and Safety Code, Fish and Game Code and Public Resources Code.
California Water Code (Section 13260) requires “any person discharging waste or proposing to
discharge waste that may affect waters of the State, except to a community sewer system, to file
a report of waste discharge with the regional board of that region” where densities exceed two
(2) dwelling units/acre. Commercial and industrial wastewater discharges are also subject to
these requirements where discharge volumes exceed certain thresholds.
The California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Lahontan Region (CRWQCB),
implements federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to water quality. The Town and the
CRWQCB have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that allows the Town to
issue building permits for development projects that use individual septic systems without
obtaining RWQCB approval, based on certain conditions.
As discussed above, the CRWQCB addresses issues regarding septic and sewer systems, as well
as concerns about the Mojave River and other sources of surface water. CRWQCB oversight and
monitoring also includes responding to illegal discharges of human or animal waste, leaking fuel
storage tanks, and unauthorized hazardous and toxic materials dumping sites.
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) was adopted in 1990. It
implements the federal Clean Water Act and requires that municipalities develop, adopt and
implement storm water management plans and programs. The NPDES is intended to ensure that
local jurisdictions “effectively prohibit non-storm water discharge into the storm drain and
require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants from storm water systems to waters of the
United States to the maximum extent possible.” CEQA analysis is not required for pollutant
control measures. The Town of Apple Valley’s NPDES program is managed by the Town
Engineering Division.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Apple Valley and other Southern California communities will need to continue to focus on water
conservation measures and wise water usage policies and practices. The Town’s development
code requires that developers utilize water-efficient irrigation design and drought-tolerant
landscaping materials; the use of water-conserving home appliances and fixtures is also
encouraged. The Town will continue to work with AVR, Golden State, and other water
companies serving the Town and Sphere of Influence to further reduce water consumption.
Groundwater pollution or contamination can affect a region as well as a local jurisdiction, since
groundwater subbasins in the planning area overlap jurisdictional boundaries. Extension of sewer
services within the Town will aid in the protection of the region’s groundwater quality.
In order to ensure adequate water supplies for future development of the Town, additional long-
term sources for ground water, including but not limited to imported water and the use of
reclaimed water, will need to be secured. New development will generate a need for additional
water capacity. The responsibility for provision of this additional water for future development
projects will rest largely on the new development.

                                                       General Plan / Open Space & Conservation Element
OPEN SPACE & CONSERVATION ELEMENT
PURPOSE
Thoughtful planning and resource management will enable the Town of Apple Valley to
preserve and enhance the community’s open space areas and conservation lands, and to assure
that long-term growth within the Town and vicinity does not adversely affect natural resources.
The Open Space and Conservation Element is intended to provide for the inclusive long-term
preservation and conservation of valuable natural resources and open space lands located within
the General Plan study area. The Element identifies the location of important natural resources
including water resources, mineral deposits, scenic resources, and recreational opportunities and
sets forth guidelines for the protection and conservation of such resources.
One of the major objectives of the Open Space/Conservation Element of the General Plan is to
identify and protect both public and private lands that contain valuable natural resources through
preservation. The protection and management of such lands ensures that natural resources remain
intact and invaluable ecosystem functions are preserved, thereby maintaining the quality of life
and the aesthetic value of the
community.       In    order     to
accomplish      this    objective,
natural resources within the
Town’s planning area have been
identified and classified.
Policies and programs have
been set forth in this element to
allow future growth without
compromising the protection
and preservation of natural
resources. These will serve as a
mechanism        to     safeguard
important natural resources and
maintain undisturbed open
space areas. They also function to assure the long-term viability of open space and conservation
lands by discouraging the inappropriate conversion of these lands to more intensive uses.
Conservation and open space have been integrated into one comprehensive element of the
General Plan. State law requires that open space and conservation elements and management of
natural resources prevent waste, and minimize the destruction or neglect of vacant lands. The
Open Space Element emphasizes open space as a land use designation, and requires that
preservation and management of natural resources be considered in land use planning and
decision-making. This combined Open Space and Conservation Element describes methodology
                                                                              Environmental Resources
                                                                                                  III-20

                                                                      Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                      General Plan / Open Space & Conservation Element
for the management and preservation of open space lands within the Town of Apple Valley,
thereby meeting the requirements of both elements under law.
BACKGROUND
The issues and subjects within this Element relate directly and indirectly to many other elements
of this General Plan, and have a direct influence on policies and programs set forth in the Land
Use Element. Parks and Recreation, Energy and Mineral Resources, Biological and Cultural
Resources, Water Resources, and Geotechnical Elements are also pertinent to this Element.
Open space land is generally defined as any parcel or area of land or water that is essentially
unimproved, vacant, or devoted to an open space use. Such lands are designated for the
preservation of natural resources, including plant and animal species; for passive recreational
uses; or for the production of resources, including agricultural production and mineral extraction
(Government Code 65560(b)). The Open Space Lands Act (Government Code 65566) requires
that local governments prepare open space plans prior to adopting required open space
ordinances. The Act helps assure consistency between the open space plan and zoning
regulations.
Government Code Section 65563 requires that every city and county prepare and adopt a local
open-space plan that assures the comprehensive and long-range preservation of open space land
within its jurisdiction. This plan, which must be submitted to the Secretary of the Resources
Agency, may consist of the Open Space Element that is adopted by the Town Council, and must
contain specific programs that will implement the open-space plan (Government Code Section
65565). Building permits, subdivision maps, and open-space zoning ordinances must be
consistent with the open-space plan (Government Code Section 65567).
The General Plan must also include elements that address issues of resource conservation,
including development, utilization, and reclamation, prevention of pollution or resource
degradation, and protection of watersheds (Government Code Section 65302(d)). The Energy
and Mineral Resources, Air Quality, and Water Resources elements of this Plan also discuss
these issues.
OPEN SPACE CATEGORIES
Within the Town of Apple Valley and the Sphere of Influence there are four categories of open
space land use designations: open space for the preservation of natural resources; open space for
resource management; open space for recreation; and open space for public health and safety.
The following discussion defines each of these open space categories.
The designation of an area as Open Space does not preclude all other use of the land. Such a
designation recognizes the importance of resources that need to be protected from the over-
development of uses, which could upset or diminish the value of the resource.
The discussion below describes each category of Open Space, and identifies the lands within the
Town, which meet the definition of that category.
                                                                             Environmental Resources
                                                                                                 III-21
                                                                        Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                        General Plan / Open Space & Conservation Element
Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources
The preservation of natural resources refers to open space areas that are utilized for the
protection of scenic resources, plant and animal resources, and crucial habitat for animal or plant
species, as well as areas required for ecologic reserves and scientific study. Hillside preservation
lands, including slopes greater than 15%, trails, and riparian areas are among those lands that are
to be preserved in the long term as an open space resource. The Biological Resources Element
further describes the value of this open space category.
Conservation of unique and valuable habitat is increasingly important due to the number of
federally listed species in the region. Conservation areas for most species of concern are
identified in the Biological Resources Element, and will be addressed in the Town of Apple
Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan, which is currently (2008) being prepared.
The MSHCP will set forth guidelines and criteria that identify biologically important areas
within the Town and Sphere of Influence and establish policies and programs to preserve these
areas as open space for the preservation of natural resources.
The following provides brief descriptions of open space areas that should be considered for the
preservation of natural resources.
Riparian Areas Along the Mojave River
The Mojave River represents an important water resource and associated riparian habitat within
the Town of Apple Valley. The Mojave River is ephemeral, originates in the San Bernardino
Mountains, and flows underground in some places. It creates a greenbelt through the High
                                                                       Mojave Desert. Protection of
                                                                       riparian areas along the
                                                                       Mojave River will help
                                                                       maintain water quality as well
                                                                       as preserve key habitat and
                                                                       wildlife corridors for plant and
                                                                       animal species. In addition,
                                                                       preserving the floodplain as
                                                                       Open Space is important in
                                                                       maintaining public health and
                                                                       safety by reducing potential
                                                                       impacts as a result of flooding.
                                                                       The Mojave River corridor is
                                                                       presently       utilized       for
                                                                       recreation via the trails and
                                                                       paths along the river’s edge.
Utilization of the riparian and floodplain areas for development along, or adjacent to, the Mojave
River must be carefully evaluated and planned due to the river’s importance as a water resource
and as a critical habitat and wildlife corridor for many animal and plant species in the area. As
shown in Exhibit III-3, Open Space Classes, the Mojave River occupies approximately 639.2
acres within the Town of Apple Valley.
                                                                               Environmental Resources

                                                                       Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                       General Plan / Open Space & Conservation Element
Wildlife Preservation
Many species of wildlife inhabit the Town of Apple Valley and the Sphere of Influence. Several
of these species are listed by the State of California or the Federal government as threatened or
endangered. The Town must ensure that viable habitat for these species is protected in order to
maintain and preserve diversity in desert and riparian ecosystems. Within the Town, the most
important wildlife preservation areas are associated with the Mojave River and ephemeral
streams (also please see Biological Resources Element).
Desert Preservation
Desert ecosystems are fragile environments that regenerate slowly after disturbance. Destruction
of this environment can result in negative environmental impacts, such as increased temperature,
humidity, particulate air pollution, and loss of biotic elements that make the region unique. In
order to maintain the integrity of these lands, the Town has designated open space land use
throughout the general plan area (See Exhibit III-3).
Knolls, Mountains, and Peaks
There are a number of mountains and peaks within and near the Town of Apple Valley. The
Summit of Bell Mountain is 3,852 feet above sea level and is located in the northern portion of
the Town. Fairview Mountain is northeast of Apple Valley, and has a peak elevation of 4,288
feet above sea level. The Town’s knolls, mountains, and rock outcroppings occupy an estimated
1,792.4 acres within the Town of Apple Valley, and should be preserved for their aesthetic
quality, habitat, and use as a recreational resource.
Scenic Resources
The protection of local scenic resources is necessary for the overall livability of the community
and to maintain the aesthetic qualities of the Town and vicinity. The Mojave River, surrounding
knolls, hillsides, mountains, and the natural desert environment are an important natural resource
that should be preserved as Open Space.
Open Space for Resource Management
The management of natural resources refers to those lands that contain open space resources that
are utilized for a specific purpose, such as agricultural lands, cultural resource lands, areas
containing major mineral deposits, areas of economic importance for the production of food or
energy, and areas required for recharging groundwater or for water storage.
Agricultural Lands
The use of lands for agricultural purposes has played a significant role in Apple Valley’s history.
Although no significant agricultural lands remain within the Town (less than 40 acres), the
Sphere of Influence contains 1,991.6 acres that are designated for agricultural uses. Agriculture
serves as a productive use of open space and enhances the rural character of the community.
There are 403.6 acres within the Sphere of Influence that are currently used for agricultural
production. The remaining 1,588.0 acres do not have an established agricultural use and remain
vacant.
                                                                              Environmental Resources
                                                                                                  III-23

                                                                              Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                              General Plan / Open Space & Conservation Element
Lands within the Town limits that were historically used for agricultural purposed have trended
toward animal keeping and equestrian activities rather than crop production. As lands within the
Town build out, the potential for agricultural uses within the Town limits diminishes.
Williamson Act
The California Land Conservation Act of 1965, commonly referred to as the Williamson Act,
allows local governments to enter into contracts with private landowners to restrict specific
parcels of land to agricultural or related open space use. Landowners in return receive lower-
than-normal property tax assessments, based upon farming and open space uses as opposed to
full market value. Local governments receive an annual subsidy of property tax revenues from
the state.
Based on information provided by San Bernardino County, there is one Williamson Act contract
in effect over approximately two acres in the Town of Apple Valley.5 It is located north of
Seneca Road near the Mojave River. 6
Archaeological/Historical Resources
There is an abundance of materials of a historic and prehistoric nature in the Apple Valley area,
particularly in the vicinity of the Mojave River. The river itself was a route heavily used by the
early Spanish explorers. The preservation of these materials is important to understanding the
history of the Indian nations, the United States, and the history of North America in general. The
Cultural Resources Element discusses the location and value of archaeological/historical
resources within the Town.
Mineral Resources
Mineral resources are naturally occurring deposits that are considered useful in the production of
materials. Important mineral resources that occur in the Apple Valley area are aggregate and
limestone, both of which are used in the manufacturing of cement. The availability of these
resources has the potential to be significantly impacted and restricted by urbanization or
development of nearby properties.
Current sources of aggregates and limestone are, for the most part, located within the Sphere of
Influence and are found adjacent to the Mojave River floodplain or within the mountain ranges
in the region. The State of California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and
Geology, as required by the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA), has
identified significant aggregate deposits within the Town of Apple Valley and Sphere of
Influence. The State has established a classification system for mineral resources, based on the
presence or absence of significant concrete-grade aggregate deposits. These land classifications
are presented in the form of Mineral Resource Zones (MRZ). These are further discussed in the
Energy and Mineral Resources Element..

                                                      General Plan / Open Space & Conservation Element
As described in the Department of Conservation’s 2006 Geological Survey, “Aggregate
Availability in California,” the Barstow Victorville P-C Region contains 133 million tons of
permitted aggregate resources as of January 1st, 2006. In Apple Valley, the Mineral Resource
Zones where significant mineral resources have been determined or inferred to be present are
located primarily along the Mojave River and near the western boundary of the Town, east of
U.S. I-15. Most to the Town, as well as the annexation areas, has been mapped within MRZs
containing known mineral deposits of undetermined significance. Areas available for mining
concrete aggregate are identified as Aggregate Resource Areas (ARA) and are considered to
have current land uses compatible with mining. In Apple Valley these occur along the Mojave
River. Mapping of MRZs and ARAs within the planning area is shown in the Energy and
Mineral Resource Element.
The Town of Apple Valley has designated 452.5± acres as mineral resources land use. Of these
lands, approximately 111.56 acres are developed for mining and processing of aggregate
materials, and an additional 340.95± acres are designated for the use and production of mineral
resources.
Both CEMEX, Inc. and TXI Riverside Cement own and operate mineral extraction operations in
the Sphere of Influence. TXI has a permit through 2034 to mine the quarry. Several quarries are
located within the Black and White Mountains, and the Alvic and Scheerer quarries are mined
for limestone. The Piercy quarry has been sold for use as open space on the approved Bridle Path
Specific Plan site.
It is expected that development proposals will be submitted to the Town that may generate land
use conflicts with aggregate and limestone quarries. Mining activities may be incompatible with
surrounding land uses. For example, dust, noise, and heavy truck traffic may create conflicts
with residential and commercial uses. These issues are further considered in the Land Use
Element and the Energy and Mineral Resources Element.
Soil Conservation
To protect community infrastructure and agricultural uses, conservation of specific soil types is
necessary. The identification of soil types can assist in developing programs to conserve soils
and protect prime agricultural lands. Although no significant agricultural lands occur within the
Town’s limits, preservation of these resources occurring in the Sphere of Influence will assure
that agricultural productivity does not decline and the rural character of the Town and vicinity
are preserved. See the Geology and Soils Element for additional information pertaining to soils
and soil characteristics.
Resource Management Plans
In order to manage open space resources within the Town of Apple Valley, the Bureau of Land
Management has set forth the Desert Conservation Plan, which describes the overriding goals
and policies for open space management in the region. The plan identifies important open space
areas and unique geological features including steep slope areas exceeding 15%, the Mojave
River bottom, and Apple Valley Dry Lake. These areas are identified within Exhibit III-6 below.
The Biological Resources Element further describes conservation management plans in the
Town and Sphere of Influence.
                                                                             Environmental Resources
                                                                                                 III-25

                                                                          Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley

Open Space for Outdoor Recreation
Open space for outdoor recreation includes areas of outstanding scenic, historic and cultural
value, areas that are suitable for park and recreational purposes, and areas that can serve as links
between major recreation and open space areas, including utility easements, trails, and scenic
highway corridors. The Town’s Recreation and Park District’s Master Plan is a planning tool that
sets forth goals and policies for the development and implementation of such recreational
amenities and periodically evaluates those goals. This plan is further discussed within the Parks
and Recreation Element.
Open space for parklands is an important resource for providing recreational opportunities to
Town residents. The Town currently contains approximately 346.8 acres of existing recreational
resource lands, including Mini Parks, Community Parks/Athletic Fields, Neighborhood Parks,
and Special Use Parks. Another 65 acres of parks facilities are planned in approved Specific
Plans, and the Town owns 27 acres of currently undeveloped lands that are allocated for parks. In
addition to the active and passive recreation opportunities that the local parks provide, there are
also trails and facilities that support passive and active recreation on a regional scale. These
include local trails such as the Town’s lifeline trails, and numerous mountain trails for hiking and
biking, and other recreational activities including backpacking, camping, and horseback riding
within the Sphere of Influence and the vicinity.
Parklands
While many regional parks provide open space desert environments, there is a shortage of
developed parks for active recreation within the community. According to the National
Recreational Park Association, the park-to-population standard is 5 acres to 1,000 residents. The
Parks and Recreation Element of this General Plan provides effective and coordinated
implementation strategies to address park facility and development of recreational programs.
Equestrian Trails
Resolution No. 89-63 of the Town Council states in part “The establishment of a comprehensive
network of Town wide equestrian/ recreational trails will promote a continued rural lifestyle in
the Town of Apple Valley...” A suggested trail system and policies specific to recreation trail use
and development are included in this General Plan’s Circulation Element.
Open Space for Public Health and Safety
Lands that require special management or regulation because of hazards or special conditions are
referred to as open space for public health and safety. Open Space lands required for the
protection of public health and safety include air and water quality, water supply, the Mojave
River floodplain, and Apple Valley Dry Lake. (Also see the Geotechnical, Hydrology,
Emergency Preparedness, and Water Resources Elements for more detailed information).
Lands that are designated as open space for public health and safety have the potential for other
compatible uses. For example, land located within Apple Valley Dry Lake contains some
residential development, and lands adjacent to or within the Mojave River floodplain have been
proposed for use as recreational walking trails. Nonetheless, future or proposed development
within areas designated as open space for public health and safety should require special
                                                                                 Environmental Resources
                                                                                                     III-26

                                                                         Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                         General Plan / Open Space & Conservation Element
consideration prior to approval. The following natural conditions should remain as undeveloped
open space for the purpose of preserving public health and safety: flood control facilities,
mapped floodways, floodplains, and dry lake beds. Open Space for public health and safety is
important to water quality and supply, reducing loss/damage to private and public property, and
preserving air quality.
Air Quality
Adverse air quality is an important issue in the region and within the Town of Apple Valley.
Increased urbanization in the high desert is creating air pollution concerns where none had
existed in the recent past. Estimates of air pollutant levels based on the build out of land uses
described in the General Plan can be found in the General Plan Environmental Impact Report.
(See the Air Quality Element for additional information pertaining to air quality.)
Water Supply
Water supply in the Apple Valley area is and will continue to be an issue of paramount
importance. This issue affects most aspects of the community, from continued agricultural uses
and landscaping standards to building codes and, in some cases, the types of business that could
operate effectively within the Town. In addition, maintaining the water supply while meeting the
needs of residents is a priority. (The Water Resources/Quality discussion contained in the
General Plan EIR provides an assessment of the water supply versus demand at build out of the
General Plan.)
Water Quality
While the quality of water in Apple Valley is suitable for all purposes, future use of reclaimed
water will be a useful consideration to extend water resources in light of continued growth
Preservation of riparian areas, wetlands, and recharge areas is critical to maintaining good water
quality as most of these areas act as natural water filters.
Water Conservation
Conserving water is especially important in the desert environment where water resources are
scarce and annual precipitation is low. The Water Resources Element further discusses the
conservation of water resources.
Apple Valley Dry Lake
The dry lake occupies approximately 1,820.6 acres within the Town of Apple Valley. Although
the dry lake is considered a potential issue to public health and safety due to disturbance of
particulate matter and a subsequent degradation to air quality, the dry lake has been partially
developed in residential land uses. Restrictions imposed in the residential development
significantly limit the development potential on these lands.
Mojave River Floodplain
There are approximately 639.2 acres that have been designated as part of the Mojave River
floodplain within Town limits. Protecting lands within the floodplain from development will
avoid the potential for the loss of, or damage to, structures or buildings as a result of a flood.
                                                                                Environmental Resources

Open Space Land Use Categories
The Town of Apple Valley contains an estimated 5,341 acres of open space land uses including
mineral resources. Open Space land uses represents approximately 11.4% of the total area within
the Town boundaries. The types of designated open space land uses and the acreages of each are
shown in Table III-4, below.

LAND ACQUISITION
The designation of open space ensures that the development or preservation of natural resources
is consistent with the goals and policies of the Town. The mindful regulation of open space areas
can permit land to be used and/or preserved for the good of the entire community, while
remaining largely undeveloped. Many conservation programs and legislative enactments have
been put into effect that help conserve and retain open space within California, including the
Conservation Easement Act, Open-Space Easement Act of 1974, less-than-fee real property
interests, and the Scenic Deed Act.
The Conservation Easement Act
Civil Code Sections 815-816, also known as The Conservation Easement Act, was established to
encourage the dedication of open space lands for ongoing conservation. Under this act, a
conservation easement is a voluntary agreement that allows a landowner to limit the type or
amount of development on their property, while retaining private ownership of the land. The
purpose of a conservation easement is to retain land predominantly in its natural, scenic,
historical, agricultural, or open space condition. The easement is a binding contract that applies
to successive owners of the land. By granting conservation easements, a landowner can assure
that the property will be protected forever, regardless of who owns the land in the future.
Open Space Easement Act
The Open Space Easement Act of 1974 (Government Code Sections 51070-51097) gives local
governments the authority to accept easements granted to them or to non-profit organizations for
the purpose of conserving open space and agricultural lands.
The Scenic Easement Deed Act
The Scenic Easement Deed Act authorizes local governments to purchase land or scenic
easements, but offers no special mechanism for obtaining them. Permitted land uses are
regulated by the Act, and local governments are authorized to adopt an ordinance to establish
open space covenants with property owners. (Government Code Sections 6950-6954)
Land Trusts
The preservation of open space and natural resource lands can be facilitated through the use of
land conservation trusts. Public and private land conservation trust offers protection to open
space, agricultural lands, wildlife habitats and natural resource lands. Land trusts achieve their
objectives primarily through acquiring and managing interests in land.
The preservation of open space and natural resource lands can be facilitated through the use of
land conservation trusts. Trust funds can be used to acquire fee simple interest in real estate to
then manage or lease back holdings, or to purchase conservation easements that protect sensitive
land from development.
Land trusts are usually able to respond more quickly than governmental entities to purchasing
opportunities, since they are less restrained by formalities and regulations. In addition, they tend
to have more experience in helping public agencies with the technicalities of acquisition. Land
                                                                               Environmental Resources

                                                                       Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                       General Plan / Open Space & Conservation Element
trusts preserve environmentally sensitive open space and conservation lands. They pursue State
and Federal financing with grants and loans and other assistance methods for the preservation of
open space.
Methods of Funding Open Space
In order to finance the acquisition and management of open space lands, viable funding
mechanisms are essential. Some financing opportunities include State obligation bonds, grants
and tax increment financing. In addition, the California Legislature has helped organizations
create grant and loan programs that can aid open space financing. The following are available on
a competitive basis for specific projects:
•       Land and Water Conservation Fund/Department of Parks and Recreation
•       Habitat Conservation Program/Department of Parks and Recreation
•       Simms Trail Bill/Department of Parks and Recreation
•       Public Access Program/Department of Fish and Game
•       Wildlife Conservation Board/ Department of Fish and Game
•       Urban Forestry Program/California Department of Forestry
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The Town of Apple Valley contains many valuable natural resources and open space lands that
contribute to the desirability of the area by enhancing the quality of life in the community.
Ongoing preservation of open space areas and natural resources is a continuous effort that will
need to be pursued and evaluated by the Town as build out continues. Implementation of the
General Plan, Development Code, and other regulatory mechanisms will effectively promote
conservation and ensure that growth and development will not interfere with or interrupt open
space and conservation lands within the Town. Use of the development review process should be
encouraged in order to promote the dedication and conservation of open space lands by public
and private developers and landowners.
In addition, the Town of Apple Valley can play an important role in encouraging and supporting
the preservation efforts of non-profit and other conservation groups, and assist in acquiring other
open space lands, including locating federal and state grants for the purchase of conservation
easements and/or fee simple ownership interests.

BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
Government Code Section 65302(d) requires the General Plan to include an element that
provides for the conservation and preservation of wildlife resources and establishes inventories
of natural vegetation, fish and wildlife, including rare and endangered species and their habitats.
The Biological Resource Element evaluates and identifies Biological Resources that exist within
the Town of Apple Valley and its Sphere of Influence. For the purpose of this document,
Biological Resources include plants and wildlife species, their habitats, the ecosystems, and
ecosystem functions that support those habitats. This element is intended to identify the variety
of biological resources within the Town and vicinity, and provide management strategies for the
preservation and protection of the natural environment and the many biological resources that are
present in the area.
This Element provides a basis for understanding the biological resource issues that are inherent
to the planning area, offering information and sources that are intended to promote the protection
of biological resources and also allow for orderly build-out of the general plan. The element is
designed to guide decision makers towards land use decisions that protect critical environmental
resources. Goals, policies and programs are set forth within this element that ensure the long-
term preservation of biological resources.
BACKGROUND
Major policy issues presented within the Biological Resources Element are directly related to the
Land Use, Open Space/Conservation, and Soils/Geotechnical Elements. This Element is also
pertinent to the Parks and Recreation Element.
The Town of Apple Valley and the Sphere of Influence are located within the planning area for
the West Mojave Habitat Conservation Plan. Once established West Mojave Plan will be the
largest habitat conservation plan developed in the United States. The plan covers 9.3 million
acres in Kern, Los Angeles, Inyo, and San Bernardino Counties. The habitat conservation plan is
a regional effort designed to protect and plan for the preservation of the region’s biological
resources including plant and animal species and their habitats. It should be noted that the plan is
only active on Federal Lands, and that a complimentary plan is being developed for private lands
within the WEMO planning area.
The Biological Resources Element has been prepared in conformance with and is supportive of
the West Mojave Habitat Conservation Plan with regard to public lands. The Element has been
designed to influence and contribute to the effective implementation of conservation strategies,
goals, policies and programs within the Town of Apple Valley. The Town is also actively
working to develop a Multi-Species Habitat Conservation Plan to protect local environmental
resources.
                                                                              Environmental Resources
                                                                                                    III-37

                                                                     Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley
                                                             General Plan/ Biological Resources Element
Federal and state laws establish a number of regulations that govern and protect biological
resources, including habitat and wildlife species. Among the most effective laws for protecting
species and their habitat are the State and federal Endangered Species Acts, which establish laws
and regulations that directly and indirectly protect plant and wildlife species through the
identification of threatened and endangered species, and protection of listed species and their
habitat(s). In addition to the Endangered Species Acts, California has several regulatory agencies
responsible for encouraging the preserving biological resources including state enforcement of
the federal Clean Water Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and California Fish and Game Code.
REGIONAL SETTING AND THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
Apple Valley lies in the High Desert, between the City of Victorville and the communities of
Lucerne Valley on the southeast and Hesperia on the southwest. There is a mix of private and
public lands within the Town limits and its surrounding Sphere of Influence. Private lands tend
to predominate within the Town of Apple Valley and Federal lands, managed by the U.S. Bureau
of Land Management (BLM), form the largest land blocks within the surrounding Sphere of
Influence. These Federal lands are natural areas managed as open space, which both benefit and
characterize the overall setting of the Town.
Climate
The planning area is located in the southern portion of the Mojave Desert. The Mojave Desert is
considered a high desert with elevations ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 feet above mean sea level.
(MSL). Climate within the planning area is representative of a high desert ecosystem, including
extreme fluctuations of daily temperature, strong seasonal winds, and less than 5 inches of
annual precipitation.
Topography
Elevations within the Town and vicinity range from 2,550 to 4,800 feet above MSL. The north
face of the San Bernardino Mountains, south of Apple Valley, contains some of the higher
elevations in the region. Generally terrain within the boundary of Apple Valley consists of lower
elevations ranging from 2,550 to 3,186 feet above MSL, while the Sphere of Influence contains
elevated terrain as high as 4,800 feet. There are scattered mountains north and east of the
planning area as well. The lowest elevation within the planning area is associated with the
Mojave River, located on the west side of Town.
The mountain drainages and ephemeral streams associated with the Mojave River have
contributed to the topography of the region. The Mojave River is a federally regulated waterway
that contains several associated tributary dry washes, including the Bell Mountain/Knolls wash,
which contains a partially lined concrete drainage basin that ultimately drains into the Mojave
River. Other watercourses in the planning area flow into the Apple Valley Dry Lake. Most of
these are considered to be ephemeral in that they rarely contain overland water flow and
generally have poorly defined banks. An exhibit showing potential streambed and appropriate
jurisdiction is shown in Exhibit III-4.
                                                                            Environmental Resources
                                                                                                  III-38

Regional Habitats And Natural Communities
General vegetation types within the Town of Apple Valley have been classified into distinct
natural communities. Minimally disturbed areas in Apple Valley support a Saltbush Scrub plant
community in lower elevation areas, Creosote Scrub in mid-elevation areas, and a low-diversity
Mojave Mixed Woody Scrub or Joshua Tree Woodland in the highest elevations. Joshua Trees
occur as a minor component in these plant communities, with the densest Joshua Tree stands
occurring in the southwestern portion of Apple Valley. The western portion of Apple Valley
contains Mojave Riparian Forest, which is associated with the Mojave River. Landscaped areas
and more disturbed areas are classified as non-native communities. The several separate natural
communities represented in the Apple Valley General Plan planning area include:
Saltbush Scrub
This type of vegetation is found within the eastern portion of the Town limits and the Sphere of
Influence. It is generally comprised of Saltbush, Allscale, and Shadscale. Joshua Tree,
Cheesebush, Anderson Boxthorn, and Cholla are also sometimes a component of this vegetation
type.
Mojave Riparian Forest
This habitat consists of small areas of water-dependent plants, and is supported by the Mojave
River that flows through the western portion of the planning area. Specifically, the Upper
Narrows River contains an extensive Mojave Riparian Forest. This community is dominated by
Cottonwood, Willow, Saltcedar, Quailbush, Rabbitbrush, and Saltgrass. Although this habitat
represents only a small proportion of the planning area, it is valuable for the diversity of wildlife
that it supports.
Wash Vegetation
There are a number of small washes within the Town of Apple Valley and the Sphere of
Influence that support specific species including Rabbitbush, Cheesebrush, and Brickellbush.
This community type may be associated with Mojave Riparian Forest species and usually
contains some non-native grasses and flowering plants.
Sandfield Plant Community
This community assemblage is found within the
upstream area of the Mojave River where water flow is
primarily subsurface, except during times of heavy
rainfall. Vegetation is generally limited to short lived
annual plants, and lacks perennial species.
Representative species include Sand Verbena, Tiquilia,
Sandpaper Plant, Saltbush, and Ricegrass.
Joshua Tree Woodlands
Found on alluvial slopes with sandy/loamy soils, this
community type often contains California Buckwheat,
Green Ephedra, Desert Needlegrass, Paperbag Bush, and may contain Mojave Yucca. This
vegetation type is observed south of the Town within the Sphere of Influence.
                                                                             Environmental Resources
                                                                                                   III-41
                                                                     Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley
                                                             General Plan/ Biological Resources Element
Creosote Bush Scrub
This community type is the predominant vegetation type within the Town of Apple Valley and
the Sphere of Influence. This community is composed of Creosote Bush, Burrobush, Golden
Cholla, Pencil Cholla, Beavertail, Cheesebush, Boxthorn, Rabbitbrush, and may contain Joshua
Trees.
Mojave Mixed Woody Scrub
This community assemblage is limited to small patches within the Town limits, and occupies
larger swaths of land within the Sphere of Influence east of the Town. Steep and rocky soils that
are shallow and overly drained tend to support this community. Buckwheat, Bladderpod,
Beavertail, Goldenbush, Cheesebush, and some cactus species such as Clustered Barrel Cactus
and Hedgehog Cactus are representative of this vegetation type.
Montane Woodlands
Located southwest of the Town limits is a small community of this vegetation type, which
extends south in the vicinity of the Sphere of Influence. This open woodland vegetation type is
dominated by California Juniper, Joshua Tree, and a number of shrubs including Blackbush,
Cliffrose, Turpentine Broom, and may contain an understory that is typical of Mojave Mixed
Scrub species.
Non-native Communities
The Town and Sphere of Influence contain non-native species interspersed within natural
assemblages. Within urbanized areas, non-native species tend to be associated with landscaping,
slope stabilization, and abandoned or vacant lots. Immediately adjacent to the Apple Valley
Airport and in disturbed land within residential areas of the Town, ruderal or weedy flora
predominate, with a few components of former native plant communities occasionally
represented. In the Sphere of Influence non-native species may occupy abandoned farmland, or
washes. Although not native, this community type provides open space and habitat and foraging
opportunities for a variety of common species.
WILDLIFE HABITAT AND FAUNA
Wildlife habitat in the Town and Sphere of Influence generally follow the natural community
descriptions. Within the Town and Sphere of Influence primary habitat is found within the
fragmented assemblages of Creosote, Saltbush, and Mojave Mixed Woody Scrub. These natural
communities are critical habitat types for numerous plant and animal species.
Developed and urban lands also provide habitat to a number of common species that are able to
survive in ruderal (weedy) plant communities or in proximity to urban development.
                                                                            Environmental Resources
                                                                                                  III-42
                                                                     Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley
                                                            General Plan/ Biological Resources Element
Common animal species identified in Apple Valley include invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles,
birds and mammals. Invertebrates include insects, such as ants (Harvester and Crater-nest ant),
beetles (Broad-necked Darkling beetle), bees (Honey and Bumble bees), scorpions (Sand and
Desert Hairy scorpions), as well as spiders (Daddy Longlegs, Black Widow, Desert Tarantula,
and orb weaver spiders) are located throughout the area. Amphibians primarily include frogs
(Pacific Tree frog and Bullfrog) and toads (Western and Red-spotted toad) commonly found in
the Mojave River corridor and various periodically wet habitats within the Town and Sphere of
Influence. Reptiles include lizards (western Whiptail, Zebra-tailed, Western Fence, Desert Night,
Southern Alligator, Desert Horned, and Side-blotched lizards), iguanas (Desert iguana), and
snakes (Western Patch-nosed, Spotted Leaf-nosed, Coachwhip, Glossy, Gopher, Sidewinder,
Mojave Rattle, and Speckled Rattle snakes), which can be found in habitats ranging from sand,
boulders, and Creosote scrub, to old woodpiles in more urbanized areas. Various bird species can
be found throughout Apple Valley, nesting in developed and undeveloped areas, including
common landscape features found in residential areas. Three hundred and one bird species have
been documented in and around the Town of Apple Valley (Myers 2007), and include sparrows,
finches, woodpeckers, and hawks, to name a few. And finally, mammals identified in the Town
and Sphere of Influence include larger species such as rabbits (Black-tailed jackrabbit and Desert
Cottontail), skunks (Spotted and Striped skunks), raccoons (Ringtail), fox (Kit fox) and coyotes,
as well as smaller species including mice (Pocket, Southern Grasshopper, and Deer mice), rats
(Kangaroo rat and Desert Woodrat), gophers (Botta’s Pocket gopher), and squirrels (White-tailed
Antelope and California Ground squirrels).
An assemblage of wetland-dependent species and associated riparian habitat is located in the
western portion of Apple Valley in conjunction with the Mojave River. The River is a significant
north/south corridor that links a number of natural communities within the planning area.
Similarly, hills, ridges (i.e., The Knolls, Falchion Boulderlands, Bell Mountain, Catholic Hill,
Bass Hill) and associated washes serve as important corridors for movement between Turtle and
Black Mountains located north of the planning area; Fairview Mountain to the northeast; the
Granite Mountains to the southeast; and the Juniper Flat foothills located within the San
Bernardino Mountains to the south. Linkage corridors are further discussed below.
Sensitive, Rare, And Endangered Species
A number of plant and animal species occurring within the Planning Area have been termed
Special Status Species due to a variety of designations issued by federal, state and/or local
governing authorities. Rapid urbanization in the region has led to the listing of some plant and
animal species as threatened, or endangered, while other species have been designated as
sensitive species.
Future development in Apple Valley must comply with laws and regulations affording protection
to special status and sensitive species. Land with potential habitats for these species is to be
evaluated prior to surface disturbance. Non-listed biological features, such as state
streambeds/federal waters, Joshua Trees and rare plants/animals, are also to be evaluated in site-
specific environmental reviews, which identify all final necessary mitigation and permitting
requirements. The following briefly describes Apple Valley’s sensitive, rare, and/or endangered
species.

 “Endangered” species are those considered in imminent danger of extinction due their limited
numbers or loss of habitat, while “Threatened” species refers to those likely to become
endangered within the foreseeable future, primarily on a local scale, and “Sensitive” species are
those that are naturally rare or have been locally depleted or put at risk by human activities.
Tables III-5 through III-10 provide a list of sensitive species that have been reported by federal
and state wildlife agencies and quasi-public conservation organizations as potentially occurring
within the Town and Sphere of Influence.

Ecosystem Management and Biodiversity Protection
Ecosystems are composed of complex interactions between species and the natural environment
that represent the culmination of evolutionary processes including soil formation, waste disposal,
air and water purification, nutrient cycling, solar energy absorption, and biogeochemical and
hydrological cycles. While the complexity of the earth’s ecosystems are not fully understood, it
is clear that every part of an ecosystem fills an important role and helps to maintain a balanced
and healthy system.
Ecosystem management integrates ecological, economic, and social goals in a unified manner,
which is an important step towards protecting biodiversity and encouraging healthy ecosystems.
                                                                                             Environmental Resources
                                                                                                                 III-47

                                                                        Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley
                                                                General Plan/ Biological Resources Element
Successful management operates under the principle that environmental components are
interrelated. Legislation, policies, and management plans that seek to restore, maintain, and
safeguard ecological systems will preserve environmental integrity for future generations.
Public Land Agencies and Ecosystem Management
Public land agencies aid in ecosystem management and biological resource protection. The
primary objective for these agencies is the safeguarding of cultural, scenic and biological
resources.
There are a number of public land agencies in the Town of Apple Valley and the vicinity that
work together to manage the region’s open space lands. Federal agencies include the National
Park Service, the United States Forest Service, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and the
Bureau of Land Management. On a state level, agencies include the California Department of
Fish and Game, State Water Quality Control Board, and the California Department of Parks and
Recreation. Lands owned and managed by these agencies and organizations may, among other
uses, provide for recreational uses, which has the potential to impact and disturb the land to
varying degrees.
Endangered Species Acts
Endangered Species Acts establish laws and regulations that directly and indirectly protect plant
and wildlife species through the identification of threatened and endangered species, protection
of listed species, and their habitat(s). The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA), enacted in 1973,
established powerful legislation for the protection of biological resources. This act set forth
regulations that required identification of all endangered species and populations with an
emphasis on “game” animals in order to preserve as much biodiversity as possible. The
Department of Commerce, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is
responsible for marine mammals and anadromous fish, while the U.S. Department of the Interior,
through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is responsible for the protection of most threatened
and endangered species. The structure of the Endangered Species Act contains the following
components:
     1.      Listing of species and designation of critical habitat;
     2.      Recovery planning; and
     3.      Prohibitions and exceptions to prohibitions.
A wide range of activities involving endangered species is regulated by the ESA, including
accidentally or intentionally “taking” (harassing, harming, pursuing, hunting, shooting, trapping,
killing, capturing or collecting), importing into or exporting out of the United States (possessing,
selling, transporting or shipping), and selling or offering for sale any endangered species.
Violators of the ESA are subject to fines up to $100,000 and one-year of imprisonment. As of
February, 2008, the United States had 1,351 species on its endangered and threatened species
lists, 9 proposed for listing, and about 283 candidate species waiting to be considered.
Private land is essential in the protection of endangered species, since nearly eighty percent of
habitat for more than half of all listed species occurs on such properties. Regulatory agencies
have been successful in establishing precedent for the protection of species on private lands. In
                                                                               Environmental Resources
                                                                                                     III-48

                                                                       Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley
                                                               General Plan/ Biological Resources Element
1995, the Supreme Court ruled that destroying habitat is as harmful to endangered species as
directly taking them. In order to provide a nexus for private land owners with threatened or
endangered species or habitat present on their land, the USFWS has been negotiating Habitat
Conservation Plans (HCPs) with public entities and private landowners, wherein a portion of
their land can be disturbed as long as the species benefit overall. Impacts to listed species can
also be addressed through a Section 7 consultation where a project includes a federal action.
California Endangered Species Act
At the state level, the Department of Fish and Game regulates and manages endangered species
through the provision set forth in Code Sections 2050 et. seq, which define the California
Endangered Species Act (CESA). State laws regulate the “take” of any endangered or threatened
species per Section 2080 of the Fish and Game Code where Take is defined as to “hunt, pursue,
catch, capture, or kill, or attempt to hunt, pursue, catch, capture, or kill” a protected species.
CESA allows for take incidental to otherwise lawful development projects, and emphasizes early
consultation with the Department to avoid potential impacts to rare, endangered, and threatened
species and to develop appropriate mitigation planning to offset losses of listed species
populations and their essential habitats caused by projects.
Section 2080 of the Fish and Game code allows the agency to authorize permits or
memorandums of understanding for individuals, public agencies, universities, zoological
gardens, and scientific or educational institutions, to import, export, take, or possess any
endangered species, threatened species, or candidate species of plants and animals for scientific,
educational, or management purposes.
This state law largely parallels the federal law, by providing similar requirements and mandates
as those described in the ESA. In addition, CESA prohibits the taking of endangered species and
species petitioned for listing at the state level. Plant species are also included under protection
within CESA, whereas the federal ESA only protects plants on federally owned lands or, where
there is a federal nexus on private lands. Such a nexus might include the existence of a federally
regulated resource or facility.
Town Responsibility under ESA and CESA
To ensure development projects minimize impacts to the environment, the Town of Apple Valley
is responsible for regulating development. In fulfilling this responsibility, the Town must make
certain that all proposed projects conform with the standards and mandates of both the federal
and state acts, as applicable. The Western Mojave Habitat Conservation Plan and the Apple
Valley Multi Species Habitat Conservation Plan (see below) must also conform to the standards
of both laws. In addition, both habitat conservation plans will assist the Town in implementing
its responsibilities under these laws.
                                                                              Environmental Resources
                                                                                                    III-49

                                                                       Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley
                                                               General Plan/ Biological Resources Element
Habitat Protection
Habitat protection, along with land conservation and ecosystem management, provides for
maximum biological diversity, ensuring the long-term protection of all species. Over the last few
years, advances in the field of conservation biology have given rise to a new discipline of
restoration ecology, which seeks to repair or reconstruct ecosystems that have been damaged by
human or natural forces. Restoration of degraded natural communities is an important factor in
reversing habitat loss and improving wildlife diversity and ecosystem functions. However, the
preservation of intact environmental systems, natural communities, and habitats before they are
degraded provides greater surety that these values do not have to be eventually recreated at a
greater cost to the Town. An important element in habitat preservation and restoration is the
connectivity of that habitat with the greater ecological system.
Habitat fragmentation is a severe threat to species’ survival. Fragmentation of natural
communities results in an overall decrease in habitat and creates isolated pockets of natural land
surrounded by human impacted areas. Habitat fragmentation leads to smaller populations with
less genetic diversity, and reduced biodiversity. Ecosystems become unstable when fragmented
and may result in negative changes, including increased predators, competitors and parasites.
Due to urbanization and human population growth, habitat fragmentation is one of the greatest
threats to species and the ecosystems upon which they rely.
Habitat Connectivity
Providing an interconnected network with established corridors is crucial in minimizing
biodiversity losses due to fragmentation.
The Town of Apple Valley and the Sphere of Influence contain areas of valuable habitat that
support special status species. These areas are identified in Exhibit III-6, and should be preserved
as open space, require species specific surveys for other land uses, and/or provide mitigation, if
impacted. Development of the Apple Valley MSHCP will provide important guidelines and
criteria for these habitats.
The Apple Valley MSHCP will establish guidelines for the preservation and maintenance of
wildlife movement corridors within the Town and vicinity. In the interim the Town will apply
standards set forth in the CEQA Guidelines for projects within or adjacent to Special Linkage
areas. The Mojave River corridor is an important linkage area within the western portion of the
Town and Sphere of Influence in that it links a number of natural communities within the
planning area. Washes also can serve as important corridors for movement between Turtle and
Black Mountains located north of the planning area; Fairview Mountain to the northeast; the
Granite Mountains to the southeast; and the Juniper Flat foothills located within the San
Bernardino Mountains to the south.
There are a number of special survey areas within the Town and Sphere of Influence that should
require species-specific surveys as part of the application process for projects and/or should be
considered for preservation as open space. These areas are depicted on Exhibit III-6, and include
the following species: Desert Tortoise, Mojave Ground Squirrel, Burrowing Owls. Joshua Trees,
and/or Migratory/Nesting/Other Protected Birds. In addition to the, washes and streams
                                                                              Environmental Resources
                                                                                                    III-50

                                                                        Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley
                                                                General Plan/ Biological Resources Element
delineated in Exhibit III-4, (Streams, Rivers, and Washes) special surveys using appropriate
agency methodology should conducted prior to development to delineate other jurisdictional
areas.
Habitat Conservation Planning
West Mojave Habitat Conservation Plan
The West Mojave Conservation Plan was developed by the Bureau of Land Management and is
the largest habitat conservation plan ever developed in the United States, encompassing 9.3
million acres of land within San Bernardino (including Apple Valley), Kern, Los Angeles, and
Inyo counties. This plan provides a comprehensive strategy to conserve and protect state and
federally listed species, as well as other special status species and their habitats.
Conservation of lands for specifically covered species, like the Desert Tortoise, Mojave Ground
Squirrel, Le Conte’s Thrasher, Burrowing Owl, etc., is mandated in the framework of this plan.
The approved West Mojave HCP is currently only applicable to federal lands, as it has only
completed NEPA certification. Local, state, and federal entities are in the process of developing
a private lands counterpart to the West Mojave Plan. However, the private lands HCP will have
a significantly reduced scope when compared to the federally adopted West Mojave Plan.
Apple Valley Multi-Species Conservation Plan
There are approximately 30 sensitive species found throughout the Town and within the Sphere
of Influence, including state and/or federally listed species such as the desert tortoise and the
Least Bell’s vireo. These listed species are protected by the state and/or federal Endangered
Species Acts (ESAs). Currently in the Town of Apple Valley, each individual development
project (private or public) that may impact a listed species is processed separately through the
state and/or federal permit processes to address compliance with the CESA and/or ESA.
Depending on the project and the biological impacts associated with it, the process takes a year
or more to complete. The processes are both time consuming and expensive.
On a parallel track with the General Plan Update, the Town is undertaking the preparation of a
Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP). The MSHCP will provide a means to
address impacts to sensitive and listed species in order to ensure that the updated General Plan
can be implemented, which will enable the Town to streamline the development entitlement
process while ensuring protection of sensitive environmental resources.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Participation in the Western Mojave Habitat Conservation Plan, and development of the Apple
Valley MSHCP is an important step by the Town for the long-term protection of important
biological resources on a local and regional level. The Western Mojave Plan establishes a
regional ecological preservation system that will be able to support important and intact
ecosystems and communities, while the Apple Valley MSHCP will provide for local
preservation within the Town, while encouraging thoughtful development. Through
implementation of the General Plan, and adherence to policies and programs, the Town can
continue to grow in a manner that is compatible with the natural environment.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND
HISTORIC RESOURCES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
Cultural resources are important in contributing to a community’s sense of place, and they
provide residents with a meaningful understanding of history and heritage; as such, these
resources are integral to Apple Valley. The Archaeological and Cultural Resources Element
describes the regional and local pre-history and history as well as the context of development in
the 20th century. This element also sets forth goals, policies and programs that preserve the
Town’s cultural heritage and are intended to help protect it for future generations.
BACKGROUND
California Government Code Section 65560(b) and Public Resources Code Section 5076
partially determine the issues addressed in the Archaeological and Cultural Resources Element,
which is directly related to the Land Use and Open Space and Conservation Elements of the
General Plan. Under Section 21083.2(g) of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a
community is authorized to require that sufficient research, documentation and preservation are
undertaken when the potential exists for significant cultural resources.
Development proposals are currently reviewed by The Town of Apple Valley to identify
potential impacts on archaeologically and culturally significant resources. Additional
comprehensive studies may be required if a potential for negative impacts is determined. Future
development proposals will be carefully evaluated to determine the need for site-specific cultural
resource assessments.
The Victorville-Apple Valley region has been continuously occupied by humans for thousands of
year. Therefore, while the Town of Apple Valley is a relatively ”new” community, there is
evidence that both prehistoric and historic cultural resources exist within portions of the Town
and Sphere of Influence. These are further discussed below.
The region has historically served as an essential transportation link between Southern California
and inland areas such as Utah and Santa Fe, New Mexico. The ancient Mojave Trail was used by
the Santa Fe Railroad in the 19th century, by the legendary U.S. Route 66 during the early and
mid-20th century, and most recently, by U. S. Interstate 15.
The Prehistoric Period
The Prehistoric Period identifies the time preceding the arrival of non-native peoples to the area
and when Native American society, based on traditions resulting from thousands of years of
cultural development, was intact and viable. During this period, the area’s proximity to the
                                                                              Environmental Resources
                                                                                                    III-56

                                                                             Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley
                                                    General Plan/ Archaeological and Historic Resources Element
Mojave River would have provided aboriginal groups a dependable source of water and
subsistence resources. The river was also a major route for interregional trade and exchange.
In the Mojave Desert region, the prehistoric period is generally divided into five sequential time
periods, beginning with the Newberry period and associated distinctive cultural changes in land
use occurring between 1500 B.C.–A.D. 500. The two ensuing periods, Saratoga (A.D. 500–
1200) and Tecopa (A.D. 1200–1700s) are characterized by seasonal group settlements near
accessible food resources. Many of the prehistoric sites identified in and around Apple Valley
include ancient habitation debris and rock shelters, with a number of rock art panels being
recorded. As expected, a significant number of these ancient sites occur along the banks of the
Mojave River.
Ethnohistory
The Town of Apple Valley is situated near the approximate boundary between the traditional
territories of the Vanyume and Serrano peoples. The Vanyume were probably related
linguistically to the Serrano, their southern neighbor, although politically they seem to have
differed. The Vanyumes’ population diminished rapidly between 1820 and 1834, at which time
southern California native peoples were removed to various missions. By 1900 the group had
virtually disappeared, and today very little is known about the Vanyume.
The name “Serrano” was derived from a Spanish term meaning "mountaineer" or "highlander."
The Serrano’s territory is centered at the San Bernardino Mountains, and includes the southern
rim of the Mojave Desert from Victorville to the east to Twentynine Palms. The nature of the
tribe's clan-based organization, as well as the lack of reliable data, make it difficult to assign
definitive boundaries for the Serrano territory.
Before contact with Europeans, the Serranos were mostly gatherers and hunters, and occasional
fishers, establishing settlements primarily where water flows emanated from the mountains. The
tribe was loosely organized by clans directed by hereditary leaders. These clans were affiliated
with one of two moieties. Members married outside their own clan and moiety. There was no
overall tribal union among the clans.
In the early 1770s Serranos experienced contact with Europeans, however Spanish influence on
their lifestyle was not discernible until mission was established on the southern edge of Serrano
territory in 1819. The mission period continued until 1834, and during this time most of the
Serranos in the San Bernardino Mountains, like the Vanyume, were removed to the nearby
missions. Present-day Serrano descendants can be found on the San Manuel and the Morongo
Indian Reservations.
Archaeological Resources in the Planning Area
A variety of resources were consulted to determine the presence of known archeological
resources in the planning area. These resources included historical maps, previous cultural
resource surveys, aerial photographs, topographic maps and other cultural records.4

                                               General Plan/ Archaeological and Historic Resources Element
Development in the Town, including residential and commercial structures and associated
landscaping and other improvements, has impacted much of the natural landscape. As a result,
surface evidence of prehistoric archaeological sites as well as early historic-period settlements
Based on a review of previous surveys, most of the Town and Sphere of Influence have not been
surveyed systematically for cultural resources, especially older development in the Town that
occurred prior to current federal and state regulations that require such surveys as a part of the
planning process. Most surveys have occurred where development has occurred in recent
decades, including areas along the Mojave River, where sensitive cultural resource sites are
concentrated.
Archaeological records in the California Historical Resource Information System identify a total
of 48 historical/archaeological sites in the Town and Sphere of Influence. Of these, 16 prehistoric
are (Native American) archaeological sites and 32 are historic-period sites. There are also seven
sites prehistoric in nature that are pending designation, and 28 isolates (localities with fewer than
three artifacts).
Of the recorded prehistoric sites, six have been identified as large Native American habitation
areas/villages along or in close proximity to the banks of the Mojave River, as have and five of
sites pending designation. Artifacts at these sites included rock shelters, bedrock milling
features, pictographs and/or petroglyphs on surfaces of boulders, human cremations and
associated grave goods, aboriginal trails, and midden. Gatherings of large, wide-spread Native
American living areas indicates that the Mojave River and its tributaries provided subsistence
resources for daily life.
Table III-11 lists the recorded Archaeological, Prehistoric and Historic sites within the area.
The Historic Period
Sites classified as “historic” are generally those older than forty-five to fifty years of age,
however, this category may also include older resources dating from the earliest European
contact (around the mid 1770s in the Apple Valley area) up to the end of World War II. trails and
Historic resources sites may range from highways to living areas and small-scale remains of
single activities.
The historic Mormon Trail, identified in the maps as "Road to Salt Lake City", is the only
evidence of human activity in the mid-1850s in the vicinity of the planning area. At its closest
point the trail traversed north-south direction approximately 3.5 miles northwest of Apple
Valley. Based on a review of historic mapping, there were no man-made features within or
adjacent to the Town and associated Sphere of Influence at that time. The earliest settlements by
other than Native peoples began to appear around 1860, however, due to the harsh environment
development was slow and population in the area remained sparse until after the mid-20th
century.

                                                                        Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley
                                               General Plan/ Archaeological and Historic Resources Element
Historical background research conducted for the General Plan has identified three phases in
which settlement and development of Apple Valley occurred during the historic period 1) the
1860s to the 1880s, 2) the 1890s to the mid 1940s, and 3) 1946 to present day.
Early Settlement (1860s-1880s)
Cattle herder Silas Cox is credited with the first semi-permanent development in the area, in
1860. A small gold rush in the San Bernardino Mountains in 1861 resulted in the development of
an important transportation route to the Apple Valley area. The Van Dusen Road, a wagon road
connecting Holcomb Valley to the Cajon Pass Toll Road, was constructed using funds raised by
miners.
There were several permanent settlements in and near Apple Valley around 1870, including the
Brown ranch, Atkinson's homestead, and McKenney and Taylor's supply station. Of these, the
best-known example of properties in this era was the Brown Ranch, later known as Rancho
Verde. At one time it exceeded 3,000 acres and extended from present-day Apple Valley and
Bear Valley Roads to the Upper Mojave Narrows.
The great southern California land boom of the 1880s brought other settlers to the region and
completion of the Santa Fe Railroad marked the beginning of serious settlement activities in the
area. Subsequent development has largely eradicated physical evidence of these early settlement
activities.
Agrarian Development (1890s-1940s)
With the initiation of activities by the Appleton Land and Water Company in the 1890s, the
second development phase of development began. The Company constructed a valley-wide
irrigation system to serve the extensive apple orchards it planted on the east side of the Mojave
River. This period was characterized by a gradually growing number of large cattle ranches and
apple plantations.
Settlers during this period launched a coordinated effort to boost the area’s image, and to this end
in 1910 created the Apple Valley Improvement Association. By the mid-1910s there were 14
major ranches in the Apple Valley area. These were clustered mostly along the Mojave River;
however, the total population remained relatively small (approximately 50),
Ursula Poates, the “Mayoress of Apple Valley, owned a number of these ranches and is credited
with naming the Town. None of these early ranches are currently in existence, however,
archaeological remains associated with these establishments are still to be found in less
developed portions of the Town and Sphere of Influence.
A new type of tourist industry began to develop in the area in the 1930s, evolving partly as a
consequence of the Great Depression, which largely resulted in the economic failure of the
orchards. Many of the ranch owners began to take advantage of their isolated desert setting and
marketed it to city-dwellers seeking health, relaxation, and recreation, converting their properties
into dude ranches, retreats and sanitariums, and the area attracted Hollywood film companies.
After flourishing for nearly a decade, these activities gradually diminished in the post-World
War II era and eventually vestiges of the orchards and ranches disappeared as other development
occurred in the area.

                                               General Plan/ Archaeological and Historic Resources Element
Birth and Growth of the Town (1940s-Present)
The third identifiable phase in the settlement and development of Apple Valley began in 1945
and was marked primarily by the town-building efforts of Newton Bass, Bud Westlund, and the
Apple Valley Ranchos enterprise. Later renamed the Apple Valley Building and Development
Company, the enterprise was reportedly the first business establishment of the post-WWII era to
plan and develop an entire community. Bass and Westlund conducted a series of high-profile
promotion campaigns that, over a 20-year period, effectively transformed the sparsely settled
desert lands into the area into a western-themed town of 11,000 residents. The Apple Valley
Ranchos Company oversaw development of several commercial and residential projects, such as
construction of the Branding Iron, the Bank of Apple Valley, and the Apple Valley Inn. The
Hilltop House was a new establishment used for entertaining potential buyers. Bass and
Westlund established an Architectural Board to review new project, avoid “boom town”
construction that might degrade or decrease the value of older buildings, and ensure that all
development in the community would "complement the natural beauty of the valley and of
building of permanence". This period prominently featured a rambling, California Ranch-style
architecture, which was typical of the era immediately following World War II and was fostered
by the scattered development patterns in the Town. For the most part commercial development
were clustered along State Highway 18.
A number of public facilities that were developed in the Town during this period were on lands
donated by Bass and Westlund. These included the James A. Woody Community Center, the
Yucca Loma Elementary School, and St. Mary's Academy. Other development included the El
Pueblo Shopping Center, the Black Horse Motel, the Terri Lee Doll Company, and the Buffalo
Trading Post. True to Bass and Westlund's original plan for “Apple Valley Ranchos”, now the
Town of Apple Valley, growth has been largely driven by residential and commercial
development. Finally, in 1988 the Town of Apple Valley was incorporated.
Archeological and Historical Resources in the Planning Area
Of the 48 known cultural resource sites within the defined area, 16 are pre-historic, however
most are from the historic period. The historic resources reflect the Town’s development along
transportation routes, as well as its evolution from a frontier settlement to a desert retreat
destination, from which it developed into a into a post-World War II boom town. Both historic
and pre-historic period sites are located along and within a mile of Mojave River, while the
remains of 19th and early 20th century homesteads and ranches are expected to occur in the
southern part of Town. Many of the residential and commercial buildings dating to the early
years of the present-day community of Apple Valley (1946-1960 are located between Apple
Valley Road and Central Road along State Route 18 (also known as Happy Trails Highway).

Archaeological and Cultural Resources Sensitivity Assessment
Based on the various research methodologies used to determine archaeological and cultural
sensitivity in the General Plan area, project archaeologists determined that the area within one
mile of the Mojave River appear to be highly sensitive for both prehistoric and historic-period
cultural resources. In this area the potential for subsurface archaeological deposits also exists.
There are sensitive historic period sites located along portions of State Route 18, and across
portions of the southern portion of the Planning Area. Sensitivity for prehistoric archaeological
remains has been identified in the northernmost planning area, including portions of the Town.
Records of previous surveys indicate that systematic and intensive-level surveys have been
conducted over approximately one-third of the total acreage of the Town and its Sphere of
Influence. Previously unsurveyed lands may contain prehistoric and historic sites that have not
been identified or recorded. Potentially sensitive resource areas are identified in Exhibit III-7.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION PROGRAMS
Federal Programs Available to the Town of Apple Valley
All federal agencies are required to assume responsibility for the preservation of historic
properties owned or controlled by the U.S. government, according to the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966. When involved in federal projects, such as some programs
funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, local governments may
take the lead in enforcing the NHPA.
                                                                                                          Environmental Resources
                                                                                                                                   III-63

                                                                          Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley
                                                 General Plan/ Archaeological and Historic Resources Element
The National Park Service and the State Historic Preservation Officers of each state administer
the Certified Local Government (CLG) program, a joint federal-state initiative providing
technical assistance and small grants to local governments for historic preservation purposes that
meet certain requirements. CLGs can benefit from historic preservation expertise, technical
assistance, information exchange, special grants, and statewide preservation programs
coordinated by the State Office of Historic Preservation (OHP).
The Secretary of the Interior maintains the National Register of Historic Places, a nationwide
inventory of sites, buildings, districts, structures, objects or other features with national, state, or
local historical significance. Currently, there are no National Register-listed resources located
within Town, although six sites have been determined as eligible for listing and a number of
others may also be eligible for inclusion.
State Programs Available to the Town
Established in 1992, the California Register of Historic Resources is the State of California’s
counterpart to the National Register of Historic Places. All properties listed in, or officially
determined to be eligible for the National Register, are included. The OHP also maintains a
listing of California Historical Landmarks, which designates properties of statewide importance,
and a listing of Points of Historical Interest, identifying properties of countywide or regional
importance. Registered properties may receive a variety of state historic preservation incentives,
such as property tax reductions, State Historic Building Code alternative building regulations,
California Heritage Fund benefits, special historic preservation bond measures, and seismic
retrofit tax credits. Further, under the Mills Act, the Town is authorized to offer incentives to
private property owners of qualifying historic properties. Funding may be used to rehabilitate
and maintain properties for no less than 10 years. As previously noted, the Mojave Trail and the
Mormon Trail are the two designated California Historical Landmarks that occur within or
partially within the Town or Sphere of Influence.
PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES
The potential for geological formations to produce fossils is evaluated based on what fossil
resources have been produced in the past at other nearby locations of similar geologic
composition. There are substantial exposures of Mesozoic-age (65,000,000 to 245,000,000 years
ago) rocks in more elevated portions of the Town that may contain no fossils. Shallow grading of
younger Quaternary alluvium that occurs throughout most of the area is not likely to reveal
significant fossil remains. Potential for the presence of significant non-renewable paleontological
resources exists where surface or subsurface Pleistocene-age (1,808,000 to 11,550 years ago)
soils occur in the planning area. High priority is also given to older sediments along the Mojave
River and at unknown depth below the surface.
Based on research of surface deposits, the soils in the planning area, which are relatively young,
have a low potential for containing significant fossil remains. Surface deposits may in some
areas constitute only a “veneer cover” that directly overlays older sediments; however, research
indicates that no fossils have been reported in Town. Reports have, however, identified localities
with fossil resources of an age that is similar soil deposits to those that occur in the Town and
Sphere of Influence. In the overall, research indicates that there is a range of likelihood from low
                                                                                 Environmental Resources
                                                                                                       III-64

                                                                         Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley
                                                General Plan/ Archaeological and Historic Resources Element
to high of encountering paleontological resources during future development projects; as
discussed above, the potential depends on the location and sediments encountered.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Public Resources Code Section 5020.1 defines “historical resources” including but not limited to
an object, building site, area, place, record, or manuscript that is historically or archaeologically
significant. Architectural, engineering, scientific, economic, agricultural, educational, social,
political, military, or cultural annals of California may also qualify as historical resources under
the PRC definition.
The manner in which the Town must review and address issues related to archaeological and
historic resources is identified by the California Environmental Quality Act. The CEQA
Guidelines state that the term “historical resources” applies to any such resources listed in or
determined to be eligible for listing in the California Register of Historical Resources. The
relevant criteria for determining significance are briefly described below.
1.      Association with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
        California’s history and cultural heritage.
2.      Association with the lives of persons important in our past.
3.      Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of
        construction, or representative of the work of an important creative individual, or
        possessing high artistic values.
4.      Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
The Town, when acting as Lead Agency, is required to ensure that archaeological, historical and
cultural sites within its jurisdiction, are located, identified, and evaluated to the greatest extent
feasible. The possibility of documenting and preserving archaeological and historic sites and
artifacts will diminish as the development continues in the community. The Town should
encourage the research and registration of appropriate sites and structures within its jurisdiction
in order to maintain its important traditions and heritage for future generations. Where future
development has the potential to negatively impact sensitive cultural resources, it will be
required to conduct site-specific cultural resources studies and mitigate any potential impacts.

AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Air Quality Element is intended to provide background information and disclose the
regulatory framework and physical environment that have the potential to affect the air quality in
the Town and region. The Air Quality Element identifies any components within the Town and
region that directly or indirectly affect air quality. Goals, policies, and programs are set forth in
this element that are designed to avoid, reduce, or limit impacts to air quality that may result
from build out of the General Plan.
This Element is intended, in conjunction with local and regional air quality planning efforts, to
address ambient air quality standards set forth by the federal Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB).
BACKGROUND
Over the past few decades, a noticeable deterioration in air quality has occurred in the Town of
Apple Valley and the region due to increased local development and population growth, traffic,
construction activity and various site disturbances. Although air pollution is emitted from various
sources locally, some of the degradation of air quality can be attributed to sources outside of the
Mojave Desert Air Basin (MDAB), in which Apple Valley is located, including air basins to the
west and southwest.
The Air Quality Element is directly related to a number of elements within the General Plan. The
Land Use and Circulation Elements have the greatest potential to directly affect the Air Quality
Element since local and regional air quality are directly influenced by land use types, patterns
and intensities. The Town’s circulation and transportation system, and the number, length and
timing of traffic trips, also impact local and regional air quality. Issues associated with
circulation are discussed in greater detail in the Circulation Element of this document.
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
Federal and state government air quality standards and regulations have been established to
monitor and regulate a variety of air pollutants and to assure that people and the environment are
not adversely impacted by poor air quality. The Town of Apple Valley is part of the Mojave
Desert Air Basin (MDAB) and is regulated on a regional level by the Mojave Desert Air Quality
Management District (MDAQMD).
Federal Regulation
The Clean Air Act (CAA) was initially passed by Congress in 1963 and has subsequently been
amended. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established the National Ambient Air
Quality Standards (NAAQS) in 1971, which set forth regulation that is intended to protect the
health and welfare of citizens and the economy by establishing primary and secondary air quality
standards. Primary standards are designed to protect sensitive sectors of the population such as
                                                                               Environmental Resources
                                                                                                     III-69

                                                                            Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley
                                                                            General Plan/ Air Quality Element
children and the elderly, whereas secondary standards protect the public welfare as related to
crops, buildings, and visibility. NAAQS are established for six criteria pollutants. These are
discussed individually below and shown in Table III-13.
State Regulation
On January 1, 1989 the state mandated California Clean Air Act (AB 2595) became effective,
and established health-based air quality standards at the state level. The bill established ambient
air quality standards and set forth deadlines for attainment. The California Air Resources Board
(CARB) developed these state standards, which are generally more stringent than federal
standards. For areas in non-compliance with federal standards, State Implementation Plans (SIP)
may be prepared to help regional air quality management districts meet the federal and state
ambient air quality standards by the deadlines specified in the federal Clean Air Act, and
emission reduction targets of the California Clean Air Act. The severity of the region’s air
pollution determines required emission reductions and attainment deadlines. In addition to
oversight of regional air pollution, CARB is charged with evaluating agencies and districts to
assure compliance with the California Clean Air Act requirements.
In 2006 the CARB approved the State Area Designations for criteria pollutants, which became
effective in July of 2007. CARB sets area designations for nine criteria pollutants: ozone, carbon
monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, sulfates, lead, hydrogen sulfide,
and visibility reducing particles.
Regional Regulation
As part of its responsibilities in regulating air quality in the MDAB, the MDAQMD is charged
with establishing air quality measurement criteria and relevant management policies for the
Town of Apple Valley, the Sphere of Influence, and neighboring communities within San
Bernardino County and the northeastern portion of Riverside County.
The Town of Apple Valley is subject to the provisions of the MDAQMD Rule Book7, which sets
forth policies and other measures designed to help the District achieve federal and state ambient
air quality standards. The Rule Book, along with the MDAQMD CEQA and Federal Conformity
Guidelines8, are intended to satisfy the planning requirements of both the federal and state Clean
Air Acts. The MDAQMD also monitors daily pollutant levels and meteorological conditions
throughout the District. The MDAQMD is also involved in regional management of air quality
through various attainment plans.
The County of San Bernardino, including the Town of Apple Valley, is in non-attainment for
ozone and particulate matter. In order to meet the requirements for basins that are in non-
attainment, the MDAQMD has established attainment plans for Ozone and PM10.

CRITERIA POLLUTANTS
Criteria pollutants are air pollutants for which federal and state air quality standards have been
established. They include carbon monoxide, lead, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and
suspended particulate matter, each of which is described briefly below.
Carbon monoxide (CO)
Carbon monoxide is produced from the partial combustion of fossil fuels, most notably from
motor vehicles. In the atmosphere, carbon monoxide contributes to the production of methane,
ozone, and carbon dioxide. It is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless toxic gas that at high
concentrations can contribute to the development of heart disease, anemia, and impaired
psychological behavior.
Lead (Pb)
Lead occurs in the atmosphere as particulate matter resulting from the manufacturing of
batteries, paint, ink, ammunition, and to a lesser extent, leaded gasoline, the use of which has
been phased out. Excessive exposure to airborne lead can contribute to anemia, kidney disease,
gastrointestinal dysfunction, and neuromuscular and neurological disorders.
Nitrogen Oxide (NOx)
Nitric oxide (NO) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) are the primary oxides of nitrogen that are
considered criteria pollutants. These oxides are produced at high temperatures during combustion
and are a by-product of motor vehicles. Incomplete combustion in motor vehicle engines, power
plants, and other industrial operations comprise the primary sources of nitrogen dioxide (NO2).
Short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide can result in airway constriction, diminished lung
capacity, and is highly toxic by inhalation.
Ozone (O3)
Ozone is formed when by-products of the internal combustion engine and other urban processes
react in the presence of ultraviolet sunlight. It is a pungent, colorless, toxic gas commonly
referred to as smog. Excessive exposure to ozone can result in diminished breathing capacity,
increased sensitivity to infections, and inflammation of the lung tissue.
Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)
Sulfur dioxide results from the combustion of high-sulfur content fuels, such as coal and
petroleum. Sources include motor vehicle fuel combustion, chemical manufacturing plants, and
sulfur recovery plants. Sulfur dioxide acts as an acid and is a colorless, odorous gas. Short-term
exposure can result in airway constriction and severe breathing difficulties, as well as lung tissue
damage and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
                                                                             Environmental Resources
                                                                                                   III-71
                                                                        Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley
                                                                         General Plan/ Air Quality Element
Suspended Particulate Matter
Suspended particulate matter consists of fine solid or liquid particles suspended in gas. These
fine particles may be from soil and dust, soot and smoke, or aerosols, and are byproducts of fuel
combustion, tire wear, and wind erosion. Particulate matter of ten microns (millionths of a
meter), or smaller in diameter are referred to as PM10, whereas PM2.5 consists of particles smaller
than 2.5 microns. Fine particulate matter poses a significant threat to public health and can cause
increased respiratory infections, asthma attacks, and lung cancer.
Air Quality and Climate Change
Air quality has become an increasing concern associated with human health issues, and because
air pollutants are thought to be contributing to global warming and climate change. The primary
contributor to air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels through the use of automobiles, power
and heat generators, and industrial processes. Emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels are
responsible for the poor air quality that is evident in industrial centers worldwide.
Some air polluting agents are also greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous
oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons, which are released into the atmosphere through natural
processes and human activities. These gases are termed greenhouse gases due to their shared
characteristic of trapping heat, and may be responsible for the global average increase in surface
temperature observed over the last decade. There is much debate over what the effects of climate
change will be, but there is a general consensus that the levels of emissions need to be reduced in
order to minimize air pollution and limit the amount of carbon dioxide and other pollutants that
are released.
In 2006, the California Global Warming Solutions Act (Assembly Bill 32) was passed in order to
comprehensively limit greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) at the state level, by establishing an
annual reporting program of GHG emissions for significant sources, and set emission limits to
cut the state’s GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Significant thresholds as well as standards
for calculated greenhouse gas emissions are expected to be established by CARB in the spring of
2009.
AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
As mentioned above, federal and state air quality standards established for criteria pollutants are
designed to protect that segment of the population that is most susceptible to respiratory distress
or infection, including the elderly, children, asthmatics, or those who are weak from disease or
illness. The following table provides a comparison of state and federal ambient air quality
standards. State standards are generally more restrictive than federal standards, particularly in
regard to sulfur dioxide and particulate matter.

MDAQMD operates and maintains six regional air quality monitoring stations throughout its
jurisdiction, to determine whether existing ambient air quality complies with the standards
shown above. The nearest monitoring station to the Town of Apple Valley is located in
Victorville. This station monitors contaminant levels and meteorological conditions on a daily
basis.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resource Board (CARB),
respectively, are the federal and state agencies responsible for regulating greenhouse gas
emissions . The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards is responsible for setting the
National Ambient Air Quality Standards for criteria pollutants. With the passage in 2006 of
Assembly Bill 32, CARB became the responsible state agency for monitoring and reducing
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the state of California.
SENSITIVE RECEPTORS
Sensitive receptors are persons or land uses that may be subject to respiratory stress and/or
significant adverse impact as a result of exposure to air contaminants. The CARB designates
people with cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases, children under 14, seniors over 65,
and athletes as sensitive receptors. Accordingly, hospitals, nursing and retirement homes,
schools, daycares, playgrounds, parks, athletic facilities, and residential and transient lodging
facilities are all considered sensitive land uses.

REGIONAL CLIMATE AND METEOROLOGY
The local and regional air quality is a function of the amount of pollutants emitted and dispersed
and the climatic, meteorological, and geophysical conditions that reduce or enhance the
formation of pollutants.
The Town of Apple Valley, Sphere of Influence, and the region are influenced by moderate
coastal conditions, though the area is far enough inland that temperatures can reach over 100º F
during the summer, and drop below freezing during the winter. The prevailing wind patterns in
the region are controlled by on-shore westerly winds during the day, and off-shore easterly winds
in the evenings and at night, with the dominant wind out of the west and southwest. During fall
and winter months, climatic conditions associated with strong, dry winds can affect the region,
creating a condition known as the Santa Ana winds, which can blow for multiple days. These
strong wind events suspend and transport large quantities of particulate matter, including sand
and dust, which can reduce visibility, damage property and pose a significant health threat.
The Town of Apple Valley is also susceptible to air inversions, which trap a layer of stagnant air
near the ground, where it can be further loaded with pollutants. Inversions in the Mojave Desert
Air Basin generally occur between 6,000 and 8,000 feet above ground surface, and create
conditions of haziness caused by moisture, suspended dust, and a variety of chemical aerosols
emitted by trucks, automobiles, furnaces and various other sources.
The Town of Apple Valley is influenced by the surrounding region’s natural geological
conditions. Air pollution generated in the South Coast Air Basin enters the Mojave Desert Air
Basin by passing over the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains. Similarly, air pollution
from the San Joaquin Air Basin passes through the Tehachapi Mountains, thereby entering the
Mojave Desert Air Basin and contributing criteria pollutants.
On the valley floor, temperatures range from the lower 20s during winter months, and commonly
exceed 100 degree Fahrenheit in the summer. Prevailing winds range from 5 to 10 knots per hour
from the west and southwest. On average the Town of Apple Valley receives approximately 2
inches of rainfall annually and experiences 350 days of sunshine.
Natural vegetation is representative of the desert ecosystem and contains sparse and widely
spaced natural groundcover. Surface soils, therefore, are readily exposed to wind. The area is
frequently subjected to strong winds, causing sand and dust to become airborne. This condition,
known as blowsand, poses an often destructive environmental hazard. In addition to health
problems associated with the presence of dust particles in the air, dust storms reduce highway
and air traffic visibility.
REGIONAL POLLUTANTS OF CONCERN
The Mojave Desert Air Basin, including the desert portions of San Bernardino County, Riverside
County, Los Angeles County, and Kern County, covers 21,480 square miles. The Mojave Desert
Air Basin, which includes the Town of Apple Valley, exceeds state and federal standards for
fugitive dust (PM10) and for ozone. State and federal standards for carbon monoxide, nitrogen
oxides, sulfur dioxide, and lead are in attainment within the Town of Apple Valley and the
Mojave Desert Air Basin.
                                                                            Environmental Resources
                                                                                                 III-74

                                                                            Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley
                                                                             General Plan/ Air Quality Element
As previously mentioned, the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District operates and
maintains regional air quality monitoring stations at numerous locations throughout its
jurisdiction, including the Victorville Monitoring Station, which monitors air in the Town of
Apple Valley. According to the EPA, and supported by the Victorville monitoring station, the
Town of Apple Valley and the Mojave Desert Air Basin are in non-attainment for ozone, PM10,
and PM2.5. These pollutants are further discussed below.
Ozone
Based on data collected at the Victorville Monitoring Station, from 2000 through 2008 ozone
levels in the area were exceeded for the State 1-hour standard an average of 14 days a year. The
Federal 1-hour ozone standard was exceeded on 8 days over the 9-year period from 2000 through
2008, and the Federal 8-hour standard was exceeded an average of 12 days per year.9
The Mojave Desert Air Basin has a history of exceeding state and federal ozone standards, and is
currently (2008) designated as a “moderate” ozone non-attainment area under the federal Clean
Air Act.
In the Town of Apple Valley, ozone is generated by motor vehicles, both from local and regional
roadways, as well as other local sources. In addition, ozone transported from the nearby South
Coast Air Basin (SCAB) contributes to the total ozone in the Mojave Desert Air Basin. The
South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) reports that in 2006 the Basin
exceeded federal health 1-hour standards for ozone on a total of 35 days, and the federal 8-hour
standard on 86 days. The more stringent State standards for the 1-hour and 8-hour standards were
exceeded on 102 and 121 days, respectively in the SCAQMD.10
The 2008 Ozone Attainment Plan sets forth strategies and control methods to attain federal air
quality standards for ozone. As part of this plan, the MDAQMD has adopted emission
limitations, maintains a permitting program for emitters and has set up monitoring systems
throughout the District. Based on ozone concentrations from 2001 through 2003, the EPA
classified the region as moderate non-attainment and established an attainment year of 2010. Air
quality modeling results show that expected level of emissions will not achieve established
ozone concentration standards by 2010.Therefore, the MDAQMD has requested a
reclassification to Severe-17, with an attainment date of June 15, 2021. Modeling results indicate
that MDAQMD could achieve attainment by 2021.11
Particulate Matter
PM10 Emissions
The region has a history of elevated PM10 emissions, which are the result of both human
activities, such as vehicle use and construction activity, and natural occurrences, such as
windstorms. For the period between 2000 and 2007, the 24-hour state standards for PM10 levels
were exceeded on an average of approximately 4 days per year. Although state standards are

more stringent than federal standards PM10 levels also exceeded federal standards, but only on
one (1) day during the period. The Basin is currently designated as a PM10 non-attainment area
for both state and federal standards.
The Town relies on applicable state code and AQMD Rules, including Rule 403 (Fugitive Dust),
for authority to enforce fugitive dust compliance as needed since it does not have its own fugitive
dust ordinance. The Town’s Municipal Code does include provisions for off-road dust generation
by prohibiting nuisance dust or dirt emissions (Chapter 11.30, Section 020).
In 2005 the MDAQMD adopted the “List and Implementation Schedule for District Measures to
Reduce PM Pursuant to Health & Safety Code §39614(d),” which identifies the most readily
available, feasible, and cost-effective control measures that could reduce particulate matter in the
District. The document identifies measures that are currently being employed to reduce
particulate matter in the District, sets forth new measures that could further reduce particulate
matter, and lists those new measures that need further evaluation prior to implementation.
Particulate matter in the Town of Apple Valley is generated by vehicle emission, construction,
and fugitive dust. One of the state’s largest contributors of particulate matter, Cemex, is located
in the Apple Valley Sphere of Influence.12 Cemex operates the Black Mountain Quarry for the
production of cement and aggregate. The facility is estimated to emit 277 tons per year of PM10
and 183 tons per year of PM2.5.
Mineral extraction operations and associated processes have the potential to generate fugitive
dust and emit other criteria pollutants into the atmosphere, which adversely impact local and
regional air quality. The Town of Apple Valley, Sphere of Influence, and the surrounding region
have identified valuable mineral deposits, some of which are actively being mined. In order to
minimize fugitive dust generation resulting from mineral extraction facilities operating within
the Town’s jurisdiction, a number of policies and programs have been developed to regulate
extraction procedures and reduce impacts to air quality. These are outlined below.
PM2.5 Emissions
Federal and state standards have been developed to regulate fine particulate matter smaller than
2.5 microns in diameter. To achieve federal attainment, a jurisdiction must provide the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with air quality monitoring data that does not violate
the fine particle standards over a three-year period. In March of 2007 the EPA issued the Clean
Air Fine Particle Implementation Rule, which describes the framework and requirements that
state and local governments must achieve in developing their PM2.5 implementation plans. The
Rule requires that states meet the PM2.5 standards by 2010, but may grant attainment extensions
of up to 5 years. Therefore, the 2007 Rule requires that all states meet federal standards for
attainment no later than 2015.
The Mojave Desert Air Basin and the Town of Apple Valley are classified as being in non-
attainment for PM2.5, based on the 2007 State Area Designations. Although the region is
classified as being in non-attainment for the state standard, the region is classified as being in

despite the air quality monitoring data from the Victorville station that shows zero (0)
exceedances for either the state or federal 24 hour standard from 2000 through 2007.
Toxic Air Contaminants
Pursuant to Assembly Bill 1807, which was enacted in 1983, Toxic Air Contaminants (TACs)
include substances such as asbestos, benzene, beryllium, inorganic arsenic, mercury, vinyl
chloride, and any other contaminants not addressed by the national ambient air pollution
program. TACs are required to be inventoried on a statewide level. There are a number of
processes and facilities within the state that generate TACs, including electroplating and
anodizing operations, gasoline distribution facilities, petroleum refineries, and others. TAC
generation and emissions are regulated by the Toxic Air Contamination Control Program. The
primary health concern associated with TACs is from mobile sources of particulate matter which
are known for their carcinogenic potential. Approximately 70 percent of the risk is attributed to
diesel particulate emissions, and about 20 percent to other toxics associated with mobile sources.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The Town will continue to act locally to meet existing and future state and federal air quality
regulations. Apple Valley is pursuing alternative energy options, such as wind turbines and solar
energy, electric and alternative fuel vehicles, and Green Building technology as viable options
for enhancing air quality by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants.
In compliance with the California Clean Air Act (Assembly Bill 2595), which requires that air
quality policies and programs be developed to protect and preserve the environment and general
public from the harmful effects of air pollutants, the following goals, policies, and programs
have been developed.
In an effort to reduce greenhouse gases and address climate change, the County of San
Bernardino, has set forth the Green Valley Initiative. This Initiative invites cities and towns to
participate in the County’s effort to reduce greenhouse gases, increase production of green
technologies, and integrate residents and businesses with natural resources. These efforts are
intended to create jobs, reduce environmental impacts, and enhance the quality of life for
residents by creating healthy economic and environmental conditions.
Participating jurisdictions document their commitment to the Initiative by identifying a Green
Valley coordinator and pledging to address at least five of the following:
             1. Green Building Programs
             2. Buy Green/Buy Local
             3. Green Business Programs

ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
Energy and mineral resources are an integral part of the community and local economy, with
their existence and availability having a fundamental influence on patterns of land use and
growth. Most conventional energy resources are finite and non-renewable, as are mineral
resources. It is becoming increasingly evident that supplies are limited and costs exraction and
production costs are increasing. Resulting shortages and rising utility rates have become an issue
of serious concern throughout the United States, including Southern California.
The Energy and Mineral Resources Element of the General Plan is intended to guide the Town in
the long-term management and well-considered use of its energy and mineral resources. The
element addresses the community’s dependence on limited resources and the need for local and
regional energy policies. The Element also focuses on the increasing need for effective new
policies concerning conservation, greater energy efficiency and renewable energy resources.
Included in the Element are descriptions of conventional and renewable energy resources, as well
as an outline of the location and identity of mineral resources in the area.
The Energy and Mineral Resources Element sets forth goals, policies and programs that assist
the Town of Apple Valley to insure the availability, conservation and management of its
resources. The goals, policies and programs also encourage the development of balanced,
innovative and long-term strategies to improve energy efficiency, expand the use of renewable
resources and create opportunities for more local control of energy production, distribution and
consumption.
BACKGROUND
California Government Code Section 65560(b) requires cities and counties to provide for the
preservation of resources including energy and mineral resource areas. The Section is one among
many state and federal legislations and regulations that apply to energy and mineral resource
issues. The various requirements directly apply to the planning area, where important mineral
and energy resources have already been identified and developed.
General Plans are required by Government Code Section 65302(d) to include elements that
address resource conservation and other appropriate matters, such as reclamation, prevention of
resource degradation and preservation for long-term use. Local jurisdictions are authorized in
Government Code Section 65303 to add other resource conservation or management subjects
that where such topics relate to the physical development of the City or Town. Sections 2762,
2763 and 2764 of the Public Resources Code also address the regulation of mineral resources.
Among State regulations affecting mineral and energy resources are the State Solar Rights Act
and Solar Shade Control Act. These acts facilitate the use of solar energy. Further, Title 24

Conservation, Circulation, and Air Quality. It also relates to the Economic Development
Element.
MINERAL RESOURCES
Mineral resources, which include sand and gravel, limestone, iron and coal, are differentiated
from such resources as natural gas and petroleum, which are generally classified as energy
resources rather than mineral resources. This Element defines a mineral resource as an
economically valuable commodity that occurs naturally and is composed of solid crystalline
substances, and which consist of chemical elements or compounds formed from inorganic
processes and organic substances. As nonrenewable resources, mineral resources must be
carefully managed and efficiently utilized to ensure they are neither wasted nor over exploited.
A variety of factors are used to determine the importance of mineral deposits, such as how
abundant and accessible they are, and the level of business and industry demand for them.
Utilization of mineral resources may conflict with other land uses; therefore planning agencies
must carefully weigh all considerations when proposed urban development may effectively
preclude or limit accessibility to rare or valuable mineral deposits.
The effects of surface mining, especially in desert areas, can remain evident for hundreds of
years. To avoid such impacts, adequate reclamation must be implemented and may include
redistribution of unmarketable (waste) materials, re-contouring, fine grading and re-vegetation.
Even with such measures, surface mining reclamation plans may not entirely mitigate the
significant environmental impacts associated with excavation of mineral resources. As discussed
in the Open Space and Conservation Element, the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975
(SMARA) was developed to ensure that utilization of mineral resources is carried out in a
sustainable manner, while at the same time addressing the need for environmental protection.
In the planning area, a variety of geological processes, including weathering and erosion have
resulted in the accumulation of alluvial deposits with significant mineral resources in the vicinity
of the Mojave River. These resources include sand, gravel and stone deposits that are suitable as
sources of concrete aggregate, which is an important component in building and construction
materials. Aggregate provides between 80% to 100% of material volume for asphalt, concrete,
road base, stucco and plaster. Concrete, asphalt, and road base, as well as other aggregate
materials, can be recycled to provide new base, concrete and asphalt products. According to the
Conservation and Open Space Technical Report prepared for the adopted General Plan, the
planning area and Sphere of Influence are thought to contain quantities of oil and gas, as well as
geothermal resources.

Locally Important Mineral Resources
The State of California Division of Geology, as required by SMARA, has identified significant
concrete aggregate deposits in Apple Valley. Mineral resources located in the planning area are
found primarily along or near the Mojave River. These resources include sand, gravel and stone
deposits that provide useful sources of concrete aggregate. Utilization of aggregate and limestone
for cement manufacture will significantly impact and be impacted by urbanization and
development of nearby properties. However, these are considered potentially important mineral
resources. Aggregate Resource Areas (ARA), or areas with current land uses that may be
compatible with resource exploitation, are identified on two Exhibits: III-8, Mineral Resource
Zones-North/Mines and Prospects and III-9, Mineral Resource Zones-South/Mines and
Prospects. The State Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology has classified
mineral resources according to the presence or absence of significant concrete-grade aggregate
deposits. These classifications are presented in the form of Mineral Resource Zones (MRZ).
Mineral Resource Zone Designations
The following are State-established definitions for mineral resources, which are used uniformly
to identify the potential for their occurrence in any area. These definitions are:
MRZ-1:          Areas where available geologic information indicates that there is little likelihood
                that significant mineral resources exist.
MRZ-2a:         Areas underlain by mineral deposits where geologic data indicate that significant
                measured or indicated resources are present. MRZ-2 is divided on the basis of
                both degree of knowledge and economic factors. Areas classified MRZ-2a contain
                discovered mineral deposits that are either measured or indicated reserves as
                determined by such evidence as drilling records, sample analysis, surface
                exposure, and mine information. Land included in the MRZ-2a category is of
                prime importance because it contains known economic mineral deposits.
MRZ-2b:         Areas underlain by mineral deposits where geologic information indicates that
                significant inferred resources are present. For this report, areas classified MRZ-2b
                contain discovered mineral deposits that are significant inferred resources as
                determined by their lateral extension from proven deposits or their similarity to
                proven deposits. Further exploration work could result in upgrading areas
                classified MRZ-2b to MRZ-2a.
MRZ-3a:         Areas containing known mineral occurrences of undetermined mineral resource
                significance. Further exploration work within these areas could result in the
                reclassification of specific localities into MRZ-2a or MRZ-2b categories. MRZ-3
                is divided on the basis of knowledge of economic characteristics of the resources.
MRZ-3b:         Areas containing inferred mineral occurrences of undetermined mineral resource
                significance. Land classified MRZ-3b represents areas in geologic settings that
                appear to be favorable environments for the occurrence of specific mineral
                                                                                 Environmental Resources
                                                                                                     III- 84
                                                                      Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                    General Plan / Energy and Mineral Resources Element
              deposits. Further exploration work could result in the reclassification of all or part
              of these areas into the MRZ-2a or MRZ-2b categories.
MRZ-4:        Areas of no known mineral occurrences where geologic information does not rule
              out either the presence or absence of significant mineral resources.
Aggregate Resource Areas In Apple Valley
The following areas include highly significant deposits of aggregate resources:
ARA-8:        That part of the Mojave River MRZ-2b area between the Rock Springs Road
              crossing and the Bear Valley Road bridge. The size of this ARA is 2,758 acres.
              The aggregate resources in this area are about 71 feet thick, based on well logs in
              the area. ARA-8 is rated as Highly Significant and the highest probable use of
              material from this deposit is concrete aggregate.
ARA-9:        That part of the Mojave River MRZ-2b area between the Bear Valley Road bridge
              and the Upper Narrows. The size of this ARA is 691 acres. The aggregate
              resources in this area are at least 100 feet thick, based on well logs in the area.
              ARA-9 is rated as Highly Significant and the highest probable use of material
              from this deposit is concrete aggregate.
                                                                             Environmental Resources
                                                                                                 III- 85

Within the Town’s Sphere of Influence are the CEMEX, and TXI Riverside Cement quarries.
Other such facilities in the vicinity include the Alvic and Scheerer limestone quarries. These are
further discussed in the Conservation and Open Space Element.
ENERGY RESOURCES
Most energy comes from non-renewable resources, which include oil, coal and natural gas; the
generation and use of energy is typically harmful to the environment. Limited resources,
increasing generation costs and the need for measures to offset the negative effects of energy
consumption all result in escalating economic costs. However, energy sources are essential for
transportation and for the operation of most land uses.
In general, local agencies do not have control or management of energy resources, or of the
often-unpredictable supplies and high costs have created important issues around energy
production and consumption. The community and environment both benefit from increased
energy efficiency, the development and use of alternative and renewable energy resources, and a
better understanding of conservation methods. Other benefits include reducing energy shortages,
preventing future crises, generating increased options and greater flexibility, and contribute to a
stable local economy.
A variety of sources, including utility providers, have been used to estimate per capita or per
household electricity and natural gas consumption in the Town of Apple Valley. Factors
affecting energy use rates include, among others, cost to generate and deliver these resources.
The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) has collaborated with utility
providers to develop a set of assumptions that generally define energy consumption by type of
land use. The average residential user consumes approximately 79,000 cubic feet of natural gas
and 6,000-kilowatt hours (kwh) per unit annually. For commercial users, these figures are based
on square footage of development, and have been estimated at approximately 35 cubic feet of
natural gas per square foot per year and between 9.95 to 53.3-Kwh per square foot per year,
based on the type of commercial use.
Electric Power Services
Non-renewable fossil fuels continue to carry most of the base-load demand in the generation of
electricity, with natural gas technology helping to meet peak power demand, and have supported
the current automobile dependent society. As discussed in the Air Quality Element, air
pollutants, hazardous waste products and climate change/vulnerability have all been linked to the
burning of fossil fuels.
The use of nuclear power as an alternative to non-renewable resources was at its highest in the
1970s, but has since declined in popularity. Renewable resources, including wind and solar
power, have heretofore been developed and utilized to a lesser extent than fossil fuels or nuclear
power as a means of generating electric power. However, interest in and support for development
of a variety of renewable resources is increasing and is expected to continue to do so over the
next decades.

Rather than one dominant technology emerging, the future may see a variety of technologies
finding a place in the mix of power generators. New systems would be based upon locally
available resources and provide a more flexible capacity that is less susceptible to interruption.
The use of small-scale systems that provide local on-site power, while also being connected to
the larger regional power grid, may allow for a more decentralized system of power generation in
the future.
Electric Power Deregulation
The electricity industry in California was deregulated in 1998, when Assembly Bill 1890 (AB
1890) came into effect. In addition to allowing California consumers to choose the type of
energy they wished to support, AB 1890 resulted in a new statewide Renewable Energy Program
to fund existing, new and emerging renewable technologies. Assembly Bill 99536 and Senate
Bill 119437 were enacted in September 2000 to extend collection of the Public Goods Charge
monies established under AB 1890. Under the joint direction of the two bills, the Renewable
Energy Program is to receive $135 million annually through 2011 from California’s Investor
Owned Utilities. From 1998 to 2005, Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric
Company and San Diego Gas and Electric contributed $1.09 billion to the Renewable Energy
Program1.
With the intention of increasing competition among generators and lowering the cost of electric
power, the state’s major utilities sold off generating facilities under deregulation. However, a
number of factors in the early 1990s resulted in expensive and unreliable sources of electricity.
The factors included greater than expected demand, lower rainfall and less available
hydroelectric power, increased cost of natural gas for power generation, and the uncoordinated
shutdown of power plants for maintenance. The new owners of power generation capacity after
deregulation may also have taken the opportunity to reap significantly greater profits than was
typical of integrated utility-owned generators. Finally, the economic viability of the restructured
utilities was compromised after deregulation, as the charges of wholesale power generators were
unregulated, while the rates that the retail power distributors could charge their customers were
capped. The gap between wholesale prices and retail caps generated billions of dollars in debt for
the restructured utilities.
As the effects of electric power deregulation continue to unfold, the Town will have important
opportunities to influence energy policy on a regional and state level. It will also be able to
shape the local electricity market through conservation initiatives, and the development and
regulation of local power generation.
Southern California Edison
Southern California Edison Company (SCE) provides electricity to the Town of Apple Valley.
SCE has four main transmission corridors across the area, each with 115kV lines. Within the
SCE system, high voltage transmission lines deliver power to substations where power is stepped
down and distributed through lower voltage lines. Individual homes and businesses then receive
power through a final transformer, which brings voltages down to safer and more useful levels.

                                                      General Plan / Energy and Mineral Resources Element
In Apple Valley, distribution facilities include circuits ranging from 33kV to 6.9kV. There are
three SCE substations in the Town, with voltages ranging from 33kV to 115kV, and one new
substation is planned to serve newly developing areas by year 2013.
SCE administers several energy conservation programs for their customers. Financial incentives
are offered to encourage energy conservation and the use of high efficiency equipment, with a
variety of conservation services available to special needs groups.
New development with the Town of Apple Valley will increase the consumption of energy.
However, the expected increase in local demand will form a small proportion of regional growth
and it will not represent a significantly different energy consumption pattern from that of other
comparable communities in the region.
The Town of Apple Valley is in a position to initiate development, promotion and
implementation of innovative energy strategies and technologies that address electricity
generation and use. Enhanced efficiency and conservation is one of the most cost-effective
approaches, since energy conservation is significantly easier than production, and also directly
addresses environmental issues associated with electric energy. Town initiatives in the areas of
alternative fuels, advanced technologies and energy conservation will be fundamental to
identifying effective strategies for a more secure, affordable and environmentally responsible
energy future.
Natural Gas Services
Natural gas is found in association with petroleum crude oil deposits. High-pressure transmission
lines are used to transport natural gas throughout the United States. While still in relatively
abundant supply, natural gas is non-renewable and therefore warrants conservation. Natural gas
is an important and widely utilized energy source that has historically been relatively
inexpensive, clean burning and convenient. However, rapidly growing demand for use in utility-
scale, base-load power generation is affecting its availability and cost.
Natural gas supplies to the Town are provided by the Southwest Gas Company; a 34-inch, high-
pressure pipeline crosses the southern part of Town. A system of high- and medium-pressure
pipelines is connected to the major pipeline, with pressure being gradually reduced at various
limiting stations and regulator stations, which provide for delivery of natural gas to homes and
businesses at safer and more useable pressure. Most development in the central core of Apple
Valley is connected to the natural gas distribution system, although some rural, outlying areas
may not be connected, given the prohibitive costs associated with extending the necessary
infrastructure. Consumers in these remote areas rely on propane as an alternative fuel source.
Local Renewable Energy Resources
It is widely recognized that the true costs of energy from fossil or nuclear fuels are not yet fully
factored into their market price. The development and utilization of local renewable energy
resources could significantly reduce dependence on environmentally damaging and increasingly
costly energy sources, with the exploitation and long-term use of renewable resources potentially
                                                                               Environmental Resources
                                                                                                   III- 90
                                                                         Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                       General Plan / Energy and Mineral Resources Element
offering significant economic development opportunities for the Town. Renewable energy
resources available in the region include sunshine, high temperatures and wind.
Wind Energy
Winds across the region are intermittent and therefore the generation of electricity from wind
turbines would be as well. However, wind energy is providing an increasingly important
alternative to conventional power systems, with the cost of wind-generated electricity now equal
to or lower than electricity generated by coal or natural gas.
Solar Energy
Photovoltaic systems involve the direct conversion of sunshine to electricity, and over the past
decade, photovoltaic technologies have made significant progress both as stand-alone power
systems and when integrated into building design and construction. In recent years, the costs of
manufacturing and installing such systems have been significantly reduced. While photovoltaic
systems are still primarily used for special applications, such as providing power in remote
locations, passive solar designs can also be used to provide lighting and space heating and have
been used world-wide as a source of domestic hot water. .
The Town is ideally located to maximize the continued emergence and refinement of solar
technologies and thereby reduce dependence on non-renewable energy resources. Photovoltaic
technologies may also become integral to the emergence of a hydrogen fuel cycle, which could
result in virtually pollution-free electric power and combustion fuel.
Hydrogen Fuel Cells
Fuel cell systems use hydrogen to generate electricity and the technology has the potential to
become a major renewable energy source. Hydrogen is produced when water molecules are
split, and the process generates no wastes other than heat and water vapor. Fuel cells efficiently
convert chemical energy directly into electricity, and in conjunction with solar or wind
technologies, hydrogen power can be effectively utilized on a large scale.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Energy and mineral resource production and use are fundamental components of infrastructure
and technological development, and have greatly enhanced quality of life since the industrial
revolution. However, the exploitation of non-renewable energy resources has increased
exponentially and has resulted in major environmental degradation, impacting wildlife habitat,
affecting water and air quality, and direct and indirect association with a wide range of adverse
public health effects.
The increasingly evident economic and environmental costs associated with conventional and
often indiscriminate mineral and energy production and use are driving the development of new
policies and programs. Requirements for materials recycling, together with a reduction or change
in energy consumption patterns, will encourage mineral and energy providers to achieve both
greater production efficiency and cost effectiveness, while identifying new economic and
environmental opportunities.

Economic opportunity can also be expanded through promoting conservation and stimulating the
development and use of alternative and renewable energy, while the development and
implementation of enlightened energy policies will assist in addressing issues of local and
national economic security.
Developing energy policies that emphasize conservation, local control, greater use of renewable
resources and community-scale technologies, are essential to and will help secure an
environmentally friendly energy future.

GEOTECHNICAL ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Geotechnical Element is intended to provide information about the geological and seismic
conditions and hazards that affect the Town of Apple Valley and its Sphere-of-Influence. This
element establishes a series of goals, policies, and programs that focus on reducing potential
impacts, such as loss of life and property damage, associated with seismic and geologic hazards.
These goals, policies, and programs also provide for the protection of the general health and
welfare of the community The Element and associated maps and other supporting document will
serve as a source of foundational information concerning regional geotechnical hazards and
thereby provide for the establishment of future land use policies and decisions.
BACKGROUND
The Geotechnical Element considers the physical characteristics of the planning area and the
safety of the community, and is therefore closely related to a number of other elements within
the General Plan. These include Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Public Buildings and Facilities,
Emergency Preparedness, and Police and Fire Protection. In addition, the Geotechnical Element
directly relates to many issues discussed in the Water, Sewer and Utilities Element and the
Flooding and Hydrology Element.
California Government Code and Public Resources Code requires that a General Plan include an
element that addresses seismic safety issues. To comply with these requirements, as set forth in
Government Code Section 65302(g), the General Plan must address the need to protect the
community from unreasonable risks that could result from seismically induced hazards, such as
surface rupture, groundshaking, ground failure, seiching, dam failure, subsidence, and other
known geologic risks. Government Code Section 65303 also allows the General Plan to address
other subjects related to the physical development of the community, and the Geotechnical
Element contributes towards addressing these issues. The Town and all other jurisdictions
located within the most severe seismic shaking zone, designated as Zone 4 (as established in
Chapter 2-23, Part 2, Title 24 of the Administrative Code), are required to identify all potentially
hazardous or substandard buildings and implement a program for the mitigation of these
structures. This requirement is mandated and programmed in Government Code Section 8876.
A technical background study1 was prepared to assess existing conditions and potential future
conditions at build out of the proposed General Plan. This report is referenced herein and is
included in its entirety as an appendix to the General Plan EIR.

GEOLOGIC CONDITIONS IN THE PLANNING AREA
The Town of Apple Valley is generally bounded by the Turtle Mountains on the north, the
Fairview Mountains and Granite Mountains on the east and the Ord Mountains on the south. The
majority of Apple Valley is situated on gently sloping alluvial fans ranging in elevation from
approximately 3,400 feet near the base of the Fairview Mountains to the northeast to 2,700 feet
along the Mojave River to the west. Notable geologic formations within the Town include Bell
Mountain at 3,897 feet and Catholic Hill at 3,645 feet. One of the most prominent features in the
area is the Mojave River, a wide floodplain that generally defines Apple Valley’s western
boundary.
The geological character of Apple Valley and the surrounding region has been formed by its
proximity to large active fault systems, including the Helendale Fault, San Andreas Fault, and
the North Frontal Fault. Fault activity in this region continues to result in ground rupture, major
groundshaking, subsidence, uplift and mountain building, landform compression and extension.
As a result, the mountains are composed of rocks that have been sheared and intensely fractured
under the strain of tectonic movement. The valley is formed by many generations of overlapping
alluvial fans, the various ages of which coincide with the rise of the local mountains.
The following section describes the general physical and engineering characteristics, from
youngest to oldest, of the six types of geologic deposits that underlie the Apple Valley planning
area. These consist of: artificial fill, very young or recent alluvium (current or recently active),
young alluvial and landslide deposits (0 to 11,000 years old), older alluvial fan deposits (11,000
to 1 million years old), sedimentary rocks (10 to 26 million years old), and crystalline rocks (65
to 225 million years old). Exhibits IV-1 and IV-1A illustrate the soil types in the Apple Valley
study area.

Artificial Fill/Disturbed Ground
The planning area includes numerous deposits of man-made fills. Fills are related to roadway,
bridge, and railway embankments, levees, and graded developments. Some of these deposits
cover a substantial area, however the size, age and composition vary widely.
Very Young or Recent Alluvium (Map Symbols Qw, Qf, Qc, Qe, and Qp)
Within Apple Valley, very young wash deposits (Qw and Qf) are found in several settings. These
include unconsolidated sediments that line active drainage courses, such as sand and gravel in
the Mojave River; mixed sand, gravel, and boulders found in Arrastre Canyon in the southern
Sphere of Influence, Desert Knolls Wash, Bell Mountain Wash; and within the many unnamed
washes and silt, sand and gravel in the numerous unnamed gullies and washes that cross alluvial
fans. Surface soils on these deposits are undeveloped, and are therefore subject to being re-
worked by flooding or buried by new sediment during storms. In the upper reaches of the
drainages, large boulders may be deposited during flooding; this condition is most likely to be
found near the mountains.
Similar in character to Qf deposits, modern colluvium (Qc) may be found in hillside areas lining
drainage deposits. In hillside areas, colluvium generally accumulates in the linings of drainage
depressions and along the natural toes of slopes, resulting from slope wash and weathering of
underlying soil units. Colluvial deposits are characteristically very large, unconsolidated, and
may contain organic material.
Fine- to medium-grained sand and silt (Qe) wind-deposited soils are found throughout Apple
Valley. Typically these deposits are thin and unconsolidated. The youngest deposits tend to form
patches in the sheltered side of desert vegetation. North of the Ord Mountains is a somewhat
older and relatively large deposit, containing a poorly developed drainage network controlled by
understated dunes.
There are several dry lake areas in the planning area and vicinity, including the Apple Valley
Dry Lake in Apple Valley, as well as a small playa south of the Granite Mountains, and Reeves
Lake in Fairview Valley, and Apple Valley Dry Lake. These areas contain Playa deposits (Qp)
that are primarily comprised of very fine-grained sediments such as silt and clay, but also include
some fine- to medium-grained sand. These areas are flat-floored basins with no ouflow, and are
therefore subject to future flooding and sediment deposition.
Young Alluvial and Landslide Deposits (Map Symbols Qyf, Qyw, Qya and Qyls)
Young alluvial fan deposits (Qyf) are those ranging from a few years old up to about 15,000
years in age, blanketing most of the valley with unconsolidated to moderately consolidated silt
and sand with scattered gravel. Cobbles and boulders may be present in deposits in and near the
mountains, and more deeply incised drainage channels may also occur.
Young wash deposits (Qyw), which typically have an age within the last 10,000 years, occur in
the planning area and vicinity as unconsolidated sand and gravel along a slightly elevated terrace
adjacent to the Mojave River and within Arrastre Canyon. In the latter, undeveloped area these
soils tend to be more vegetated than within the very young deposits. Along the Mojave River,
                                                                               Environmental Hazards

where substantial development has occurred, this unit represents an older river floodplain. Along
the river the lowest areas are somewhat protected by sand levees; nonetheless, localized flooding
could occur during severe storm events, or in the event of catastrophic failure of one of the
upstream dams.
Young alluvial valley fill (Qya) soils are within 15,000 years in age and are comprised of pale
brown, slightly to moderately consolidated silt, sand, and gravel which has been incised by
shallow to moderately deep drainages. In the planning area these soils form an elevated terrace
above the Mojave River floodplain, as well as the relatively steep bluffs north of Yucca Loma
Road.
Landslide deposits (Qyls) normally consist of blocks of intact bedrock and/or rubble. The
graben area (upper part of the slide) is typically comprised of a mix of soil and bedrock
fragments. There are two mapped landslide deposits, which are located in the western part of the
Granite Mountains, in and near the far eastern portion of the Sphere of Influence.
Older Alluvial Fan Deposits (Map Symbols Qof, Qoa, Qvof and Qvoa)
There are older alluvial deposits (Qof and Qoa) in the planning area that occur as scattered
remnants of erosion along the flanks of the Ord Mountains to the south, and in the Desert Knolls
area. In the Black Mountain area, to the northeast, these deposits occur as isolated patches and
they are generally elevated above younger fan deposits. This unit is weakly stratified and has
moderate surficial soil development. These deposits range from about 11,000 to 500,000 years
old, and are comprised of moderately well consolidated silt, sand and gravel, with boulders
possible near the base of mountains.
Very old alluvial deposits (Qvof and Qvoa) consist primarily of silt, gravel, and medium- to
coarse-grained sand. These soils are mid to early Pleistocene in age (about 500,000 to 1 million
years old), and are moderately to well consolidated with a deeply dissected surface.
Characteristically, such deposits may be roughly arranged in beds (layers of varying thickness
and character), although these beds may give way to chaotic debris flows near the mountains.
Mature soils are developed on the surface and may exhibit a reddish colored on the upper part of
the deposit. In the planning area vicinity, there are very old alluvial deposits in a large area north
of Bell Mountain Wash, as well as within isolated patches southwest of the Black Mountains and
within the Ord Mountains (Juniper Flats and the lower mountainsides.).
In general, older alluvium may provide better structural support because it is more consolidated
than young alluvium. Where clayey soils develop on the fan surface, however, they may be
expansive. Stream erosion can over-steepen slopes, leading to slope instability.
Sedimentary Rocks (Map Symbol: Tcr)
Sedimentary rocks occur in narrow, exposed bands along the base of the Ord Mountains, and
along the eastern side of the Mojave River. They include sandstone, pebbly sandstone, and
conglomerate of the Miocene-age (10 to 26 million years old) Crowder Formation. This unit is
pinkish-tan, pale gray, and pale brown in color. Because of their permeability, the presence of
massive to planar bedding and cross-bedding, and the absence of well-developed potential slip
planes, sedimentary rocks generally contribute to gross slope stability. However, they are highly
                                                                                  Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                    IV-7

vulnerable to erosion and surface failure on natural slopes as well as on graded slopes comprised
of granular materials.
Crystalline Rocks (Map Symbols: Mzp, Mzv, Mzm, Pzw)
Rocks that have crystallized from the igneous, or molten state, and rocks of sedimentary origin
that have crystallized under extreme conditions deep below the earth’s surface
(metasedimentary), are included in this group. Where not highly weathered, these rocks are very
hard, forming steep, rugged slopes and deep canyons. However, they are generally fractured,
since they are brittle and have been subjected to millions of years of tectonic activity, and
therefore are typically very fractured. As a result, they may be sheared near fault zones, a
condition, which, along with jointing that is inherent in intrusive rocks, creates planes of
weakness along which slope instability can occur. As noted above, however, there are only two
small landslides mapped in the planning area vicinity, at the western edge of the Granite
Mountains in the eastern Sphere of Influence.
Plutonic rocks (Mzp) are those that have solidified deep within the earth’s crust. They are
characterized by fine to coarse grains that are easily discernible by the human eye. These rocks
tend to weather into rounded outcrops containing boulders. In the planning area and vicinity,
including the Ord Mountains, Granite Mountains, Bell Mountain, and Catholic Hill, there are
small patches of darker-colored rocks (horneblende diorite and gabbro).
Rocks that are solidified on the ground surface, such as from a lava flow, are volcanic (Mzv).
These rocks cooled quickly and thus are very fined-grained. Volcanic rocks, classified as rhyolite
or dacite, occur as small isolated patches forming jagged, blocky outcrops on Bell Mountain and
Catholic Hill. Volcanic rocks occur in the Sidewinder and Black Mountains, northeast of the
Helendale fault.
Metasedimentary rocks (Mzm) are pale gray to tan marble, schist, quartzite and gneiss. Rocks of
Mesozoic-age (251 million years ago to 65 million years ago) occur in the western part of the
Ord Mountains and as small patches in the hills north of the Desert Knolls area. The north and
east sides of Catholic Hill are comprised of the oldest rocks in Apple Valley, and occur on the
north and east sides of Catholic Hill. These formations consist of highly deformed schist and
quartzite approximately 250 to 500 million years in age, including the Wood Canyon Formation
(Pzw).
Geologic Hazards
Landslide and Slope Instability
Much of the terrain within Apple Valley is hillside land, which is generally undeveloped except
for local mining operations. The presence of scattered homes along the base of steep mountain
slopes in the planning area represents a hazard due to slope instability. While slope failures tend
to result in localized affects, in contrast to earthquakes or major floods, and are generally short-
term, they can result in significant monetary losses. Such hazards may not be covered under
homeowner’s insurance policies, and may therefore result in additional distress to affected
property owners.

The mountains and hills of Apple Valley are underlain by bedrock, which is not typically
susceptible to landslides. However, canyon walls and other areas of sharp topographic relief, are
potentially affected by rockfalls and rockslides, especially due to strong seismic shaking, and to
mudflows and soil erosion during or after intense storm events. Exhibit IV-2, Seismic Related
Hazards, shows areas of potential risk for rockfall and landslides in the planning area.

Compressible Soils
Soil units that could compress under the weight of proposed fill embankments and structures are
known as “compressible soils”. While such soils usually involve geologically young (Holocene
age) unconsolidated sediments with low density, they can also occur in conditions such as the
upper weathered part of older alluvium, colluvium/slope wash that collects near the base of
natural slopes, and slope failure debris. In some cases, they may be present in very weathered
bedrock. Factors that determine the settlement potential and the rate of settlement in these
sediments include texture and grain size, natural moisture and density, thickness of the
compressible layer(s), drainage, proposed load weight, and the rate at which the load is applied.
Compressible soils are most likely to occur in the planning area where Holocene-age deposits are
present, as well as active and recently active stream channels. In hills it is most likely that
compressible soils will be found in canyon bottoms, swales, and at the base of natural slopes.
Landslide deposits often result in compression, especially at the head or along the depression
created by the slide, as well as along the margins. At depths of greater than 60 feet, deep fill
embankments can also compress under their own weight. Potential hazards associated with
compressible soils are preventable through the use of sound engineering practices, including a
thorough geotechnical soils analysis.
Collapsible Soils
Substantial and rapid settlement can occur under relatively light loads when soil units are
saturated, leading to a rearrangement of their grains and a loss of cohesion or cementation. Most
susceptible soils are generally those associated with recently deposited, Holocene-age soils that
have accumulated in an arid or semi-arid environment, as well sand and silts deposited by wind.
Flash flooding often deposits debris flow settlements, creating alluvial fans comprised of soils
that are susceptible to collapse. Surface water infiltration is increased during irrigation, or a rise
in the groundwater table. When combined with the weight of a building or structure, these
conditions can cause rapid settlement, causing foundations and walls to crack. Heavily irrigated
landscaping in close proximity to a structure’s foundation is often associated with differential
settlement of structures.
Given the granular nature of the soils, the fact that upper soils are generally dry, and the rapid
deposition in the alluvial fan environment, the young and very young alluvial sediments in the
planning area may be locally susceptible to this hazard.
Expansive Soils
Soils with significant amount of clay minerals the ability to give up water (shrink) or absorb
water (swell). These are considered expansive soils, which have potential to substantially change
in volume in response to changes in moisture content. Structures and other surface improvements
are subject to damage from upward pressures induced by the swelling of expansive soils.
Alluvial sediments underlying the valley and canyon areas are primarily comprised of granular
materials, such as silty sand and sand. These soils typically have a low expansion potential,
although pockets of fine-grained expansive soils are not uncommon within these units. There are
very fine-grained silts and clays within Apple Valley Dry Lake, which are likely to be expansive.
                                                                                  Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                   IV-11

                                                                      Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                                      General Plan/Geotechnical Element
Clay deposits accumulated in subsurface soils have developed on older fan deposits; this is due
to weathering and soil development. Where such soils are rich in clay they may be expected to
have moderately expansive qualities.
Ground Subsidence
The gradual settling or sinking of the ground surface with little or no horizontal movement is
known as ground subsidence. This movement is due to extraction of oil, gas or groundwater in
sediment-filled valleys and floodplains, and may be evidenced by earth fissures, sinkholes or
depressions, and disruption of surface drainage. Damage associated with ground subsidence may
include harmful effects to canals, levees, underground pipelines, wells, buildings, roads,
railroads and other structures and improvements. Subsidence has been mitigated in affected areas
through management of water resources, including reduction in pumping from local wells,
importation of water, and artificial groundwater recharge.
Apple Valley overlies the southern part of the Mojave River Groundwater Basin; the Basin
covers approximately1,400 square miles and has an estimated storage capacity of nearly five
million acre-feet. It is one of the largest groundwater reservoirs in southern California. The
Mojave River accounts for over 80% of the natural recharge, with the remainder coming from
runoff that flows from upper reaches of tributary washes. The basin is in a state of overdraft that
has developed as water extraction has exceeded natural recharge over many decades.
Groundwater levels in the basin have dropped more than 100 feet between the 1950s and 1990s,
and approximately 30 feet in the last 20 years alone. These issues are further discussed in the
Water Resources Element.
Subsidence studies conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Mojave Water
Agency (MWA) show that the closest subsidence area to Apple Valley is located approximately
seven miles northwest. No subsidence has not been detected to date within Apple Valley. The
MWA continues to implement groundwater conservation and recharge activities in the Apple
Valley area and these activities contribute to the management of ground subsidence. Monitoring
groundwater and basin conditions and increasing the use of reclaimed water, storm water or
imported water are preventative measures.
Erosion
The planning area is located in an area of extreme topographic relief between the valley and the
surrounding mountains and is therefore subject to erosion, runoff, and sedimentation. Key factors
affecting these processes include climate, topography, soil and rock types. Natural erosion may
be accelerated by human activities such as agricultural or land development, as well as grading
that may involve altering natural drainage patterns. Grading and construction activities such as
soil compaction, and cut and fill slopes also increase the potential for erosion, and sedimentation.
The increase in impermeable surfaces associated with development may impact conditions
downstream of development, increasing the potential for flooding and sedimentation.

Wind Erosion
Wind erosion is a common phenomenon occurring mostly in flat, bare areas where dry, sandy
soils are present, or anywhere the topsoil is loose, dry, and finely granulated. Recognized as a
serious environmental problem, wind erosion causes damage to land and natural vegetation
through the air or water-borne relocation of soil from one place to another. Soil loss, dryness
and deterioration of the soil structure, loss of nutrients and productivity, air pollution, as well as
sediment transport and deposition are all problems created by erosion.
Apple Valley is affected by strong winds associated with the Cajon Pass, as well as climatic
differences between the high desert, the mountains, and the inland valleys south of the pass. The
wind, combined with sandy surface soils that are common in Apple Valley, poses an
environmental hazard that may be destructive. The presence of dust particles in the air poses a
health risk associated with respiratory discomfort and airborne pathogens that cause eye
infections and skin disorders. Dust storms also reduce highway and air traffic visibility. Wind
erosion can be managed through the use of wind barriers, watering construction sites, and
vegetative ground cover.
Seismic Assessment
Much of southern California is located along the boundary between the North American and
Pacific tectonic plate. This boundary, also known as the San Andreas Fault Zone, could generate
strong seismic activities. The Pacific Plate is moving in a northwesterly direction, approximately
50 millimeters per year in relationship to the North American Plate. In southern California, the
San Andreas Fault consists of three segments: the Mojave Desert segment, the San Bernardino
Mountains segment, and the Coachella Valley segment.
The planning area is located near this boundary, and there are several active faults in the region.
These include the Helendale fault, the San Andreas fault, the North Frontal fault, the Cleghorn
fault, the Cucamonga fault, and the San Jacinto fault. Of these, the North Frontal fault has the
potential to generate the strongest seismic shaking in Apple Valley.
Measuring Seismic Events
Classification of seismic events is based on their magnitude and intensity. The intensity of
ground shaking is determined by several factors, such as the earthquake’s magnitude, the
distance from the epicenter, and the geologic composition of local soils and rocks. Seismic
intensity is most commonly measured by the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale, which
includes twelve levels of damage. The MMI is derived from actual observations of damage to
structures and human reactions to earthquakes. Based on this scale, an earthquake tremor at
Level I earthquake tremor is generally not felt and is considered unlikely to result in damage,
whereas a Level XII earthquake results in total destruction. Earthquake intensities may result in
damage such as partial or complete collapse of masonry structures, severe damage to complete
destruction of underground pipelines, rock and land slides, and massive damage or destruction of
bridges, overpasses and other improvements.
Earthquake magnitude is measured by the Richter Scale on a continuum of one to nine, with each
level-of-magnitude increase representing a tenfold increase in the amplitude of the waves on a
                                                                                 Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                  IV-13

                                                                     General Plan/Geotechnical Element
seismogram. The most notable historic earthquake in the Apple Valley region was the Landers
earthquake of 1992, which had a magnitude of 7.3 on the Richter Scale. The Landers earthquake,
so named for its epicenter near the small desert community of Landers, also ruptured five other
separate faults.
The largest earthquake likely to occur on a fault or fault segment within a specified period of
time is considered the Maximum Probable Earthquake (MPE). The MPE is useful during
emergency and engineering planning. It provides a means to assess the potential seismic risk
within a region, is referenced to establish safe construction and design parameters, and facilitates
the preparation of policies and programs that are responsive to the potential impacts of an
earthquake.
Defined as the largest earthquake a fault is estimated to be capable of generating, the Maximum
Credible Earthquake (MCE) also provides a useful gauge for emergency and engineering
planning efforts. In the Apple Valley area, the North Frontal fault (West) is expected to generate
a magnitude 7.2 earthquake with a Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) ranging from 1.13g to
0.38g, which is equivalent to a Level XI to X on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (MMI).

the surrounding area.

Major Faults Affecting Apple Valley
Potential adverse effects from earthquakes may be substantial and range from property damage,
to the loss of public services and facilities, to loss of life. Apple Valley and the surrounding area
are most susceptible to severe impacts associated with strong ground shaking. Strong ground
shaking can cause other geologic hazards, including landslides, ground lurching, structural
damage or destruction, and liquefaction, which can further disrupt affected areas through fire, the
interruption of essential services or damage to facilities and infrastructure, such as water, sewer,
gas, electric, transportation, communications, drainage, as well as release of hazardous materials.
Dam or water tank failure brought about by seismic activity can result in flood inundation.
There are no faults mapped by the State of California within the Town’s corporate limits or
within either of the proposed annexation areas, however two faults occur within portions of the
Town’s Sphere of Influence. The following discussion describes the faults in the region that are
most likely to impact Apple Valley. Faults within the Apple Valley study area are illustrated in
Exhibit IV-3, Faults in Apple Valley Area.

North Frontal Fault
As previously noted, the North Frontal fault is closest to and therefore has the potential to
generate the strongest seismic shaking in the planning area. The North Frontal fault is a partially
blind reverse fault zone comprised of several fault splays; it trends south along the eastern flank
of the San Bernardino Mountains, and has a combined total length of approximately 40 miles.
Several of the fault splays interact with other faults that traverse the region. The most significant
fault with which the North Frontal relates is the Helendale fault, which offsets and divides the
North Frontal into two main segments, referred to as the East and West segments. The West
segment is approximately 22 miles long, and is less than 0.5 miles from Apple Valley at the
closest point.
The North Frontal fault is considered an active fault, based on its having moved within the last
10,000 years. However, it has not been studied in detail, and while it is has been attributed a slip
rate of approximately 0.5 mm per year, the parameters of this fault are not well understood.. It is
thought that movement on this fault causes an average uplift rate of the San Bernardino
Mountains of about 1 mm per year. The West segment of the North Frontal fault zone is
considered capable of generating a maximum magnitude 7.2 earthquake, based on its length.
Such an earthquake on this fault would generate peak ground accelerations in the planning area
of between about 1.1g and 0.4g, which converts to Modified Mercalli intensities as high as XI.
Based on rupture of the East segment of the North Frontal fault zone in a 6.7 earthquake, ground
shaking of about 0.26g to 0.14g would be felt in the planning area. This converts to Modified
Mercalli intensities in the IX to VIII range.
Helendale Fault
There are several right-lateral strike-slip faults within what is known as the Eastern California
Shear Zone, of which the Helendale fault is the westernmost. Approximately 9 to 23% of the
total movement along the North American/Pacific plate boundary motion occurs along this zone.
The Helendale fault itself is 56 miles long, but it also seems to form a continuous fault with the
South Lockhart fault to the north. The southern end of the Helendale fault apparently offsets the
North Frontal fault, as discussed above, forming the East and West segments. The Helendale
fault extends to the northeast of the planning area, outside of Apple Valley’s northeastern
corporate limits and within the Sphere of Influence.
The Helendale fault has an annual slip rate calculated at 0.8 mm/year; it has a recurrence interval
for large surface-rupturing events of 3,000 to 5,000 years. Based on currently available data, the
California Geological Survey estimates that a maximum earthquake of magnitude 7.3 along the
combined Helendale-South Lockhart faults would generate horizontal peak ground accelerations
in Apple Valley of between 0.75g and 0.3g, with Modified Mercalli Intensities of between XI
and IX.
San Andreas Fault
The San Andreas Fault zone is located approximately 23 miles southwest of Apple Valley. The
longest fault in the State of California, it extends approximately 750 miles from Cape Mendocino
in northern California to the Salton Sea in southern California. The San Andreas, a right-lateral
transform fault, is regarded as a “Master Fault” that controls the seismic hazard for central and
                                                                                  Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                   IV-18

                                                                      Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                                      General Plan/Geotechnical Element
southern California. The magnitude 8.0 Fort Tejon earthquake, which occurred in 1857, is the
last major earthquake to have occurred on the southern San Andreas. As previously discussed, at
least one other fault occurs closer to Apple Valley and has the potential to cause stronger ground
shaking, and therefore more damage, than the San Andreas Fault. Nonetheless, the San Andreas
Fault is considered to have a high probability of causing an earthquake in the near future and
should therefore be considered in all seismic hazard assessment studies in southern California
given its.
The Fort Tejon earthquake in 1857 ruptured the Cholame, Carrizo, and Mojave segments of the
San Andreas fault, and displacements occurred along of as much as 27 feet of the rupture zone. It
is estimated that peak ground accelerations in Apple Valley as a result of the 1857 earthquake
may have been as high as 0.38g. Another similar earthquake that ruptured the entire southern
San Andreas Fault, with its epicenter along the section of fault closest to Apple Valley, could
generate even higher peak ground accelerations in Apple Valley, estimated at between 0.48g and
0.25g.
Lenwood – Lockhart – Old Woman Springs Faults
Another of the Eastern California Shear Zone faults is the Lenwood fault, a right-lateral strike
slip fault approximately 47 miles long. It has a slip rate of about 0.8 mm/year. Based on
trenching studies, this fault has ruptured at least three times and these ruptures have occurred as
recently as approximately 200 to 400 years ago. Other ruptures are estimated as occurring
between 5,000 and 6,000 years ago, and 8,300 years ago. Therefore a recurrence between major
surface ruptures is estimated at between 4,000 to 5,000 years. Prior to the 1992 Landers
earthquake the yearly slip rate on this fault had been recorded but not verified.
The Lockhart fault is approximately 44 miles long and is north of the Lenwood fault. The North
Lockhart fault, a segment that evidences no activity within the last 11,000 years, is
approximately 6 miles. The Lockhart fault is estimated to have an interval of between 3,000 and
5,000 years for major surface-rupture.
The Old Woman Springs segment is about 6 miles long and is the main trace in a complex fault
system where the Eastern segment of the North Frontal Fault Zone and the Lenwood fault
intersect. It is considered an active fault.
The Lenwood and Lockhart faults essentially form a continuous, 90-miles long system. While
there is no evidence that both of these faults have ruptured together in the past, such an event
may be possible, as evidenced by rupture of five separate fault segments during the Landers
earthquake. The technical background study assumes a scenario wherein the Lenwood and
Lockhart faults, together with the Old Woman Springs fault, rupture together in a magnitude 7.5
maximum earthquake. Such an event would generate peak ground accelerations in Apple Valley
of about 0.42g to 0.19g, with Modified Mercalli Intensities in the IX to VIII range. A smaller
magnitude event involving rupture along only one of these faults ruptures would cause lesser
ground motions in Apple Valley than those reported above.

Cleghorn Fault
The Cleghorn fault, also known as the Silverwood Lake fault due to its extension across the lake,
is approximately 19-miles long. Studies suggest that the fault zone has had about 650 feet of
motion in the last 50,000 to 100,000 years, which results in a slip rate of 2 to 4 mm/year. A
magnitude 6.5 earthquake on this fault is considered capable of generating horizontal peak
ground accelerations in the Apple Valley area of between about 0.33g and 0.11g, with Modified
Mercalli Intensities in the IX to VII range.
Cucamonga Fault
The Cucamonga fault zone is approximately 16-miles long. As one element of the Transverse
Ranges family of thrust faults, it runs along the southern front of the San Gabriel Mountains
from San Antonio Canyon eastward to the Lytle Creek area. It has a slip rate of between
approximately 5.0 and 2.0 mm/year with an estimated average recurrence interval of 625 years.
The Cucamonga fault is thought capable of generating a maximum magnitude 6.9 earthquake,
based on length, and such a scenario would result in peak horizontal ground acceleration in the
Apple Valley area of between about 0.28g and 0.15g, with Modified Mercalli intensities in the
IX to VIII range.
Landers (or Kickapoo) Fault
The group of faults that ruptured during the 1992 Landers earthquake, including the Homestead
Valley, Kickapoo, and Johnson Valley faults, and segments of the Burnt Mountain and Eureka
Peak faults, are known as the Landers fault. The Landers fault now refers to the Kickapoo fault.
These faults are part of the Eastern Mojave Shear Zone and were discovered after they ruptured
the surface during the 1992 Landers earthquake. It is estimated that intervals between major
ruptures is in the thousands of years, The 1992 earthquake resulted in substantial lateral
displacement along some of these faults, for instance nearly 9.5 feet in the case of the Kickapoo
fault. Individually, these faults could rupture in smaller earthquakes. Their combined lengths
allowed for the magnitude 7.3 earthquake that shook southern California on June 28, 1992.
Ground shaking in the Apple Valley area due to a Landers-type earthquake on these faults would
cause horizontal ground accelerations of between 0.27g and 0.14g, with Modified Mercalli
intensities in the IX to VIII range.
Sierra Madre Fault
The Sierra Madre fault zone or complex is approximately 47 miles long and extends along the
base of the San Gabriel Mountains from the San Fernando Valley to San Antonio Canyon; from
there it continues southeastward as the Cucamonga fault. The estimated slip rate of the Sierra
Madre fault is estimated to be approximately 0.6 mm/year with a recurrence interval of about
8,000 years. Recent studies suggest that the last rupture event on the eastern segments of the
fault occurred about 8,000 years ago, therefore, the Sierra Madre fault may be near the end of its
cycle, and therefore has potential generate an earthquake in the not too distant future. The Sierra
Madre fault is estimated to be capable of producing a magnitude 7.2 earthquake, resulting in
peak horizontal ground accelerations in Apple Valley of between about 0.21g and 0.14g.
Gravel Hills – Harper Lake Fault
This fault zone is between 31 and 44 miles long, depending on how many fault segments are
included and is considered active. The estimated annual slip rate on this fault zone is 0.9
                                                                               Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                IV-20

                                                                      General Plan/Geotechnical Element
mm/year; the recurrence interval between earthquakes is about 3,500 years. The combined fault
segments are estimated to be capable of generating 7.1 magnitude earthquake, which would
generate peak horizontal ground accelerations in the Apple Valley area of between 0.20g and
0.11g, with Modified Mercalli intensities in the VIII to VII range.
Seismically Induced Geotechnical Hazards
Ground Shaking
The most significant potential geotechnical hazard facing the planning area is seismically
induced ground shaking. As previously noted, the effects of ground motion on structures are
difficult to predict, depending as they do on a variety of factors. These include the intensity of
the quake, the distance from the epicenter to the site, the composition of soils and bedrock,
building design, and other physical criteria. Given the variability of these factors, ground shaking
may cause no, little, or major structural damage or destruction. Generally, with increasing
distance from the causative fault, peak ground accelerations and seismic intensity values
decrease. The effects of seismic waves may be amplified by local conditions, such as soft soils,
shallow ground water, and the presence of ridge tops, which may result in localized
accelerations. Local agencies utilize the Uniform Building Code, California Building Code, and
Unreinforced Masonry Law as their primary tools to ensure seismic safety in structures. Goals,
policies and programs are set forth below to ensure that development in the planning area
complies with the requirements established within these codes.
Liquefaction
Where loose, saturated, sandy sediments are subjected to ground vibrations greater than 0.2 g,
liquefaction may occur. causing the total or substantial loss of shear strength in the affected
sediments. During this process, wherein soils behave like a liquid or semi-viscous substance,
structural distress or failure due to ground settlement can occur. These conditions may cause
foundation soils to lose load-bearing capacity in foundation soils and the buoyant rise of buried
structures.
Liquefaction is induced by three general conditions: 1) strong ground shaking over a relatively
long period; 2) the presence of unconsolidated granular sediments; and 3) the occurrence of
water-saturated sediments within 50 feet of the ground surface. These general conditions appear
to occur in the planning area, thereby allowing the potential for liquefaction. There are a number
of active faults in the region that could potentially generate earthquake characterized by strong
ground shaking of long durations. Along major drainages in the planning area and vicinity,
granular loose sediments occur. The alluvium underlying Apple Valley is coarsely granular and
percolates well; the water table is below 50 feet of the ground surface throughout most of the
area, with the exception of locally within the Mojave River floodplain, where water-saturated
sediments occur within about 50 feet of the surface. These areas are likely vulnerable to
liquefaction during an earthquake.
Seismically Induced Settlement
Strong ground shaking can, under certain circumstances, cause soils to densify and thereby result
in local or regional settlement of the ground surface and associated ground failure, which occurs
when loose granular, cohesionless soil grains become tightly packed due to the collapse of voids
                                                                                 Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                  IV-21
                                                                       Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                                       General Plan/Geotechnical Element
and pore spaces. These risks increase where there are recently deposited alluvial sediments and
when artificial fills are not properly compacted, potentially resulting in damage to buildings and
water, sewer, and other subsurface pipelines. Areas in the planning area that are underlain by
young, unconsolidated alluvial deposits and artificial fill may be susceptible to seismically
induced settlement.
Seismically Induced Rockfalls and Landslides
Landslides, rock slides and rock falls can occur as a result of strong ground motion, particularly
where saturated ground conditions exist. This potential increases in the planning area where
there is a high seismic potential, as well as areas where rapid uplift and erosion have resulted in
steep slopes and deeply incised canyons, rock with inherently weak components such as silt or
clay layers, and highly fractured and folded rock. Slope orientation relative to the direction of the
seismic wave also contributes to the occurrence of landslides in the planning area.
Although most of the Town of Apple Valley is characterized by relatively level to gently sloping
terrain, there are several natural slopes in the Sphere of Influence area that could be vulnerable to
seismically induced slope failure. In addition, there are many areas in the San Bernardino
Mountains to the south of Apple Valley that could fail during an earthquake. This has the
potential to significantly impede traffic through the area immediately and for several days after
an earthquake, which could indirectly impact Apple Valley’s residents and visitors, in addition to
restricting access to and from the area by emergency response teams.
Deformation of Sidehill Fills
The deformation of sidehill fills, which may also result from strong seismic ground shaking, can
cause minor to severe property damage. Sidehill fills, which are artificial fill wedges typically
constructed on natural slopes to create roadways or level building pads, may crack at the cut/fill
contact area. Further, strong ground shaking may result in differential settlement in the fill
wedge, and the development of bulging on the slope face. This condition is most common in
relatively thin fills of 27 feet or less placed near the tops of narrow ridges. It is not expected to
occur in Apple Valley, with the exception of the approaches to the two bridges in Apple Valley
that extend across the Mojave River, where minor settlement of the bridge embankment could
result in a step up of a few inches to the actual bridge.
Ridgetop Fissure and Shattering
Ridgetop fissuring and shattering can result from intense amplification or focusing of seismic
energy due to local topographic features. During the 1989 Loma Prieta and 1994 Northridge
earthquakes, linear fault-like fissures and shattering of surface soils on the crests of steep, narrow
ridgelines occurred, making surfaces affected by ridgetop shattering appear as if they had been
plowed. Severe structural damage may occur, especially where it occurs on relatively high
(greater than 100 feet), narrow (typically less than 300 feet wide) ridges flanked by slopes
steeper than about 2.5:1 (horizontal:vertical). Ridgetop shattering may occur locally in the
unincorporated area of Apple Valley, in the Granite Mountains, Fairview Mountains, and Ord
Mountains, and just outside the study area, at the top of the Black Mountains, Sidewinder
Mountains and Turtle Mountains.

                                                                                                   IV-22

                                                                     Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                                     General Plan/Geotechnical Element
Seiches and Seismically Induced Inundation
Seismically-induced oscillation or sloshing of water contained in enclosed bodies of water
including lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and swimming pools are called seiches. Factors that determine
the risk of seiche in an area include the frequency of seismic waves, distance and direction from
the epicenter, and site-specific design criteria of the enclosed body of water. Seiches due to
seismic shaking could occur in Silverwood Lake, to the southwest of Apple Valley, and in the
shallow lakes present throughout the study area if water is present at the time of the earthquake.
Minor sloshing of water out of the lakes and onto the immediately adjacent surrounding areas
may occur. In similar fashion, water in swimming pools is known to slosh during earthquakes;
for the most part, however, such sloshing does not lead to significant damage.
Fire-suppression efforts may be affected if damage to water storage tanks and systems
substantially limits water supplies after a major earthquake. Water tanks are required to include
baffles and other design elements to reduce the potential for seiches in tanks, open reservoirs,
and ponds where overflow or structural failure may cause damage to nearby properties. The
American Water Works Association (AWWA) Standards for Design of Steel Water Tanks
provides criteria for seismic design of water tanks.
Mitigation Of Earthquake Hazards
Building and structure collapses cause the majority of injuries and loss of life related to
earthquakes. The occurrence of an earthquake cannot be prevented, however, it is possible to
minimize such an event’s destructive effects through comprehensive hazard mitigation measures.
Such measures include the identification and mapping of potential hazards, sensible planning,
strict implementation of building codes, and the retrofitting and rehabilitation of weak structures.
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act
The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act was signed into California law in 1972, and was
intended to mitigate the hazards of fault rupture by prohibiting the location of structures for
human occupancy across active fault traces. As required by the Act, the State Geologist is
required to delineate active (showing evidence of Holocene surface displacement along one or
more of their segments) “earthquake fault zones”, and are clearly detectable by a trained
geologist as a physical feature at or just below the ground surface. An earthquake fault zone
boundary is generally about 500 feet from major active faults, and 200 to 300 feet from well-
defined minor faults. Counties and cities are also required to condition development permit
approval for sites within earthquake fault zones to perform geologic investigation that
demonstrate that the sites are safe from surface displacement associated with future faulting. Of
the types of development that are regulated are defined by State law, however, local regulations
may prove even more restrictive.
Currently (2008) there are no Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones mapped within the Apple
Valley corporate limits or the annexation areas. However, there are two zones extending across
portions of the town’s Sphere of Influence, and a third Alquist-Priolo zone approaches the
Sphere of Influence from the east-southeast. It should be noted that the State Geologist
periodically revises the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones based upon new scientific
                                                                                Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                 IV-23

                                                                     Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                                      General Plan/Geotechnical Element
research or fault studies’ data. Local agencies, either at the county or local level, can designate
additional fault hazard study zone.
Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act addresses hazards associated with surface fault
rupture. In addition, the State enacted the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act in 1990. This Act
addresses non-surface rupture earthquake hazards such as strong ground shaking, liquefaction,
and seismically induced landslides. It is intended to identify and mitigate seismic hazards and
thereby lessen loss of life and property. The Act is implemented by the California Geological
Survey (CGS), which provides local governments with seismic hazard zone maps delineating
areas susceptible to seismic hazards and other ground failure hazards. When development
projects are proposed within these areas, termed “zones of required investigations,” site-specific
geological hazard investigations are required. Although CGS has not mapped seismic hazards for
San Bernardino County, or the Town of Apple Valley the technical background study conducted
for the proposed Apple Valley General Plan and referenced herein has analyzed and mapped this
hazard.
Real Estate Disclosure Requirements
The Natural Hazards Disclosure Act, effective June 1, 1998, requires that sellers of real estate
properties and their agents provide prospective buyers with a “Natural Hazard Disclosure
Statement” if the property being sold occurs within one or more State-mapped hazard areas. The
law further requires the seller of a house built pre-1960 to provide the buyer a completed
earthquake hazards disclosure report and a booklet entitled “The Homeowner’s Guide to
Earthquake Safety,” which was written and adopted by the California Seismic Safety
Commission. The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act and Seismic Hazards Mapping
Act mandates that real estate agents, or sellers of real estate acting without an agent, must
disclose to potential buyers that the property is located in an Earthquake Fault Zone and/Seismic
Hazard Zone.
There are currently no official Alquist-Priolo or Seismic Hazard maps for Apple Valley.
However, as noted above, Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones are mapped across Apple
Valley’s Sphere of Influence. Where regions of the study area have potential to be impacted by
natural hazards, as described in this document, those hazards should be disclosed to prospective
buyers, following the provisions of the Natural Hazards Disclosure Act.
California Environmental Quality Act
The California Environmental Quality Act of 1970 (CEQA) was intended to ensure that local
governmental agencies consider and review the environmental impacts of proposed projects
within their jurisdictions. CEQA regulations require the preparation of an Environmental Impact
Report (EIR) for projects with potential to result in significant impacts to the environment. As
part of its analysis, an EIR must identify geologic and seismic hazards and include potential
mitigation measures to reduce potential impacts.
Uniform Building Code and California Building Code
One of the important tools used by local agencies to ensure seismic safety in structures is the
Uniform Building Code (UBC). It defines a variety of factors, including minimum lateral forces
                                                                                 Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                  IV-24

                                                                      Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                                      General Plan/Geotechnical Element
needed to resist seismic shaking, purpose of the building, seismic zone, type of structural system,
building configuration and height, and soil profile types that result in various degrees of shaking.
The last version of the UBC was issued in 1997.
California Building Code (CBC), also known as Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations,
provides building regulations customized for California earthquake conditions. State law requires
that every local agency, town, city, and county enforcing building regulations adopt the CBC
within 180 days of its publication. A local jurisdiction may, in addition to CBC regulations,
adopt more stringent amendments provided that they are based upon local geographic,
topographic or climatic conditions.
Building Codes are minimum requirements, and therefore, they may, in some cases, be
inadequate to protect health and safety. Therefore, it is essential for geotechnical consultants,
engineers, the Town and reviewers of their work to keep up to date with current research.
Seismic Retrofitting
Seismic zones are zones near historically active faults. The entire Apple Valley area lies within
Seismic Zone 4. The Unreinforced Masonry Law of 1986 requires all towns, cities, and counties
in Seismic Zone 4 to identify potentially hazardous unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings in
their jurisdictions, establish a URM loss reduction program, and report their progress to the State
by 1990. To comply with the law, the Town of Apple Valley has conducted an inventory of its
URM buildings and has notified building owners about the hazards of URM construction. In
2006, the Seismic Safety Commission reported that the Town has 14 non-historic URM
buildings. These building owners have been notified of the hazards associated with this type of
construction; retrofitting of the structures will be required at such time as a property owner
applies to do any alterations or additions to their building. As of 2006, none of the URM
buildings in Apple Valley had been retrofitted, and no warning placards had been placed in any
of the buildings.
Past earthquakes have demonstrated that many types of structures, in addition to URMs, are
potentially hazardous. These include pre-cast tilt-up concrete buildings (including pre-1971
structures), soft story structures, unreinforced concrete buildings, and pre-1952 single-family
structures. Other structures that are considered at risk include irregular-shaped buildings and
mobile homes. It is recommended that the Town consider developing and adopting a program
that inventories and provides mitigation of these structures.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Local seismic and geotechnical conditions pose on-going challenges that the Town must
continue to manage by means of those regulations and guidelines already in place.
Implementation and enforcement of the requirements set forth in the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake
Fault Zoning Act, CEQA Statutes and Guidelines, Uniform/International Building Code, zoning
ordinance, and other applicable legislation are necessary to deal with risks addressed in this
Element. The Town must also sustain or initiate close coordination with state, regional, and
county agencies in order to establish or maintain an updated information database of
geotechnical and seismic conditions in the region. As part of its development review process, the
                                                                                 Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                  IV-25
                                                                     Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley

Town must continue to assure that all-inclusive and thorough evaluations of geotechnical and
seismic safety are provided for all development proposals. Such evaluations must include the
preparation and review of all necessary special studies are conducted and reviewed, and the
implementation of comprehensive mitigation measures.

FLOODING AND HYDROLOGY ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Flooding and Hydrology Element of the Apple Valley General Plan sets forth goals,
policies, and programs to addresses potential drainage and flooding hazards within the
community. The protection of the general health, safety and welfare of the community from
potential flood and associated hazards is the primary goal of this Element. Further, other
elements of the General Plan, which also address threats to the lives and property of the
community’s residents, are referenced in this Element, and the potential for and extent of major
future flooding are assessed. The Town intends to plan for and implement the phased
development of project-specific and Town-wide flood control facilities.
BACKGROUND
There are several General Plan Elements that are related to the Flooding and Hydrology Element.
These include the Circulation Element, which discusses the need to maintain adequate access and
evacuation routes in the event of a major flood or other disaster; the Geotechnical Element and
the potential for seismic hazards to rupture aboveground water storage tanks; and the Hazardous
and Toxic Materials Element, addressing the transport and storage of hazardous and toxic liquids
above and below ground. In addition, the policies and programs of the Land Use Element guide
the location of development, key public facilities, and open space, which each have the ability to
affect flood damage potential.
General Plans are required by state policies and regulations to offer mitigation measures to lower
the impacts associated with the potential flood hazards within a community. California Statute
1939, Chapter 73, mandates that area-wide drainage affecting local jurisdictions be subject to
joint planning. Further, the Cobey-Alquist Flood Plain Management Act (Government Code
Section 8401c) requires that local governments plan, adopt, and enforce land use regulations for
flood plain management. This Act also establishes requirements for receiving state financial
assistance for flood control measures. Finally, the mapping of areas subject to inundation in the
event of dam failures is required by California Government Code Section 8589.5 and 65302 (g).
Meteorological Setting
There are three types of storms that produce precipitation that have the potential to impact the
Apple Valley area: winter storms, local thunderstorms, and summer tropical storms. Winter
storms are characterized by heavy and sometimes prolonged precipitation over a large area.
These storms usually occur between November and April, and are responsible for most of the
precipitation recorded in Apple Valley and southern California. Local thunderstorms can occur at
any time, but usually impact relatively small areas. These storms are typically most prevalent in
the higher mountains during the summer, but are also common in the Mojave Desert region.
Tropical rains typically occur in the summer or early fall, especially in desert areas. These storms
                                                                                  Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                  IV-29

                                                                       Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                           General Plan / Flooding and Hydrology Element
originate in the warm, southern waters off Baja California, in the Pacific Ocean, and move
northward into southern California.
Precipitation in southern California is also extremely variable from year to year, ranging from a
fraction of the average amount in one year, to more than double the average amount in another.
The Town of Apple Valley and surrounding areas are, like most of southern California, subject
to unpredictable seasonal rainfall. Most years, the scant winter rains are barely sufficient to turn
the hills green for a few weeks, but every few years the region is subjected to periods of intense
and sustained precipitation that results in flooding.
For example, record-breaking rainfall has occurred periodically in Apple Valley with peak flows
typically ranging from about 500 to 1,000 cubic feet per second. However, record peak flows
(measured just upstream of the Mojave Forks Dam) reached about 23,000 cubic feet per second
in 1969 and 1978, and more than 37,000 cubic feet per second in 1910. During the winter of
1938 peak stream flow for Deep Creek was estimated at more than 46,000 cubic feet per second,
and the Mojave River swelled to more than 70,000 cubic feet per second. The winter rainfall in
February and March of 1938 remains the benchmark for damaging storms in the Apple Valley
area.
General Conditions and Flood Hazards
Floods are natural and recurring events that only become hazardous when man encroaches onto
floodplains, modifying the landscape and building structures in the areas meant to convey excess
water during floods. Unfortunately, floodplains have been attractive to development throughout
history, since they provide level ground and fertile soils suitable for agriculture, as well as access
to water supplies and transportation routes. However, flood hazards are one of the most
destructive natural hazards in the world, responsible for more deaths per year than any other
geologic hazard. In addition, the average annual monetary flood losses have increased steadily
over the last decades as development in floodplains has increased.
As the population in the area increases, there is an increased pressure to build on flood-prone
areas, and in areas upstream of previously developed land. The construction of impervious
surfaces, such as asphalt, associated with increased development means that water that used to be
absorbed into the ground becomes runoff to downstream areas. Areas that have not flooded in the
past may be subject to flooding in the future if drainage channels that convey storm waters are
not designed or improved to carry these increased flows. Developments near the base of the
mountains and downstream from canyons that have the potential to convey mudflows are
particularly susceptible.
Stream Flow and Flood Hazard
Most of the drainages from the surrounding hills and mountains in Apple Valley terminate in
desert playas (dry lakes). The Apple Valley Dry Lake is the largest playa in the area, collecting
runoff from most of Apple Valley. A smaller playa (Reeves Dry Lake) is present in the central
part of Fairview Valley, where it receives runoff from the adjacent mountains. In the southeast
corner of Apple Valley, drainages from the Ord Mountains, including the Juniper Flats, Arrastre
                                                                                   Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                   IV-30
                                                                       Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                           General Plan / Flooding and Hydrology Element
Canyon, and Lovelace Canyon watersheds, lead to Rabbit Dry Lake in Fifteenmile Valley.
Along the eastern edge of the Sphere of Influence, drainages from the Granite Mountains flow
eastward to Lucerne Dry Lake in Lucerne Valley. Drainage channels in Apple Valley’s local
mountains are well carved, however they lose their strong definition upon reaching the valley
floor, where sediment-laden water typically spreads out into braided ephemeral stream channels
and as sheet flow.
Drainages along the western side of Apple Valley eventually discharge into the Mojave River.
The largest tributary to the Mojave River within Apple Valley is Bell Mountain Wash, a natural
channel that collects runoff primarily in the area north and west of Bell Mountain. The area west
of Catholic Hill is drained by the smaller, partially modified, Desert Knolls Wash. In the
southwest corner of Apple Valley, numerous small, unnamed drainages draining the western part
of the Ord Mountains flow towards the Mojave River.
The Apple Valley Master Plan of Drainage reports several episodes of flooding including a 20-
minute storm in August 1961 that caused several homes near Bell Mountain to be inundated by
mud flows, a two-hour summer storm in 1963 that caused flash flood waters to inundate
downtown sections of Apple Valley, and a 45-minute storm in August 1974 that flooded streets,
homes, and businesses throughout the area. More recently, in January 2005, intense and
sustained rainfall in the San Bernardino Mountains caused the release of water impounded
behind Cedar Springs Dam (Silverwood Lake) and Mojave Forks Dam, leading to evacuations
and flooding downstream, as well as erosion of the earthen levees along the Mojave River.
Seismically Induced Inundation
Dam Inundation
Seismically induced inundation refers to flooding that results when water retention structures,
such as dams, fail due to an earthquake. Three dams in the area could potentially impact Apple
Valley and the surrounding communities. These include the Mojave Forks Dam (Mojave
Reservoir), the Cedar Springs Dam (Silverwood Lake), and the Lake Arrowhead Dam.
Mojave Forks Dam is located at the base of the San Bernardino Mountains, where Deep Creek
and the West Fork of the Mojave River merge to form the Mojave River. Constructed in 1971
to control flooding in desert communities downstream along the river, the dam consists of an
embankment that is 200 feet higher than the original streambed and is constructed of compacted
fill. The reservoir design flood is a peak outflow of 23,500 cubic feet per second, and 131,300
cubic feet per second for the spillway. The maximum release from the dam to date was 16,600
cubic feet per second in January 2005. A worst-case scenario from failure of the Mojave Forks
Dam is that floodwaters would be expected to be confined to the existing Mojave Riverbed and
the mouths of tributary channels.
Cedar Springs Dam is located in the Summit Valley area of Hesperia, upstream from the Mojave
Forks Dam. This dam is constructed across the West Fork of the Mojave River and impounds
the Silverwood Lake, a large water supply reservoir that also serves as a recreation facility. The
dam captures a thirty-four square mile drainage area. If the Cedar Springs Dam failed it is
                                                                                   Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                   IV-31

                                                                        Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                            General Plan / Flooding and Hydrology Element
expected that it would flood a significant portion of eastern Summit Valley between Silverwood
Lake and Mojave Forks Dam in less than 30 minutes.
Lake Arrowhead Dam is located at an elevation of approximately 5,000 feet, approximately15
miles south of Apple Valley in the San Bernardino Mountain. The dam was constructed over a
period of years beginning in 1893; subsequent legal delays slowed construction, and the dam
opened in 1922. Lake Arrowhead Dam encompasses approximately 780 acres and has an average
depth of 100 feet. In the event of dam failure, floodwaters would flow north down the Deep
Creek drainage to the Mojave Forks Dam, and would be contained in the Mojave Forks
Reservoir area. If the Mojave Forks facility were at or near capacity, however, water from Lake
Arrowhead would spill over into the Mojave River.
Inundation from Above-Ground Storage Tanks
Strong ground shaking and rupture can damage aboveground water tanks. Without adequate
bracing and baffling, seismically induced inundation can occur. As a result, sloshing water
within the tank can potentially lift the tank off of its foundation and split the shell. The Town of
Apple Valley does not provide water to its residents, and does not own any water reservoirs.
There are numerous private water companies providing the area with water, and also maintaining
aboveground water reservoirs within the Town. Most of the tanks have been constructed in
recent years and may meet current earthquake design standards. However, older tanks may lack
the flexible joints and other seismic upgrades. Such upgrades, associated with newer design
requirements, can help to limit the potential for damage to areas downstream resulting from a
failed water tank. Therefore, evaluation and retrofitting of existing tanks within the Town should
be undertaken as necessary to ensure compliance with the most current water tank design
criteria.
FLOOD CONTROL MEASURES
Regional Flood Control
The management of regional drainage within and in the vicinity of Apple Valley is the
responsibility of the San Bernardino Flood Control District. Regional drainage includes rivers,
major streams and their tributaries, as well as areas of significant sheet flows. The District is
mandated to provide flood control planning and construction of drainage improvements for
regional flood control facilities, as well as watershed and watercourse protection related to those
facilities as part of its broad management functions. In order to accomplish its responsibilities,
the District has been invested with the power of taxation bonded indebtedness, land and water
rights acquisition, and cooperative partnerships with local, state, and federal agencies. The
official decision-making body for the District is the San Bernardino County Board of
Supervisors.
Local Flood Control
Although as stated above the San Bernardino County Flood Control District has the primary
responsibility for managing regional drainage in and around the community, the Town remains
directly responsible for the management of local drainage. To manage local drainage and open
                                                                                    Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                    IV-32
                                                                             Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                                 General Plan / Flooding and Hydrology Element
space, areas rich in vegetation and cover, as well as those constrained by topography should be
preserved, so as to allow existing alluvial plains and drainage channels to reduce runoff and
preserve the capacity of downstream facilities. The size of downstream facilities required can be
significantly reduced through the inclusion of on-site stormwater detention facilities
significantly. Further, such planning provides opportunities for groundwater recharge as well as
enhanced open space and/or recreation areas.
As new developments are considered within the Town, hydrologic studies should be conducted
to evaluate the impact that increased development may have on existing downslope development
The hydrologic analyses should consider the effects of increased runoff and alterations to natural
stream courses and identify the constraints to be assessed while planning and site development
are in their earliest stages. If any deficiencies are identified in the project hydrologic study, the
project proponent needs to demonstrate that these can be mitigated to a satisfactory level prior to
proceeding forward with the project, in accordance with California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) guidelines. Typical mitigation measures used to address hydrologic deficiencies in
project design include the provision of flood control devices such as catch basins, storm drain
pipelines, culverts, detention basins, desilting basins, velocity reducers, as well as debris basins
for protection from mud and debris flows
The San Bernardino County Flood Control District has established methodology to be used to
analyze and design flood control structures. The Town is responsible for operation of the local
storm drain network, whereas the regional flood control facilities are the responsibility of the San
Bernardino County Flood Control District. As a result, both agencies must be involved in the
planning and approval of mitigation measures in order to assure compatibility. The scale,
complexity and cost of future flood control facilities is influenced by the effectiveness with
which drainage issues are managed within Apple Valley. Prevention and on-site management
that recognize the significant physical and financial constraints that exist in many parts of the
planning area should be actively integrated into community land use planning and regulation.
Apple Valley Master Plans of Drainage
The drainage within the Town of Apple Valley is defined by the Apple Valley Master Plan of
Drainage and the Apple Valley West/Desert Knolls Master Plan of Drainage.
Apple Valley Master Plan of Drainage2
The Apple Valley Master Plan of Drainage divides the Town of Apple into subareas based on
localized hydrologic features, including topography, soils, and drainage facilities. These subareas
include the North Community, the South Community, and the East Community, as discussed
below.
The North Community Master Drainage Plan identifies numerous drainage courses and regional
drainage facilities in the northern part of Town, north of the Apple Valley Dry Lake. The
existing and proposed flood control facilities in this area include:

    •    Facility N-01 is an unimproved, open channel that collects runoff from a 3.3 square mile
         area encompassing Fairview Mountain and is diffused on the valley floor. This channel
         intercepts runoff and provides flood protection for buildings east of Central Road.
    •    Facility N-02 is a shallow earthen channel adjacent to the Apple Valley Airport that runs
         through from Central Road (north of Johnson) to Waalew Road (west of Navajo Road).
         Runoff transported by Facility N-02 originates on the south side of Black Mountain and
         the northeast side of Fairview Mountain, collecting runoff from an 8.7 square mile area.
    •    Facility N-03 is a riprap-lined channel that transports runoff from an industrial area east
         of the airport, and merges with facility N-02 south of Papago Road.
    •    Facility N04 is a fully leveed channel that conveys runoff southward from Black
         Mountain, north of the Mojave Northern Railroad. The channel drains an area of 7.6
         square miles. A debris basin is recommended adjacent to the railroad, because upstream
         of the railroad lines there are many drainage paths through the Black Mountain area.
    •    Facility N-05 is an earthen channel with a partial riprap lining that transports runoff
         generated entirely from the industrial area north of the airport. It merges with channel N-
         04 just south of Gustine Street, where an earthen levee collects flows.
    •    Facility N-06 carries runoff generated by Bell Mountain, Little Bell Mountain, and
         Catholic Hill, west of Dale Evans Parkway between Quarry Road and Corwin Road. The
         channel drains 1.6 square miles and is a natural earthen channel in some areas, has riprap
         in other sections, and is fully leveed in its southernmost sections. Containment levees are
         needed on the east side of the upper portions of the channel. In addition, debris basins
         may be required, since the natural channels that drain Bell Mountain are intercepted.
    •    Facility N-07 is a riprap-lined channel that carries runoff from Little Bell Mountain and
         Catholic Hill. This channel runs parallel with Corwin Road and merges with channel N-
         06 at the intersection of Corwin Road and Papago Road. This facility requires a
         containment levee along Corwin Road to channelize flows, and a debris basin where the
         natural channels that drain Catholic Hill are intercepted.
The South Community Master Drainage Plan proposes drainage courses and regional drainage
facilities in the southern part of Town, south of the Apple Valley Dry Lake. The existing and
proposed flood control facilities in this area include:
    •    Facility S-01 (Mariana Wash) and its tributaries, which convey most of the initial runoff
         from the Ord Mountains within the watershed. This facility’s outlet is at the Apple Valley
         Dry Lake, with 100-year peak flows of approximately 9,900 cubic feet per second and a
         tributary area of about 29 miles. It may be beneficial to elevate the lower reaches of this
         facility as a rectangular concrete channel to reduce impact on existing development.
                                                                                     Environmental Hazards

                                                      General Plan / Flooding and Hydrology Element
• Facility S-02 conveys runoff from the residential area south of the railroad and north of
  Ocotillo Way. The alignment of this facility closely follows the alignment of the existing
  wash. This facility outlets to Facility S-01, just south of Ramona Avenue with a 100-year
  peak flow rate of approximately 5,200 cubic feet per second. This drainage has a tributary
  area of about 9 square miles.
• Facility S-03 conveys runoff from the Ord Mountains east of the portion that is directly
  tributary to Facility S-01. At its confluence with S-01, this facility has a peak 100-year
  flow rate of approximately 3,800 cubic feet per second, and a 5.5 square mile tributary
  area.
• Facility S-04 conveys runoff originating in the Ord Mountains west of the portion
  contributing directly to S-01. At its confluence with S-01, this facility has a peak 100-
  year flow rate of approximately 2,100 cubic feet per second, and a 2.1 square mile
  tributary area.
• Facility S-05 would be constructed to convey runoff from the single-family residential
  development south of the railroad. This channel will have a base of 15 feet in width and a
  riprap lining for its entire 200-foot length. The 100-year peak flow for this facility is
  estimated to be approximately 780 cubic feet per second.
• Facility S-06 is proposed to follow the existing alignment of Colony wash, and would
  convey runoff from Deadman Hills and the low-density residential area in the southeast
  portion of the Town. At its confluence with S-02, this facility would have a peak 100-
  year flow of approximately 3,100 cubic feet per second, and a 4.4 square mile tributary
  area.
• Facility S-07’s alignment is proposed to closely follow the existing Del Oro Wash for its
  entire length. It will convey runoff from local residential areas encompassing 2.4 square
  miles and will have a peak 100-year flow rate of 1,600 cubic feet per second at its outlet
  to S-03.
• Facility S-08 conveys runoff from a southwest portion of Town to the Apple Valley Dry
  Lake. The watershed is long and narrow, and includes dense development of single-
  family homes. At this facility’s outlet to the Dry Lake, the 100-year peak flow rate is
  approximately 2,800 cubic feet per second, with a 7.4-mile tributary area.
• Facility S-09 conveys runoff from the southwest portion of Town and outlets to S-08, just
  north of Standing Rock Avenue and east of Navajo Road. The 100-year peak flow rate is
  approximately 1,100 cubic feet per second, with a 2.8-mile square mile tributary area.
• Facility S-10 conveys runoff from the area immediately west of the Apple Valley Dry
  Lake. At this channel’s outlet to the Dry Lake, the 100-year peak flow rate is about 1,100

The East Community Master Drainage Plan proposes drainage courses and regional drainage
facilities in the eastern part of Town. There are no significant man made flood control facilities
in the East Community, and the natural drainage system consists of one major watercourse,
which is the Fairview Wash. The existing and proposed flood control facilities in this area
include:
    •    Facility E-01 is known as the Fairview Wash. Runoff is generated from the Granite
         Mountains in the east and south, and from the Fairview Mountains to the north. This
         runoff is contained within a broad flood plain with side slopes with a ratio of
         approximately 60 to 1. This channel outlets to the Apple Valley Dry Lake, with 100-year
         peak flows of 8,500 cubic feet per second, and a tributary area of approximately 20
         square miles.
    •    Facility E-02 is planned to meet with E-01 at the outlet to the Dry Lake. Runoff for this
         facility is generated from Fairview Mountain north of Waalew Road. Runoff will be
         collected into a concrete channel by means of an earthen levee along the north side of
         Waalew Road, east of Tokata Road, as well as a short section of levee running north on
         the west side of the natural watercourse. The 100-year peak flow is expected to be about
         1,400 cubic feet per second, with a 1.5-mile tributary area.
    •    Facility E-03 drains the southern portion of Fairview Mountain in a partially riprap lined
         channel with a base of 15 feet. This facility has a 100-year peak flow rate of
         approximately 840 cubic feet per second. The facility’s confluence with E-01 occurs
         approximately 1,200 feet east of Japatul Road.
    •    Facility E-04 conveys runoff from the western portion of the Granite Mountains and the
         Deadman Hills. Runoff is channelized just north of Esaws Avenue, approximately 1,600
         feet east of Japatul Road. The addition of a levee running southeast from the channel
         inlet, and another along the east side of Redwing Road, will ensure channelization of
         runoff. At its outlet into the Dry Lake, this facility has a 100-year peak flow of 5,700
         cubic feet per second, from a 10.4 square mile tributary area.
    •    Facility E-05 conveys runoff from the Granite Mountains between Thunderbird Road and
         Standing Rock Avenue. The channel confluences with E-04 at Candlewood Road. The
         100-year peak flow rate for this facility is 3,800 cubic feet per second, from a tributary
         area of 4 square miles.
    •    Facility E-06 conveys runoff from the Deadman Hills. It joins with E-04 approximately
         750 feet north of Esaws Avenue and 500 feet west of Shirwaun Road. The 100-year peak
         flow for this facility is approximately 1,600 cubic feet per second.
    •    Facility E-07 conveys runoff from the Granite Mountains and Japatul Hills south of
         Standing Rock Avenue. This facility joins with E-05 at Shirwaun Road, and has a 100-
         year peak flow of 1,200 cubic feet per second. The channel is riprap lined with a base of
         15 feet.
                                                                                    Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                    IV-36

                                                                            Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley

    •  Facility E-08 conveys runoff from the Granite Mountains between Thunderbird Road and
       Standing Rock Avenue. The riprap lined channel joins with E-05 at Via Vista Road just
       east of Lillian Way, with a 100-year peak flow rate of approximately 750 cubic feet per
       second.
Apple Valley West/Desert Knolls Master Plan of Drainage3
The Apple Valley West/Desert Knolls watershed is generally defined by Catholic Hill and Piercy
Quarry to the north, the base of the Ord Mountains to the south, Kiowa Road to the east, and the
Mojave River to the west. The watershed is long and narrow, with the northern portion
moderately sloping to the southwest and the southern portion gently sloping down to the
northwest to the Mojave River. The existing and proposed flood control facilities in this area
include:
    •  Line A-01 is known as the “Desert Knolls Wash” and is an existing natural earthen
       channel that enters the Mojave River just upstream of the Upper Narrows. If levees are
       constructed on the River in this area, this facility would require approximately 500 feet of
       containment levees ranging from zero to six feet. The 100-year flow depth in this facility
       is the same as the River at their confluence.
    •  Line B-01 has a proposed outlet that will cross Riverside Drive and continue directly into
       the River. When River levees are constructed, this facility will require containment levees
       ranging from zero to six feet upstream to Talcony Road, approximately 1,200 feet
       upstream of Riverside Drive. The 100-year flow depth in this facility is approximately 3
       feet higher than the River at their confluence.
    •  Line C-01 flows across Havasu Road and empties into an earthen swale that flows to the
       northwest and into the River. Construction of the River levees will require containment
       levees at this facility, ranging from zero to six feet upstream to Havasu Road. The 100-
       year flow depth in this facility is the same as the River at their confluence.
    •  Line E-01 is proposed to utilize existing pits between the railroad and Rock Springs
       Road. The pits will need to be filled approximately 10 feet and the River levee will have
       to be lowered to allow flows to reach the River. The railroad and road embankments will
       act as levees for this facility. With these improvements, the 100-year flow depth of this
       facility is approximately 4 feet higher than the River at their confluence.
Federal Emergency Management Agency and Federal Flood Rate Maps
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is required to assess flood hazards, as
mandated by the National Flood Insurance Act (1963) and the Flood Disaster Protection Act
(1973). Through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), FEMA conducts engineering
studies to assist communities in evaluating the extent and location of flood hazards, and to
encourage appropriate land use and flood plain management and development. The flood zones
mapped by FEMA are published in Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs). The extent of flooding

potential in some parts of Apple Valley has been analyzed through Flood Insurance Studies.
Exhibit IV-4, Flood Zones in the Study Area, shows the FIRM inundation limits for the 100-year
and 500-year flood in the planning area. It should be noted that mapping of flood zones is not
complete since the entire area was not studied.
FEMA defines the flood zones based on the potential level of inundation. Each of the applicable
flood zones is briefly described below.
  Zone A: Areas of 100-year flood for which no base flood elevations have been determined.
  Zone AE: Areas of 100-year flood for which base flood elevations have been determined.
  Zone D: Areas in which flood hazards have not been determined.
  Zone X: Areas that have been determined to be outside the 500-year floodplains.
The FIRM maps are amended periodically to reflect changes in flood control facilities and/or
changes in topography (usually as a result of development). Modifications to the FIRM maps
typically accompany updated Flood Insurance Studies or Letters of Map Change that FEMA
issues in response to an agency supplying new hydraulic data showing that the flooding hazard in
a specific area has changed or been abated. FIRM maps in the Town include six community
panels from 1996, and one community panel form 1997. Since their original publication, some of
the maps have been amended by Letters of Map Change.
Portions of Apple Valley are still vulnerable to inundation during the 100-year flood. These areas
occur along the Mojave River and Desert Knolls Wash, and within the Apple Valley Dry Lake.
Except for Desert Knolls Wash, most of the FEMA flood-prone areas are relatively undeveloped,
or in the case of Apple Valley Dry Lake, development is minimal. Rock Springs Road is a major
roadway and Mojave River crossing in the planning area. This roadway, as well as numerous
secondary roads (mostly in the Dry Lake area), would be flooded and impassable as a result of
the 100-year storm.
Land Use Planning as a Flood Control Strategy
One of the most effective and direct methods to control flooding and limit threats to lives and
property is land use planning. Proper planning is consistent with other primary community goals
that call for the preservation of natural areas in the foothills and mountains. These preserved
areas can function as natural watersheds for local drainage and ground water recharge and can
have positive affects by slowing down storm water flows and reducing erosion and the amount of
debris that reaches downstream facilities.
Land use planning can also limit human exposure to the hazards of flooding. Losses to the
community can be greatly reduced through the use of restrictions on the type and location of
structures in the vicinity of major drainages. Within the limits of improved and unimproved 100-
year floodplains development should be severely limited and regulated. Restrictions in the Apple

Valley Dry Lake, which allows development of one unit on every 5 acres, or prohibitions on
development if flood hazards cannot be eliminated, are examples of how planning can effectively
protect against flooding.
Development approvals should be conditioned to assure protection of improvements from flood
damage within flood zones subject to sheet flooding. Protection measures may include the
raising of buildings’ finished floor levels above the flood depth projected for the surrounding
area, and providing protection to drainages against scouring. Such measures are standard
requirements of the San Bernardino County Flood Control District and the Town, for all projects
proposed in FEMA Zone A (see discussion of FEMA Zones, above). Until such time as flood
improvements are completed, and flood prone areas are removed from severe threats of flooding,
development in these areas should be carefully regulated.

Flood Protection Measures for Property Owners
Within the vicinity of the Mojave River and the Apple Valley Dry Lake, flooding remains a
significant risk to structures and residents in Town. It is recommended that property owners in
flood prone areas make modifications to their houses to reduce the potential impacts of flooding.
Flood protection measures are recommended by FEMA for property owners to implement and
reduce flood damage, including: the installation of waterproof veneers on the exterior walls of
buildings; putting seals on all openings, including doors, to prevent the entry of water; raising
electrical components above the anticipated water level; and installing backflow valves that
prevent sewage from backing up into the house through the drainpipes. These suggested
improvements vary in complexity and cost, and some need to be carried out only by a
professional licensed contractor. Structural modifications require a permit from the Apple Valley
Building and Safety Division, or the County Building Departments. These agencies should be
consulted regarding whether or not flood protection measures would be appropriate for a specific
property.
Other Flood Control Measures
Emergency Response
The Town has established the following evacuation routes: Central Road (north/south), State
Route 18 (east/west and north/south), and Bear Valley Road (east/west). The County is currently
developing County Evacuation/Transportation Committee within each region, with the high
desert region plan expected to be addressed in early 2009. Town emergency services staff
regularly participate in the County Evacuation/Transportation Committee and attend Caltrans
training. As of 2008, no comprehensive mass evacuation plan is in place for the Town or the
region.
In order to provide the highest functional reliability of major roadways and the public
transportation system serving the Town and the region, the Town shall continue to coordinate
with Caltrans, the Federal Highway Administration, adjoining cities and communities, and San
Bernardino County. The Town shall also address flooding hazards that threaten people and
property, and that may isolate portions of the community, through continued coordination with
San Bernardino County Flood Control and FEMA. Through this coordinated effort, programs
should be developed that can identify and address weak links in the circulation system, in
conjunction with the efforts of the County and other jurisdictions in the high desert region.
All Weather Crossings
U.S. Interstate-15 and State Route 18 are major regional access routes serving the Town. Bridges
and underpasses are critical roadway components for delivery of food, water and medical
supplies and personnel, as well as for the evacuation of the injured. Freeway underpasses and
railroad crossings are generally protected from flooding by existing flood control structures. In
the event of a major flood or other disaster, critical roadways and components could be damaged
or blocked.

In the event of major flood events, access to the U.S. Interstate-15 freeway, which links Apple
Valley with other cities and communities in the region, may become flooded or damaged.
However, several roadways cross the Mojave River west of the Town, including Interstate-15,
State Route 18, Bear Valley Road and Rock Springs Road. Rock Springs Road is an at-grade
roadway that is not passable during moderate to heavy rainfall. Although funding for realignment
of this roadway has been authorized through Proposition 1.B (Highway Safety, Traffic
Reduction, Air Quality and Port Security Bond Act of 2006), these improvements do not address
the river crossing. An additional crossing, the Yucca Loma Bridge at Yucca Loma Road, is under
design by the Town, and construction is anticipated to begin in 2010, with completion likely in
the later part of 2011.
Based on information provided by Caltrans, all bridges on U.S. Interstate-15 in the planning area
are designed to withstand the 100-year flood and to have 2 feet of freeboard for the 50-year
flood.
The National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
The Clean Water Act was passed in 1972 with the goal of restoring and maintaining water
quality by reducing "point source pollution" such as pollutants from industry and sewage
treatment facilities. Amended in 1987, the Act’s focus was shifted to polluted runoff; states were
required to reduce discharges into waterways. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
was required to formally regulate polluted runoff through the same mechanism by which it
regulates industry and sewage treatment plants: with permits under the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). Under the NPDES program, communities with
populations exceeding 100,000 must apply for a municipal permit that require cities and counties
to eliminate or control "non-point source pollution." As defined by the EPA, non-point source
pollution is pollution from diffuse sources, such as contaminated runoff, that affect a water body.
The NPDES program emphasizes pollution prevention, control measure activities, utilization of
existing resources and programs, and coordination with regional and state compliance activities.
The goals of these activities include the following:
    •   Eliminate illicit connections and illegal discharges to the storm drain system;
    •   Promote public awareness and participation through the Program's education program,
        the Storm Water/Clean Water Protection Program;
    •   Identify and control storm water pollution created by industrial and commercial
        activities;
    •   Establish storm water management programs for public agencies to reduce the amount of
        pollutants that enter and accumulate in storm drains;
    •   Identify and establish local regulatory control measures for activities that can pollute the
        storm drain system, such as new development and construction, and residential,
        commercial and industrial activities;
                                                                                   Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                   IV-42

                                                                      Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                          General Plan / Flooding and Hydrology Element
    •   Monitor wet and dry weather flows to identify the origin, types, and concentrations of
        non-point source pollutants;
    •   Increase existing municipal efforts to clean streets, collect solid waste, and prevent used
        oil and other hazardous wastes from entering storm drains;
    •   Develop local ordinances to establish legal authority for cities and counties to regulate
        stormwater discharges.
In California, as in many other states, the NPDES permitting program is administered by the
state rather than the EPA. There are nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards in California
with administrative responsibility for the program. San Bernardino County is under the
jurisdiction of the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board.
Flood Control, Wildlife Habitat and Recreation Enhancement
The control of storm water flows, which is consistent with the goals and policies set forth below,
should also be viewed as an opportunity for multiple uses, including recreation and wildlife
enhancement. This multi-use function should be considered in the design of washes,
detention/retention basins and channels. The Biological Resources Element also supports these
goals, and should be considered in tandem with the policies and programs in this Element.
Frequently used by numerous birds and small and large mammals, these facilities provide a
source of forage and cover. They can also can offer meaningful areas for passive enjoyment by
community residents, and serve as a retreat from the more urban environments of the area. These
areas are also important as opportunities for the continued integration of the natural habitat into
the built environment.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The principal implementation of this Element will be accomplished through the enforcement and
implementation of the Apple Valley Master Plan of Drainage and the Apple Valley West/Desert
Knolls Master Plan of Drainage. The improvements associated with the Master Drainage Plans
will help control and confine the area-wide drainage pattern to more discreet and focused routes
where it can be better managed. The Master Plans identify facilities that complement land use
patterns, provide cost-effective flood control alternatives, and maximize opportunities for
multiple uses. The Master Plans also set critical parameters for future development along areas
subject to area-wide flooding. The Apple Valley Development Code, Grading Ordinance, and
Subdivision Ordinance will be the primary tools the Town will use to implement the flood
protection measures required in the Master Plans. An update to the Master Plan of Drainage is
currently being drafted in cooperation with the County of San Bernardino Flood Control District
and is anticipated to be completed by 2011 or earlier.

NOISE ELEMENT
PURPOSE
Noise represents a potential hazard to the Town’s residents, business people and visitors. This
Element is designed to consider the land use patterns of the Land Use Element in the context of
the noise it will generate, and the ambient noise levels in Town. The proper attenuation of noise
is particularly critical to assure that the noise environment is controlled as the Town grows. The
Noise Element describes the current and future noise environment, identifies those areas where
noise levels are expected to be unacceptable, and establishes policies and programs designed to
reduce these noise levels in the long term.
BACKGROUND
California law governs the scope and content of Noise Elements. Government Code Section
65032(f) identifies the requirements for the evaluation of the noise environment in a community,
while the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) allows the Town to establish standards
to determine whether noise levels will have an effect on the Town’s environment. In addition,
the California Building Code establishes standards for acceptable noise levels inside new
buildings. The Town implements these standards through its Building Department.
The Land Use and Circulation Elements have the most direct impact on the Noise Element. The
distribution of land uses, and their relationship to noise sources, is critical to the quality of life of
Apple Valley. Similarly, the number of vehicle trips generated on the Town’s roadways will
continue to be the single largest source of noise in the community for the long term.
Development in general, and urbanization in particular, typically lead to increased levels of noise
in the environment. Excessive noise levels have the potential to contribute to temporary and
permanent physical impairments including hearing loss, fatigue, stress, annoyance, and anxiety.
In order to prevent noise levels from becoming excessive, standards can be adopted and
implemented through this Element to establish maximum acceptable levels of noise for all land
uses.
The noise environment also in Apple Valley is primarily affected by traffic on Town roadways,
and by local airport operations associated with general aviation aircraft at the Apple Valley
Airport.
Community Noise Assessment
Noise Rating Terminology
Noise levels are calculated on a logarithmic scale in decibels (dB), which is the unit of
measurement that describes the amplitude, or strength, of sound. The measurements are weighted
and added over a specified time period to reflect not only the magnitude of the sound, but also its
                                                                                    Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                    IV-47

                                                                      Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                            General Plan/Noise Element
duration, frequency and time of occurrence. An increase of 10 decibels indicates a sound energy
that is ten times greater, which would be perceived by the human ear as being twice as loud.
The most common unit for measuring noise levels is the A-weighted decibel (dBA) scale, which
gives less weight to the very low and high frequency components of sound, as does the human
ear, resulting in an accurate correlation to the subjective reactions to noise. The most common
sounds measure between 40 dBA (very quiet) and 100 dBA (very loud). A rural night-time
environment typically measures about 25 dBA, while a jet engine measures 105 dBA.
Due to the logarithmic nature of the decibel scale, doubling the sound energy of a noise source
only increases the decibel rating by 3dBA. Therefore, if the noise generated by one car is 72 dB,
another car next to it will only increase the noise level by 3 dB, to 75 dB. A sound must be
nearly 10 dBA higher than another sound before the human ear perceives it as being twice as
loud. An increase of 3 dB is barely perceptible to most people, and in many cases, an increase of
5 dB must occur for the listener to consider it readily perceptible. Noise control measures should
reduce noise by 5 to 10 dBA in most circumstances to effectively lower the perceived sound.
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL)
Section 46026 of the California Health and Safety Code established a model noise ordinance that
can be used by local communities to establish standards for appropriate levels of noise for all
types of land uses. The model uses the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL), which
averages noise levels on a 24 hour basis; the CNEL uses a weighted scale that acknowledges the
more sensitive evening and nighttime periods. Because of the decrease in ambient noise levels
during the evening and nighttime, sounds appear to be louder, and may be more noticeable as a
result.
Town of Apple Valley Noise Ordinance
Section 9.73 of the Town of Apple Valley Development Code establishes community-wide noise
standards and emphasizes the value of an acceptable noise environment. Section 9.73 sets forth
regulations for noise measurement and monitoring, as well as citing special provisions, and
exemptions to the ordinance. Section 9.73 is intended to regulate excessive noise from existing
uses and their activities. Violations are defined as a nuisance, and procedures, remedies and
penalties to which violators are subject are included. Section 9.73 also establishes standards for
construction activities, which represent a temporary, but often disruptive noise source.
Types of Noise
Noise sources can be classified as either “line sources” (such as a busy street) or “point sources”
(a commercial air compressor). A number of factors affect noise as it travels through the air,
including temperature, wind speed and direction, hard and soft ground surfaces, and intervening
vegetation and walls. “Soft site” conditions are those that occur over natural surfaces, such as
earth and vegetation, while “hard site” conditions are represented by hard ground surfaces, such
as asphalt, concrete, and stone. A noise reduction rate of 4.5 dBA per doubling of distance is
typically observed in soft site conditions, while a reduction of 3.0 dBA typically occurs in hard
site conditions. When considering noise generated by a roadway, these factors are particularly
important insofar as they can mitigate or intensify the noise level.

                                                                            General Plan/Noise Element
Major Noise Sources in Apple Valley
Traffic Noise
The noise generated by vehicles on Town roadways is the most significant contributor to noise in
Apple Valley. More heavily traveled roads generate the most noise, while local streets, which
carry fewer cars, are generally quieter. The U.S. Interstate 15 (U.S. I-15) freeway is located
along the northwestern Town limits. The primary thoroughfare through Apple Valley is State
Route 18. Residential uses adjacent to, or in proximity to U.S. I-15 or State Route 18 are
impacted by traffic noise. Schools and the hospital are also located on major roadways.
Traffic noise is also affected by the type of vehicle traveling on Town roads. The higher
concentrations of heavy trucks on U. S. I-15, State Route 18, Bear Valley Road and Dale Evans
Parkway result in higher noise levels in the areas surrounding these roadways. Similarly, truck
traffic can significantly impact residential neighborhoods on arterial roadways. To assure that
this impact is minimized, the Circulation Element includes a plan of truck routes that limits the
intrusion of truck traffic into residential areas.
Aircraft Noise
Aircraft noise associated with the operation of the Apple Valley Airport, which is owned and
operated by the County of San Bernardino, is limited to general aviation aircraft. The airport
currently (2008) operates an average of about 103 takeoffs or landings daily, or 38,000 flight
operations a year. The 60 dBA noise contour for the airport has been identified as occurring
within the Airport’s property, and noise levels on surrounding lands are not significantly
affected. While aircraft overflights may be heard within the Town, aircraft noise does not create
significant noise impacts outside the immediate area.
Rail Noise
While train noise is intermittent, train pass-bys generate high noise levels for short periods of
time. A single-track rail line occurs on the north side of Quarry Road for the exclusive use of the
Mojave Northern Mining Quarry, which operates trains on the lines about 2 to 4 times per week.
An additional single-track rail line is located within the southern portion of Town and extends
into the southerly Sphere of Influence area. This rail line is used by quarry operations in San
Bernardino County, and generally runs along Tussing Ranch Road, following Kiowa Road south
and Rock Springs Road west. Freight trains run on this line about twice a week.
Industrial and Commercial Noise
Industrial and commercial uses can have a varying degree of impact to adjacent uses. Noises
from industrial and commercial uses are typically associated with mechanical equipment,
generators, truck deliveries, loading/unloading docks, speakerphones, trash compactors and air
conditioning units. The level of noise that mechanical equipment generates can be effectively
attenuated through screens and baffling, as well as the orientation of the equipment as it relates
to more noise-sensitive land uses in the vicinity.
                                                                                Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                 IV-49

                                                                            Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                                  General Plan/Noise Element
Sensitive Receptors
Sensitive receptors are those land uses that are particularly sensitive to noise intrusion, including
residences, schools, libraries, churches, hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care facilities.
Day care centers, parks, and other outdoor recreation areas may also be considered sensitive
receptors. Moderately sensitive land uses include cemeteries, golf courses, hotels and motels, and
dormitories.
Potential problems occur when residential areas are located in close proximity to industrial and
commercial uses. The nearest noise sensitive areas potentially impacted by industrial uses are
located adjacent to the North Apple Valley Industrial Specific Plan boundary, in the existing
residential areas south of Waalew Road and Central Avenue. Intense commercial uses are also
located along State Route 18 and Bear Valley Road, and noise from these uses can impact
adjacent residential areas.
Existing Noise Environment
The primary noise source in the Town of Apple Valley is motor vehicle traffic. Noise from
railroads, which run to the west, north and south of the Town, have a limited impact on the noise
environment immediately surrounding them. Aircraft noise from the Apple Valley Airport
contributes to the noise environment in North Apple Valley. Other noise sources include
mechanical equipment serving commercial and industrial lands, household appliances and
garden maintenance equipment, as well as construction activities and equipment.
In order to establish a baseline for the Town’s noise environment, the noise impact analysis4
prepared for this General Plan included two types of noise monitoring. Four sites were monitored
for a 24-hour period, while short term monitoring was performed at 30 sites. The monitoring
locations are depicted in Exhibit IV-5. Long-term and short-term monitoring results are depicted
in Tables IV-2 and IV-3, respectively. As shown in these tables, the existing residential
neighborhoods adjacent to State Route 18, Bear Valley Road, Central Road, Waalew Road and
Corwin Road currently experience exterior noise levels approaching 65 dBA CNEL.

The Community Noise and Land Use Compatibility Model
In the Town of Apple Valley, the applicable limit for outdoor noise levels in single-family
residential areas is 50 dBA from 7 am to 10 pm, and 40 dBA from 10 pm to 7 am. (Ordinance
9.73.050).
The standard used for maximum outdoor noise levels in residential areas in California is a CNEL
of 65 dBA. These noise impacts are characteristically “unmitigated” and represent the worst-case
noise impact without any obstruction of the noise.
Table IV-4 below shows the CNEL ranges of allowable exterior ambient noise levels for various
land uses at build out. The allowable noise levels increase as the sensitivity of the receptor
decreases. Therefore, noise levels at a commercial shopping center, where people will
congregate for short periods during the day, but are not present at night, can be higher than noise
levels in residential neighborhoods.
The Town has consistently implemented the noise levels shown in Table IV-4 for a number of
years.

      Normally Acceptable: With no special noise reduction requirements assuming standard construction.
  B Conditionally Acceptable: New construction or development should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of the noise
     reduction requirement is made and needed noise insulation features included in the design
   C Normally Unacceptable: New construction is discouraged. If new construction does proceed, a detailed analysis of the
       noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise insulation features included in the design.

                                                                             General Plan / Noise Element
Managing the Noise Environment
The noise environment in the Town of Apple Valley can be managed using a variety of
strategies. For areas particularly impacted by noise, site planning and design standards, including
the use of buffer zones such as building orientation, walls, and landscaping between sensitive
land uses and roadways, can effectively lessen noise levels. As new noise-sensitive projects are
developed adjacent to the roadways described above, noise impact analyses will be required to
assure that all possible design features and mitigation measures are incorporated into the project
to lower the noise levels and assure good quality of life for the residents.
Noise is most effectively reduced by barriers. A solid row of vegetation, 15 feet in height, will
reduce noise levels by about 5 dBA, while a solid masonry wall can provide a reduction of 15
dBA. Barriers must be high enough to complete block the line of sight between the noise source
and the receptor. As a result, a home located on a hillside above a noisy freeway will not benefit
from a sound wall adjacent to that freeway. The placement of noise barriers, therefore, is critical
to their being effective.
Airport Noise
The Apple Valley Airport currently generates a limited number of flight operations, associated
with general aviation. In the future, however, the County intends to expand the Airport’s
capabilities to better serve the industrial and commercial land uses which will develop within the
North Apple Valley Industrial Specific Plan. Even with expansion, however, the future noise
contours are expected to remain within the airport boundary, and noise impacts on surrounding
land uses, particularly the residential development to the east, are expected to be less than
significant.
Bus Stops and Bus Routes
The Victor Valley Transit Authority (VVTA) operates bus routes within Apple Valley and
regionally. Currently, bus routes travel on major arterial roadways. In the future, as bus service is
expanded, bus routes may occur on collector or local streets. Bus noise is equivalent to heavy
truck noise in terms of its impact on sensitive receptors. Therefore, as bus service is expanded in
Town, care must be taken that noise levels for sensitive receptors are not significant, if the bus
routes expand onto less traveled streets.
Truck Routes
Truck routes have been assigned in the Circulation Element. These routes generally occur near
U.S. I-15, on State Route 18, and on major arterials and secondary roads, in commercial and
industrial areas. Based on an analysis of existing and proposed truck routes, sensitive receptors
should not be significantly impacted, and the long-range increases in noise should not affect
residential neighborhoods.
Train Traffic
The two train lines that currently operate in the planning area are owned by third parties, over
which the Town has no control. Although no plans for expansion are currently known, train
traffic on both lines, in the northern and southern ends of Town, could expand in the future. The
trains that pass on the Quarry Road line generate noise levels of about 49 dBA CNEL at a
                                                                                  Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                    IV-62

                                                                        Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                                              General Plan / Noise Element
distance of 100 feet from the rail line; the trains operating on the rail line in the southern end of
Town generate a noise level of 44 dBA CNEL at a distance of 100 feet. These noise levels reflect
engine noise, and do not reflect the additional noise intrusion of whistles and horns. Should train
traffic increase in the future, the noise levels would also increase, and given the land use pattern
in the area of both lines, could impact sensitive receptors.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The Land Use pattern in Town has been designed to place sensitive noise receptors as far as
possible from noise sources. However, as the Town continues to develop, and noise levels
increase, it will be increasingly difficult to buffer all uses from noise sources. Careful
consideration of the placement of new residential projects, and the noise-creating components of
commercial and industrial projects, will need to be reviewed by Town staff and elected and
appointed officials to assure that compatibility is maintained. The Town’s ongoing efforts to
preserve a high quality of life for all its residents, present and future, must include the protection
of a quiet noise environment.
Particular care will need to be taken when the Town considers development along the High
Desert Corridor. This roadway does not currently exist, but when constructed has the potential to
generate significant noise levels.

                                                     General Plan / Hazardous and Toxic Materials Element
HAZARDOUS & TOXIC MATERIALS ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Hazardous and Toxic Materials Element identifies those factors that need to be considered in
order to provide protection to residents and visitors from potentially harmful hazardous and toxic
materials within the Town. Such hazards may pose a threat to life and property, or may call for
costly public improvements. The Element characterizes these hazards and presents methods to
reduce or eliminate them by establishing policies and programs to ensure the utilization of
appropriate management practices, as well as the effective and secure use, storage, and transport
of hazardous and toxic substances in the community.
BACKGROUND
Hazardous and toxic materials are substances that have the potential to pose a threat to people or
the environment. Hazardous materials are commonly used in a number of industries and often
produce hazardous wastes. Hazardous and toxic materials can also be produced as a byproduct of
new technologies and chemical processes. Communities and the environment can face
potentially significant threats from accidental spills, illegal dumping, and other uncontrolled
discharges of these materials. Proper use, disposal, and management of such material is
necessary to prevent any adverse impacts from exposure to hazardous and toxic materials.
There are a number of other elements within this General Plan that relate directly or indirectly to
the Hazardous and Toxic Materials Element. The Air Quality and Water Resources Elements set
forth policies to minimize impacts from pollutants including hazardous and toxic materials. The
Land Use Element establishes zoning criteria that are intended to limit any conflict in land use so
that hazardous material use, storage, or disposal does not impact people or the environment.
Improper management of hazardous and toxic materials has the potential to negatively impact
the Biological Resources Element. The Emergency Preparedness Element is also related to the
hazardous and toxic materials element by establishing policies and programs that protect the
general public from adverse impacts associated with such materials.
Section 65302(g) of the California Government Code requires General Plans to address safety
issues, including but not limited to hazardous materials. A number of agencies including local,
state, and federal agencies are responsible for regulating and monitoring the management,
disposal, labeling, and use of toxic and hazardous materials. The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, the California Office of Health Planning and Development, and the San Bernardino
County Department of Environmental Health Services are some of the regulatory agencies that
deal with hazardous and toxic materials. The Tanner Bill, AB 2948 (Chapter 1504, Statutes of
1986), adopted in response to the need for safe management of hazardous materials and waste
products, empowers counties to prepare Hazardous Waste Management Plans (HWMP).
                                                                                   Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                    IV-66
                                                                       Terra Nova / Town of Apple Valley
                                                     General Plan / Hazardous and Toxic Materials Element
A variety of federal, state and local agencies oversee water quality and maintain data regarding
specific hazardous waste sites. These are further discussed under Hazardous Waste Management
Planning, below.
Hazardous And Toxic Materials
Potential hazardous/toxic material generators that may be located in the Town include
commercial, quasi-industrial, and medical operations. Typical businesses that may use or
generate hazardous materials or waste include service stations, petroleum product and equipment
suppliers, pesticide vendors and users, automotive dealers, medical practitioners, and hospitals
and clinics.
In addition, there are three hazardous materials transportation corridors located in the Town of
Apple Valley. The Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad, U.S. Interstate 15, and State Route 18
have the potential to be involved in the transport of hazardous wastes and materials. Accidental
spills, purposeful illegal dumping, air emission, and other uncontrolled discharges into the
environment from such hazardous/toxic material generators or transporters may potentially
expose residents or the environment to hazardous and toxic materials.
Hazardous and toxic material can be composed of a wide variety of chemical and purified
chemical compounds, products, and elements. As mentioned above, such materials can be used
in commercial businesses, industrial operations and processes, and medical facilities. The more
common chemicals include chlorine products, chemical fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides,
stored fuels and waste oil, chemical solvents and lubricants, and a variety of medical materials.
Such hazardous and toxic material users and producers are considered “small quantity
generators”.
Within the Town of Apple Valley there are a limited number of “small quantity generators,” that
use or produce hazardous materials. Such businesses are required on an annual basis to certify
any onsite hazardous materials with the County’s Hazardous Materials Division (HMD). These
facilities including waste-generating medical clinics, gasoline service stations, equipment and
fuel storage yards, and waste haulers. These businesses are inspected and monitored to assure
compliance with California Code of Regulation (Title 22).
The most significant hazards from these “small quantity generators” are due to leaks from
underground storage tanks, typically located at service stations, maintenance yards, and at the
airport. A search for Leaking Underground Fuel Tank (LUFT) cleanup sites identified 15 spills
within the Town of Apple Valley. To limit the number of spills associated with underground fuel
tank storage, the U.S. EPA requires all service stations to retrofit or replace underground storage
tanks with double-walled construction.
A search of the US EPA Envirofacts Data Warehouse for the Town of Apple Valley conducted

search did identify 7 school investigation sites, however, these require no further action since no
hazards were found.5
The Town of Apple Valley does not currently contain any large quantity generators of hazardous
waste. All businesses that use, generate, transport, or store hazardous waste are required to
submit a hazardous waste management business plan to the County of San Bernardino.
Airport Hazardous Waste
The Apple Valley Airport, located at 21284 Corwin Road in the northern portion of Apple
Valley, has a moderate to high potential for hazardous material spills. The airport is permitted to
discharge less than 1,000 gallons per day of treated sewage, which is considered a minor threat to
groundwater. In addition, the site contains four underground fuel storage tanks, none of which
have any reported spills or leaks.
Medical Hazardous Waste
The Medical Waste Management Program (California Health and Safety Code, Section 117600)
protects the public and the environment from potentially hazardous medical waste by regulating
the generation, handling, storage, and disposal of medical hazardous waste through the
implementation of the Medical Waste Management Act (MWMA). Through the program,
generators of medical waste are exposed to classes and workshops that provide management
tools and strategies for minimizing hazardous waste. Under the MWMA the County of San
Bernardino is the local enforcement agency for Apple Valley’s medical hazardous waste
generators. All medical hazardous waste generators within the Town and Sphere of Influence are
required to abide by the MWMA, Title 22 and Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations, and
any other pertinent laws that regulate medical hazardous waste.
Household Hazardous Waste
Household hazardous waste includes a number of common household products such as
fluorescent lamps, batteries, pesticides and herbicides, paint, motor oil, mercury containing
devices, medications, and electronic equipment. As of February 8, 2006 all household hazardous
waste must be disposed of at specified disposal facilities. In the Town of Apple Valley such
waste can be taken to the Town of Apple Valley Public Works building located at 22411 South
Outer Highway 18. This collection facility is open on the first and third Saturday of each month
from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm.
Hazardous Waste Management Planning
There are several responsible agencies, including federal, state, and regional agencies, that
regulate hazardous material, monitor and manage hazardous sites, and enforce compliance with
applicable hazardous materials laws and regulations.
The Town of Apple Valley, in conjunction with the San Bernardino County Hazardous Materials
Team, works with appropriate county, state, and federal agencies in the identification of
hazardous material sites and the active regulation of their cleanup. Management and planning for

facilities and operations that use, store, or produce hazardous and toxic materials may include
establishing and maintaining information on these sites, and periodic monitoring of such
facilities. A comprehensive monitoring program that utilizes multiple agencies to monitor the
storage and disposal of hazardous materials and regulates illegal dumping in the Town is
appropriate. Special attention should be paid to monitoring and regulating underground storage
tanks and septic systems, and the transport and disposal of hazardous materials.
The California Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB), the Town of Apple Valley,
Apple Valley Ranchos Water Company, and the Golden State Water Company maintain
information concerning contaminated wells and groundwater. The state and federal
Environmental Protection Agencies (EPA) and the State Department of Health also supply
information concerning specific hazardous waste sites and their locations.
Federal Agencies and Management
At the federal level the EPA, Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and Department of Transportation (DOT) regulate
hazardous materials. Through the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the EPA
was charged with the responsibility of creating regulations that manage hazardous waste from
“cradle to grave,” including treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. OSHA, in
addition to overseeing safety in the workplace, maintains a guide to “The Globally Harmonized
System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals” (GHS), which is an international system for
classifying the toxicity of a chemical. FEMA is responsible for developing policies and programs
for emergency management at the local, state, and federal level. For the transport of hazardous
waste, the DOT has established standards for packaging, container labeling, vehicle placarding6,
and emergency response.
In addition to the RCRA mentioned above, the following federal laws governs the production,
use, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste:
    •    Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments Act (HSWA)
    •    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)
    •    Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA)
    •    Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know (SARA Title III)
State Agencies and Management
The state of California has a number of agencies that oversee management of hazardous
materials. Collectively, these are known as Certified Unified Program Agencies (CUPA), which
regulate and implement laws pertaining to hazardous materials. The two primary agencies on the
state level are the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) and the Regional Water
Quality Control Board (RWQCB). The Office of Emergency Services, California Department of
Fish and Game, Air Resource Board, Caltrans, State Office of Environmental Health Hazard
Assessment, and California Integrated Waste Management Board are also involved in state
management of hazardous materials. The Cal-OSHA Division of the California Department of

Industrial Relations is the regulatory agency responsible for regulating industrial users and
producers of hazardous materials,. State transport of hazardous materials is monitored by the
California Highway Patrol (CHP) and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).
Requirements for these agencies to provide information on the location, type, and associated
health risks of hazardous materials to emergency response personnel, authorized government
officials, and the public can be found in the California State Health & Safety Code, Division 20,
Chapter 6.95, Sections 25500 - 25520; California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 19, Division
2, Chapter 4, Article 4, Sections 2729 - 2732. Further, Title 22 and 27 of the California Code of
Regulations are also relevant to the proper management of hazardous materials. Private database
and documentation services are also available; these services will search, extract, and summarize
reports on contaminated sites recorded in various locations throughout state databases.
Regional Agencies and Management
The Town of Apple Valley is a member of the Southern California Hazardous Waste
Management Authority, a joint powers authority between Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG) member counties. The draft Regional Comprehensive Plan (RCP)
addresses a number of areas of resource management. The RCP includes an overview of the
current solid and hazardous waste management planning process in Southern California, and will
discuss potential strategies and actions for improving the SCAG region's solid and hazardous
waste management system. The Draft RCP is currently (2008) in the environmental review stage.
The Town works with the Hazardous Materials Division (HMD) of the San Bernardino County
Fire Department, which has been designated by the State as the Certified Unified Program
Agency for handling hazardous waste and materials in the High Desert. Local businesses must
certify any hazardous materials at their facilities with the County HMD on an annual basis. HMD
performs compliance inspections of facilities that handle hazardous materials, which are defined
by California Code of Regulations (Title 22) as substances that are toxic, ignitable, flammable,
reactive, or corrosive. The Apple Valley Fire Protection District Duty Chief acts as the liaison
with HMD in the event of a hazardous materials spill or leak.
Standards established by the Town of Apple Valley’s Development Code are intended to ensure
that the use, handling, storage, and transportation of hazardous materials comply with all
applicable requirements of the State Government Code Section 65850.2 and Health and Safety
Code Section 25505, and Article 80 of the Uniform Fire Code.
As mentioned above, AB 2948 (Chapter 1504, Statures of 1986), also known as the Tanner Bill,
allows counties to prepare Hazardous Waste Management Plans (HWMP) to respond to the need
for safe hazardous materials and waste products management. The County of San Bernardino
prepared the Business Emergency/Contingency Plan (Business Plan) to meet the requirements of
the aforementioned bill. The plan was revised and updated as recently as February 2008 and
requires new and existing businesses that generate or use hazardous materials to obtain approval
from the County or Town prior to onsite use of such materials.
In order to comply with Health and Safety Code Section 25135, the County of San Bernardino
uses the Business Plan to assure that adequate treatment and disposal capacity is available to
manage the hazardous wastes generated within the jurisdiction, and to address issues related to
                                                                                    Environmental Hazards

the manufacturing and use of hazardous waste. The Business Plan provides a management tool
that requires each business to individually address the disposal, handling, processing, storage and
treatment of hazardous materials and waste products used.
For the Town of Apple Valley, the Hazardous Materials Division of the San Bernardino County
Fire Department is the administering agency and the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA)
responsible for the regulation of hazardous materials.
Hazardous Materials Response
The Town of Apple Valley has developed a Multi Hazard Functional Planning Guidance
Document (Multi Hazard Plan) that, among other priorities, establishes contingency plans when
an incident involving hazardous materials occurs. The Multi Hazards Plan is compliant with the
statewide Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS), which enables a multiple
agency response to an incident, and the National Incident Response Management System
(NIMS), which is intended to standardize agency response across federal, state and local
jurisdictions. The Emergency Preparedness Element provides additional information regarding
SEMS and NIMS.
As mentioned above, the Town of Apple Valley is served by the Hazardous Materials Division
of the San Bernardino Fire Department, which acts as the participating agency in the statewide
Certified Uniform Program Administration. Other responsible agencies that assure that the Multi
Hazard Plan addresses the production, storage, transport, and disposal of hazardous and toxic
materials include the County of San Bernardino Hazardous Materials Division and the Regional
Water Quality Control Board.
When the Town receives a call related to hazardous materials, the Hazardous Materials Team, a
unit of the Apple Valley Fire Protection District and a member of the San Bernardino County
Hazardous Materials Team, responds. The Hazardous Materials Team consists of specialist level,
certified personnel. This level of certification allows members to identify the hazardous material,
participate in Level A entries (fully encapsulated suits), and assist with any measures necessary
to mitigate the hazard, with the exception of disposal. The Hazardous Materials Team responds
to hazardous material spills including fuel spills and the illegal dumping of unknown products in
the Town, and may assist in other jurisdictions as requested.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
For spills and accidents associated with hazardous materials within the Town of Apple Valley,
the Town’s Hazardous Materials Team, as a member of the County’s Hazardous Materials
Division, is the first line of defense. To identify, regulate, and properly manage sites and
businesses where hazardous materials are stored, the Town defers to the County to contact and
coordinate with the appropriate regulatory and enforcement agencies. Similarly, the Town of
Apple Valley, in conjunction with the County of San Bernardino, is responsible for coordinating
with other agencies to identify contaminated sites as they occur and actively regulate cleanup.
                                                                                    Environmental Hazards

                                                      General Plan / Hazardous and Toxic Materials Element
Implementation of the Hazardous and Toxic Materials Element can be accomplished through
regular consultation with the Regional Water Quality Control Board and the County Department
of Environmental Health, by maintaining and updating a database on hazardous material sites,
including an inventory of underground storage tanks and septic systems, and by monitoring
facilities that utilize or produce hazardous materials within the Town. Also of importance in the
management of hazardous materials is the monitoring of the transport and disposal of hazardous
materials.
Processes for determining oversight, management, and coordination between responsible
agencies, including determining responsibilities of appropriate levels of local, State, and County
personnel and facilities is critical to an efficient and timely response to an emergency situation
involving hazardous or toxic materials. This can be achieved through regular consultation and
coordination between the Town’s Emergency Preparedness Manager and responsible County and
State agencies. Goals, policies and programs included herein guide planning and management
strategies to effectively address hazardous and toxic materials in Apple Valley.

WATER, WASTEWATER AND UTILITIES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Water, Wastewater and Utilities Element sets forth goals, policies and programs intended to
ensure the adequate provision of domestic water, sewage treatment and utility services to the
community. The community’s orderly growth and development depends on the provision of
these services, which include domestic water, sanitary sewer, natural gas, electricity and solid
waste management services. This Element describes these services as well as others, such as
telephone and cable services. These utility facilities and services are essential to the orderly
growth, development and management of the community. The Element also identifies standards
for provision of infrastructure and services relative to population and land use intensity, and
provides programs and courses of action necessary to implement the goals and policies
established herein.
BACKGROUND
This Element is most closely related to the Land Use Element, since all urban development must
be planned in conjunction with and according to the availability and cost-effective extension of
essential utility infrastructure. It also is tied directly to the Water Resources and Energy and
Mineral Resources Elements, as well as the Public Buildings and Facilities Element. Water,
sewer and other utility infrastructure are considered "critical facilities", and this Element is
therefore closely associated with the Emergency Preparedness Element.
As set forth in California Government Code Section 65302(d), the General Plan must address a
number of factors relating to water and other natural resources. These factors include
conservation, development and utilization of such resources. In addition, the management of
such natural resources as natural gas and electricity must also be addressed. This Element serves
in part to satisfy the requirement for a Conservation Element, as well as addressing the provision
of other utilities to the community. California Government Code Section 65103(c) requires the
Town to conduct an annual review of its capital improvement program to assure consistency with
the General Plan. Finally, the Town must comply with state Water Code requirements.
Therefore, this Element is provided as a framework for the Town’s compliance with state law.
Domestic Water
There are several public and private water purveyors currently serving the Town of Apple Valley
and Sphere of Influence. These include: Apple Valley Foothill County Water District, Apple
Valley Heights County Water District, Apple Valley Ranchos Water Company, Apple Valley
View Mutual Water Company, County Service Area 64, Golden State Water Company, Juniper
Rivera County Water District, Mariana Ranchos County Water District, Navajo Mutual Water
Company, Rancheritos Mutual Water Company and Thunderbird County Water District. These
are shown on Exhibit III-2 in the Water Resources Element.

                                           majority of the area within the Town’s corporate
                                           limits and is considered the primary water service
                                           provider in Apple Valley.
Apple Valley Ranchos Water Company (AVRWC or AVR)
Currently (2008) AVRWC operates 23 domestic wells in Apple Valley and serves more than
19,000 customer connections. The current (2007) total groundwater production capacity of the
AVR system is approximately 37.79 million gallons per day (MGD). AVR’s water system
includes approximately 400 miles of water lines ranging from 4 inches to 20 inches in diameter.
The distribution system is equipped with elevated storage capacity of over 11 MG.
AVR subdivides its system into 15 pressure zones to ensure that adequate pressures and flow
capacities are available to all customers. Pressure zones are interconnected and separated by
booster pumps or pressure reducing stations, as necessary. The Main Zone is the largest and
serves as the core of AVR’s system. It receives water pumped from 20 of the District’s 23 wells,
and provides 6 MG (54.5 percent) of its 11 MG elevated storage capacity. Along with its
associated reduced pressure zones, the Main Zone has adequate capacity to serve residential
demand and fire flow requirements to an elevation of approximately 3,040 feet above mean sea
level. New pressure zones would be required to serve development in higher elevations, such as
the north side of the Desert Knolls area. A booster pump station and an elevated storage tank
would also be required.
There are twelve (12) other AVR pressure zones within the Town limits, including the following:
Corwin, Reduced Corwin, Desert Knolls, Aztec, Bell Mountain, Stoddard, Riverside, High
County, Tract 15250, Sterling, Premier and Jess Ranch. Two other AVR pressure zones occur
outside the Town and its Sphere of Influence. These are the Youngstown, which is supplied by
the Main Zone via a large main within Cahuilla Road, and the Bellvue, a non-contiguous stand-
alone water system west of U.S. I-15.
AVR is located in the Mojave Water Basin and is subject to the Mojave Basin Judgment (the
Adjudication) of this basin. The Adjudication assigns to AVR an annual "free production
allowance" (FPA), which is currently (year 2007-08) 11,250 acre-feet, including carry-over from
the 2006-07 FPA. Beyond this amount, all groundwater that is pumped is subject to replacement,
which can be accomplished in 2 ways: 1) payments to the Watermaster for water acquisition (for
2005-2006, these payments were levied at a rate of $246 per acre-foot); or 2) through a transfer
of water allocation from another party to the Adjudication of unused water rights within the Alto
Subarea. During water year 2005-2006, AVRWC’s imports, inflows, return flows and outflows
equaled consumption. or “production safe yield.”
                                                                           Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                     V-3

                                                   General Plan/Water, Wastewater and Utilities Element
The AVR 2005 Urban Water Management Plan indicates that within the Alto Subarea,
groundwater levels decline from an elevation of 2,815 feet in 1960 to approximately 2,755 feet
in 1995. Almost all of the basins within the Mojave River Basin are currently in overdraft
conditions. Conditions within the Alto Subarea and the larger Mojave Water Basin are discussed
in detail in the Water Resources Element and the General Plan EIR.
Golden State Water Company
The Golden State Water Company (Golden State, GSWC) currently (March 2008) serves
approximately 2,847 active service connections within the nearly 4± square miles of its
Customer Service Area (CSA) that is within the Town of Apple Valley and its Sphere of
Influence. There are two Golden State water systems within its CSA in Apple Valley: the Apple
Valley North system and the Apple Valley South system.
The North system includes service connections east of Central Road and north of Waalew Road.
A portion of the south system CSA is located north of Tussing Ranch Road, and a portion is
located north of Bear Valley Road east of Toltec. GSWC currently utilizes 2005 water demand
data, which has been used to complete its master plans. Based on year 2005 data, the average
water demand is approximately 416 acre-feet per year (AFY) in the North system, and
approximately 789 AFY in the South system. Golden State projects that demand in the Apple
Valley North and South systems will increase to 3,609 AFY by year 2030. Please also see the
Water Resources Element.
Mojave Water Agency
The Mojave Water Agency (MWA) was established to contract with the State Department of
Water Resources (DWR) to purchase water from the State Water Project (SWP), and has primary
authority to protect, conserve and reclaim water. Based on this authority, the MWA administers
several programs to oversee the management of the Mojave Ground Water Basin. These include
groundwater recharge projects, monitoring groundwater levels and quality, computer modeling
of groundwater levels, developing and implementing public information programs, and
formulating a groundwater management plan. The MWA 2005 Urban Water Management Plan
Update shows that with increased water demands over the next 20 years, additional projects and
water management actions will be necessary to maintain groundwater levels and protect
groundwater quality for all users, including municipal, agricultural, industrial, recreational, and
environmental. In order to do so, continued groundwater basin recharge will be necessary.
Without such projects and if overdraft conditions persist or intensify, the presiding Judge for the
Mojave Basin Area Judgment could require mandatory cutbacks in production.
Wastewater Treatment
The local wastewater collection system is owned, operated and maintained by the Town of Apple
Valley. The Town's Sewer Master Plan was last updated in 1993. It identified the wastewater
facilities needed to serve development within the Town. The Town has budgeted for a Plan
update during FY2008-2009 to ensure that the system is adequate to serve the future needs of the
Town and its Sphere of Influence.
                                                                          Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                    V-4

                                                                                  Town of Apple Valley
                                                    General Plan/Water, Wastewater and Utilities Element
Wastewater is collected via force main lines and gravity sewer lines ranging in diameter from 6
inches to 24 inches. Wastewater is conveyed to the Victor Valley Waste Water Reclamation
Authority (VVWRA) treatment plant in Victorville via two regional intercept lines. One extends
south along Dale Evans Parkway south of Morro Road and trends southeasterly along Stoddard
Wells Road to Highway 15, where it enters Victorville and is conveyed to the VVWRA. The
second line extends west from Nanticoke Road along Standing Rock Avenue trending northwest
generally along Highway 18, then turning southwest at the Town’s western boundary and
continuing to the VVWRA. Both lines are owned and maintained by the VVWRA.
The VVWRA treatment plant is located at 20111 Shay Road in Victorville. Currently (October
2008), the plant’s treatment capacity is 18 mgd. Average daily use is 13 mgd.
The VVWRA is a joint powers authority that includes the Town of Apple Valley, City of
Hesperia, City of Victorville and San Bernardino County. Funding for the VVWRA collection
and treatment facilities is authorized by the VVWRA. The participating jurisdictions collect
connection fees and monthly assessments that are passed through to the VVWRA. Industrial
users are charged based on volumes of wastewater requiring treatment. There are additional
surcharges for wastewater with concentrations of biological oxygen demand, concentrations of
total suspended solids and concentrations of ammonia.
Approximately 30% of development in the Town is connected to sewer facilities. Unsewered
development is served by on-lot septic systems. The Town’s Sewer Connection Policy, adopted
in 2006, requires that new development with total gross lot sizes of less than one acre and within
one-half mile of existing sewer facilities connect to the Town's collection system. For
developments more than one-half mile from existing facilities, developers must install dry
sewers, or with the approval of the Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB),
developers may install interim “Holding Tank System” to create a working collector sewer
system within the development. Ultimately, all new development is to be connected to the
community sewage collection system.
The cost to transport wastewater from many areas of the Town that are outside the existing
wastewater treatment system to the VVWRA is considered prohibitive. To address this issue, the
Town has identified areas where sub-regional wastewater treatment plants might be located to
serve existing and future development. This advance planning effort is further discussed under
Future Directions, below.
California Water Code (Section 13260) requires “any person discharging waste or proposing to
discharge waste that may affect waters of the State, except to a community sewer system, to file
a report of waste discharge with the regional board of that region” where densities exceed two
(2) dwelling units/acre. Commercial and industrial wastewater discharges are also subject to
these requirements where discharge volumes exceed certain thresholds.
The California Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB), Lahontan Region,
implements federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to water quality. In 1990, the Town
and the CRWQCB entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that allows the Town
to issue building permits for development projects that use individual septic systems without
                                                                           Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                     V-5

                                                                                   Town of Apple Valley
                                                     General Plan/Water, Wastewater and Utilities Element
obtaining CRWQCB approval, based on certain conditions. These conditions are defined in the
MOU and consider issues such as on-site soil characteristics, type of residential development
proposed, and estimated wastewater flows from proposed commercial and industrial projects.
Electric Service
Southern California Edison (SCE) distributes electricity to the Town and its Sphere of Influence.
SCE provides electric power that is generated from a variety of sources, including nuclear,
natural gas, geothermal, biomass, wind, solar and hydroelectric sources. More than 16% of
SCE’s total energy portfolio is currently (2008) comprised of renewable energy sources. SCE is
developing new transmission facilities that are expected to provide for greater utilization of wind
energy sources, thereby increasing to 20% the amount of electrical energy distributed by SCE
and coming from renewable sources by year 2020.
SCE maintains electrical transmission and distribution facilities in the Town, which connect with
facilities located throughout its approximately 50,000 square mile service territory. These
include electric transmission corridors, with local distribution lines and substations to step down
power for local distribution throughout the area, as well as high and low voltage electric lines.
There are four major electric transmission corridors in the region, each of which has 115 kV
lines that provide power to local businesses, industrial plants, institutions, and residences via
distribution facilities and circuits ranging from 33kV to 6.9kV. There are three SCE substations
in the Town of Apple Valley; substation voltages range from 33kV to 115kV. Within the Town
boundaries, all new electric lines of 34.5kV or less are installed underground, as set forth in
Town Ordinance 14.28.020. SCE has indicated that it plans the construction of an additional
substation in Apple Valley to serve newly developing areas by year 2013; it is currently (2008)
conferring with the Town to determine a location.
SCE has planned for new infrastructure over the next 10 years to be able to adequately serve
existing and new development within its service area. Based on SCE's current 10-year load
forecasts, it expects to be able to provide electrical service to future development within the
Town and its Sphere of Influence. Future growth may require the construction and extension of
additional lines.
Natural Gas Service
Southwest Gas (SWG) provides natural gas service to the Town and its Sphere of Influence for
space heating, commercial and industrial processes, domestic hot water, and air conditioning
applications. Currently (March 2008) Southwest Gas owns and maintains a distribution system
consisting of pipelines ranging from 2 to 4 inches in diameter, which typically run within
developed public rights-of-ways. Nominal operating pressure for these lines is generally40
pound-force per square inch gauge (psig).
The high-pressure pipeline corridor system includes a combination of 4-inch, 6-inch, 8-inch and
12-inch diameter high-pressure lines operating at 240 psig. The following are the locations and
pipeline size ranges for existing high-pressure pipeline facilities corridors in Apple Valley:
                                                                            Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                      V-6

•   Along Thunderbird Road from Central Road to Highway 18 and Quantico Road (4
    inch, 6 inch, 8 inch);
•   Along Ottawa Road from Central Road to Kiowa Road (8 inch);
•   Along Kiowa Road from Ottawa Road to Tussing Ranch Road (4 inch, 12 inch);
•   Along Del Oro Road from Kiowa Road to Joshua Road (4 inch);
•   Along Bear Valley Road from Kiowa Road to Mojave River Road (8 inch);
•   Along Apple Valley Road from Bear Valley Road to Yucca Loma Road (4 inch, 6
    inch).
SWG works directly with project developers to insure that adequate facilities exist or can be
extended to serve proposed development. They will provide detailed facilities maps showing
facilities existing at the time of the information request from approved development. At that
time, SWG analyzes the additional demand to determine their ability to add or extend
infrastructure to serve a project. Upon this determination, SWG issues a “will serve” letter to
confirm the availability of facilities. New development fair share funding of any required system
upgrades are determined based on SWG tariffs, which are established by the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC).
Telephone, Internet and Television Service
Verizon provides local telephone services in the Town of Apple Valley and its Sphere of
Influence area via a standard telephone network (copper lines). Telephone service is also
available within incorporated areas Town via Verizon’s fiber optic network (FiOS). Verizon
provides high-speed Internet services as well as high-definition television via the FiOS network,
which generally provides faster download speeds than DSL lines. Verizon provides point-to-
point data transmission services to business customers in Apple Valley via DS3 or T1 high-speed
data transmission lines. Currently there are no customer service facilities available in Apple
Valley, however customers can manage accounts and make payments online.
Charter Communications provides telephone service, as well as cable television and high-speed
Internet, to most areas of Apple Valley. Charter has approximately 446 miles of coaxial cable,
of which about 292 miles is aerial and approximately 154 miles is underground. Bandwidth
speeds have been designed at 550 megahertz (MHz) with capacities of up to 820 MHz in some
areas of its service area. Charter provides approximately 380 miles of fiber optic network to the
high desert communities of Apple Valley, Hesperia, Adelanto and Victorville. Charter was
unable to provide a breakdown of the number of miles covered by its fiber optic network within
Apple Valley.
Solid Waste Management
The Town of Apple Valley maintains a contract for solid waste and recycling services with
Burrtec Waste Industries of Fontana, California. Burrtec collects solid waste, including non-
hazardous industrial waste, from Apple Valley and transports it approximately 12 miles to the
Victorville landfill located to the northwest of the Town. The landfill is part of the San
Bernardino County landfill system. The County has acquired additional acreage at the landfill to
                                                                           Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                     V-7

                                                                                     Town of Apple Valley
                                                       General Plan/Water, Wastewater and Utilities Element
expand capacity. Based on this expansion, the Victorville landfill is estimated to have a closing
date of 2047.
In 2006, commercial sources in the Town of Apple Valley generated approximately 43,382 tons
of solid waste annually. Residential sources generated approximately 25,479 tons. The County’s
landfill in Victorville currently (first quarter 2008) averages receipts of approximately 1,293 tons
per day. Receipts are currently at lower averages than in first quarter 2007 (approximately 1,401
tons per day), which is likely attributable to slow downs in the housing and construction market.
The landfill’s daily permitted limit is 3,000 tons per day.
The County Fire Department coordinates and facilitates household hazardous waste disposal.
Under the authority of the County Fire Department’s Household Hazardous Waste program, the
Town operates a collection center located at the Town’s Public Works Yard at 22411 South
Outer Highway 18. Materials accepted for disposal at this location include pesticides, wood
preservatives and solvents, automobile batteries, and small electronic items such as television
sets and computer monitors, as well as other materials. The center is open the first and third
Saturdays of each month from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Approved County contractors categorize,
sort, pack and haul wastes to approved facilities. Wastes are processed and packaged for off-site
recycling or incineration, as applicable. Oil filters, oil, latex pain, antifreeze and batteries are
among those items that are further recycled.
Small-scale generators of industrial hazardous wastes qualify for the County’s "Conditionally
Exempt Small Quantity Generators" (CESQGs) program. To qualify for the program, a business
must generate less than 27 gallons or 220 pounds of hazardous waste, or 2.2 pounds of extremely
hazardous waste, on a monthly basis. The San Bernardino County Fire Department will collect
hazardous waste, or businesses can deliver waste to the County’s collection facility, if such
delivery can be accomplished safely and in compliance with all regulatory requirements. Wastes
are then transported to a state-permitted processing facility located in San Bernardino and further
recycled or incinerated.
Hazardous waste from businesses that generate more than the threshold amounts is collected by
private contractors collect for disposal by County-approved hazardous waste disposal firms in
accordance with state and federal regulations for such waste.
Recycling Efforts
Municipalities in California are required, in accordance with the California Waste Management
Act (AB 939), to reduce the amount of waste that is transported to landfills by 50 percent, as of
year 2000. The Town’s recycling programs are responsive to AB 939. Individuals also have the
option of participating through private recycling operators.
Recyclable materials are collected curbside from residential, commercial and industrial locations
on at least a weekly basis by AVCO, a Burrtec company. Materials are transported to the Victor
Valley Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) in Victorville. The MRF sorts, bales and ships
recyclables at a rate of approximately 20 tons per hour, and can process over 800 tons per week.
The MRF is jointly owned by the Town of Apple Valley and the City of Victorville, and
operated by Burrtec.
                                                                              Public Services and Facilities

                                                     General Plan/Water, Wastewater and Utilities Element
Based on Department of Public Works records, in 2006, AVCO collected approximately 68,861
tons of recyclable materials from sources in the Town, as follows: commercial sources – 43,382
tons; residential sources – 25,479 tons.
The Town is part of the Zero Waste Communities of San Bernardino County (ZWC), a collective
effort by 16 townships and cities in the County to educate residents on ways to reduce, reuse and
recycle to extend the lives of the County’s landfills. Recycling services also address issues of
sustainability and global warming by resulting in energy and resources conservation.
Greenwaste generated in the Town of Apple Valley is accepted at the California Bio-Mass
composting facility on Shay Road in Victorville. The facility uses greenwaste for composting.
The Victorville facility processes approximately 18,000 tons of greenwaste annually. Of this
amount, approximately 1,771 tons were generated from sources in Apple Valley in 2006, and
925 tons in 2007. California Bio-Mass in Victorville has a daily processing capacity of 200 tons,
and has a permitted expansion area for an additional 500 tons per day.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Effective land use planning requires the planned and cost-effective extension of water,
wastewater and other public utilities. The economic health and development potential of a
community is impacted by the availability and quality of these services. Modern and available
utility infrastructure is essential to attract commercial, industrial and hotel/motel development,
which are considered important parts of the Town's economic base. The Town’s long-range
facilities’ planning is essential in the timely provision of adequate public service and utility
services over the long-term. This process should therefore be active and continuous, benefiting
from close coordination with the appropriate public and quasi-public agencies and service
providers.
The Town will continue to play a pivotal role in addressing existing and future service issues,
such as sharing information on current and future land use and development, coordinating
planning of domestic water service, and the potential for establishing sub-regional wastewater
treatment facilities to connect currently unsewered development to the wastewater treatment
system.
The Town should also continue to monitor the emergence of and demand for new technologies,
such as fiber optic cabling and high-speed data transmission, to anticipate expansion plans and
ensure the provision of state-of-the-art technologies to future development in the Town and its
Sphere of Influence. Information provided in this General Plan regarding existing and future
development in the Town and Sphere will help utility providers plan to meet the community’s
needs.

PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Town of Apple Valley has a range of public buildings and facilities, including the Town
Hall, fire and police stations, schools and libraries, parks and community centers. These also
include utilities and associated facilities such as electrical power substations, telephone and cable
transmission lines, domestic water wells and reservoirs, and wastewater treatment facilities.
These public and quasi-public facilities are built to accommodate the community’s needs and
constitute an important part of its quality of life.
Town-owned and utility maintenance yards and facilities, roadways, traffic signals and bridges
are also included in this category. The Town’s advance planning process must provide for timely
provision of these facilities in order to ensure that the needs of existing and future development
are met. Some of these facilities, especially utilities, are key factors in determining timing,
location and intensity of future development. This Element shows the location of most of these
facilities on the General Plan map.
The Public Buildings and Facilities Element reflects the state of available technological and
organization resources, and describes the various structures and facilities owned by public and
quasi-public agencies in the Town. It further reviews them in relationship to land use
compatibility issues, aesthetic impacts, and functionality in order to provide sufficient
information for these agencies to adequately coordinate planning and development. This Element
also establishes goals, policies, and programs to address the long-term planning needs of the
Town.
BACKGROUND
The Public Buildings and Facilities Element is directly related to several other General Plan
elements. The Land Use Element assigns land use designations to ensure that the Town has
adequate and optimally planned lands for existing and future public buildings and facilities. The
Circulation Element is intended to ensure the provision of safe, efficient transportation corridors
throughout the Town and especially to essential public facilities. The local and regional
economies directly impact and are impacted by the ability of the Town and other responsible
public and quasi-public agencies charged with providing necessary facilities to do so.
Government Code Section 65103(c) requires that each local government conduct an annual
review of its capital improvement program, as well as the other local agencies’ public works
projects to ensure coordination between and consistency with the General Plan.
Public buildings and facilities are sited within the community based largely on their function.
Nonetheless, the logical and sensitive integration of these facilities into the Town’s existing and
planned land use patterns must also be considered. Convenient and safe access, provision of
adequate parking, and other considerations must be accounted for when siting public buildings
                                                                                Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                         V-14

                                                                         Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                      General Plan/ Public Buildings and Facilities Element
that serve as offices for residents and Town staff to conduct business. The following discussion
focuses primarily on public buildings and facilities; however, utilities such as electrical
substations, water wells, and others are also considered in relation to their compatibility with
surrounding land uses.
The locations of public buildings and facilities are illustrated on Exhibit V-1, Public Buildings
and Facilities Map North and Exhibit V-2, Public Buildings and Facilities Map South.
City Hall and Associated Facilities
The Town of Apple Valley Civic Center is
located at 14955 Dale Evans Parkway.
The Civic Center campus is approximately
6.03 acres and includes the Town Hall, the
Civic Center Park, Town Hall Recreation
Center and Aquatic Center, Apple Valley
Police Department, and the Newton T. Bass
Branch Library of San Bernardino County;
these facilities are discussed further, below.
The Town Hall was constructed in 2002 and
encompasses approximately 27,900 square
feet. There is also an outdoor amphitheatre
that seats 1,000. A new Town Hall annex has been designed and is currently (2008) in the
construction-bidding phase, with completion expected in 2009. The new annex will be located on
2± acres adjacent to existing facilities and will provide additional administrative space for Town
departments that are currently overcrowded. The new building will incorporate numerous green-
building features, including materials and orientation to better utilize natural light.
Town Public Works Yard
Currently (2008) located at 22411 South Outer Highway 18, the Town Public Works Yard
encompasses an approximately 1.5-acre parcel. The yard was constructed in 1975 and houses the
Public Works offices, storage and yard, and the animal control offices and animal shelter. The
Town Hazardous Waste Collection Center is also located at the Yard. The main office is
approximately 2,356 square feet, with an additional 5,726 square feet of warehouse space. The
animal control facility currently encompasses 8,000± square feet, with 3,000 square feet of office
space and 5,000 feet of animal shelter facilities.
The Town plans on relocating and expanding the Public Works Yard, to 13450 Nomwacket
Road. The Town purchased this developed site in 2008. The potential expansion would result in
an approximate tripling of currently available space. The Town plans to re-locate the animal
shelter to an approximately 5-acre site on the southeast corner of Quinnault Road and Powhatan
Road, with an estimated construction completion date of July 2009. The animal shelter and
ancillary offices will be constructed on the northern 2 acres of the site and the future public
works yard and storage will occupy the southern 3 acres of the site. The southern 3 acres is
directly west of the newly acquired Public Works facility.
                                                                              Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                       V-15

                                                     General Plan/ Public Buildings and Facilities Element
Community Center
The James Woody Community Center is located at 13467 Navajo Road on approximately 22
acres, which are fully developed. The 28,676 square foot facility includes a full-sized
gymnasium and a mini-gym, as well as an enclosed racquetball court, and a maintenance shop.
Other facilities on-site include a batting cage and practice ball fields, five lighted ball fields for
Little League, youth soccer, flag football and adult softball leagues, and two concession stands.
The park also provides an equipped playground and a grassed park area with trees, picnic tables
and barbecues, as well as paved parking areas and restrooms.
Chamber of Commerce
The Apple Valley Chamber of Commerce is located at 16010 Apple Valley Road. The Chamber
was established in 1948 as the Businessman’s Association, changing to its present name in 1951.
The Chamber moved to its current location in the B. J. Westlund building in the Spirit River
Center in 2000. The 3,000 square feet facility provides the Chamber with state-of-the-art
technological capabilities. The Chamber is committed to providing education and training to
business owners through which it aims to improve the local economy.
Fire Stations
The Apple Valley Fire Protection District serves the Town of Apple Valley as well as other high
desert communities, including those portions of unincorporated San Bernardino County that are
within its approximately 206-square mile service area. The AVFPD maintains a mutual aid
agreement with the City of Victorville Fire Department, San Bernardino County Fire
Department, and the Bureau of Land Management. The mutual aid agreements provide a
mechanism for coordinated strategic
and facilities planning between fire
departments in the region to actively
support one another regardless of
geographic or jurisdictional boundaries.
A joint dispatch center is located in
Victorville that serves the mutual aid
agencies.
AVFPD maintains and is responsible
for staffing seven fire stations in Apple
Valley. Of these, five are staffed 24-
hours per day, seven days per week.
Another fire station is staffed on an as-
needed basis by on-call firefighters, and
the seventh station is staffed entirely by
private ambulance company personnel. The Police and Fire Protection Element lists these
stations and their associated staffing and equipment. Station locations are shown on the two
Public Buildings and Facilities Maps (Exhibits V-1 and V-2).
An eighth fire station is being considered on approximately 12 acres at the northeast corner of
Johnson Road and Navajo Road. The Wal-Mart Corporation, which owns the Wal-Mart
Distribution Center in North Apple Valley, donated the site to the Town. If developed, the new
                                                                             Public Services and Facilities

owned by private pilots. The airport serves mainly small, private aircraft. The California
Highway Patrol and San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department share a hangar. There are 50 tie-downs
and two runways:             Runway 18/36 is
approximately 6,500 feet long and 150 feet
wide; Runway 8/26 is approximately 4,100 feet
long and 60 feet wide. The Apple Valley
Airport is further discussed in the Circulation
Element.
Hospitals and Other Medical Facilities
St. Mary Medical Center is located at 18300
Highway 18 in Apple Valley. The
approximately 90-acre campus provides acute,
general medical-surgical and intensive care,
and includes a 24-hour emergency room as
                                                                               Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                        V-19

                                                                        Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                     General Plan/ Public Buildings and Facilities Element
well as a variety of other in and outpatient medical services. The current (2008) facilities,
including offices, encompass approximately 215,000 square feet. The hospital is currently
designated as a Level III trauma care center, which is the lowest level of trauma care. Near-term
(5-year) plans include construction of new acute care facilities with the intention of attaining
Level I trauma care status. The hospital has also purchased lands in Victorville and plans to
break ground for facilities there within approximately 3 years. The hospital maintains back-up
facilities, such as diesel-powered generators and food and water stockpiles, as well as a
decontamination tent. The hospital’s role as a critical facility in the event of an emergency is
further discussed in the Emergency Preparedness Element.

                                                       General Plan/ Public Buildings and Facilities Element
There are several residential senior care facilities in the Town, which provide services ranging
from independent to assisted living facilities to skilled nursing care. There are also a number of
facilities offering care to persons with Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia.
Utility Infrastructure
Utility services are provided to the Town by a variety of service providers. The Town maintains
a system of wastewater collection lines that connect to interceptor lines owned and maintained
by the Victor Valley Wastewater Reclamation Authority as part of a joint powers agreement.
There are several domestic water purveyors. Apple Valley Ranchos Water Company is the
primary water service/facilities provider to the Town and its Sphere of Influence, with over
19,000 service connections. Golden State Water Company provides services to approximately
2,509 active connections in Apple Valley. There are several other smaller water purveyors, as
discussed in the Water Resources Element and the Water, Wastewater and Utilities Element.
Southern California Edison provides electrical service to the Town. There are four major electric
transmission corridors in the region from which electrical power is distributed to substations via
115kV lines. SCE has three substations in the Town, with voltages ranging from 3kV to 115kV.
Power from these substations is distributed to local residential, business, industrial and
institutional customers via 33kV to 6.9kV distribution facilities and circuits. As new electric
lines are added, those of 34.5kV or less are undergrounded.
Natural gas is delivered to the most portions of the Town and its Sphere of Influence by
Southwest Gas Company facilities. Other utility and service providers include Verizon, Charter
Communications, and Burrtec. Apple Valley Ranchos Water Company has over 20 well sites and
several elevated storage reservoirs, as well as booster pumps and pressure-reducing stations.
Many other major utility buildings and facilities, such as the regional wastewater treatment
facility, are located outside of Apple Valley. These are further described in the Water,
Wastewater and Utilities Element.
The scenic value and noise environment of an area may be impacted by the operation of such
utility facilities as well, reservoirs, pumping facilities, and electrical substations and switching
facilities. Design of these structures can incorporate landscaping and architectural elements and
treatments that soften and help harmonize these facilities with the surrounding environment.
Such improvements may include visual and sound barriers, such as block walls and landscape
buffers to further minimize potential impacts. The use of architectural styles and colors that are
consistent with the local environment is also important to ensure compatibility with surrounding
land uses and the natural setting. Visual impacts can also be avoided through undergrounding of
transmission lines, where feasible.
Stormwater Management Facilities
The Town maintains local stormwater management facilities, which include a series of lined and
unlined drainage channels located throughout the Town and its Sphere of Influence. The Town’s
Master Plan of Drainage divides the Town into subareas based on hydrologic features that occur
within the north, south and east, respectively. There are several existing flood control channels
currently serving the Town and several more are proposed. The western portion of the Town is
considered in the Apple Valley West/Desert Knolls Master Plan of Drainage.
                                                                               Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                        V-21

                                                                          Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                       General Plan/ Public Buildings and Facilities Element
All-weather crossings are critical structures, providing for access into and out of the area in the
event of an emergency. Bear Valley Road at the Mojave River is an all-weather crossing. An all-
weather crossing of the Mojave River is also planned at Yucca Loma Road. These critical
roadway facilities are further discussed in the Circulation Element and the Emergency
Preparedness and Flooding and Hydrology Elements.
Critical Structures
Buildings or facilities that provide important and/or essential emergency services following such
disasters as floods, earthquakes or fires are referred to as “critical structures.” These include fire
stations, hospitals, major roadways and bridges, airports, primary communications facilities,
wells and reservoirs, and other facilities. School facilities and other civic structures may also be
included in this list as essential staging areas for community emergency response and recovery
areas.
To the greatest extent practicable, critical structures should be located where they are least
vulnerable to impacts from such events as earthquakes, flooding, wildfire, or other hazardous
events. They should be located outside and at some distance from 100-year floodplains or fault
zones.
The Town is located in a seismically active region, being in proximity to the Helendale, San
Andreas and other fault zones. Therefore, the Town and other responsible agencies need to
ensure that, to the extent necessary, thorough engineering analyses are conducted prior to site
selection for and construction of critical structures. As discussed in detail in the Geotechnical
Element, design of such buildings should allow for offset of building foundations that may result
from strong groundshaking or surface displacement. Safety issues relating to critical structures
and facilities are also discussed in the Flooding and Hydrology and Emergency Preparedness
Elements.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The Town does not have direct responsibility for the provision of many of the public buildings
and facilities discussed in this and other General Plan Elements. The Town does have substantial
influence, however, and plays an important advisory role in the planning and construction of
these facilities carried out by others. Facilities planning decisions by utilities, educators and
health service providers may have far-reaching consequences for community neighborhoods and
the entire community and planning area.
The Town can assist the agency and company planners of these facilities by providing important
information on growth in development and population, changes in the demographic makeup of
the community, economic projections, Town capital improvements planning and other
information that may affect planning and timing of new facilities. Close and on-going Town
consultation and coordination with other responsible agencies will assure that essential and
otherwise important public facilities will be available to meet current and future needs of the
community.
In order to meet the community’s essential infrastructure and service needs, provision must be
made for continued funding of public services and facilities. The construction and/or expansion
of new infrastructure and service facilities is essential to support the Town’s current residents
and business, and to accommodate future growth. The Department of Public Works, which
regularly reviews the current state of infrastructure, is also tasked with planning for future
facilities and their funding.
The Town routinely prepares and updates a Capital Improvement Program (CIP), which
identifies proposed and existing projects that require governmental funding, such as traffic
signals, street widenings, parks and recreation facilities, public parking lots and municipal
buildings. The use of the five-year Capital Improvements Program planning process can be
expanded to better coordinate this activity with the planning of other agencies. The Finance
Department reviews requests for public services and facilities’ expansion. A variety of funding
sources and mechanisms are used to fund these improvements, including Measure A Tax,
franchise taxes, and developer fees.
The Town must coordinate with a variety of public and quasi-public agencies and organizations
to ensure the provision of adequate, cost-effective and conveniently located facilities. It should
continue to do so at least annually to ensure that utilities mapping is up to date, and to assure that
adequate funding is available through the capital improvement planning process and developer
fees to maintain and expand public services and facilities. New funding sources, including a
possible New Construction tax, should continually be explored and identified.
Education and health care are important components in the community’s quality of life and may
also serve to attract new businesses and residents. The Town should continue to explore the
siting of new healthcare and educational facilities. These may include, but are not limited to, a
possible branch of the San Bernardino County Museum in Apple Valley, as well as a four-year
science and math teaching college/university in conjunction with the Academy for Academic
                                                                               Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                        V-25

                                                               General Plan/ Schools and Libraries Element
SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Schools and Libraries Element discusses the educational and library facilities in the Town of
Apple Valley and its sphere-of-influence. It describes the services, resources and opportunities
that are currently available through local school and library systems. Decision-makers can use
this information to assist them in planning for future needs, and to plan for expansion that will
ensure the provision of adequate and accessible educational facilities to the community. In this
Element, the Town’s role in planning and siting new school and library facilities is discussed,
and goals, policies and programs are set forth to enhance the educational experience of the
Town’s residents.
BACKGROUND
The Schools and Libraries Element is related to several other General Plan elements. Most
directly, it relates to the Land Use Element, which considers the need for adequate and
conveniently located public lands on which to site educational facilities. It relates to the Noise
Element, since schools and libraries are impacted by community noise levels and are considered
sensitive noise receptors. The Town’s planning efforts include protection of schools and libraries
from excessive traffic, which is covered in the Traffic and Circulation Element. Schools and
libraries are defined as public facilities, the identification and location of which is discussed in
the Public Building and Facilities Element.
As established in California Government Code Section 65302(a), the General Plan is required to
assess the general distribution, location and adequacy of educational facilities. State legislation
has been adopted that authorizes school districts to charge development fees to fund the
construction and reconstruction of public school facilities (California Government Code Section
65999(b). Fees are levied on a per square foot basis for residential and commercial development.
Currently (2008), school developer impact fees are $0.47 per square foot for commercial
development, and $3.60 per square foot for residential development.
EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES
Public Schools
Apple Valley Unified School District
Public educational services for kindergarten through 12th grade are provided to the Town of
Apple Valley by the Apple Valley Unified School District (AVUSD). In 2007/2008, there were
an average of 14,725 students enrolled in a total of 18 AVUSD schools. Of these, 9 are

As noted above, the Vanguard Preparatory School is a magnet school that serves students in
kindergarten through 8th grade. Its focus is on academics, communication, and character
building. There is currently a waiting list for enrollment at Vanguard.
The Academy for Academic Excellence (AAE) is an independent charter school focusing on
science and technology, with particular emphasis on aeronautics and the space program. The
Thunderbird Road campus was opened in 1997 as a K-12 school. In 2000, AAE opened its
Mana Road campus for grades 3 through 12. Both schools operate at or near capacity at all times,
with any openings generally occurring in grades 11 and 12. There is currently a waiting list.
Students from the waiting list are selected for enrollment based on a random lottery system.
Redlands University offers college courses using facilities at the Manna Road campus in the
evenings. The Town and the AAE are considering the possibility of locating a four-year
college/university at Manna Road. This is further discussed under Higher Education, below.
Adult Education
Currently (February 2008), there are 39 adults enrolled in GED studies through Adult Education,
which is offered at the Alternative Education Center.
Other District Programs
The District also offers a number of special programs, including Gifted and Talented Education
(GATE), for which students are recommended based on academic achievement or because of a
specific artistic talent. Special education services are available to students who qualify based on
testing and performance at less than grade level.
After-school programs are offered for students in levels Kindergarten through 5th grade. Many
District schools offer Intercession sessions during seasonal school breaks. Intercession provides
students with an opportunity to raise a failing grade or receive individual tutoring in specified
subjects as needed.
Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) is for middle school students whose socio-
economic background or school performance do not presuppose college attendance, but who
have a desire to attend college. In peer tutoring with high school students, they learn to improve
note-taking, study skills, and how to complete college applications.
Peer tutoring occurs on two different levels: volunteer tutoring by middle schoolers to
elementary school students, and compensated tutoring by high schoolers to middle school
students through the AVID program. The District has optimized opportunities for the latter at the
recently-constructed Sitting Bull campus, which incorporates both elementary and middle
schools at one location.
Other special programs include pre-school programs and intra and inter-mural athletics
programs.

Master Planning Process
The District completed its Master Plan update in 2007. It plans for facilities over the course of a
six-year period, though 2012. In general, the District purchases property and plans for new
facilities near areas where the City has approved tract maps.

County Educational Facilities and Programs
The County of San Bernardino currently serves many special needs students through private
placement or by means of staffing provided at public (AVUSD) elementary schools. The County
plans to build three facilities in Apple Valley to consolidate these services, including two early
education centers and one junior high/high school.
An early education center with a capacity of approximately 130 students is planned adjacent to
the Sandia Elementary School. The proposed early education center at this location will also
include a separate facility to provide State-mandated medical-therapy services, such as braces
and casts, for special needs students. The center and medical-therapy unit are expected to be
completed in 2009.
A second early education center is planned near the intersection of Nakash Road and Palmero
Road, in proximity to St. Mary Medical Center. This facility will have capacity to serve
approximately 156 students, with four classrooms dedicated to serving autistic students. It is
expected to be completed in summer 2010.
A third campus will be developed to serve junior high and high school special needs students, on
Powhatan Road west of Pawnee Road. The 6.1-acre campus will provide 12 classrooms and
capacity for approximately 156 students, and is slated for completion approximately summer
2010.
All three campuses are planned primarily for students living within the AVUSD boundaries,
however, the Nakash Road facility is also expected to serve regional needs.

Colleges and Universities
Victor Valley College is a 253-acre community college located south of Apple Valley within the
City of Victorville. Currently (2008) there are approximately 11,000 students enrolled in classes
on campus. The school offers services to student with disabilities, and provides students with a
number of opportunities for academic support. The campus library offers a diverse collection of
books, periodicals, newspapers, videos, CD’s, and microfilm for research opportunities on
campus and provides a comprehensive electronic database for off campus research. As a
community college, Victor Valley offers associate degrees for more than 40 majors and
certificates for vocational and technical classes or programs.
As noted above, Redlands University courses are offered in the evenings at the AAE on Mana
Road. The AAE and Redlands are exploring the potential to develop a four-year college or
university at the campus in the future. While still in the discussion phase, the college is currently
envisioned as a partnership between several colleges and universities in the region and would
focus on providing teacher education and credentialing.
Other Educational Initiatives
The San Bernardino County Museum, located in Redlands, is a regional cultural and natural
history museum with branches at historic sites in Yucaipa, Colton, Chino, Rancho Cucamonga
and Daggett. The Museum houses collections focusing on anthropology, biological and
geological science, and history. It offers special programs and events for families, school
children, and scout troops. The Town is currently (2008) exploring the possibility of offering a
branch of the Museum in Apple Valley. This is further discussed under Future Directions.
LIBRARY FACILITIES
The Town of Apple Valley contains
a 19,142 square foot public library
located off of Dale Evans Parkway
adjacent to Town Hall. The Newton
T. Bass Apple Valley Library is part
of the San Bernardino County
library system. It serves the Town
of Apple Valley by offering a
number of resources, programs, and
community events. Construction
and operation of this facility was
made possible through a joint effort
of local, county, and state funding.
According to the County’s General
Plan, the desirable size for public libraries in the County system is 0.5 to 0.6 square feet per
capita for communities that have between 35,000 and 100,000 persons. To meet this standard in
                                                                              Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                      V-33

                                                                              Terra Nova/Town of Apple Valley
                                                                   General Plan/ Schools and Libraries Element
Apple Valley the library size would need to be at least 35,200 square feet. Library staff work
with the Town and the County of San Bernardino to monitor library usage and to ensure that
resources are available to residents. Presently, there is no indication that the public library
facility within Apple Valley is over utilized or unable to meet the demand generated by residents.
Collection and Resources3
This public library facility offers Apple Valley residents access to over 20,000 hardcopy books
within its collection. In addition, the library provides access to an online database that contains
electronic periodicals, magazines, and encyclopedias. General Internet access is also available on
any of the 23 computers contained within this facility. There are two study rooms available for
library users.
The library provides resources for illiterate and visually impaired residents by offering books on
tape and CD, as well as some large print books.
Community Programs
The library serves as a community facility by offering a diversity of events and programs. The
LITE program is designed for younger children and includes parent/child story time, crafts, and
song circles. The Kids and Crafts program offers a variety of hands on crafts to children between
the ages of 5 and 12. Teen programs are also available and include an anime and scrapbooking
club, and teen chef, which are offered on a weekly and monthly basis. There are also programs
intended for adults including a free adult literacy program, book and poetry clubs, and volunteer
opportunities with the Friend of the Library program.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Future expansion of the Apple Valley Unified School District will need to accommodate growth
in student populations that may be associated with development in the Town and its sphere-of-
influence. Although in the past year the District has experienced a downturn in student
enrollment, it is reasonable to expect that in future economic conditions will again result in
increased development and student population growth. AVUSD, as with all public school
districts, is considered a “responsible agency” and has “lead agency” status for siting, planning
and processing development plans for its own facilities. Most decisions rest with the District,
although consultation with the Town is required. The State Architect’s Office processes and
approves building, planning and design plans. Nonetheless, the Town has a crucial role to play in
assisting and coordinating with AVUSD, and where applicable, with San Bernardino County and
state agencies, to ensure that adequate educational facilities and services are provided, including
those to special needs populations.
The Town should also continue to encourage and support educational initiatives that include
development of a four-year college/university and location of a branch of the San Bernardino
County Museum within the Town.

and the community. As the population in Town increases library resources and facilities may
need to be expanded to meet the growing demand. The County of San Bernardino and the Town
monitor circulation numbers and plan for expansion of services and facilities as needed.

                                                          General Plan/ Police and Fire Protection Element
POLICE AND FIRE PROTECTION ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Police and Fire Protection Element is intended to address the provision of adequate police
and fire protection services by a local government. It identifies the agencies that provide police
and fire protection services, and describes the levels of service those agencies currently provide.
It establishes focused policies and programs that have been developed to ensure the long-term
and adequate public safety for the entire community. This Element is reflective of the Town’s
commitment to provide continuous quality and responsive police and fire protection services.
BACKGROUND
The Police and Fire Protection Element is directly related to a number of General Plan elements,
including Land Use, Traffic and Circulation, Emergency Preparedness, and Water Resources.
Factors that affect the provision of fire and police services include distribution and intensity of
land uses, accessibility and emergency response coordination. These services also depend on the
availability of water to suppress fires, health service to treat the injured, and the provision of
“defensible space” in urban development.
As communities grow, the provision of police and fire protection services are important to
continued safety. The Town of Apple Valley contracts with the County of San Bernardino
Sheriff’s Department for law enforcement services. The Apple Valley Fire Protection District
provides fire protection and maintains cooperative/mutual aid agreements with other
communities and agencies for additional emergency response support. Ambulance and
paramedic services are provided by American Medical Response (AMR).
There are several state regulatory codes directed at the importance of addressing the protection of
the community from natural and man-made hazards, including Government Code Section
65302(g) and Public Resources Code 4125(a). Government Code Section 65302(g) requires that
a Safety Element or its equivalent be included in the General Plan to address measures necessary
to protect the community from risks related to fire and other hazards and threats. Public Resource
Code 4125(a) sets forth a requirement that the State Board of Forestry classify all lands within
the State so as to determine hazards and address financial responsibility for fire prevention and
suppression. Lands that are unclassified fall under the jurisdiction of the Town or if applicable,
appropriate federal agency, such as the Bureau of Land Management or the U.S. Forest Service.
Police Protection
The Town of Apple Valley contracts with the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department for
police services. Sheriff’s Department staff assigned to the Apple Valley Police Department
offers police protection services within the corporate limits of the Town of Apple Valley, which
                                                                             Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                      V-38

                                                                       Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley
                                                          General Plan/ Police and Fire Protection Element
encompasses approximately 72 square miles. The County Sheriff’s Department serves
unincorporated areas in the vicinity of Apple Valley, including the Town’s Sphere of Influence.
The Apple Valley Police Department is located at 14931 Dale Evans Parkway in Apple Valley.
There is also an un-staffed sub-station, used for report writing and other administrative tasks,
which is located at 21989 Outer State Highway 18. The Department desires a ratio of 1 police
officer for every 1,500 residents. The current (2008) level of law enforcement staffing in the
Town is approximately 1.02 sworn officers for every 1,500 residents.
Police Personnel
At present (2008), the Apple Valley Police Department has a total of 48 sworn positions and 13
unsworn positions for a total of 61 personnel. The 48 sworn positions include 1 Captain, 1
Lieutenant, 7 Sergeants, 5 Detective/Corporals, and 34 Patrol Deputies; while the unsworn
positions include 5 Sheriff’s service specialists, 1 secretary, and 7 station clerks. The Apple
Valley Police Department is organized into three main departments: Administration, Traffic
Division, and Detective Bureau.
The Apple Valley Police Department patrol unit is currently organized into three shifts per day,
with each shift lasting 10 hours. The day shift operates from 7 am to 5 pm, the night shift
operates from 3 pm to 1 am, and the graveyard shift is on duty from 10 pm until 8 am. Patrol
teams are deployed with 4 to 5 officers during the day shift, 5 to 6 officers during the night shift,
and approximately 3 officers are on duty for the graveyard shift. In addition, there is a traffic
officer on duty from 5 pm to 3 am each day of the week.
The Apple Valley Police Department fleet inventory consists of 22 patrol cars, 9 unmarked units,
and 4 bicycles. In addition, they operate a mobile trailer, equipped with radar, radios, and other
equipment, that is used daily for enforcing speed limits. In early 2008 the Department anticipates
receiving a new trailer that will be similarly outfitted with all new equipment; this trailer will be
utilized at checkpoints.
Demand for Police Services
In 2007, the Apple Valley Police Department received approximately 72,658 calls for service.
The Police Department officers respond to high priority calls within 3 to 7 minutes, depending
on the time of the day and traffic flow. As the Town’s population continues to increase, law
enforcement response time, calls for police services, and traffic levels are expected to increase.
The demand for Priority 1 police services, which include assaults and burglaries, was 2,431
service calls in 2007. In the same period, the Department received 5,235 Priority 2 calls such as
petty thefts and vandalism. In 2007 the Police Department made 1,978 arrests, and issued 7,105
citations.
Crime Prevention and Public Safety
The Apple Valley Police Department implements a variety of crime prevention and public safety
programs. The department currently deploys personnel in the following public safety programs,
including several community-based policing programs; patrol, detectives, traffic enforcement,
crime free multi housing, and monthly safety checkpoints.
                                                                             Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                      V-39

                                                                          Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley
                                                             General Plan/ Police and Fire Protection Element
Patrol deputies are the primary responders for all police related service calls within the Town of
Apple Valley. It is the responsibility of the Detective Bureau to perform follow-ups and
investigation of reports, arrests, and tips initiated by the uniformed officer. In addition, detectives
conduct crime scene analysis. Traffic law enforcement, traffic collision investigations, and
follow-ups on traffic related crimes are handled by motor officers within the Traffic Enforcement
Division.
The Town participates in the California Police Activities League (Cal-Pal), by offering a number
of programs to the Town’s youth, including those aimed at resolving conflict situations
associated with gangs and school age children within the community as well as within schools.
The SHOCK (self discipline, honor, obedience, consistency and knowledge) program places law
enforcement officers in the educational environment to conduct programs focused on prevention
and intervention. There are two sworn officers assigned to this program. They provide and teach
program curricula such as DARE and GREAT, which are drug and gang awareness programs, to
elementary and middle school children.
For teenagers and adults who are interested in law enforcement the Department offers the
Explorer Program. Candidates must be between 14 and 20 years of age and must pass an oral
interview and a background investigation.
The Apple Valley Police Department has a citizen’s volunteer program called Citizens on Patrol
that provides additional patrol capabilities to the community, and helps in clerical duties
throughout the department. There are approximately 40 volunteers that offer daily assistance to
the Department. Volunteers must be at least 21 years old, are required to complete training
classes, and must comply with the Town’s and Police Department’s guidelines and policies.
Apple Valley Police Department Strategic Plan
The Apple Valley Police Department has drafted a 2008 strategic plan to address the current and
future law enforcement needs of the community. A description of strategies and objectives as
well as methods for implementation are set forth in the strategic plan. Development of the Police
Department Strategic Plan involved the review and input of department employees, the Town
Manager, and Town policy makers, and its drafting is currently underway.
Fire Protection
The Apple Valley Fire Protection District provides fire protection services to the Town of Apple
Valley and the vicinity. It is an independent District whose western boundary is the Mojave
River, and extends east as far as the dry lakes toward Lucerne Valley. It serves the Town and
unincorporated areas of San Bernardino County, with a total service area of over 206 square
miles. District staff includes paid, professional personnel and support staff.
The Fire Protection District maintains a mutual aid agreement with Victorville, San Bernardino
County Fire Department, and the Bureau of Land Management. This agreement allows for fire
departments within the region to actively support one another regardless of geographic or
                                                                                Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                         V-40

                                                                        Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley
                                                           General Plan/ Police and Fire Protection Element
jurisdictional boundaries. A joint dispatch center serving the mutual aid agencies is located in
Victorville.
Fire Department Staffing
There are currently a total of 20 paid-call, five (5) part-time, and 54 career (paid, full-time) staff
in the Fire Protection District, of which 50 are assigned to seven stations within the Apple Valley
District (see below). This level of staffing is currently adequate to meet the District’s desired
ratio of approximately 1 full-time fire personnel per 1,500 persons.
Fire Stations and Equipment
There are seven fire stations in the District. Four are staffed 24-hours per day, seven days per
week, for emergency response. One station is staffed by department staff on a 24-hour basis
approximately four-days per week, and staffed by private ambulance company personnel only
the remainder of the time. One is staffed as needed by on-call firefighters. One station is staffed
with private ambulance company personnel only.
The District’s desired response time is 6 minutes. Within the core area, defined as the Town
corporate limits, the average response time is 6 minutes 25 seconds.
The following are the stations within the District, along with the number of personnel, and type
of equipment at each:
   •   Station No. 331 at 22400 Headquarters Drive has 12 staff, and is equipped with a Type-1
       engine, a Type-2 water tender, and a medium-level rescue vehicle.
   •   Station No. 332 at 18857 Highway 18 has 9 staff. Equipment includes a Type-1 engine
       and a Type-3 engine.

   •   Station No. 335 at 21860 Tussing Ranch Road is staffed by paid-call staff only. This
       means that staff members are alerted via pager to calls within the response area. The
       station is equipped with a Type-1 engine and a Type-3 water tender.
   •   Station No. 336 at 19235 Yucca Loma Road has 6 career and 10 paid-call staff, and is

       been expanded, as of April 2008, from 2 to 4 staff members. The station is equipped with
       a Type-4 Medic Patrol, a Hazmat Trailer, and a Reserve Squad.
The Town is considering the construction of an eighth fire station on approximately 12 acres at
the northeast corner of Johnson Road and Navajo Road. The property has been donated by the
Wal-Mart Corporation, which owns the Wal-Mart Distribution Center in North Apple Valley.
The new station, if developed, is expected to house fire training classes, which would be
relocated from Victor Valley College.
                                                                              Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                       V-41

                                                                       Terra Nova/ Town of Apple Valley

In addition to firefighting staff, the Apple Valley Fire Marshal provides project review services
for all new development.
District Rating
The Insurance Service Office (ISO) provides rating and statistical information for the insurance
industry in the United States. The ISO does this by evaluating a community’s fire protection
needs and services, and assigns each community evaluated a Public Protection Classification
(PPC) rating. The PPC rating , which is developed as a cumulative point system, is based on the
community’s fire-suppression delivery system, including fire dispatch (operators, alarm dispatch
circuits, telephone lines available), fire department (equipment available, personnel, training,
distribution of companies, etc.), and water supply (adequacy, condition, number and installation
of fire hydrants). Insurance rates are based upon this rating, which ranges from Class 1 (best) to
Class 10 (worst). The District is currently (2008) rated “Class 4.”
Other Fire Protection District Services
The District is involved in a number of community outreach and educational programs.
Firefighters read to AVUSD students in schools on a weekly basis in the On Fire for Literacy
program. The Risk Watch program focuses on fire/burn prevention, bike safety and water safety.
The District also uses the Schools Acquiring Fire Safety Education and Readiness (SAFER)
program to inform and raise fire safety awareness among school children.
Emergency Medical Services
American Medical Response (AMR), a private company, currently provides emergency medical
services, including ambulance services, via a contract with the County of San Bernardino. Their
services and vehicles are regional, and ambulances are dispatched as needed via the Desert
Communications dispatch center in Victorville. AMR offers Advance Life Support ambulances,
staffed with a paramedic and an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), Basic Life Support
ambulances, staffed with two EMTs, and Critical Care Units, staffed with a paramedic, an EMT,
and a Registered Nurse. AMR’s contract with San Bernardino County establishes a response
time of 9 minutes 59 seconds or less to all calls, with longer allowable response times to some
rural areas. AMR meets or exceeds this response time an average of 92 percent of the time, based
on monthly averages.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The Town’s continued growth is the primary factor in determining additional demand for police
and fire protection service. The exact timing and location of additional police and fire facilities
necessary to provide adequate safety related services are dependent upon the type, location and
intensity of future development. While these may be difficult to determine, the Town will
continue to monitor growth patterns and to use that information to respond to additional demand
for public safety facilities and services.
There are several issues that will continue to require focused attention, including those involving
land use and circulation patterns, financing of future police and fire stations, the provision of
water for sufficient fire flows, and the adequacy of emergency response times.

                                                             General Plan/Emergency Preparedness Element
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Emergency Preparedness Element describes existing plans and facilities that are in place to
deal with natural and man-made disasters that could affect the Town of Apple Valley and its
Sphere of Influence. It discusses the potential for such emergencies. Further, it considers any
additional critical facilities and services that are necessary for the Town to respond quickly and
efficiently to protect its citizens from injury and loss. Currently, the Town has in place systems
and approaches to minimize damage, loss of life and impacts to financial resources during and
following an emergency, which are also discussed herein. This Element discusses the Town’s
relationship to and coordination with County, State and Federal agencies with regard to
emergency response. It establishes goals, policies and programs that shape the Town’s priorities
and future directions that are intended to support and maintain adequate readiness for emergency
situations.
BACKGROUND
This Element is part of an overall consideration of general environmental hazards. Its inclusion
complies with Government Code Section 65302(g), which requires that the following be
addressed in General Plans: hazards such as seismic disturbances and their effects, “other
geologic hazards . . . flooding; and wildland and urban fires.” Other General Plan Elements to
which this Element is directly related include the Geotechnical, Flooding and Hydrology
Elements, which provide information regarding natural constraints and hazards that emergency
planning needs to address. It is also related to the Land Use Element, which addresses planning
issues associated with making critical facilities accessible, and provides for their protection from
location-specific hazards, as well as the Hazardous and Toxic Materials Element, which
describes potential man-made hazards, the mismanagement of which can result in the need for
emergency response. It relates to the Water, Sewer and Utilities Element, which describes
existing utilities infrastructure and defines the Town’s hazard planning associated with these
services. It also relates to the Police and Fire Protection Element, which discusses public safety
protection, rescue operations and emergency transportation during disasters.
The Town is located approximately 25 miles north-northeast of the Mojave Desert segment of
the San Andreas fault. The Helendale fault is located approximately eight miles east of Apple
Valley. The proximity to these faults makes the Specific Plan area susceptible to seismically
induced hazards, including strong groundshaking. The Town may also be vulnerable to man-
made emergencies such as major accidents involving trains and motor vehicles, especially given
its proximity to Interstate-15, which runs southwest to northeast through the region forming the
Town’s western boundary, and Highway 18, which bisects the Town in a generally northwest
trending direction. The Town is also located in proximity to the Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe
Railroad.
                                                                             Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                     V-46

                                                                                  Town of Apple Valley
                                                           General Plan/Emergency Preparedness Element
Aircraft accidents and power outages could also occur. In addition, terrorism and school and
workplace violence have the potential to result in incidents that may necessitate that action and
response plans be in place to deal with such scenarios.
Mandated Emergency Management Systems
The following discusses mandated emergency management systems. State programs have been
in place for over a decade and are discussed first. Federal requirements enacted in 2004, with
implementation and compliance dates that began in 2005, are also considered. This section also
describes the Town’s emergency plans and systems.
Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS)
Senate Bill 1841, California Government Code Section 8607 was made effective January 1, 1993
(Petris Bill). It describes the statewide Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS) in
legislation related to “responding to and managing emergencies and disasters involving multiple
jurisdictions or multiple agency responses…” (Section 8607(a)). In order to be SEMS-compliant,
all jurisdictions within the State of California are required to use standardized equipment and
language to ensure the effective utilization of assistance offered across jurisdictional boundaries.
Local jurisdictions are also required to adopt SEMS to be eligible to recover costs associated
with State-level emergency responses. Individual Town agencies and personnel take on their
responsibilities as defined by the Town’s Emergency Plan.
Under SEMS, the Incident Command System (ICS) is used to coordinate field-level activities.
ICS, which can be adapted to any scope of emergency, also quantifies the specific actions,
personnel, equipment and facilities needed to respond adequately and in a systematic fashion to a
particular hazard. The ICS organizes response based on five principal activities that must be
performed at any incident: Management, Operations, Logistics, Plans and Finance.
Federal Emergency Management Requirements
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security approved of the National Incident Response
Management System (NIMS) in March 2004. NIMS is intended to standardize response to
terrorist attacks, natural disasters and other emergencies across federal, State, local and tribal
governmental lines. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is charged with
implementing the NIMS program and ensuring compliance by State, local and tribal
jurisdictions. NIMS, like SEMS, is based around the Incident Command System and associated
functional areas. To standardize public communication during an incident it also employs a Joint
Information System (JIS), and provides for system implementation through a National Response
Plan. State and local governments were required to demonstrate compliance with NIMS
beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 2005 in order to be eligible for Federal preparedness assistance.
New compliance activities are set forth each year, and jurisdictions must continue to demonstrate
compliance, gauged by performance-based measurement systems, or metrics, to receive annual
emergency preparedness grants. Required changes to State and local government emergency
plans in California are expected to be relatively minimal since SEMS and NIMS share a common
basis in ICS.
                                                                           Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                   V-47

                                                                                    Town of Apple Valley
                                                            General Plan/Emergency Preparedness Element
The Town of Apple Valley has completed the emergency training level of NIMS compliance.
Based on 2007 NIMS compliance metrics for local jurisdictions, the Town scored 100 percent
compliance for Tier 1 compliance (items critical for NIMS implementation) and 88 percent
compliance for Tier 2 compliance (items required to measure ongoing progress of NIMS
implementation activities).
State governments were required to submit pre-disaster mitigation assessments for all local
jurisdictions to the federal government by November, 2004. California’s State Multi-Hazard
Mitigation Plan incorporated assessments provided by each jurisdiction. Apple Valley submitted
its assessment to San Bernardino County for submittal to the State; the State Plan was adopted in
March 2005. These pre-disaster mitigation assessments are also linked to federal financial
emergency assistance.
Apple Valley Emergency Plans
Town of Apple Valley
The Town adopted its emergency plan, the Multi-Hazard Functional Planning Guidance (Multi-
Hazard Plan) document, in 2003. The Multi-Hazard Plan addresses the Town’s planned response
to extraordinary emergency situations associated with natural disasters and emergencies,
including but not limited to wildland fire, earthquake, and flooding. The Plan also includes
contingencies to deal with incidents involving hazardous and toxic materials, domestic violence,
terrorism, and other threats to public health and safety directly resulting from human activity.
The Plan’s operations concepts focus on coping with potential large-scale disasters that pose
major threats to life and property and can impact the well-being of large numbers of people. The
Multi-Hazard Functional Planning Guidance document includes twelve functional Annexes.
These cover operational areas of management, fire and rescue, law enforcement and traffic
control, medical, public health, coroner, care and shelter, movement, rescue, construction and
engineering, resources and support, and radiological protection. The multi-hazard functional plan
with accompanying annex documents has been the standard used throughout the State. The Plan
is designed to include the Town as part of SEMS, and is being updated to comply with federal
NIMS requirements by the 2008 mandated deadline.
Emergency response and chain of command are further described below.
Apple Valley Unified School District
The Apple Valley Unified School District (AVUSD) has developed its own Emergency
Operations Procedure document that sets forth responses to natural and manmade emergencies,
establishes communication links and provides for the establishment of shelters. Each District
school also has a site-specific emergency plan listing assigning emergency operations
responsibility to specific staff members. School sites are designated shelters, which when
activated are operated and managed by the American Red Cross under the direction of the Town
and Fire Protection District.
                                                                             Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                     V-48

                                                                                   Town of Apple Valley
                                                            General Plan/Emergency Preparedness Element
St. Mary Medical Center
St. Mary Medical Center, located at 18300 Highway 18, Apple Valley, has developed emergency
plans for all critical hospital systems. The plans are based on standards set by the Joint
Commission on Hospital Accreditation (JCHA), the independent organization through which St.
Mary is accredited. Additional information on St. Mary’s emergency supplies and systems is
provided under Emergency and Other Medical Facilities and Supplies, below.
Hazardous Materials Planning
The Town of Apple Valley is a member of the Southern California Hazardous Waste
Management Authority, which is a joint powers authority between member counties of the
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG). SCAG is drafting a Regional
Comprehensive Plan (RCP) to address resource management; it will also discuss the current
solid and hazardous waste management planning process in Southern California. The draft RCP
will also consider potential strategies and actions for improving the SCAG region's solid and
hazardous waste management system. It is currently (2008) in the environmental review stage.
The Town works with the San Bernardino County Fire Department Hazardous Materials
Division (HMD). The HMD is State-designated as the Certified Unified Program Agency for
handling hazardous waste and materials in this area. Via annual compliance inspections, local
businesses that handled hazardous materials at their facilities must certify such materials through
the County HMD. California Code of Regulations (Title 22) defines hazardous materials are
substances that are toxic, ignitable, flammable, reactive, or corrosive. In the event of a hazardous
materials spill or leak, the Apple Valley Fire District Duty Chief acts as liaison with HMD.
Critical Facilities
Critical facilities are those that provide emergency or other services, or shelter, for those in
danger, and are therefore an integral part of any emergency plan. Such facilities may include
hospitals, police and fire departments, governmental operations, communications centers,
evacuation and emergency shelters, and utility installations and systems. Support facilities
provide an important function in that they bolster primary critical facilities by providing
information and direction to the public during a crisis. Support facilities may include fire and
police communications, auxiliary personnel and commercial radio stations.
Other critical facilities include access, such as evacuation routes and transport of the injured,
peak-load water supply and delivery, and airport services. An emergency plan must consider
transportation system constraints, as these may hinder ground-based access or delivery of
supplies or emergency services to the affected areas.
The Town’s Disaster Council meets quarterly to coordinate emergency planning and initiatives.
The Council is comprised of representatives of the five entities that form the core of the Town’s
Emergency Operations Center network: the Town, Fire District, Police Department, AVUSD,
and St. Mary Medical Center. Representatives of other agencies and organizations are invited to
attend, including the County and Apple Valley Airport Authority, and local businesses and non-
profit agencies. The Town Emergency Services Manager also sits on several County committees
as part of the Town and Fire Protection District’s regional SEMS coordination.
                                                                            Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                    V-49

                                                                                     Town of Apple Valley
                                                             General Plan/Emergency Preparedness Element
Communications
The Town of Apple Valley and the County of San Bernardino, as well as critical facilities such
as St. Mary Medical Center, utilize a range of equipment and are linked to a variety of
communication systems to ensure adequate communication and coordination in the event of an
emergency. The following is an overview of these systems.
Town of Apple Valley Communications
In addition to land and cellular telephones, the Town has a short-wave radio system that can
contact units located at Fire District stations, Police department, AVUSD school sites, and St.
Mary Medical Center. The Town has one satellite telephone and expects to obtain two additional
units within the next few months.
The Town also participates in the County-wide Emergency Communications (ECS) unit,
(formerly known as Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Services, or RACES) which provides
emergency communications support operated by volunteer radio operators. ECS volunteers are
trained by the County Office of Emergency Services staff. Radio operators work from activated
Emergency Operations Centers (EOC) and at key locations, including hospitals, to provide
emergency operations and other critical facilities’ staff with an alternative communications link.
Apple Valley is part of San Bernardino County’s Telephone Emergency Notification System
(TENS), which functions as a reverse 911 system and serves to notify Town residents in the
event of an emergency with potential to affect them. While the County TENS system is useful in
providing basic information on an existing condition, messages relayed by the County’s system
are somewhat limited in nature, and may not offer sufficient information to assist residents in
determining an appropriate course of action. This issue is further discussed under Future
Directions.
The Apple Valley Fire District participates with the City of Victorville in a Regional Fire
Protection Authority established between the two jurisdictions in the early 1980s. In the event of
an emergency, communication between Apple Valley and Victorville is handled by a 24-hour/7-
day a week central fire dispatch center located at Desert Communications, 17199 Jasmine Street
in Victorville. This center uses an 800-radio system during normal daily operations as well as in
the event of a disaster. Desert Communications also has a mobile unit for off-site use. Second-
tier provision for communication with Victorville Fire Department is via the Town’s ECS unit.
Hospitals within San Bernardino County, including but not limited to St. Mary Medical Center in
Apple Valley, Victor Valley Community Hospital and Desert Valley Hospital, both in
Victorville, are linked to the County EOC by means of the Ready Net communications system.
The system is computer-based and relies on the county’s microwave communications links,
which provide greater reliability than telephone lines. Ready Net provides a daily “snapshot” of
the facilities at each hospital, as well as of staffing and patient-load status. In an emergency, this
system provides updated information regarding availability and need so that patient traffic can be
routed appropriately, and emergency supplies and services can be directed where needed.
                                                                              Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                      V-50

                                                                                  Town of Apple Valley
                                                           General Plan/Emergency Preparedness Element
San Bernardino County Communications
San Bernardino County is linked to a variety of federal and state warning and communications
systems, including the Emergency Alert System (EAS), National Warning System (NAWAS),
National Weather Service (NWS), and California Warning System (CALWAS). Within its
operation area, the County uses local and regional warning systems, including the Caltech/USGS
Broadcast of Earthquakes (CUBE) system, and facilities and technology associated with the FCC
Local Area.
CUBE collects data regarding earthquake data time, location and magnitude that is gathered at
the Caltech Seismological Laboratory in Pasadena. The information is transmitted via a
commercial paging system and broadcast to public and private sector subscribers, which include
government, public utilities, and public broadcast stations. The information allows public
emergency response agencies access to information about earthquake location and magnitude,
estimates of distribution of groundshaking following the earthquake, and warnings regarding
imminent groundshaking immediately following the event.
The FCC Local Area is a network of broadcasters and cable television companies that are located
within and/or that serve Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. There are five zones covering
the two counties. County OES Emergency Services Officers call in the Emergency Alert System
message, which is transmitted directly to the primary radio stations to be broadcast. The FCC
Local Area includes stations in San Bernardino, Victorville, Yucca Valley and Big Bear Lake,
including at least one Spanish-language station. It also has the ability to access a 900-megahertz
paging and an automated telephone system, which provide for automated contact to key response
or public safety personnel. Further, the Responders Organized for Potential Emergencies (ROPE)
program is used to notify and coordinate with public safety agencies or private resources on
highway corridors in the Cajon Pass and High Desert. The FCC Local Area systems are available
in most areas, however, terrain and distance preclude adequate coverage in some areas.
Community Training and Resources
The Town conducts an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) drill and/or training at least once a
year. A functional drill was held in July 2007. EOC staff participated in a refresher “SEMS
EOC” course in February 2008. The Town will participate in a statewide full-scale exercise in
November 2008. This day-long event will activate the EOC and include field exercises involving
the police and fire departments, hospitals, schools and volunteers. The Fire District conducts
training and exercises throughout the year, including a “bump and run” field drill held in June
2007, which involved several high desert fire agencies and a volunteer activation.
California Citizen’s Corps is a state program that is intended to strengthen the state’s emergency
preparedness by recruiting and training volunteers at the neighborhood level. The program
includes Citizen Corps Councils, Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT), Medical
Reserve Corps, Neighborhood Watch, Volunteers in Police Service and Fire Corps.
The Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT) program trains private citizens in basic
search and rescue, fire suppression, first aid and utilities management. Town and Fire District
staff provide CERT training throughout the community. Through public education, such as
presentations at neighborhood watch meetings, CERT educators seek to raise awareness and
                                                                           Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                   V-51

                                                                                   Town of Apple Valley
                                                            General Plan/Emergency Preparedness Element
encourage emergency preparedness, especially in mobile home and other communities that may
include centralized gathering places and means of resident contact. The goal is to enable these
neighborhoods to be self-sufficient for a period of time following an emergency, thereby
providing for their residents and reducing demands on emergency shelters in the larger
community.
The Town is home to numerous mobile home parks and one age-restricted, gated community,
Jess Ranch. The Jess Ranch community has formed a program called “Jess Ranch Heart” in
order to plan for emergency conditions. The community has a limited stockpile of food, water
and emergency medical supplies and equipment, including wheelchairs. They have developed a
“red flag” notification system, whereby following an earthquake, residents who are safe place a
red flag in their yard. The absence of a red flag following such an event alerts designated
neighborhood captains to attempt contact with the resident.
The Friends of Animals During a Disaster (FADD) is a local volunteer group with approximately
200 members who work to ensure the safety of domestic pets in an emergency situation.
Shelters and Supplies
Shelters must be available to handle large numbers of people and to provide basic services such
as food, potable water and medical supplies. In the event of an emergency involving the Town,
shelters would be operated and administered by the American Red Cross at the direction of the
Town. There are 26 shelter locations in Apple Valley, including public schools, several private
schools and churches, the Senior Citizens Club, and the Lone Wolf Colony campground.
Shelters have a capacity of between approximately 40 to 300 people, depending on the location.
Several have stockpiles of water, and some have generators.
The Fire District has a limited stockpile of food, water and emergency supplies, stored at each
fire station, which is designated for use by its personnel. The Town does not currently have such
a stockpile for the general public, and additional storage facilities would be needed to
accommodate such a supply.
Emergency Accessibility, Transportation and Circulation
Immediate access to impacted areas by emergency personnel and supplies is essential after a
disaster. U.S. Interstate-15 and State Highway 18 are major regional access routes serving the
Town. Bridges and underpasses are critical roadway components for delivery of food, water and
medical supplies and personnel, as well as for the evacuation of the injured.
Highway 18 (Happy Trails Highway) enters the Town at its eastern border, running east to
Navajo Road, and then traverses the Town in a generally southeast to northwest direction. Other
major north-south arterial roadways in the Town include Apple Valley Road, Dale Evans
Parkway (Boulder/Bell Mountain Road), Aztec Road, Central Road, Joshua Road, and Stoddard
Wells Road. East-west arterial roadways include Bear Valley Road, Yucca Loma Road, Corwin
Road, and Waalew Road.
                                                                            Public Services and Facilities

                                                                                    Town of Apple Valley
                                                             General Plan/Emergency Preparedness Element
Freeway underpasses and railroad crossings are generally protected from flooding by existing
flood control structures. There is one railroad crossing in the Town, a spur that runs along the
north side of Quarry Road and serves only the Mojave Northern Mining quarry located to the
east. In the event of major flood events, access to the U.S. Interstate-15 freeway, which links
Apple Valley with other cities and communities in the region, may become flooded or damaged.
Several roadways, including Interstate-15, State Highway 18, Bear Valley Road and Rock
Springs Road cross the Mojave River at the Town’s western boundary. An additional crossing,
the Yucca Loma Bridge at Yucca Loma Road, is under design by the Town, and is scheduled for
construction in the near term.
Rock Springs Road is an at-grade roadway that is not passable during moderate to heavy rainfall.
A portion of this roadway is slated for realignment. Funding for these improvements is through
Proposition 1.B through (Highway Safety, Traffic Reduction, Air Quality and Port Security
Bond Act of 2006). The planned improvements do not address the river crossing.
All bridges on U.S. Interstate-15 in the planning area are designed to withstand the 100-year
flood and to have 2 feet of freeboard for the 50-year flood.
In the event of a major disaster, including major earthquakes or floods, urban wildfires, major
truck or rail accidents, or by other natural or man-made disasters, critical roadways and
components could be damaged or blocked. The loss of freeway bridges over interchanges or road
closures due to rockfalls or landslides would also impede the delivery of emergency services and
supplies.
Evacuation plans must of necessity be regional in nature. Advance planning between
communities within a region must include established communications systems with sufficient
back up facilities, evacuation routes, and sufficient provision of food, water, shelter and medical
attention, as well as other essential services to meet the needs of evacuees.
The Town has established evacuation routes, including:
    •    Central Road (N-S)
    •    State Highway 18 (E-W, N-S)
    •    Bear Valley Road (E-W)
The County is currently (January 2008) developing mass evacuation plans within each region.
The high desert region plan has not yet been completed. Town emergency services staff
participates on the County evacuation/transportation committee and will attend Caltrans training
in March. However, currently (January 2008) there is no comprehensive mass evacuation plan in
place for the Town or the region.
The Town shall continue to coordinate with Caltrans, the Federal Highway Administration,
adjoining cities and communities and San Bernardino County to provide the highest functional
reliability of major roadways and the public transportation system serving the Town and the
region. The Town shall also continue to coordinate with San Bernardino County Flood Control
and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to address flooding hazards that
                                                                             Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                     V-53

                                                                                   Town of Apple Valley
                                                            General Plan/Emergency Preparedness Element
threaten people and property, and that may isolate portions of the community. Programs that can
identify and address weak links in the circulation system, in coordination with the efforts of the
County and other jurisdictions in the high desert region, should be developed. The County’s
mass evacuation planning effort, in conjunction with its evacuation and transportation
committee, may assist in this capacity. This issue is further discussed under Future Directions.
The Apple Valley Municipal Airport is located within the Town’s corporate limits. It is classified
as a General Aviation airport and is capable of accommodating most private single-engine and
corporate jet aircraft, as well as helicopters. There is no public helipad on the property, however
California Highway Patrol and the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department share a hangar.
The Osborne Airstrip is a private airstrip located at 18173 Osborne Road, east of U.S.-Interstate
15 in Victorville. The airstrip is for personal use by the landowners, and to a limited extent, to
invited guests. There is one paved runway parallel to U.S.-Interstate 15, an owner/operator
hangar, two tie-downs for guests. The airport is equipped to serve small, non-commercial fixed
wing aircraft.
The Town is located approximately 51 miles from the San Bernardino International Airport,
which currently (January 2008) offers general aviation and corporate services, and approximately
52 miles from the Ontario International Airport, which has general aviation, corporate and
commercial flights. Both airports are accessible by means of helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft.
Emergency and Other Medical Facilities and Supplies
Emergency medical services are provided by American Medical Response, AMR, which has
Advance Life Support ambulances staffed with paramedics and an Emergency Medical
Technician (EMT), Basic Life Support ambulances staffed with two EMTs, and Critical Care
Units, staffed with a paramedic, EMT and a Registered Nurse (RN). AMR also has supervisory
staff with ICS training who are able to respond to any disaster. AMR is dispatched through the
Desert Communications 911 dispatch center, which has the ability to link to County dispatch
centers in the event of a fire or medical emergency. The Inland Counties Emergency Medical
Agency (ICEMA) is authorized to activate AMR ambulance strike teams in the event of an
emergency. The ICEMA is a Joint Powers agency for the management of emergency medical
services in Inyo, Mono and San Bernardino counties.
AMR coordinates closely with Mercy Air, which has airlift capabilities. Mercy Air bases a
helicopter at SOCAL Logistics Airport, located at Victorville Fire Station 319, and a second
helicopter at the Hesperia Airport. Mercy Air has helicopters based in several communities in the
high desert and outside the region, which are available to respond to an emergency within Apple
Valley. The closest are based in Victorville and Hesperia. As noted below, St. Mary Medical
Center has two helipads.
Patients are either transported via emergency ground transportation to the airport for airlift, or
AMR coordinates with the fire captain on the scene, who requests dispatch of airlift through the
Desert Communications and whose staff establishes a safe landing zone. The San Bernardino
Sheriff’s Department has secondary responsibility for airlift via its rescue helicopter. The
                                                                            Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                    V-54

                                                                                     Town of Apple Valley
                                                              General Plan/Emergency Preparedness Element
Sheriff’s Department may be called in to supplement Mercy Air services when multiple patients
must be transported, or when transport is needed from remote and rugged terrain.
There are several medical facilities that may provide medical services and personnel in the event
of an emergency affecting Apple Valley or the region. These include St. Mary Hospital in Apple
Valley, and Victor Valley Community Hospital and Desert Valley Hospital in Victorville.
Trauma victims are airlifted to Loma Linda Medical Center in Loma Linda. As has been noted,
all hospitals in San Bernardino County are linked to the County EOC via the Ready Net system,
described in the Critical Facilities section of this element.
St. Mary Medical Center
St. Mary Medical Center is located at 18300 Highway 18 in Apple Valley. The hospital is
located on a 90-acre campus with approximately 215,000 square feet of facilities. Licensed for
186 beds, it provides general medical-surgical care, intensive care, 24-hour emergency care,
obstetrics, in and outpatient surgery, and a range of ambulatory services including physical
therapy and cardiac rehabilitation. St. Mary has the only full-service cardiovascular surgery
program and the only Level II Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in the high desert area. There are
currently (2008) two helipads on-site.
As required by the Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation, St. Mary is currently equipped
to remain self-sustaining for 72 hours following an emergency. This means that the hospital has
72 hours (approximately 3 to 4 days) worth of food, water, and fuel to meet the needs of an at-
capacity patient load and staff. The hospital is evaluating ways to meet new Commission
standards, effective January 2008, to be self-sustaining for up to 96 hours.
All major operating systems, including electrical, HV/AC, and communications systems have
back-up systems. The hospital has two large-scale electrical generators to ensure uninterrupted
supply at 100 percent of capacity for critical areas, such as intensive and cardiac care and
surgical units, and between 85 and 95 percent of capacity for all other areas.
St. Mary has plans to acquire triage tent that would accommodate up to 20 percent above-
capacity patient demand in an emergency. This tent will be equipped with heating and air
conditioning units for use as needed.
Due to emerging concerns over chemical and bio-terrorism and in compliance with state hospital
commission mandates for accredited hospitals, the Center has a decontamination tent with a hot
water generator, and a dedicated decontamination team in the event of a hazardous materials
release incident. There are decontamination showers for gurneys and wheelchairs located
outside the emergency room.
The hospital has a small inventory of medical supply caches for off-site use as necessary. As part
of the St. Joseph Hospital health system, St. Mary has access to additional equipment from other
facilities.
Hospital representatives sit on the Town of Apple Valley Emergency Operations Committee.
The hospital interfaces directly with the County Health Department and is linked to the County’s
                                                                              Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                      V-55

                                                                                   Town of Apple Valley
                                                            General Plan/Emergency Preparedness Element
Ready-Net computer system for on-going communication, as needed, with the County
Emergency Operations Center (EOC), the Town’s EOC, and other hospitals in the region. In the
event of an emergency, at least one hospital representative would join emergency operations
personnel at the Town EOC to serve as liaison with the hospital in coordinating emergency
activities.
St. Mary has acquired lands in Victorville for a second hospital campus, and expects to begin
construction within the next two to three years. Currently St. Mary is considered a Level III
(lowest level) trauma care. With the construction of the new facility, St. Mary hopes to be able
to provide Level I trauma.
Other Medical Facilities in the Region
The aforementioned Victor Valley Community Hospital is located approximately 5 miles to the
west, and Desert Valley Hospital is located approximately 10 miles to the southwest of Apple
Valley. Victor Valley Community Hospital, to the west, is licensed for 115 beds. The facility
includes 24-hour/7-day a week emergency services and an on-site heliport. DVMC, to the south,
is licensed for 83 beds. Both centers include acute care hospitals.
More severe injuries requiring Level I care would be transported to the Loma Linda Medical
Center, approximately 51 miles from Apple Valley. Loma Linda has 900 beds and is the only
Level I trauma center for Inyo, Mono, San Bernardino, and Riverside counties.
The County of San Bernardino has established grant-purchased medical equipment and supply
caches at various locations, including at least one in the high desert.
Emergency Operations Centers (EOC)
The Town’s Emergency Operations Center is located at the Lewis Center/Mojave River Campus,
17500 Mana Road in Apple Valley. The Alternate EOC is located at Apple Valley Fire Station
#336, 19235 Yucca Loma Road in Apple Valley.
The County’s Primary EOC (PEOC) is located at 1743 Miro Way in Rialto. There are two
Alternate EOC (AEOC) locations. The first priority AEOC is located at the County Fire Training
Center at the San Bernardino International Airport. The second is at County Public Works
Department Operations, at 825 Third Street in San Bernardino. The County may also dispatch
its mobile EOC as needed. The County is also considering siting an AEOC in the high desert
region, however, a location has not been determined. The County EOC is activated either upon
the request of an affected jurisdiction, or when two or more jurisdictions within the County have
activated their EOCs.
Emergency Response, Organizational Structure and Chain of Command
In general, the Town’s response to a disaster will be dictated by the type and magnitude of the
emergency, with progression from local to regional, to state, to federal involvement. The Town
may provide overall emergency management, and activate the Emergency Operations Center, in
three different modes:
                                                                            Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                    V-56

                                                                                    Town of Apple Valley
                                                             General Plan/Emergency Preparedness Element
    1)    Monitoring an incident that has potential to grow and affect residents. Although the
          EOC is activated, emergency services staff, including fire and police, may monitor
          from off-site locations. The public may or may not be informed at this level;
    2)    Determining that the incident is affecting residents. This level activates shelters, and
          may require road closures or other actions as deemed necessary to protect public health
          and safety. EOC staffing is maintained at a level determined to be appropriate in the
          particular situation, but generally less than a 24-hour basis.
    3)    Responding to a major incident, requiring 24-hour EOC operation.
The EOC may be activated by the appropriate agency head: Fire Chief, Sheriff’s Captain
assigned to Apple Valley Police Department, or Town Manager. In the event of a school or
hospital-related emergency, the appropriate AVUSD or St. Mary personnel would coordinate
with the appropriate Town authority for activation and aid, if necessary.
When conditions warrant activation of the Town’s EOC, the Town Manager assumes the role of
Incident Commander, and activates the other four ICS functions (Operations, Logistics, Plans
and Finance) with their respective areas of responsibility. If the Town Manager is unable to fill
or continue the duties of Incident Commander, an Assistant Town Manager assumes those
duties.
In accordance with Section 8605 of the Emergency Services Act, each county is designated as an
Operational Area, which are activated under certain conditions. These conditions may include a
situation that requires cooperative efforts on the part of two or more cities within the County, or
when emergency conditions extend across county lines. The county-designated Operational Area
Coordinator would be responsible for managing emergency operations within incorporated
jurisdictions in the County. In unincorporated areas, the County Emergency Corps Commander
would assume responsibility.
The state is divided into six Office of Emergency Services (OES) Mutual Aid Regions. The State
OES Director coordinates among the six regions. San Bernardino County is part of Region 6 for
fire and law enforcement mutual aid. Region 6 also includes the counties of San Diego, Imperial,
Riverside, Inyo and Mono. Designated state agency representatives who comprise the Regional
Emergency Management staff coordinate and support local emergency operations as requested
by the Operational Area Coordinator.
Upon the declaration of a Local Emergency, and once the Town’s EOC and the County’s PEOC
or AEOC have been activated, the State OES is advised. Should the Governor declare a State of
Emergency in the impacted areas, the State OES Director, the County’s Operational Area
Coordinator and Emergency Corps Commander, and the Town’s Director of Emergency Services
coordinate the necessary activities. The Governor is responsible for requesting a Presidential
declaration of an Emergency or Major Disaster, and would thereupon appoint a State
Coordinating Officer to coordinate with the Federal Coordinating Officer to support local
operations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is the main federal
government contact during emergencies.
                                                                             Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                     V-57

                                                                                  Town of Apple Valley
                                                           General Plan/Emergency Preparedness Element
Extended Emergency Response, Organizational Structure and Assistance
The Town’s immediate response to an emergency is crucial to minimizing loss of life and
property. Conditions that result from a disaster can, in the aftermath, threaten health and safety
as significantly as the initial event. The Town may expend substantial financial resources during
the emergency, and must keep careful records and follow appropriate reporting procedures to
ensure recovery of those resources from appropriate state and federal agencies.
Once the immediate crisis has passed, the Town assesses the damage, and seeks to contain
hazards posed by damaged infrastructure. Basic services must also be restored. Continued
safety and rescue functions, and the restoration of order, are the responsibility of Fire and Police
personnel. Department of Public Works staff provide necessary equipment. Working through the
Federal and State Coordinating Officers (SCOs), and County, Town representatives execute state
and federal assistance programs and begin the recovery process. These agencies would
coordinate to establish Disaster Assistance Centers (DAC’s) where individuals can apply for and
access on-going emergency and recovery services and provisions in one location. DAC
personnel would process subsistence monies, loan applications, insurance claims and other
necessities for emergency victims.
The post-emergency recovery period would begin as early as feasible. During this period, the
State OES Director, through the designated SCO, would coordinate the efforts of appropriate
federal, state, local, and Red Cross officials to implement state and federal assistance programs
and establish support priorities. There are several major objectives of the recovery period. These
are reinstatement of family autonomy, provision of essential public services, permanent
restoration of private and public property; reinstatement of public services; and research to
uncover residual hazards, advance knowledge of disaster phenomena, and improvement of future
emergency operations.
Once the major field tasks associated with emergency assistance and restoration of public safety
and basic services has been accomplished, the Town’s EOC is deactivated. However, post-
emergency tasks, such as record keeping and receipt submittal, are still necessary and would be
completed as quickly as possible following de-activation of the EOC.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The Town has a comprehensive emergency plan in place. The emergency plan will continue to
be upgraded over the near term to ensure compliance with new federal requirements. Plans and
systems must be maintained and upgraded as needed to keep pace with population growth, new
construction, business development, and growth-induced circulation issues.
Compliance with relatively new federal regulations associated with the NIMS system is likely to
continue to evolve over the next several years, as federal, state, and local jurisdictions confer to
determine how best to implement them within local communities. This on-going task over the
may require additional staffing to ensure compliance with federal requirements by annual
deadlines.
                                                                           Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                   V-58

                                                                                     Town of Apple Valley
                                                             General Plan/Emergency Preparedness Element
As discussed above, the Town utilizes the County-owned TENS reverse-911 disaster notification
system. While useful, the system provides only very basic information to residents. A Town-
owned system, wherein messages can be customized to guide residents on appropriate actions,
apprise of changing conditions, or to issue evacuation warning or alerts, would constitute a
substantial improvement and assist the Town’s emergency preparedness efforts. The Town
should confer and consult with federal, state, County and local funding sources to identify and
apply for funding to purchase such a system, either on its own or as a shared resource with other
local cities and communities. A partnership with the City of Victorville may be worthy of
consideration for this resource, by virtue of the existing shared dispatch center.
Nursing homes, licensed daycare facilities and private schools, all of which serve potentially
vulnerable populations, are required to develop disaster plans. However, since these are non-
public agencies, they may not be part of established communications networks or back up
systems. The Town should fully cooperate and coordinate with the County to provide CERT
training at these facilities. The Town should also provide the County with lists of Homeowner’s
Associations, local businesses and volunteer groups that would benefit from the CERT training
and augment community awareness and preparation for emergency situation.
The Town currently has no large stockpile of food, water or emergency medical supplies that
could serve the general population. Although storage capacity for a large, centralized stockpile is
an issue, the Town should explore the possibility of locating smaller stockpiles, or caches, at
locations throughout Town. Potential locations could include schools, medical offices, and
businesses. The Town should collaborate with the County to use the CERT training sessions to
recruit community assistance with this need.
The Town has established evacuation routes, however, these roadways would not have sufficient
capacity to accommodate a mass evacuation. Further, such an evacuation must be extensively
pre-planned and coordinated with emergency operations centers and critical facilities in
surrounding communities and the County to ensure their ability to receive and provide for
evacuees. The County has begun preparing mass evacuation plans and has slated the high desert
region for this effort in the near future. The Town should continue to consult with the County in
this regard, and should also initiate its own efforts to plan for large-scale emergency events.
