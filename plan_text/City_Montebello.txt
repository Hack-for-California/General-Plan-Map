circulation element
INTRODUCTION:
Circulation - the movement from one place to another - is vital to the well-being of the City and its population. An effective circulation system assures people the ability to travel to work school, recreation, and other pursuits in the City and surround ing area.
PURPOSE:
To comply with California State law (Government Code Section 65301) by designating the location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares and transportation routes.
DEFINITIONS:
The circulation plan is comprised of several types of streets, each designed to accommodate a specific type of travel. The various terms apply as follows:
Freeways are designed to be used for high speed intra-and inter-regional travel. They are 200 to 500 feet wide, characterized by limited access with interchanges at selected locations, and divisions between the two directions of traffic flow.
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
Major and Secondary Roads are designed to connect major living areas to working,shopping and recreation areas in and around the community. In Montebello, as a result of the close-in location, they also serve as through-and commuter-traffic routes. Both are characterized by controlled access, signalization and road dividers.
Major roads are generally 80 to 120 feet wide, while secondary roads are generally 60 to 84 feet wide.
Collector Roads are designed to serve residential areas by taking traffic from local streets to primary and secondary routes. They are 60 to 70 feet wide and generally have neither dividers nor controlled access.
-1-
GOALS:
1.	To facilitate traffic movement and alleviate congestion in and around the City.
2.	To protect residential areas from through traffic movement.
3.	To develop a circulation system which provides for continuous movement to and from adjacent communities.
Adopted MCC June.26, 1973
OBJECTIVES:
1.	To improve north-south circulation in Montebello by providing at least one major street with a grade-separated railroad crossing.
2.	To improve circulation in the southern industrial area.
3.	To provide major traffic routes on streets which border rather than intersect residential neighborhoods.
4.	To provide a circulation system for the Montebello Hills which services the various types of residential and commercial development but at the same time preserves the unique environmental and aesthetic qualities of the hill area.
5.	To provide a crossing of the Santa Ana Freeway at Greenwood Avenue.
CONSTRAINTS:
1.	Many east-west roadways as well as the nearby freeways now carry traffic at or near their designed capacities; the City Engineer has projected even higher volumes for the future. This condition will require improvement of the major east-west routes.
2.	Existing commercial, institutional and residential development along major streets makes attempted widening difficult to accomplish.
3.	Railroad tracks inhibit traffic on the City's north-south roadways.
-2-
4.	Topography in the Montebello Hills and physiographic features such as the Rio Hondo Channel/Whittier Narrows Dam and the bluff in the flatlands limit potential transportation routes.
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
POLICIES:
Major policies of the city with regard to circulation within the community are as follows:
1.	The City should upgrade and improve Greenwood Avenue and Montebello Boulevard as the community’s major north-south connector.
2.	Improvement of Greenwood Avenue and Montebello Boulevard should include widening, grade separation structures and signalization.
3.	City should seek to provide an adequate circulation system in the hills which services major regional traffic generators, yet preserves areas which are attractive for residential, open space or recreational development.
4.	Through traffic in residential areas should be discouraged.
5.	The City of Montebello should not be bisected by a new freeway route.
6.	The City's existing municipal bus lines should be improved to accommodate and service new development, as proposed in the land use element.
7.	Improvement in the bus system should include the development of two new terminals along Montebello Boulevard, one northeast of the intersection with Victoria Avenue, the other either within or adjacent to the regional town center.
8.	With the development of the regional town center, an extension of Montebello/Northridge route through Monterey Park and a new route from the town center along Paramount Boulevard to Pico Rivera should also be considered.
-3-
DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN:
The circulation plan is shown on the accompanying map. Generally, it shows the designation of primary road for Beverly Boulevard, Whittier Boulevard, Olympic Boulevard, Mines Avenue, Washington Boulevard, and Slauson Avenue to carry east-west traffic and Garfield Avenue, Greenwood Avenue/Montebello Boulevard, and Paramount Boulevard to carry north-south traffic. Secondary streets designated are Wilcox Avenue, a proposed extension of Howard Avenue north from Beverly Boulevard to Potrero Grande Drive, Lincoln Avenue between Wilcox Avenue and Montebello Boulevard and along the Whittier Narrows Dam to San Gabriel Boulevard, Telegraph Road, and a proposed road across the Montebello Hills from the Howard Avenue extension to San Gabriel Boulevard. A supporting system of collectors, grade separation structures, and freeway interchanges is also depicted.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, nothing contained herein shall be deemed or construed to in any manner, indicate or evidence any intention on the part of the City of Montebello to at any time in the future, acquire by purchase, eminent domain or any other means, any real property and/or appurtenances for purposes of implementing any provision of this plan.

CONSERVATION ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION:
The importance of conserving our environment is becoming increasingly clear to all of us. We experience increasing time available for leisure and recreation. Because of this, many of us are taking note of the conditions of the environment and are desiring to preserve and enhance this environment for our present and future benefits. As close as Montebello is to the metropolis of Los Angeles, it has a considerable amount of open space that has been preserved because of oil production in the Montebello Hills and the spreading basin of the Rio Hondo Channel Area.
The Montebello Hills are considered by many residents to be the most important physical feature in the city. Physiographically, the hills are a part of a discontinuous range which spans Los Angeles County from the Puente Hills on the east to the Santa Monica mountains on the west. One-third of the city encompasses hills that are being used for oil extraction and cattle grazing. The oil operations are now in the last phases of secondary recovery operations and
production may end in the next ten to fifteen years. By that time, approximately 800 acres will be available for development and open space uses.
Adopted MCC May 27, 1975
PURPOSE:
The purpose of.this conservation element is to comply with California law (Government Code, Section 65302(d)) by adopting goals and policies relating to conservation, identifying resources to be conserved and formulating an action program for implementation of the conservation plan.
DEFINITION:
Conservation is the planned management, preparation and wise utilization of natural resources. The objective of conservation is to prevent the wasteful exploitation, destruction or neglect of these resources. The local conservation planning process and program should acknowledge and detail the environmental processes relevant to the jurisdiction.
-1-
Adopted MCC May 27, 1975
Conservation factors applicable to Montebello are:
Geology and Soils
Land Features
Mineral and Natural Resources
Energy
Water Resources
Plant and Animal Life
Noise and Air Quality
Historical Landmarks
GOALS:
1.	Preserve and protect natural, environmental and man-made resources.
2.	Practice sound management in the utilization of the resources for the long-term benefit of the community.
3.	Promote the reclamation of wastes and the recycling of materials to the maximum feasible extent.
OBJECTIVES:
1.	Maintain underground water supplies free of all pollution which would prevent the use of such water for domestic purposes without treatment.
2.	Preserve outstanding land features.
3.	Reclaim and utilize wastewater wherever possible.
4.	Encourage conservation of energy through use of environmental impact assessment to propose mitigating measures.
-2-
OBJECTIVES:	(Continued)
5.	Preserve outstanding and unique plant life in the community.
6.	Preserve habitats for desirable or non-objectionable birds and mammals in the area.
7.	Encourage area-wide, regional and national solutions to air pollution.
8.	Seek to reduce emissions from stationary and mobile sources within the City of Montebello to the lowest feasible level.
9.	Preserve and display the history and cultural background of the community in order to foster community identity, pride and an appreciation of its cultural heritage.
Adopted MCC May 27, 1975
CONSTRAINTS AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS:
Geology and Soil
1.	The southerly two-thirds of Montebello is flat and the remaining one-third is hilly. The hills are dominated by a major east-west trending anticline. It is this uplifted structure that is responsible for the topography of the hills, for the accumulation of oil and gas and for the exposures of older rock.
2.	The soil consists primarily of poorly bedded, gray silt-stone with beds of cobble conglomerate and sandstone in the upper part of the section. The lower siltstone is exposed in the central part of the hills while the conglomerate beds "rim" the hills on the north, west and south.
The upper siltstone unit (i.e., above the conglomerate) is exposed along the southeast flank of the structure near Lincoln Ave and San Gabriel Boulevard, and in a limited area on the north flank near the sanitary fill. The southern part of Montebello's flat land once was very fertile and was considered to be one of the best agricultural areas. At this time, all of the land has been developed. (See Figure 1.)
3.	*There are no known major or active faults located in the,
city. The primary earthquake hazard in the study area is ground shaking from earthquakes originating on the Sierra

Madre and San Andreas faults, ten and twenty-one miles, respectively, to the north. The Newport-Inglewood fault is fifteen miles to the southwest, and shaking from earthquakes on this fault should be less severe than the shaking expected from the Sierra Madre fault.
4.	*Potential subsidence in northern Montebello, as a result
of fluid withdrawal from the oil fields, was investigated,
and it was found that is related to groundwater withdrawal rather
than fluid withdrawal at the oil field.
5.	*NaturaI erosion is active to varying degrees on the slopes
of the Montebello Hills. It is most active on the steeper slopes in the siltstone.
Adopted MCC May 27, 1975
Natural Resources :
1.	There are two significant natural resources in Montebello, agriculture and the oil fields. Most agricultured land has been developed and the oil fields are fast being depleted.
Oil production from 1917 (when the first of three areas was found) through 1973 totaled 183,942,688 barrels. The production has been declining from 1,229,000 barrels in 1960 to 627,365 barrels in 1973. This represents a decrease of almost half in the production rate in thirteen years, despite the implementation of a water injection program during this period. Water injection has been relatively unsuccessful in stimulating production. Based upon the past trends, the life expectancy of the fields is estimated at ten to fifteen years, depending upon the price of crude oil..
2.	A natural resource of lesser importance is the sand and gravel content of the siltstone and conglomerate beds in the Montebello Hills. Sand and gravel material has been used as base material for oil field roads, and as topping around some well sites. Terrace deposits also contain sand and gravel, but the clay content is higher. These materials are of sufficient quality to be considered for use in development of the area, but may not be suitable for export.
(See Figure 1 for Oil and Gravel Locations.)

Water:
Adopted MCC May 27, 1975
1.	The City of Montebello is served by five water companies and agencies. Imported water from the Metropolitan Water District is the city’s primary source. Portions of the city’s water is obtained from private companies and from local wells. There are six wells within the city, two for the northside area and three for the south-side area, and one for the golf course.
2.	The city stores its water in a 200,000 gallon reservoir for the golf course and in a two million gallon reservoir for the south part of the city. Two 4^ m.g. additional reservoirs will be constructed for the development of the hills.
3.	The City is regulated by the Central Basin Water District for its natural storage and it is allocated to purchase 369.5 acre foot per year. The water that the City pumps from the underground water basin is more pure than imported water and is monitored by the State Health Department.
4.	Flooding has generally been limited to the southern area of the City. Adequate storm drains have been furnished to meet present and future needs in most areas.
5.	Recharge areas include the golf course and park areas located in both the south and north sections of Montebello, and terrace deposits along the south, west and northwest sides
of the Montebello Hills. The most significant areas are the San Gabriel River and Rio Hondo Channel areas east of the Montebello Hills. Most of the hills of Montebello are considered watershed areas. (See Figure 2.)
6.	A contamination problem exists in the southern areas where septic tanks are still in use and water from the tanks infiltrate into the underground water table.
7.	*There is a potential contamination problem from the sanitary
landfill site because of inadequate facilities to control flood and storm waters. No facilities were constructed for leachate control and/or retention of carbondioxide gas.

Plant and Animal Life:
1.	In the northeast corner of the City, facing San Gabriel Boulevard, is a sparse Oak Woodland with Englemann Oak,
Toyon, Elderberry, Eucalyptus, Poison Oak, Grape and an annual weed understory. Some of these oaks near the top of the hills are quite large. Other large trees include Sycamore, Eucalyptus, and Pepper trees. The variety of plant species, open land, brush and trees attract a number of birds, including those species not commonly found in the urban surroundings.
2.	The type of mammals found in the Montebello Hills are coyote, raccoon, skunk and cottontail rabbit. Other mammals (i.e., opossum, rats, mice, bats and several species of burrowing rodents) that range on the hills may also be found in certain urban and suburban areas nearby.
3.	A strong attraction for rodents is the active sanitary landfill in the northwestern portion of the hills. (See Figure 3.)
Noise and Air Quality:
Adopted MCC May 27, 1975
1.	The City’s main noise problem comes from the Santa Ana and the Pomona Freeways. Major roads that create noise problems in the City are Garfield Avenue, Beverly Boulevard, Wilcox Avenue, Whittier Boulevard, Mines Avenue, Washington Avenue, and Telegraph Road.
2.	There are many truck companies in the southern part of Montebello that create a noise level higher than that of the northern section of Montebello.
3.	Montebello lies in the middle of the south coastal air basin.
The average daily emission of air pollutants in Los Angeles County during 1970 was 13 tons, 88 percent of which is attributable to motor vehicles.
4.	The main contributors of air pollution are tne Pomona Freeway which runs the northerly boundary of Montebello, the Santa Ana Freeway and the trucking companies in the southern part of Montebello and everyday traffic on surface streets.

5.	*In the Montebello area, eye irritation occurs on 30 percent of summer working days and 1 percent of winter working days. There has been an average of four smog alerts per year, between 1955 and 1970. Such alerts are called when one or more of the following levels is exceeded:
Carbon Monoxide	- 100	ppm
Nitrogen Oxides	-	3	ppm
Sulfur Oxides	3	ppm
Ozone	- 0.5	PPm
Adopted MCC May 27, 1975
Historical:
1.	The City of Montebello’s historical background starts more than two hundred years ago. Franciscan friars from Spain pushed their way north, out of Mexico, and founded a series of missions from San Diego to San Francisco. The trail connecting these missions was named the El Camino Real. A portion of that trail is known today as Whittier Boulevard. One of the earliest missions was Mission Viejo, built in 1771, on a site near the San Gabriel River that is now located in the northeast corner
of Montebello.
2.	The first house in what has become Montebello was built by Dona Casilda Soto de Lobo. The house still stands and is called the Juan Matias Sanchez Adobe. Its owner recently restored the building and donated it to the City as an historical monument, museum, and a community meeting center.
The City contains the location site where California's fate as a member of the United States was sealed in a decisive battle on the banks of the Rio Hondo on August 17, 1847.
This struggle led to the independence of California . . .
a step preceeding its admission to the Union. (See Figure 2.)
3.	One of the earliest significant ranches established in the Montebello area was known as the Taylor Ranch of which one of the buildings is still standing today.

POLICIES:
Adopted MCC May 27, 1975
1.	The land use element goal of 200 acres of recreation and open space in Montebello should be implemented to preserve unique land features and sufficient open space for recreation, natural plant and animal life. (See Figure 4.)
2.	Trees and vegetation should be preserved and provided to serve as animal habitats within parks, schools, cemetaries and other landscaped open spaces.
3.	Disposal of liquid wastes should be through the sewer system or by transport to approved disposal sites and not by direct discharge on or under the ground surface. Existing private disposal operations should be carefully regulated.
4.	Promote wastewater treatment and utilization for purposes such as irrigation, tooling and groundwater recharge where feasible.
5.	Utilize environmental impact report process to focus on energy conservation measures.
6.	Strict, yet reasonable, legislation and enforcement should be provided regarding,emission and air quality standards.
7.	Use of public transportation systems should be encouraged.
8.	The Juan Matias Sanchez Adobe, the Rio Hondo monument, the Viejo Mission, Taylor Ranch, and El Camino Real should be preserved and restored as necessary.
PROGRAMS:
1.	The following plans should be investigated and considered in proposals to the present landowners, in order to acquire the 200 acres of open space the City has planned in the Montebello Hills prior to development:
(a)	Allocate tax benefits to owners who will keep their land as open space;
(b)	Use the power of eminent domain to acquire property;
(c)	Dedication of open space for subdivision;

(e)	Acquisition of property through tax sales;
(f)	City acquisition of easement rights/development rights on the land to keep it open and undeveloped; and
(g)	Donation by the landowner to the City.
2.	Investigate park, school and private landscaping programs to provide plant life and animal habitats in the Montebello Hills and other areas.
3.	Assist in the reduction of motor vehicle emissions through such measures as:
(a)	Designing highways and intersections and timing traffic signals for the smooth flow of traffic, thus reducing excess emissions caused by acceleration and deceleration
(b)	Equip city vehicles for use of clean burning fuel, such as natural gas, to the extent practical, and purchase vehicles from among those models known to have lower than average emissions; and
(c)	Explore the possibilities of providing parking areas ' near freeway access points as a means of encouraging car pooling.
4.	Consider waste disposal aspects of land use in establishing and applying zoning regulations.
5.	Encourage settlement of industries with the least air pollution potential.
6.	Support additional research and publication concerning the history of Montebello.
7.	The Conservation Element should be implemented in close coordination with the Open Space Element and other applicable elements.

CHAPTER!: INTRODUCTION
The City of Montebello prepared a revised Housing Element of- the General Plan in conformance with California State Legislation (Roos Bill,'AB'2583) in 1981, As required by law, this document has been updated in 1984 and 1989. The purpose of the Housing Element is to provide the City with a general policy direction with regard to decisions concerning housing and to facilitate the improvement and development of housing for all economic segments of the community. The Housing Element identifies the housing needs of the community and sets forth a statement of goals and quantified objectives to address those needs. The plan includes programs for the preservation, improvement and development of housing.
Expanding housing opportunities is acknowledged to be a shared responsibility of the private sector and government at all levels. The plans and strategies in the Housing Element recognize and encourage this joint responsibility. The Element seeks a public/private partnership to address the goal of adequate housing stock in a satisfying environment for all Montebello residents. Fundamentally, the City seeks to provide safe, sanitary, and decent housing to accommodate the housing needs of all the residents of Montebello.
The Housing Element is divided into eleven chapters, beginning with this introduction, in Chapter Two, a community profile is presented which focuses on general demographic information such as population, income, and condition of the existing housing stock. Chapter Three evaluates the effectiveness of the 1984 Housing Element. The results and lessons learned formed a basis for this 1989 update. Chapter Four entitled Housing Needs Analysis, is an examination of the present, future, and special housing needs of the community. Much like the previous chapter, this housing needs analysis was central in the development of this update. In Chapter Five, the constraints., upon, and resources. available to the City of Montebello are discussed. The chapter focuses upon both private and public constraints and resources. Chapter Six is the 1989 action plan which provides a full discussion of the policies, goals, programs, objectives and anticipated results. Chapter Seven is entitled Citizen Participation, is essentially an explanation of the steps taken by the City to ensure public participation in the preparation and adoption of the Housing Element. Chapters Eight and Nine are devoted to a discussion of consistency between the General Plan, the Housing Element, and Energy Conservation respectfully. Chapter Ten is a list of vacant parcels that are developable and zoned for residential use. The Housing Element concludes with Chapter Eleven which is an evaluation of the potential or current rent restricted low income housing units converting to market rate housing. There is also an analysis of the preservation and replacement costs of these units and a discussion of possible resources.

CHAPTER II: COMMUNITY PROFILE
A.	Present and Projected Population
The 1980 U.S. Census reported a total population of 52,929 for the City of Montebello, a 23% increase over the 1970 population. This population growth rate exceeded that of surrounding cities during the decade of the 1970's. In fact, Montebello was the 12th fastest growing of the 83 cities within the County of Los Angeles between 1970 and 1980.
In 1986, the Census Bureau conducted a special census in several communities located in central Los Angeles County, including Montebello. This special census listed Montebello's population as 55,1981. As of January 1,1989, the latest estimate of Montebello's population published by the Department of Finance, Demographic Research Unit, indicates a population of 58,233 (see Figure No. 1, Population Growth: 1950 - 1989). This reflects a 9% increase in population since 1980.
According to the 1980 Census, the average household size was 2.92 persons per dwelling unit in Montebello. The 1986 special census lists the persons per household at 3.01. As of January 1, 1989 the latest figures published by the Department of Finance, Demographic Research Unit, indicates average persons per household has increased to 3.14 (see Figure No. 2, Household Size 1980 -1989).
Figure No. 2: Household Size

The 1980 Census lists the median age in Montebello as 29.5 years. Four of ten residents were either over 65 years of age, or under the age of 19.
Between 1970 and 1980 the Hispanic population grew at a faster rate than the general population. According to the 1980 Census, Hispanics comprised 59.2% of the City’s population, an increase of 12.1% from 1970. Between 1970 and 1980, the Asian population
1 U.S. Census Bureau, 1986
2
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element”
grew from 5.2% to 13.6%, and the Black population grew slightly from 0.3% to 0.6%.
The 1986 Special Census indicated slight increases in the Hispanic and Asian populations to 61% and 16% respectively, with no significant change in the Black population.
The Population Element of the General Plan projects maximum population for the City of between 60,000 to 70,000. This projection was based upon development of the Montebello Hills in densities consistent with the General Plan population density guidelines. The population projections reflect the limitations on infrastructure necessary to support increased population densities.
B.	Household income
According to the U.S. Census, the median household income for Montebello was $9,507 in 1970, and $17,731 in 1980. The median income varied widely by census tract in 1980, with a high of $31,154 reported in Census Tract 5319 (an extremely small census tract representing only 20 households) and a low of $13,090 in Census Tract 5320.

A number of census tracts in 1980 were found to have significant percentages of low and moderate-income households. Low to moderate-income households, as determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), are those households whose incomes (adjusted for family size) fall below 80% of the median households income in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area. Table No. 1 on page 4 indicates the low and moderate-income caps for 1989.

As of July 1989, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social Services listed 7,5183 residents in Montebello on public assistance, A representative of the Department indicates' that the majority of these households are headed by a single parent. This segment of the community is burdened by a low income and the high cost of providing shelter. Figure No. 4 illustrates the number of Montebello residents receiving various types of public assistance.

In 1980 the Census recorded 18,126 housing units in the City. Between January 1, 1980 and July 1, 1989, there was a net increase of 753 new units (after demolitions). Therefore, the total housing stock increased by 4% and numbered )	18,879 as of July 1, 1989.4 The breakdown
of housing type in Montebello is depicted on Figure No. 5 .
Housing production slowed beginning in 1978, and a much slower rate of growth has continued through the 1980’s, reflecting a pattern of infill redevelopment on lots in existing neighborhoods rather than larger scale new tract development. During the 1970's, a total of 4,089 units, or 22% of the existing total housing stock, were added. This growth is attributed primarily to development of the City's western portion of the Montebello Hills area. Most of this land had previously been used for oil production, or had been completely vacant. The release of these properties for development during the period of 1970 through 1978 allowed for substantial residential development.

D.	Existing Housing Stock Condition
u
All residential building in the City, except those constructed in the last five years, were included in the housing condition survey conducted by the Montebello Planning Department in mid-1983. Given that 96% of the housing was built prior to 1983, the survey was very comprehensive. The survey results, which follow on Figure No. 6 found the housing stock in generally sound condition.
Criteria for determining housing conditions were:
Paint:	Homes with peeling or dirty paint as
visible from the street.
Roof:	Homes with missing or deteriorated
roof covering as visible from the street.
Structural: Homes with missing plaster or
obviously weak or missing structural members as visible from the street.
The housing survey results reveal the City's resident's pride in home ownership. Consequently, only 9% of the residential units needed painting and less than 1 % required new roofs or structural repairs. The number of units constructed in recent years, in part, also contributed to the sound condition of the housing stock. Approximately 4,100 units were constructed between 1970 and 1980, as reflected by the 1980 census data. However, a significant percentage of the City's housing stock is maturing. In a statistical summary prepared in 1973,43% of the units were listed as being more than 20 years old: by 1980 this figure had increased to 52%.
E.	Length of Residency
The 1980 Census reflected a stability of residency, with 45% of the residents indicating a tenure of longer than six years in their present dwelling. The high cost of housing has probably curtailed residential mobility. The City can expect to see a trend developing whereby residents will remain in their homes for longer periods of time. Since the housing stock will continue to age and need periodic rehabilitation, the City has focused its housing programs on preserving the existing housing stock and maintaining the cohesiveness and stability prevalent in the majority of its residential neighborhoods.

CHAPTER III: PLAN EVALUATION
The 1984 Housing Element identified five major housing policy areas. Beiow is an evaluation of the 1984 plan by each of those five policy areas. Under each policy area the goals, programs, objectives, and results are presented in summary matrix form. The results are also discussed in greater detail through the use of tables, charts, and narrative description.
In general, the City of Montebello was successfully able to achieve the majority of its objectives. However, there were objectives that were not reached. A discussion of those shortcomings is also included. The 1989 Housing Element is based on the evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the 1984 Plan as well as the anticipated circumstances necessary to take the City into the 1990's.
A.	Provision for Housing: To encourage the provision of housing for all economic segments of the community.
As is evident by Table No. 2 on page 8, Montebello met or surpassed all but one of its Provision for Housing objectives. Only with respect to code enforcement corrections did the City fall short (approximately 6%). From July 1, 1984 through June 30, 1989 approximately 600 code enforcement actions were taken annually; our objective was 640. The short fall is due to two reasons 1) staff turnover; and 2) concentration on the most serious violations which tend to adversely impact a larger area and take longer to resolve.
A comparison of housing production objectives with actual housing production results from mid-1984 to mid-1989 is also provided in.Table No. 2. A total of 654 new dwelling units were developed in Montebello during the period of July 1, 1984 to June 30, 1989. These figures indicate that goals for new construction were met, including construction of the anticipated number of subsidized housing units for the elderly and handicapped. The mix of housing type was as follows: 359 apartments, 88 townhomes and/or condominiums, 77 single family homes and 130 units of senior citizen housing. The average construction rate from July 1, 1984 through June 30, 1989 was 130 units per year, including the subsidized Casa La Merced senior housing project. During this same five year period 97 housing units were demolished.
Figure No. 7 on page 8, is a map which depicts the spatial distribution of the 654 new units. Thus, given the mixture of locations, types, and tenure, the goal to provide for a range of housing was satisfied.
7
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element"
Montebello was able to achieve its special population (e.g. elderly) housing goal of 130 units/ \ through a public/private partnership. The City made the land available, HUD provided the financing, and a non-profit organization developed the units. The 130 unit complex, known as Casa La Merced, houses senior citizens. All residents of the complex receive Section 8 housing certificates from HUD.

B.	Housing and Neighborhood Preservation: To preserve existing housing, neighborhoods and the residential character of the community while providing for orderly growth to accommodate the future housing needs of the community.
Montebello fell slightly short in its Housing and Neighborhood Preservation goal. As demonstrated by Table No. 3, the City's objective was to provide 12 rehabilitation loans annually; an average of 10 were completed annually over the five year period. Montebello set an objective of 28 single family unit rehabilitations per year; an average of 17 per year were completed. The City also intended to provide 55 handyman services per year; over the five year period Montebello's average was 45 per year. Montebello surpassed its graffiti removal objective by a factor of more than two. Montebello met or nearly attained its objectives when staff was at full strength. However, personnel vacancies due to transfer, promotion, resignation, etc., created,occasional periods of reduced production until the vacancies were filled.

C.	Housing Accessibility: To assure housing accessibility free of discrimination.
Essentially, the goal of the housing accessibility policy is to provide housing options through the reduction or elimination of discrimination, and to increase the public's awareness of housing programs. These goals and their corresponding objectives are being met as is evident by Table No. 4 on page 10.

City of Montebello ”1989 Housing Element1
The City has a contractual arrangement with the San Gabriel Valley Fair Housing Council to provide fair housing services. Under an annual contract the Housing Council investigates allegations of discrimination complaints. In cases where the Council has reason to believe that discrimination has occurred, the Council refers the matter to the State Department of Fair Housing and Employment and/or the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development for further investigation. The Council conducts quarterly seminars for tenants, managers and landowners with respect to housing discrimination issues. The Housing Council has a program with the Montebello School District to educate students on the need for fair housing. Currently, the Council is in the process of conducting a survey of 100 households to determine the level of housing discrimination in Montebello.
With respect to awareness of City programs, staff annually mails information on ail available housing programs in Montebello to every household. For persons interested in the owner occupied rehabilitation program the City holds a bi-monthly orientation meeting.

D.	Conservation of Affordability: To conserve and increase the supply of affordable housing for low and moderate-income households.
The City of Montebello considers its multi and single-family residential rehabilitation programs as efforts to conserve housing affordability and to preserving neighborhoods. The results of the rehabilitation programs were discussed under Housing and Neighborhood Preservation.
There was 16% increase in Montebello in the number of Section 8 certificates from 297 to 345 during the period of July 1984 to June of 1989. The objective of providing 382 Section 3 certificates was not attained (see Table No 5 on the following page). However, the Section program is not an area in which the City of Montebello has authority or control. Monteben contracts with the Los Angeles County Housing Authority for Section 8 certificates. Hence the City cannot control the number of certificates issued by the County. The County Housing
10
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element*
Authority does not allocate certificates by local jurisdiction. Instead, the recipient is free to select any unit in any jurisdiction within the county willing to accept the voucher. Montebello's primary responsibility, which it fulfilled, is to inform citizens of how the County process works and to refer them to the proper authority within the’County:
In addition to the 345 Section 8 vouchers discussed above, there are three Section 8 HUD subsidized buildings in which every resident receives Section 8 assistance (the combined total number of units within these three buildings is 347). There are 130 units in Casa La Merced and 189 units in the Beverly Towers. Both Casa La Merced and Beverly Towers are exclusively for senior citizens. Villa Margarita is a 28 unit complex exclusively for families.

E.	Standards and Plans for Adequate Sites: To develop standards and plans to ensure that adequate sites exist throughout the City for various types of housing.
The goals and objectives of this policy were achieved as is evident by Table No. 6 on page 12. Montebello has in place a variety of means by which it can expedite housing production and reduce the cost of housing. The General Plan and other development standards continue to provide the framework which permits growth while maintaining the quality of life.

F.	Lessons Learned
The basic housing policies and goals remain unchanged (see Chapter VI). However, the 1989 update has been revised to incorporate a number of important lessons learned as a result of prior efforts. For example, the City has taken a more aggressive position with respect to housing and neighborhood preservation. To that end, the City has doubled the number of full time code enforcement officers and has significantly increased its graffiti removal efforts. Both of these programs represent a substantial commitment on behalf of the City to preserving residential neighborhoods. The programs are designed to project an image of pride, stability, as well as a concern for maintenance and safety.
Although the City was previously slightly below its housing rehabilitation goal, we continue to make progress. Our goal is identical to the prior element-90 units per year. The single family rehabilitation program is now properly staffed with experienced personnel. A full-time employee coordinates this program. Additionally, Montebello has hired, on a contract basis, an inspector to provide rapid but professional inspections for interested applicants. This change will decrease the time necessary to process applications, and thus, reduce the loss of potential clients.
12
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element1
With respect to the rental rehabilitation program, the City has increased its marketing outreach efforts. Montebello has contacted local property management firms, apartment owners' associations, the local Chamber of Commerce, real estate offices, etc., regarding the availability of the rental rehabilitation program.
The City has utilized the efforts of the code enforcement officers as a means of informing apartment owners cited for violations about the rental rehabilitation program. In general, the City has instituted a much more aggressive marketing effort in regards to the rental rehabilitation program.

CHAPTER IV: HOUSING NEED ANALYSIS
State law requires a community’s Housing Element to consider the housing needs of residents at alt income levels. Projections of future housing heeds for Montebello originate from several sources. The Federal Housing Assistance Plan (HAP) is one source. The HAP is required of all jurisdictions receiving Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding. This federally approved document includes the community’s housing needs and establishes goals towards alleviating the needs of the community.
A second source is the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG). SCAG is the state designated regional planning body for the Southern California area, including Montebello. Under state direction, a primary function of SCAG is to develop data from which to analyze the housing needs of each community within the region.
The 1989 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA), prepared by SCAG, identifies existing housing needs as of January 1, 1989, and projects future housing needs from July 1, 1989 to June 30, 1994 for each jurisdiction within the region based on the regional Growth Management Plan (GMP), Regional Mobility Plan, and the Air Quality Management Plan. Each community in the region must then utilize these RHNA numbers as the basis for the identification of housing needs in the update of their Housing Element.
V
A.	Existing Housing Needs
1.	Low and Very Low Income Households
The RHNA Identifies 18,268 households within Montebello in 1989. Of these households, 7,216 (40%) are classified by SCAG as low income households.
Figure No. 8: Household Overpayment
3500/
Owners
Renters
■	Low Income
SI Very Low Income
■	Total
"Existing need" in the RHNA is defined as the current number of lower income households paying more than 30% of their income for housing, which, is. defined by the RHNA as "overpayment". There is a large stock of affordable units in Montebello, with over 7,7805 rental units having an average rent of $555 per month.
Montebello Business Licenses
14
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element"
Nevertheless, according to the RHNA, of the total 7,216 low income households in the City, 3,730 (52%) are "overpaying" for shelter Information on the type of households by income category and tenure overpaying for housing is provided in Figure No. 8 on the previous page.
2.	Rehabilitation Needs
Pursuant federal guidelines, any unit which does not meet or exceed the Section 8 housing quality standards or local building codes is considered to be substandard and suitable for rehabilitation. According to SCAG’s Regional Housing Needs Assessment document, there are 18,782 dwelling units in Montebello. As of 1989, 1,619 of these units are designated as being suitable for rehabilitation6. As is discussed in Chapters III and VI, the City has programs to assist qualified homeowners and rental property owners in rehabilitating such properties. The City also has an active property maintenance code enforcement program that requires the correction of substandard housing conditions.
B.	Future Housing Needs
State law requires each local Council of Governments (COG) to assess future housing needs for the region and to allocate to each community its "fair share" of the estimated regional growth. The COG for this area is the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) which has provided such allocations through its Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA). The RHNA takes into account future growth as well as demolitions and existing and ideal vacancy rates. An "ideal" vacancy rate for each community is arrived at by averaging the ideal single-family vacancy rate (2%) and the idea! multi-family vacancy rate (5%) based on the ratio of single-family/multi-famiiy development in the community.
According to the RHNA, the total future housing need in Montebello from 1989 to 1994 is 951 new units. This allocation assumes an 11.7% replacement factor, an existing vacancy rate of 0.4%, and an ideal vacancy rate of 3.25%. The 951 units include 112 replacement units to replace demolitions, 294 units to meet regional growth needs, and 545 units to meet existing and future vacancy needs. This figure is further distributed by income as shown on the following page in Table No. 7. The City accepts the RHNA as its quantified objective for the development of new housing units across income categories.
Table No. 7 also breaks down housing need and construction objective by household income. Every community should have its regional share of very low, low, moderate and

) high-income households. The breakdown provided by Table No. 7 includes the number of units which would be necessary for Montebello to move 25% closer to the "ideal" over the next five years, and to achieve the "ideal" within 20 years.

For a discussion of rehabilitation and conservation quantified objectives by income category please see Tables 16 and 17 on pages 44 and 49.
C.	Special Housing Needs
State legislation stipulates that housing elements consider any special housing needs that may exist in the community, such as those of the haridicapped, elderly, large families, farm workers, homeless families, and single parent households. The following discussion analyzes the special housing needs of these groups in Montebello.
1.	Elderly
There is a significant elderly population residing in the City of Montebello. The result of the 1986 Special Census reflects an increase within the elderly population (65 years of age and older) from 10.7% of the population per the 1980-census to 14.8% of the population by 1986. /The total elderly population number is 7,727. This increase is attributed to a significant percentage of the population entering retirement age and an increased life span for the elderly as a result of medical advances. Demographers expect that the elderly will constitute an even greater portion of the population by the year 2000.
16
City of Montebello ”1989 Housing Element”
For elderly homeowners, the greatest single need is assistance with the upkeep of their home. According to the City's Human Services Coordinator, many seniors are on a low fixed income and therefore cannot properly maintain their home. For these seniors, the City's rehabilitation program provides loans which are deferred until the house changes ownership.
u
Senior citizens who are not homeowners face the problem of affordable housing. The needs of this group have been assisted through construction of two subsidized senior housing developments in Montebello, Beverly Towers with 189 units and Casa La Merced with 130 units. All residents of these two complexes receive Section 8 certificates. However, waiting lists for each of these developments indicate continuing demand for such housing.
For those eligible senior citizens who can no longer prepare their own food they are assisted by the County’s Department of Aging's Meals-On-Wheels program. Essentially, this program delivers food to those seniors who can no longer prepare their own. This program allows seniors to remain in their own home or apartment and thus remain in an independent living environment.
2.
Handicapped
According to the 1980 Census, disabled and handicapped persons, over the age of 16 constituted 4.4% of the population. Therefore, an estimated 2,232 handicap persons live in Montebello.
Perhaps the most important need of the handicapped is the removal of physical barriers to housing. Consequently, Montebello has used Community Development Block Grant funds to provide curb cuts through out the City. Additionally, whenever the dwelling of a household with a handicapped member undergoes rehabilitation using federal, state, or local sources, the unit is retrofitted with handicapped improvements.
A breakdown of low and moderate-income households which contain at least one handicapped person and that are expected to receive rental assistance during the next five years is provided in Table No. 8 on the following page.

3.	Large Families
The housing needs of large families within this community are problematic on two counts. First, is a limited supply of large (three or more bedrooms) rental units in the City. Secondly, large families (with five or more persons) find it increasingly difficult to locate affordable housing to accommodate their needs.
Homeownership is prohibitively expensive for many families as income has not kept pace with the cost of housing. The strong need for increased family housing is evident when viewed against the numbers of families qualifying for assisted housing programs. Seven of twelve census tracts within the City have a majority of residents who qualify for federal housing assistance programs. Many of these families are headed by single parents (3,932 households)7 8 .
Often, large families have several dependent children and thus need a location close to day care centers and schools. A higher than normal percentage of these households are low and moderate-income. Additionally, a higher than normal percentage of these households are paying more than 30 percent of their incomes for rent
The primary resources for large families are the Section 8 housing certificates and the 28 unit Villa Margarita. According to the Los Angeles County Housing Authority, the waiting list for dwelling units that can accommodate large families ranges from two to four years. As the City's fees are modest (see Table No. 14 on page 34) and processing time extremely short (60 days) a program to waive fees or expedite permits would have only a marginal impact at best. Nevertheless, the City will examine the possibility of implementing such a program.

Farm Workers
Montebello is located within a highly urbanized area therefore, farm workers do not constitute a significant percentage of City's population.
5. Homeless Families
With the assistance of the Police Department, on October 6, 1989 the City sought to document the number of homeless in Montebello. According to this point-in-time search there are no homeless families among Montebello's population. However, this search and routine police patrol does indicate that there were several (5 to 8) homeless single males living in parks, behind businesses located along Whittier Boulevard, and or under bridges at any one time in the City of Montebello.
The City's Community Services Department has an active program to assist the homeless. The Department organizes food drives at City Hall and local schools and churches. This food is available to any homeless person in need of food. The Department also provides appropriate referrals for temporary shelter and/or crisis assistance.
Within a five mile radius of Montebello City Hall the following housing resources for homeless single men are available: Sundowners, Salvation Army, and the New Jerusalem Church.
For homeless women and/or families the following shelters and temporary housing are available: Rio Hondo Temporary Home, Chicana Service Action Center, Southern California Coalition on Battered Women, and Bethel Haven.
While there are no shelters within the jurisdiction, local land use regulations do not prohibit the placement of shelters within the City limits. A shelter would require a conditional use permit. The conditions for a shelter would not differ, except for parking standards, from any other residential use in terms of setbacks, open space, etc. With respect to parking, a shelter need provide only one space per every two employees rather than a ratio based on bedrooms or square footage. This provision facilitates the placement of shelters. Therefore, there is no need to identify an exact location for the siting of shelters.

Person* Per Room
According to the 1980 Census the rate of overcrowding was as shown on Figure No. 9. As is evident by the numbers, renters with large families are most likely to live in overcrowded dwelling units. This is due to the high cost of housing and the limited number of apartments with three or more bedrooms.	To alleviate
overcrowding for renters, the City offers the Rental Rehabilitation Program (RRP). Under this program, property owners may receive low interest loans for property upgrading, including room additions which will help alleviate overcrowding. Eligible tenants may also apply for Section 8 housing, which would provide affordable housing without overcrowding. However, the City has no control or jurisdiction over the administration of the Section 8 program.
To reduce overcrowding for owner occupied units, the City has a Home Improvement and Preservation Program (HIPP). The program provides low interest loans and deferred loans to qualified homeowners in order to alleviate overcrowding and structural defects.
7. Female Headed Households
According to the 1980 Census, the City of Montebello had 13,522 Family Households residing within its city boundaries, of which 19% (2,540) were Female Headed Households (FHH) with no husband present.	The
preliminary 1990 census data indicates that Montebello had 14,397 Family Households of which 23% (3,273) are FHH with no husband present (see Figure No. 10).
Figure No. 10: Female Headed Households
During the decade of the 1980*s, the number of Family Households increased by 875, from 13,522 in 1980 to 14,397 in 1990. Over this same time period, the number of FHH without a husband present increased by 733, from 2,540 in
20
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element1
1980 to 3,273 in 1990. In analyzing the increase in FHH during the 1980*s, the ) data appears to indicate that for each new Family Household (875) gained in the City, there were almost as many new FHH (733) gained in the City. Hence, one is inclined to say that of the new Family Households gained in the City of MontebeHo during the 1980's, 84% were FHH. However, in making such an analysis one would completely miss the reality of the City's demographics. In the following section, the City's Home Improvement Program (HIPP) data for 1984 through 1989 suggests a different view of the City's FHH than what the census data would indicate.
Figure No. 11: HIPP Loans To FHH
■ Def. a sub.
Elder B Total
Between 1984 and 1989, the City's HIPP made a total of 66 deferred and subsidized loans to very low and low-income people. Of the 66 HIPP loans, 47% (31) were made to FHH. During the same time period, 24% of all HIPP (deferred and subsidized) loans made were to elderly FHH. A closer analysis reveals that of the 31 HIPP loans made to FHH, 52% (16) were made to elderly FHH. Overall, of the HIPP loans made by the City, 57% have been deferred loans to FHH and 27% have been subsidized loans to FHH (see Figure No. 11).
In the housing section of this document, it was established that housing costs in the City have increased substantially (512%) over the past 18 years. Given the substantial increase in the City’s, housing costs, many low and moderate-income families have subsequently been priced out of the City’s housing market. In the demographics section, it was also established that the City has a rapidly growing elderly population that requires different types of assistance. One form of assistance the City provides to elderly people is through the HIPP.
The findings in the housing and demographic sections, as well as the City's HIPP data indicate that the increase in the City's FHH is actually an increase in elderly female headed households. The findings and HIPP data do not indicate that the increase in FHH during the 1980's were young female headed households (with no husband present).
In accordance with the City's increasingly elderly population, 52% of the IPP (deferred and subsidized) loans made have been to elderly female headed households who applied for financial assistance to properly maintain their
21
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element"
homes. Hence, the increase observed in FHH during the 1980’s in Montebello is a result of the City's increasing elderly population, in particularly the elderly female population. To assume that the increase in FHH during the 1980's is attributable to young female headed households who under normal dircumstances would not be able to afford to purchase a home in the City, would lead one to an erroneous conclusion.
Since the City has been able to effectively assist elderly female headed households through the City's HIPP, the City will continue to aggressively market the HIPP to the elderly homeowner population. In addition, the non-elderly FHH will be targeted for rental assistance through the Los Angeles County's Section 8 Program.

CHAPTER V: CONSTRAINTS AND RESOURCES
The housing constraints and resources within the City of Montebello are similar to those of other Southern California urban and suburban communities. Rising costs within the construction industry, the cost and availability of financing, and high demand for a limited amount of land, have combined to constrain housing production, particularly for low and moderate-income persons. The net result is significantly higher costs for housing in a period when incomes are not rising at the same pace. However, the City has used and continues to utilize available resources including tax increment financing, parcel data banks, modest development fees, and a conducive regulatory environment to stimulate the development and preservation of housing in appropriate locations.
This section of the Housing Element elaborates on the constraints and resources faced by the private and public sectors with respect to the development and rehabilitation of housing in Montebello.
A.	Market Constraints
Many of the factors which tend to restrict housing supply cannot be controlled by local government, especially those that relate to the regional, national and international economy. Various factors not under the control of local government influence the cost, supply and distribution of housing. These factors include production costs, housing prices and vacancy rates.
1.	Production Costs
a) Land Costs: The scarcity of land serves only to increase the ultimate cost of the housing unit. The cost of land ranges between 16% and 40% of the price of a new home, with most projects having total land costs in the 23% to 35% range. Most developers feel there is relatively little they can cut out of current projects to reduce the price, yet still be competitive with housing built by developers in other cities.
Part of the increase in land prices can be attributed to the general inflation in the U.S. over the last 40 years. However, a significant portion of the increase is due to land price appreciation as the demand for housing has continuously expanded, both because of population growth and Montebello’s central location within the metropolitan area.
V
23
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element
b)
Construction Costs: Labor and material add substantially to the cost of housing. Construction costs are about the same in Montebello as in other parts of Southern California, averaging about $58 per square foot for* single family residences, and $65'per square foot for multi-family residential construction.
c) Financing Costs: Financing costs, for the most part, are not subject to local influence. The control of interest rate is determined by national policies and economic conditions. Interest rates greatly influence the housing market for home buyers and indirectly for renters.
2.	Housing Prices
a)
Housing Price Trends: A fundamental constraint on the supply of new housing is profitability. Trends in the price of housing over a period of time can either expand or contract the number and proportion of families that can afford homeownership. When the price of new housing continuously increases at a rate greater than income gains, more and more households are priced out of the homeownership market. The impact of price escalation is most severe on first-time buyers.
The price of new housing influences the resale price on existing homes. When new home values are high relative to consumer incomes, consumers interested in home ownership must turn to the resale market, thus inducing pressures for price increases.
rigure No. 12: Homeownership Cosi
During the decade. of the 1980’s, housing cost in Montebello increased substantially. As illustrated in Figure No. 12, in 1970 the median price of a single-family home was $26,130. This average increased to $97,250 in 1983. In 1988, the same home sold for $160,000, an increase of 512% in 18 years (not adjusted for inflation). In 1987, the majority of single-family homes in the City ranged in price from approximately $130,000 to $350,0009.
c
9 Montebello Board of Realtors
24
City of Montebello ”1989 Housing Element
In August 1988, the housing affordability index reached its lowest level since December 1984. Only a fourth of California's households today have the income to qualify for a 30-year mortgage to buy the present median-priced single-family home priced at $167,42810. A June 1988 survey from the California Association of Realtors shows that 75% of California families cannot qualify to buy a median-priced home. For example, to purchase a median- priced home, 20% down payment is required, as well as an annual income of $52,011 in order to make monthly mortgage payments including taxes and insurance of $1,300.
In summary, as the price of existing single-family homes continue to rise at a rate faster than that of individual incomes, ownership of single-family homes becomes less accessible, even to median income households.
b) Rental Rates: Rental rates have also increased, although not nearly as fast as the cost of homeownership. In 1970, the median rental rate was $122 per month. By 1980, the average rental was $285 per month. By 1986, the monthly median rent was upwards of
$500. In 1989, according to the Fair Housing Council of San Gabriel Valley the monthly rent for a 1-bedroom unit ranged from $390 - $490; 2 bedroom units ranged in price from $525 - $650; and 3 bedroom units . (very few within the City), ranged in rent from $750 and up. The average rental cost for all units was $555 (see Figure No. 13). There is a very limited supply of single-family, detached homes for rent within the City. Costs ranged from $650 to $750 for a two-bedroom house to $800 -$1,000 for a three-bedroom house.
Figure No. 13: Average Rental Cost
Year
3.	Vacancy Rates
The price of new housing has a strong bearing on the demand for existing housing and subsequent vacancy levels and rates. The 1986 Special Census identified a vacancy rate of 2.96% for housing in Montebello. The 1989 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) identified a vacancy rate of only
10 Security Pacific National Bank 1988 Housing Affordability Index (August, 1989)
25
City of Montebello "79S9 Housing Element
0.4%. However, the Los Angeles County Population Study published in January 1989, identifies a 2.97% vacancy rate for 1988. Regardless of which vacancy, rate is most accurate, the essential point is that as long as the vacancy supply is low, housing prices will remain high.
B.	Government Constraints
1.	Existing Development Pattern
The existing development patterns within the City of Montebello, to a large extent, controls the City's ability to encourage housing production or to greatly increase land use. Slightly less than half the housing stock within the City is comprised of single-family detached residential homes. The vast majority of these single-family homes are owner occupied and well maintained. The other half of the housing stock are apartments and condominiums. The ratio of renters to homeowners is about 51% renters and 49% homeowners. Therefore, Montebello has a good balance between renters and homeowners, and multi-family units and single family homes.
As a result of the General Plan/Zoning Consistency Program, the City has / learned that most lots zoned for multi-family structures are developed to the maximum potential. However, there are enough underdeveloped lots to accommodate an additional 982 new housing units. Please see "Adequate Sites" section on page 28 for additional information.
2.	Existing Condition of Housing Stock
The sound condition of the existing housing stock (please see Figure No. 6, page 6) is a further limitation on new housing development. The current high costs of new construction provides incentives to preserve the more affordable, existing housing whenever possible.
3.	infrastructure and Operational Cost
The ability of local governments in general, and the City of Montebello in particular, to directly support the construction of new housing and to accommodate project impacts is severely limited by infrastructure and operational costs. Local governments, particularly as a result of tax limitation measures, are attempting to maintain service levels with limited fiscal resources. Any new commitments and/or obligations must be measured * against the constraints of fiscal resources and community goals, objectives and
26
City of Montebello ”1989 Housing Element1
policies. However, given that the City is highly developed with a complete infrastructure system and that the vast majority of new housing is infill, lack of infrastructure is not a major problem.
4.	Reduction in Federal and State Assistance
Reductions in the nature and amount of state and federal assistance programs to local government place further constraints on the ability of the City to develop new initiatives or expand existing programs. Information currently available on the status of state and federal housing assistance programs does not provide substantial assurances of support. Specifically, there is a lack of funding from federal and state sources for assisted housing for low and moderate-income persons, large families and families with a single head of household.
5.	Compliance with Rules and Regulations of Higher Level of Government
Among other governmental constraints on local housing maintenance, improvement, and development are those constraints imposed by higher levels of government. Examples include, but are not limited to, County subdivision processing schedules, County Housing Authority processing and allocation of existing Section 8 units, state mandated laws, and federal administrative requirements.
Given the finite fiscal resources at the local level, and the limited funds provided by the state and federal governments, the City faces substantial constraints in providing significant support to the development of new housing. When these factors are combined with the cost of land, the construction of new housing, and the limited amount of land available for such purposes, developing new housing (particularly for low and moderate-income persons) is problematic. Although similar constraints may apply to the maintenance and improvement of existing housing, considerably more "leverage'* can be obtained through use of available resources to support and expand housing preservation programs.
The constraints listed above affect the availability and thus the affordability of housing within Montebello. These factors are discussed as major criteria to be considered in developing Montebello’s housing plan. To the degree feasible, allowances will be made to minimize the effect of these constraints on the overall strategies designed to meet the City's adopted goals, policies, and priorities.
27
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element1
C.	Resources
1.	Existing Housing Stock
The City's 8.2 square miles are divided into 12,602 parcels, of which 9,770 (77.5%) are developed with single family homes, and 1,563 (12.4%) are developed with multi-family units, leaving 1,269 parcels (10.1%) as commercially and industrially developed. Thus, the City’s most significant housing resource is its substantial good quality existing housing stock, as described in Chapter 2.
2.	Adequate Sites
Residential development is permitted in areas designated Residential or Boulevard Commercial by the General Plan. There are three residential development density types that apply city-wide. Table No. 9 below identifies the three density types (low, medium, and high density) and the corresponding development standard e.g.,
TABLE NO. 9
RESIDENTIAL DENSITY TYPES
DEVELOPMENT DENSITY TYPE	UNIT PER SQUARE FEET OF LOT AREA |
Low	I One unit per 5,000 square feet
Medium	One unit per 3,000 square feet
High	One unit per 2,000 square feet
City staff conducted an extensive analysis to determine the amount of housing development potential. The study documented the redevelopment potential of every block within the City designated as residential on the General Plan. The study concluded that 982 new dwelling units could be accommodated through redevelopment within areas of the General Plan designated residential. The development of all these units would be "by right", meaning that no conditional use permits would be required. The vast majority, approximately 95%, of these dwelling units would be multi-family with the remaining 5% as single family. With the completion of the study, the City can direct developers to specific parcels and blocks which can accommodate additional growth. It is not practical, in this Housing Element, to list every such parcel or block, however, the information is available upon request by interested agencies or developers. These 982 new units excludes development of the Montebello Hills (see Table No. 10 on page 29).

As stated above, residential uses are permitted in areas designated as Boulevard Commercial by the General Plan. Hence, staff also evaluated the potential for residential development along areas designated as Boulevard Commercial. A total of 131 acres are designated Boulevard Commercial by the General Plan. Within these 131 acres, the range of possible new dwelling units is illustrated by Table No. 11 below.
TABLE NO. 11
ADEQUATE SITES FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
WITHIN COMMERCIAL AREAS
| DEVELOPMENT DENSITY TYPE	POSSIBLE DWELLING UNITS
(Low	1,141
I Medium	1,902
I High	2,853
Assuming that redevelopment of the subject areas occurred under a medium density residential scenario^ a total of 1,902 new dwelling units could be accommodated in areas designated as Boulevard Commercial. Given land costs, it is staffs assessment that the most likely development scenario would be at medium density. Table No. 12 on the following page shows that up to 982 new units could be accommodated in areas designated Residential by the General Plan, and that 1,902 new dwelling units could be accommodated in areas designated Boulevard Commercial. Consequently, in areas designated as Residential and Boulevard Commercial, the City of Montebello has sufficient adequate sites to accommodate up to 2,884 new dwelling units. However, even under the low density scenario, a total of 2,123 dwelling units would be possible (1,141 in the commercial areas and 982 in the residential areas). Therefore, regardless of the density scenario utilized in the analysis, Montebello has identified sufficient adequate sites to meet the requirements of the Regional Housing Needs Allocation of 951.

3.	Vacant Land
In the northeast section of the City lies a 500 acre parcel of vacant land under one ownership. This parcel is the only remaining significant area for additional residential development in the City. Until recently the owner, Chevron U.S.A., indicated it would continue extracting oil from the site until the year 2000. However, Chevron has recently indicated an interest in developing the parcel. Although the plans are very preliminary the eventual number of potential housing units could be significant. However, as of this report the timing of any development or scale remains unknown. Nevertheless, the City considers the parcel as a potentially significant housing resource. Other than this large parcel, the very few vacant properties in Montebello are small and not capable of providing significant housing opportunities.
4.	Vacant Parcel Inventory
There are very few vacant lots zoned for residential development in Montebello. A survey of vacant parcels throughout the residential zones was completed by City staff in June of 1991. It indicated that at that time there was a total of nine developable vacant parcels in Montebello which were residentially zoned. Of these nine vacant parcels, six were zoned for single family and three were zoned multi-family (apartments).
In the six vacant single family parcels, a maximum of 12 units could be developed. On the three multi-family parcels a maximum of 9 units could be developed. Therefore, if every vacant developable parcel were developed at maximum density, the total number of new units would be 21.
Vacant parcels were identified by staff through the use of the County Assessor's records and verified by field inspections. The County Assessor's records were used to identify every parcel with a land improvement value of less than $5,000. A threshold of $5,000 was used because parcels with such a
30
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element"
k
low land improvement value are presumed to be either vacant or possessing only very minimal improvements such as fencing, paving, etc. Once identified as potentially vacant and zoned residential, a field visit was conducted to verify {he Assessor's records and to confirm that the parcel was vacant and developable. Attached as Chapter 10 provides the list of developable vacant parcels.
5.	Regulatory Environment
In recognition of the many constraints facing home developers, the City has taken a number of steps to foster development while still protecting community standards. For example it utilizes the Uniform Building Code as its standard and thus reduces the uncertainty over acceptable building standards.
In terms of land use controls, such as lot coverage, setbacks, unit size, parking requirements, open space, and density, Montebello's standards are quite comparable and in many cases, less restrictive than those of surrounding communities. Provided, as Table No. 13 on page 33, is a copy of the City’s residential development standards. Given that approximately 100 new units are developed annually in a City with very limited infill potential, indicates that land use controls do not inhibit the construction of housing for any income group. Moreover, 25% of all new housing units built between 1984 -1989 were for very low and low-income tenants.
The City does not utilize design review boards. Discretionary projects undergo a review only for code compliance. Moreover, this review is done with the involvement of all affected departments (i.e. Fire, Public Works, Building). This insures a rapid and comprehensive review of projects and thus cost savings to the developer. Moreover, on average, development applications submitted to the Planning Department are scheduled for Planning Commission action within four weeks from the date they are deemed complete. This is extremely expeditious and a significant time and cost savings to prospective developers.
A one stop permit processing counter using a computerized parcel management system has been in operation in Montebello for several years. This speeds up the permit approval process and enhances coordination during review.
6.	Public Improvements
Since Montebello is a high urbanized city, where all new construction is infill,
31
City of Montebello *1989 Housing Element1
the City's public improvements requirements are very minimal. Typically, the site already has sidewalks, curbs, and gutters, therefore such improvements are not necessary. Additionally, the vast majority of streets have been widened to their maximum potential thus, developers are usually not required to provide additional right-of-way. Therefore, the need for public improvements are not an impediment to the development of new housing.
7.	Moderate Housing Development Fees
Table No. 14 on page 34 is a development fee comparison. All five cities compared to Montebello are within 10 miles. All are comparable in size and population to Montebello. The most populated is Alhambra with 73,000 persons and the least* is Bellflower with 56,000. As shown by Table No. 14 Montebello's development fee schedule is in line with its neighbors. Pico Rivera has the lowest fees. However, Pico Rivera is in the process of revising its fees upward. The park development fee, (also known as Quimby Fees) which is not listed on Table 14, is only $375 per unit. All other cities listed on Table 14 levy a higher park fee. More importantly, such a small park fee is not a deterrent to new housing. However, it does help to provide the necessary park funding residents need to have recreational opportunities. The City does Z not levy any other exaction fees.
8- Tax Increment Funds
The City of Montebello has two redevelopment project areas which must set-aside 20% of the tax increment monies generated. The 20% set-aside, per California redevelopment law must go toward the development, or preservation of housing affordable to households of low and moderate-income. Since 1986, the Montebello Community Redevelopment Agency has made an annual determination to defer its set-aside funds. As of 1989 the City of Montebello had approximately $6,000,000 set-aside. City staff has been working to develop a five year low and moderate-income housing plan using the 20% set-aside. However, recently the City hired a consultant to help develop a set of efficient and effective strategies and programs for spending its 20% set-aside for affordable housing. Among the options that the consultants are exploring include establishment of a local nonprofit housing development corporation, land banking, density bonus, first-time homeownership financing, construction of new rentals, purchasing existing rentals, rehabilitation of existing housing, emergency foreclosure and rent relief, land write-down, and mobile home park assistance.

City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element"
CHAPTER VI: THE HOUSING PLAN
Below is the City's 1989 - 1994 Housing Plan. Policies, goals, programs, and objectives, relative to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing are discussed. These policies, goals, programs, and objectives are reflective of the housing need, constraints, and resources available to satisfy the needs identified in this Housing Element. The plan also reflects and incorporates the lessons learned from previous housing elements in 1981 and 1984. The following policies will guide the City of Montebello's efforts in addressing housing concerns within the community.
Fundamentally the City of Montebello seeks to enhance the quality of life for all its residents by assuring the availability of safe and decent housing. It is the City's intent to take all reasonable and feasible steps to achieve this goal during the 1989 - 1994 time period and the years thereafter.
The City's five major housing policies are as follows:
(1)	To encourage the provision of housing for all economic segments of the community;
(2)	To preserve existing housing, neighborhoods and the residential character of the community while providing for orderly growth to accommodate the future housing needs of the community;
(3)	To assure housing accessibility free of discrimination;
(4)	To conserve and increase fhe supply of affordable housing for low and moderate-income households; and
(5)	To develop standards and plans to ensure that adequate sites exist throughout the City for various types of housing.
As mentioned previously, the City of Montebello has a very limited amount of land available for development and/or redevelopment. The essentially "built-out" nature of the community and the limited fiscal resources available, necessitates that primary emphasis be the maintenance and improvement of the existing housing stock. Such programs would be designed to give maximum benefit to low and moderate-income persons and families, and are anticipated to provide the most effective use of limited resources.
Many of the specific objectives and policies will necessarily focus upon promoting and facilitating private sector development in a manner consistent with the General Plan, zoning code and other applicable standards for development. For example, the housing needs of
35
City of Montebello ”1989 Housing Element”
upper and middle-income residents will largely be provided through the private sector. < j However, lower income households will probably require assistance through a combination of public and private efforts and resources.
In addition to promoting private sector development, the City will pursue applicable state and federal programs designed to meet specific housing needs, including but not limited to those described in this Housing Element. The City will continue to support and facilitate the development of new housing construction and maintain the availability of existing housing, especially for the elderly, handicapped, low and moderate-income, large families and families with single heads of household. New construction of affordable housing for the elderly, handicapped and other special need groups will continue to be encouraged and supported through non-profit sponsors. Given the fiscal constraints on local government, the implementation of this aspect of the plan will depend upon the availability of state and/or federal assistance programs. However, the tack of state and federal assistance, and other constraints, will severely limit the ability of the City to meet all the identified housing needs. Nevertheless, the City will actively pursue applications for such programs.
The following plan provides an action program the City is undertaking and/or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the goals and objectives of the Housing Element. This plan will be implemented through administration of the City’s land use and development controls, regulatory concessions, market incentives, and use of appropriate ,	,
federal, state, and local financing programs when available. The plan is reflective of potential and actual private and governmental constraints, a continuation of successful existing policies and or new policies when necessary. Unless noted otherwise, the City of Montebello will be the agency responsible for the implementation of this action program.
A.	PROVISION FOR HOUSING POLICY
It shall be the policy of the City of Montebello to make all necessary and appropriate provisions for the development of housing for all economic segments of the community.
1.	Goa/s
a)	The availability of safe, sanitary and decent housing for all segments of the community;
b)	The provision of a range of housing selection, location, type, price and tenure; and
c)
The availability of housing to meet the special needs of groups including but not limited to the elderly and the handicapped.
36
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element"
e)	California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA)
The City has twice applied for participation in the CHFA range of programs, which include loans to low and moderate-income families for major rehabilitation and purchase/rehab of single family structures. Both of these applications were turned down by the state due to a ’’lack of need". The City intends, however, to continue to apply to the program.
f)	Mortgage Revenue Bonds
Mortgage revenue bonds are allocated by the state to cities with qualifying construction projects. Through this program, eligible first time home buyers may obtain a loan to purchase a housing unit at a below market rate interest level. In 1984, the City of Montebello and the City of Oxnard formed the Montebello-Oxnard Housing Finance Agency for the purpose of issuing single-family residential mortgage revenue bonds. To date, none of these bonds have been used in Montebello due to a decline in market interest rates for housing finance since 1984, and the issue was redeemed in December 1987. However, the City will continue to participate in this type of bond program when feasible given market interest rate performance.
g)	New Construction of Subsidized Housing for the Elderly and
Handicapped
The construction of 130 units of elderly and handicapped housing was completed on October 31, 1986. The site for this development was provided to the project by the City at no direct cost to the developer through a long term loan, deferred for 40 years. Part of this site was formerly acquired by the City for right-of-way purposes and had been declared in excess, and the City actively purchased additional land specifically with the intent to provide a site suitable for such housing. The City will continue to endeavor to match developers with parcels and funding for such projects, when available. It is anticipated that redevelopment project area tax increment will be used to further these efforts.
h)	Multi-Family Bond Program - Los Angeles County
This program, which involves loans from private lenders, was implemented in cooperation with the County of Los Angeles to increase the supply of rental housing which must provide at least 20% of the
39
City of Montebello ”1989 Housing Element”
development's units as affordable housing for low to moderate-income households.
i)	Second Unit Construction
Since July 1, 1983, the City has operated under the procedures of SB 1534 (Mello) which provides for the construction of second units on lots in the single family residential zones. Second units may be constructed in Montebello, subject to approval of a conditional use permit The conditional use permit criteria in effect are consistent with the provisions contained in the state statute.
3. Objectives
a)
b)
c)
d)
e)
A comprehensive affordable housing strategy;
640 annual code enforcement actions;
Consistency between the General Plan and zoning;
Sale of City-owned parcels for residential redevelopment as available; and
Construction of 951 new units by the private market based on the RHNA (see Table No. 15 on page 41 for the quantitative objective by income category).
As stated previously, the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) prepared by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) indicates a "need” for an additional 951 dwelling units by 1994. It should be noted that only 839 of the 951 units would be a net increase to the housing stock, the other 112 units would be new units replacing previously existing units demolished in conjunction with new development. Of the 839 total units, 294 will go towards satisfying new household growth, and 545 will be to bring the vacancy rate to an "ideal" level.
The City would question the figure of 545 units necessary to bring the vacancy rate to an "ideal" level. The 545 figure is a direct result of Montebello being assigned a 0.4% vacancy rate. This vacancy rate is not consistent with other vacancy rates studies which are available. For example, the Department of Finance, Demographic Research Unit, published a report on April 25, 1989, stating the vacancy rate in Montebello on January 1, 1989, was 2.75%. The Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning published a report on June 10,1989 indicating that on July 1,1988 the vacancy rate in Montebello was 2.97%.
The City's largest amount of vacant land is in the northern hills. Although currently utilized for oil production the property owner of the subject site (Chevron USA) is in the process of

2. Programs
a)	Affordable Housing Strategy
Montebello has hired a consultant to assist the City to develop an Affordable Housing Strategy. The purpose of the consultant study is to establish a strategy for the most efficient and effective use of the tax increment monies available for affordable housing as a result of the City’s redevelopment projects. Under California Redevelopment law a minimum of 20% of the tax increment monies generated by redevelopment must be spent on the development or preservation of housing for low and moderate-income households. The strategy will examine a variety of methods and issues, including, but not limited to:
i.	establishment of a local nonprofit housing development corporation;
ii.	land banking;
iii.	density bonus;
iv.	first-time homeownership;
V.	construction of new rentals, purchasing existing rentals;
vi.	rehabilitation of existing housing;
vii.	emergency foreclosure and rent relief;
viii.	land write-down; and
ix.	mobile home park assistance.
Code Enforcement	
The City has long maintained an aggressive program of code enforcement to preserve and protect existing neighborhoods against the harmful effects of * deterioration caused by neglect and deferred maintenance. In addition, a property maintenance ordinance (PMO) has been adopted to allow code enforcement personnel to abate specific conditions on private property as a public nuisance. In 1988, some of these violations which are transitory in nature were designated as infractions so as to facilitate enforcement through the issuance of
37
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element1
citations when appropriate and after warnings. The City has also initiated a City Prosecutor program to further enhance the effectiveness of this program over the next five years.
c)	General Plan/Zoning Consistency
As indicated in Chapter II, the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance are not consistent with respect to total population .in Montebello. The Zoning Ordinance would allow a maximum population of approximately 80,000 while the General Plan calls for a population of 70,000. This potential inconsistency has been addressed through the General Plan/Zoning consistency study.
Essentially, the previous development standards were not consistent with the General Plan policy guidelines. Given that the General Plan is the policy document based on an overall analysis, (i.e., infrastructure, water, sewers, circulation, etc.) and that zoning is just one of many implementing tools, the General Plan must prevail where an inconsistency arises. This position is consistent with state planning law. Moreover, the General Plan unlike the Zoning Ordinance, is a product of public participation and therefore, a reflection of the democratic process.
The results of the General Plan/Zoning Consistency study is that approximately 2,000 to 4,000 additional units could be added through new infill developments. These new units would be scattered through the City and do not include any development of the Montebello Hills. As a result of the study, the City possesses the ability to indicate the additional housing capacity of every block within the jurisdiction. Based on the General Plan/Zoning Consistency Program the City could accommodate the SCAG Regional Housing Allocation of 951 new units.
d)	Sale of City-Owned Parcels for Residential Redevelopment
During the period of 1984 through 1987, fifty-nine (59) dwelling units were developed on several parcels purchased and sold by the City and Redevelopment Agency. These were remnant parcels from land acquired for the widening of Montebello Boulevard and other surplus property. The City will continue to identify any opportunities to make surplus property available for future development.
38
City of Montebello ”1989 Housing Element”
preparing a specific plan for the development of this 500 acre parcel. During preliminary discussions the landowner has proposed to build 2,000 housing units over a three phased development. However, at this time it is not possible to know exactly what number of units will be built, nor the timing of that development.
Other than the northern hills area, new construction in the City during 1989 - 1994 will be accomplished primarily by the residential redevelopment of underdeveloped residential property. Vacant land within the City (other than the parcel discussed above) is very scarce and new development during the next five years will continue to be limited to infill projects.
Based on this analysis, quantified objectives for the development of new housing units during this period are indicated by Table No. 15. These objectives are consistent with projected housing need as derived from the RHNA.

41
City of Montebello ”1989 Housing Element”
2.	Programs
The City's Home Improvement and Preservation Program has been developed and implemented over the last ten years. It is a multi-tiered program, designed to impact all levels of need within the low and moderate-income housing community. Benefits also accrue to residents of the non low and moderate-income community from the upgrading of individual parcels as well as the overall improvements made to neighborhoods. It shall be the City's policy to continue and expand upon the various components of the program outlined below, within the bounds of funding availability and demonstrated need. The major components of this program include the following:
a)
Single Family Rehabilitations: The City, through the use of Community Development Block Grant money, provides rehabilitation funds to qualified family homeowners. In order to qualify, a homeowner must be at 80%, or less, of the median income as defined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The program can provide two funding types — loans and/or grants. Loans range from $10,000 to $15,000 for a maximum term of 15 years at 3% interest. Those low and moderate-income applicants who do not qualify for a low interest Ioan may qualify for a deferred loan which can be repaid at the time the home is sold or the property is transferred. If necessary, a low and moderate-income homeowner may be eligible for a grant. Grants are provided in cases where the money needed for repairs exceeds the maximum loan allocated by the financing process. Grants range from as little as $500 to a maximum of $3,000. Whether the homeowner receives a low interest loan, deferred loan or grant, the purpose of the rehabilitation program is to provide funding for major home repairs and/or room additions to relieve overcrowding. The City intends to process 38 loans and grants annually between 1989-1994.
b)	Rental Rehabilitation: The rental rehabilitation program is designed to maintain the affordable rental housing stock in safe, sanitary, and decent condition. In return for the subsidized loan, the property owner agrees to a list of conditions relating to property management, no overcrowding of units and general upkeep. The City intends to rehabilitate 12 units per year from 1989-1994.
c)
Handyman Services Program: This program addresses itself to minor repairs and painting of homes owned by low and moderate-income owners of single-family homes. The City plans to provide assistance to 40 single family homeowners annually.
42
City of Montebello ”1989 Housing Element
d)	Property Maintenance/Code Enforcement: For a program description please see page 37.
e)	Neighborhood Strategy Areas: The City of Montebello was the first community in Southern California to achieve Neighborhood Strategy Area (NSA) status for concentrated neighborhood revitalization in a predominantly low and moderate-income residential area. Activities such as street improvements and repairs, the installation of infill street lights, curb and gutter repairs, sidewalk repair, provision of curb cuts for the handicapped, fire hydrant installation, and tree planting were concentrated so as to have maximum impact. The first program was followed up with projects in two additional neighborhoods, with funding for these programs totaling nearly $700,000. The City will continue
- pursuing These projects toward the goal of alleviating all such neighborhood-wide deterioration.
f)	Graffiti Removal: The City includes graffiti as an abatable public nuisance under its property maintenance ordinance. The seriousness with which the City regards graffiti is evidenced by its ongoing funding of a graffiti removal program through the City’s annual CDBG program, as well as supplementation of that program through the General Fund. The City intends to continue the programs as long as funding is available and the need exists.
g)	Monitoring of Housing Element by City Council, Planning Commission and staff.
3.	Objectives
a)	640 annual code enforcement actions;
b)	120 units of residential graffiti removal annually, or as many as necessary;
c)	12 units of rental rehabilitation per year (see Table No. 16 on page 44);
d)	38 single family rehabilitation loans and grants per year (see Table No. 16);
e)	40 handyman services per year (see Table No. 16); and
f)	Annual update on progress made toward implementation of the Housing Element to the Planning Commission and City Council.

C.	HOUSING ACCESSIBILITY POLICY
It shall be the policy of the City of Montebello to eliminate, to the extent feasible, all barriers to the accessibility of housing in the City.
1. Goafs
a)
The provision of housing opportunities free from discrimination based upon such arbitrary factors as race, color, creed, sex, age, family size, religion, national origin, marital status, or handicaps; and
44
City of Montebello ”1989 Housing Element"
b)	Increase community awareness of available housing programs and services and encourage participation.
2.	Programs
a)	Fair Housing Education: The City of Montebello has a Fair Housing Program designed to limit discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, national origin, handicap, gender, or creed. To assist the City in implementing its plan, the City has an agreement with the Fair Housing Council of San Gabriel Valley. This agency investigates allegations of housing discrimination, educates the public as to their rights under the law, and provides assistance to persons seeking rental housing. In the two years during which the City has had an agreement with this agency, the Fair Housing Council has provided this service to the community. The City plans to continue providing these services through the Fair Housing Council.
b)	Housing Mediation Board: In December 1982, the Montebello City Council approved the establishment of a Housing Mediation Board to mediate disputes between rental property owners and tenants. Mediation hearings are conducted privately with trained mediators assisting the parties involved in the dispute to reach a voluntary private agreement. Since its inception, the Board has successfully processed over 400 cases.
The program has also handled 1,465 direct inquiries during the last two years. The inquiries included questions regarding evictions, rental deposits, health and safety matters, rent increases, and other issues related to rental housing. The City plans to continue providing these services through the Housing Mediation Board.
c)	Mailing to Every Household of Available Housing Programs: The City will mail to every household information regarding all available housing programs offered by the City of Montebello.
d)	Orientation meeting for persons interested in the single family
rehabilitation program: The City will continue to hold monthly meetings for homeowners interested in participating in the single family homeowner rehabilitation program.
45
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element"
3.	Objectives
a)	Fair housing workshops by the San Gabriel Valley Housing Council to the students of the Montebello Unified School District, and to the Montebello business community.
b)	Investigation of alleged housing discrimination by the Fair Housing Council, and referral to the proper state/federal agency if warranted.
c)	Annual mailing to every household in Montebello explaining and listing every available housing program.
d)	Monthly meeting for persons interested in the single family rehabiliU 1 program.
e)	Survey of Montebello households to determine the amount of housing discrimination.
D.	CONSERVATION OF AFFORDABILITY POLICY
The City has various programs designed to conserve the affordability of housing units, one of which is the Housing Mediation Program. This program brings together tenants, landlords, and trained mediators whenever a renter believes a rent increase is excessive. Upon receiving a petition, staff notes the base rent, the requested rent increase amount and the geographic location of the unit. Using the above factors as criteria staff analyzed the results of housing mediation. The results are that over a ten year period the program has conserved affordable housing for persons of very low, low and moderate-incomes. On average 45 cases are successfully mediated annually. Staff estimates that the percentage break down is approximately 33% for each of the three income categories (very low, low and moderate-income). Therefore, Montebello anticipates that housing mediation will continue to conserve 15 units annually as affordable under each income category. Thus over a five year period, the housing mediation program would conserve 75 affordable housing dwelling units for each of the above three income categories. Table No. 17 on the following page summarizes affordable housing conservation goals of the Housing Mediation Program.
A nonprofit housing corporation that will be in operation by January 1993, has set a goal of assisting 10 moderate/above moderate income families annually purchase their first home. Under the program guidelines, the City will match the down payment from a qualified resident toward the purchase of a moderately priced home. Therefore, as is also indicated by Table No. 17, the City expects that the first time home buyers program will conserve 20 dwelling units as affordable to moderate/above moderate income families.

Additionally, the nonprofit housing corporation has set a goal of assisting 10 very low and low income families annually who face eviction due to job loss, medical catastrophe, etc. Both tenants and home owners will be eligible for this program. As shown by Table No. 17 above, the City expects that the emergency relief program will conserve 20 dwelling units as affordable to very low and low income families.
It shall be the policy of the City of Montebello to conserve those units which are classified as affordable to persons of low and moderate-incomes.
1.	Goals
a)	The development and implementation of housing programs which maintain the continued affordability of units in the future;
b)	Preservation and maintenance of the existing, affordable housing stock;
c)	Pursuit of programs and funding sources and adoption of policies which allow for continued affordability of housing units; and
d)	Foster cooperation between private enterprise and public agencies and commissions to provide a full range of housing for ail segments of the community.

Annual examination of the procedures and fees charged for processing of all development proposals to insure said fees are reflective of the actual cost of processing and that unnecessary procedures are eliminated.
One-stop processing for review of development proposals.
Condominium Conversion: Regulation of conversion of existing, multiple-dwelling units into air space condominiums, provides an opportunity for affordable homeownership. To insure that such units are suitable for individual ownership, the City requires each dwelling unit, and the structure being converted, to meet all current building condominium conversion standards. Most of the existing affordable housing in the City was developed prior to the adoption of the current condominium conversion standards. This effectively limits the potential for widespread conversion of affordable housing to more expensive condominium development.
Mobilehome Park Conservation: The City is investigating alternative methods which would assist the 250 mobilehome owners become landowners rather than rent the space their mobilehome occupies. As housing costs increase, mobilehome parks offer increasingly affordable

housing units for low and moderate-income households. It is the City's intent to conserve all of these units if possible.
n) Preservation of "At-Risk" Units: There are three apartment complexes in Montebello that have affordability restrictions-Villa Margarita, Beverly Towers, and Casa La Merced. Chapter Eleven provides a complete at-risk analysis as required by state law. Essentially, none of the three apartment complexes are at-risk within the time frame of this Housing Element (July 1989 - June 1994).

F.	Land Use Policies And Programs
1.	Introduction
Land use policy is only one method by which housing can be accommodated; albeit a critical method. This chapter provides a discussion and analysis of the City's current land use policies and programs. The purpose of this chapter is to provide land use policy and program direction related to housing development. The land use policies are intended to encourage, promote, and provide for the development of various housing types. Land use policies are also geared towards the removal of regulatory barriers that may preclude the development of housing, where those impediments may exist.

In addition to the introduction, this chapter also contains a land use policy principle. The principle sets the framework from which individual policies and programs are developed. The principle is proceeded by a series of individual policy declarations. The policy declarations are followed by a description of programs in support of the policy, and by a discussion of program's implementation.
2.	Land Use Policy Principle
It shall be the City of Montebello's policy to establish and maintain land use regulations, guidelines, codes, and programs that encourage and promote the development of housing for all economic segments of the community.
a)	Policy
The City of Montebello's policy is to encourage and promote the development of a variety of housing types, including second units.
i)	Program Description: Second Unit
Pursuant to State government code, section 65852, et seq. x (planning and zoning law) a second unit can be developed on a parcel zoned for single family housing. Second units can be
52
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element
k
k
either "granny" units, wherein the second unit must house a person 62 years old or older, or a housing unit free of tenancy restrictions. California law allows municipal governments to develop their own ordinance in order to implement this state law, or to use the existing state guidelines. Under state law, a local government may completely prevent second units from being developed, provided certain specific findings are made.
ii)	Program Implementation
To encourage and facilitate the development of both types of second units, the City of Montebello currently utilizes state guidelines as its criteria when evaluating a second unit application. Hence, Montebello does not impose additional requirements or standards above and beyond those permitted under state law. In Montebello, development of a second unit is subject to the approval of a conditional use permit (CUP). It is the City’s assessment that using state guidelines facilitates the development of second units by not imposing additional requirements and by not discouraging second unit applications. More importantly though is the fact that the City of Montebello has not elected to pursue its prerogative under state law to completely ban all second units.
To date all second unit development applications received by the City of Montebello have been approved . The applications were approved without the additional parking and open space typically required of a second unit under the Montebello Municipal Zoning Code. The City's policy shall, on a case by case basis, continue to be to support approval of second units without requiring additional parking or open space. In order to promote second units, the City will make a flyer available effective November 1, 1993, describing the second unit program at the front counter of the Planning Department. As in the past City staff will continue to speak before local realtor groups regarding the second unit program. Additionally, staff has scheduled a meeting with a private firm specializing in the development of second units. The purpose of the meeting is for staff and the firm to exchange ideas about how to effectively facititate and implement a second unit program.
53
City of Montebello *1989 Housing Element"
b)
Policy
The City’s policy is to encourage the development of housing on all parcels suitable for residential development.

i)	* Program Description: Planned Unit Development (PUD)
A PUD is both a type or method of development and a zoning classification that allows the adoption of a set of development standards that are site/project specific. Essentially, a PUD is a tract of land absolved from conventional zoning to allow clustering or other non-conventional types of residential development The development plan in a PUD constitutes the zoning restrictions for that particular property. Since irregular shaped or substandard parcels are often difficult to develop within the existing zoning code framework, the PUD option is a viable alternative method of providing the necessary legal and regulatory flexibility required to develop such lots.
ii)	Program Implementation
To further encourage the development of housing on irregular, small and/or otherwise substandard parcels, the City permits the use of Planned Unit Development (PUD) overlay zoning. Under / v the Montebello zoning code, a townhome residential PUD does not have a minimum or maximum lot size requirement. However, for commercial or industrial PUDs the minimum parcel size is three acres. Therefore, the City’s residential PUD regulations are much more flexible than those for commercial or industrial PUD guidelines. The code was specifically written without a minimum lot size for residential PUDs in order to encourage the development of housing.
iii)	Program Description: Parcel Merger Ordinance
California planning and zoning law, Section 66451, et. seq., allows for the merger of contiguous parcels so long as the parcels are under one owner. State law also allows the City to develop a local ordinance that would allow for the merging of two substandard parcels provided the lots are owned by the same individual. The purpose of the state law is to provide for the development of land that may not otherwise be developable.
iv)
Program Implementation
Recently, the City of Montebello amended its parcel merger ordinance to be consistent with the State Subdivision Map Act as described above. Prior to this amendment, the City's parcel
54
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element"
merger procedure was not consistent with the current Subdivision Map Act. The parcel merger ordinance was amended in order to facilitate the development of housing on two substantial parcels. One of the substandard parcels was previously City owned. The new owner is currently in the process of preparing a development plan application.
c)	Policy
The City’s policy is to encourage residential development in areas designated as boulevard commercial on the land use element map of the Montebello General Plan.
i)	Program Description: Residential Development Along Commercial Areas.
The City of Montebello allows residential development in areas designated boulevard commercial in the land use element map of the General Plan. According to the land use element, boulevard commercial areas are designated to accommodate "development along major streets which consist primarily of stores but also includes offices, institutions, and multi-family residents." The City's policy with respect to density along major commercial corridors is to permit a wide range in multi-family housing density, from as low as R-2 (medium density) to R-4 (very high density).
Per the general plan, approximately 130 acres of land in Montebello are designated boulevard commercial. Of these 130 acres, approximately 17 acres are currently developed with housing at high or very high densities. Multi-family housing developed within the last five years along commercial corridors has all been constructed at very high density (R-4). Given the expense of land (approximately $30.00 per square foot) located on major commercial corridors, the high to very high residential density development is not unexpected.
ii)	Program Implementation
To encourage and further promote housing along these commercial corridors, the City has entered into discussions with two developers. One developer currently has a single room occupancy (SRO) hotel on the second floor of a commercial building. However, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake severely damaged that building. Therefore, the owner has expressed an interest in replacing the entire building, including the SRO, with a new building. However, since the building is
55
City of Montebello *1989 Housing Element”
non-conforming due to a lack of parking, the owner would be required to provide substantial additional parking for the new conforming building. The new development standards appear to make replacement of the SRO hotel extremely unlikely.
To preserve this component of the housing stock, the City has agreed to consider preparation of a Specific Plan that would essentially enable the property owner to develop a new building that includes the same number of SRO units without providing new additional parking. The SRO portion of the building would be built at a very high density.
A second potential multi-family residential development along a commercial corridor concerns a possible senior citizen housing project. The subject three acre site is currently developed with a car dealership. The property owner had originally proposed to replace the dealership with a car service center. Subsequently, the City's Planning and Redevelopment Departments approached the property owner regarding the possibility of developing a very high density senior citizen project. Based on preliminary discussions, the property owner officially withdrew his car service center application.
To further encourage the property owner, City staff provided the property owner with a tour of other comparable senior citizen projects and with references to possit =5 architects within the greater Los Angeles area. The propt / owner has hired an architect and is currently working with tr?<# City's Redevelopment Agency regarding possible public financial assistance. The City is prepared to process the necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, including the development of a specific plan, and to provide financial assistance if such assistance is deemed necessary and appropriate.
d)	Policy
The City of Montebello's policy is to utilize redevelopment funds to promote and encourage the development of housing and housing programs.
i) Program Description: Land Acquisition
The City's Redevelopment Agency, on its own or through the Montebello Housing Corporation, will purchase and develop property suitable for multi-family housing construction.
56
City of Montebello *7959 Housing Element"
ii) Program Implementation
The Redevelopment Agency recently purchased a vacant 13,000 square foot parcel using a portion of its 20% redevelopment set-aside money. The lot is zoned for multi-family development. The Redevelopment Agency is in the process of preparing a request for proposals from housing developers to construct affordable housing on the subject property. The Redevelopment Agency has for a number of years owned a second 13,000 square foot lot that also is suitable for multi-family housing development. Although the lot size is significant, the lot's width at 44 feet is substandard. However, the City is prepared to favorably consider a PUD or other planning mechanism that would provide relief from the zoning code in order to accommodate the development of affordable housing. This project will be undertaken upon completion of the previously mentioned project.
Please see other sections of the Housing Element for a description of other programs using 20% redevelopment set-aside funds.
e)	Policy
The City's policy is to ensure consistency between its land use element, including the land use map, and the zoning ordinance.
i) Program Description: General Plan/Zoning Consistency
The purpose of the general plan/zoning consistency program is three-fold: 1) to identify all areas of the city in which there is an inconsistency between the land use element of the general plan, including the land use map, and zoning ordinance; 2) to resolve such inconsistencies; and 3) to streamline the development application process.
General plan and zoning ordinance consistency is required under California Planning and Zoning law. Where there is an inconsistency, the Planning Commission and City Council cannot approve a development project because California law requires a finding that projects be consistent with the General Plan. Therefore, resolving inconsistencies is an important component of providing the regulatory framework necessary to accommodate the development of housing.
Through the elimination of inconsistencies, potential housing developers would not incur delays related to the processing of the
57
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element"
necessary regulatory framework (i.e., zone changes, plan amendments, specific plan). Hence, property owners and developers will know up-front the development potential of a given site.
Program Implementation
In phase one of the general plan/zoning consistency program, 16 sub-areas in which the general plan and zoning ordinance were not consistent were identified. Phase one was completed in 1992. During phase two, currently underway, the 16 sub-areas identified as having inconsistencies will undergo revision In their general plan designation and or zoning classification in order to bring about consistency. To date, two of the 16 sub-area inconsistencies have been resolved.
There are two inconsistent sub-areas where the potential exists for additional new housing. Since the direction of the City Council is to preserve the integrity of the general plan, preliminary indications suggest that both sub-areas will eventually accommodate multi-family residential. However, any action affecting development rights will require City Council approval.
By resolving inconsistencies, the City will streamline the development application process thereby, eliminating delays related to processing zone changes or plan amendments in those parts of the City in which the general plan and zoning are not consistent. Moreover, as the General Plan/Zoning Consistency Program is City initiated, the zone change or plan amendment costs are borne by the City not the developer.
In summary, through the elimination of such inconsistencies, the City will be in a position to make favorable determinations on potential housing development applications. Consequently, the time delays usually associated with a zone change or plan amendment will be eliminated. Property owners and developers will know up-front the development potential of a given site, and that the costs of processing the regulatory changes are borne by the City.

CHAPTER VII: CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
The Housing Element revision process was explicitly designed to reflect maximum feasible citizen participation. This participation has been solicited and encouraged through the following:
a)	Three study sessions with the Planning Commission were conducted. The Commission reviewed the adequacy of the existing element and the need for revision based upon the latest available data and changed conditions within the community;
b)	A noticed public hearing was held before the Planning Commission. In addition, standard required citizen notification procedures were followed;
c)	A noticed public hearing was scheduled before the City Council prior to the draft Revised Housing Element being submitted to the State Department of Housing and Community Development for the required 45-day review period. A second public hearing was held to consider adoption of the revised Housing Element subsequent to consideration of advisory comments by the state; and
d)	Study session with the Planning Commission to review progress towards meeting the goals of the Housing Element will continue to be conducted. These meetings were noticed to solicit participation.
59
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element"
CHAPTER VIII: GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
The Montebello General Plan was adopted in March of 1973. The Plan consists of the following 11 elements: Land Use, Circulation, Population, Housing, Parks end Recreation, Open Space, Redevelopment, Conservation, Noise, Scenic Highway, Seismic Safety and Safety. The City is currently in the process of revising the Housing Element of the General Plan.
Development patterns in the City are guided by the Land Use Element of the General Plan. Montebello's current Land Use Element augments and supports the Housing Element. The Land Use Element responds to the community's needs through development and application of density standards through the Zoning Ordinance which limit population. It allows for a variety of housing types controlled by location to complement single-family, residential areas. The Element also provides for adequate commercial development and growth and development of industrial area to give balance to the residential community.
The Circulation Element provides for the orderly flow of traffic within the community. Particular attention is given to limiting through traffic in residential neighborhoods. This serves to preserve the integrity of the residential community.
The Population Element acknowledges the limitations to growth within Montebello resulting from limited available land for residential development and constraints on the infrastructure necessary to support more growth. It provides for orderly, planned growth of the City and maintenance of high service levels to residents. This element also recognizes the ethnic diversity within this community with the goal of providing public facilities and programs designed to serve the diversified needs of city residents.
The Parks and Recreation and Open Space Elements are designed to provide play and open space to all residents of the community. The City is dommitted to enhancing the quality of life for its residents by assuring easy accessibility to parks and leisure activities. This philosophy of the City is consistent with the Housing Element as it increases the viability of neighborhoods by giving balance to the aesthetic and leisure needs of residents, while also increasing the stability of neighborhoods. The Conservation Element also gives consideration to preserving the environment as a means of preserving the quality of life.
The Redevelopment Element is particularly compatible with the revised Housing Element. It addresses the need for the continued identification of declining land use characteristics, including residential, and the development of programs to address such problems. This Element also encourages neighborhood revitalization programs and continuous evaluation of the needs, problems, and condition of housing within the City.
The Noise Element seeks to mitigate the detrimental effects of continuous exposure of the residents to harmful or offensive noise levels.
60
City of Montebello ”1989 Housing Element1
Although there are no state-designated scenic highways in Montebello, there is a need to / j preserve scenic vistas from future housing development in hillside areas. This need should be addressed as future development occurs pursuant to the Montebello Hills master plan.
The Seismic Safety and Safety Elements, much like the Noise Element, seek to protect the residents, to the extent possible, from loss of life and injury from natural hazards.
The revised Housing Element is consistent with Montebello's adopted General Plan elements. The Housing Element seeks to enhance the quality of life for all residents. The primary goal of the Element is to assure the continued desirability of Montebello as a residential community. It also seeks to assure the continued availability of a range of housing types to meet the needs of the entire community.

CHAPTER IX: ENERGY CONSERVATION
The City of Montebello recognizes the need to conserve energy, our physical resources and the quality of lifewithrn the environment. The City continually reviews its policies relative to energy and environmental concerns and its physical operations to incorporate new, innovative methods for energy conservation.
Fuel cost and the potential for gas shortages in the future could place limitations on the use of the passenger automobile as the primary method of transportation. Montebello's proximity to downtown Los Angeles, a major employment center, and accessibility to nearby industrial areas, makes it an ideal location for limited use of the automobile. The City also maintains a modern mass transit system which provides connector service to major employment centers.
The City operates a Municipal Transit System with regularly scheduled bus service throughout the community and extending to surrounding communities and to downtown Los Angeles. The City supports greater use of mass transportation. The beneficial effects are many, and specifically from an energy standpoint, include at least the following: t) prolonged availability of fossil fuels for other uses with decreased gasoline consumption; and, 2) improved air quality with fewer cars contributing to pollution.
The City actively supports preservation of its existing housing and neighborhoods, including the voluntary retrofit of solar and solar-assisted energy sources. Increased longevity of the structures diminishes the need for new development in other areas, thus preserving available land space. Cost effective solar installations, including, but not limited to, water and swimming pool heaters, would aid in energy conservation.
Controlled traffic patterns have been instituted to prevent heavy commercial and industrial vehicular use of residential neighborhoods. These steps were undertaken to protect residents from excessive noise levels and disruption of the aesthetic quality of each neighborhood. An active Neighborhood Improvement Program supports enforcement of these steps.
Measures have also been taken to mitigate the effects of traffic pollutants and excessive noise levels generally associated with heavy industrial uses. To the maximum degree feasible, industrial developments have been sited to provide buffers between industrial and residential uses, or measures have been taken to mitigate the effects of existing development patterns (e.g. installation of the Sycamore Avenue sound wall). When it is not possible to provide buffers to industrial uses, the industrial users are required to take reasonable precautions not to intrude upon the residential areas.
The provision of parks and open space is high on the list of City priorities. Open, green areas are critical to a well-balanced and aesthetically pleasing environment within urban
62
City of Montebello ”1989 Housing Element”
centers. Parks contribute substantially to the environment for Montebello residents. To the * V degree that capital and operational fiscal constraints permit, the proximity of parks to residential areas will be supported.
The City will use its resources and influence to increase the awareness of its residents to the need for energy conservation measures within the home and make resources available to support energy saving installations. City staff will continue to keep abreast of innovative energy conservation methods for the home and distribute this information within the community. Particular attention will be given to instituting energy conserving measures which contribute to the extended life of energy resources.

CHAPTER XI: EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL OR CURRENT RENT RESTRICTED LOW-INCOME HOUSING UNITS
INTRODUCTION
This report amends the Montebello General Plan Housing Element adopted in July 1989. The purpose of this amendment is to bring the Housing Element into compliance with a recent amendment of housing element law, codified in Government Code Section 65583. Under this law, jurisdictions must evaluate the potential for current rent restricted low-income housing units to convert to non-low income housing, and develop programs to preserve or replace those units.
Consistent with State requirements, this report consists of the following five parts:
I.	An inventory of the City's restricted low-income housing projects and their potential for conversion to market rate housing units;
II.	An analysis of the costs of preserving and/or replacing the "at-risk" units;
III.	Resources for preservation;
IV.	Quantified objectives for the number of "at-risk" units to be preserved; and
V.	Programs for preserving the "at-risk" units.
A.	Inventory Of Units At-Risk Of Losing Government Subsidies
1.	Period of Analysis
The at-risk period of analysis covered by this Housing Element is the ten year period beginning July 1, 1989, and ending June 30, 1999. However, the ten-year analysis is further divided into two five-year periods: 1) July 1, 1989 -June 30, 1994; and 2) July 1, 1994 -June 30,1999.
2.	Projects At-Risk
Table No. 21 on the following page provides an inventory of the City's at-risk units. As shown on Table No. 21A on page 66, there are two subsidized rental buildings in Montebello that are at-risk-Villa Margarita and Beverly Towers. The at-risk inventory list was compiled from interviews with City staff, the Los Angeles County Housing Authority, Department of Housing and Urban
65
City of Montebello *1989 Housing Element*
Development (HUD), a review of "Inventory of Federally Subsidized Low-Income Rental Units at Risk of Conversion" (California Housing Partnership Corporation), and "The Use of Housing Revenue Bond Proceeds" - 1990 (California Debt Advisory Commission). The inventory includes all multi-family rental units assisted through federal, state, and/or local programs, including HUD programs, state and local bond programs, redevelopment programs, and local in-lieu fee, inclusionary, density bonus, or direct assistance programs.

3.	Description of At-Risk Projects
a) Villa Margarita
Villa Margarita is a 19 year old apartment complex consisting of three autonomous buildings that contain a total of 28 two-bedroom units. The entire complex provides housing to 28 very low-income families. A professional property management company manages the Villa Margarita apartment complex and maintains the complex in excellent physical condition. Each two-bedroom unit has approximately 1,000 square feet of living area.
66
City of Montebello *1989 Housing Element"
b) Beverly Towers
Beverly Towers is a 189 unit senior citizens building. Of the 189 units, 133 are bachelors and 56 are one-bedroom units. The two types of units range in size from 290 to 540 square feet. Even though the building is 17 years old, the professional property management firm responsible for Beverly Towers* maintenance, keeps the building’s interior and exterior in superb condition.
4- Conversion Potential: Phase One (July 1989 - June 1994)
a)	Villa Margarita
Villa Margarita will be at-risk of conversion as eariy as March 1994, due to the potential for prepayment of its HUD 236(J)(1) Interest Reduction Mortgage loan. This conversion date is within Phase One and is covered by this Housing Element. However, according to HUD records as of April 1,1993, the owners, TSE Incorporate, have not filed a Notice of Intent to change or terminate the project's affordability control. Given that the Notice of Intent must be filed two years prior to conversion of the units, the HUD 236(J)(1) subsidy will not be at- risk until at least April 1, 1995. Therefore, Villa Margarita is not actually at-risk of conversion through the loss of its HUD 236(J)(1) subsidy until Phase Two (July 1994 - June 1999).
The project is also considered to be at-risk based on the potential loss of its Section 8 rent subsidy. The Section 8 rent subsidy contract was to have terminated as of November 30, 1991, however, HUD records indicate that the contract was renewed for five additional years until November 30, 1996. Therefore, the Section 8 subsidy will not be at-risk until the Phase Two (July 1994 -June, 1999).
In summary, Villa Margarita will not be at-risk of conversion during Phase One (July 1,1989 - June 30,1994).
b)	Beverly Towers
The construction of Beverly Towers was accomplished in part through a HUD 236(J)(1) Interest Reduction Mortgage Loan subsidy. According to HUD, the Mortgage Loan subsidy is not at-risk because the owner, United Methodist Church, is a nonprofit and is thus prohibited from prepaying the loan during the 40 year term.
67
City of Montebello *1989 Housing Element*
Beverly Towers also receives Section 8 project based rental subsidy. According to HUD records, the subsidy could be terminated as early as November 1, 1993. However, to terminate the Section 8 subsidy, the owner must provide HUD with a one year notice. As of April 1993, the owner had not filed the required ’’Notice of Intent". Hence, the building is not at-risk of conversion during Phase One. Additionally, HUD's Office of Preservation has indicated that it intends to extend the Section 8 contract for an additional five years to November 1, 1998, and very likely beyond 1998 if federal appropriations are available. Therefore, Beverly Towers is not at-risk of conversion during Phase One.
5. Conversion Potential: Phase Two, July 1994 - June 1999
a)	Villa Margarita
The Villa Margarita's HUD 236(J)(1) subsidy will be at-risk as early as February 1, 1995; its Section 8 rental subsidy will be at-risk as early as November 30, 1996. Prepayment of a Section 236 loan is regulated by the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act (LIHPRHA). Under LIHPRHA provisions, owners of prepayment eligible projects may opt to retain project ownership in exchange for additional federal incentives, or sell their properties under a voluntary sale program. More specifically, LIHPRHA provides owners of eligible projects an opportunity to receive additional federal incentives for extending low-income use restrictions during the remaining useful life of the project. As long as use restrictions for HUD Section 236 mortgage are in effect, Section 8 rent subsidy contracts are likely to be renewed.
b)	Beverly Towers
The only risk faced by Beverly Towers is the loss of its Section 8 rent subsidy on November 1, 1998. However, as long as HUD 236 use restrictions are in effect, which in the case of Beverly Towers is an additional 23 years, Section 8 contracts are likely to be renewed. Thus, only a very remote likelihood of conversion exists during Phase two (July, 1994 - June, 1999).
6.	Projects Not At-Risk
Table No. 22 on the following page provides an inventory of those units that receive mortgage and/or rent subsidies and are subject to use restrictions but are not at risk. In Montebello there is only one such building-Casa La Merced. Casa La Merced has a total of 129 units, all of which are one bedrooms. Casa
68
City of Montebello ”1989 Housing Element"
La Merced is in excellent condition. Casa La Merced will not be at-risk given that it was constructed under Section 202 and is owned by a nonprofit (El Centro Human Services). Moreover, its Section 8 rent subsidy will not expire until March 12, 2007.	... .
There are no housing units in Montebello that have affordability controls as a result of state or local programs, including state and or local Revenue Bonds, Redevelopment Housing Funds, Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds, In-Lieu Fee Program, Density Bonus, and Inclusionary Program.

B.	Cost Analysis Of Preserving Versus Replacing At-Risk Units
The following analysis addresses the two subsidized apartment complexes that are at risk of conversion-Villa Margarita and Beverly Towers. As discussed in the Conversion Potential section above, the future of Villa Margarita and Beverly Towers as subsidized housing appears to be very secure. Nevertheless, the City should have a plan for addressing a conversion proposal, given the impact on low-income people,, should the remote possibility occur. The analysis would cover only Phase Two, July 1994 - June 1999, given that there are no at-risk units during Phase One.
1. Cost of Producing New Rental Housing Comparable In Size and Rent
Levels to Replace The Units Which Could Convert
This replacement costs analysis examines land, construction, and soft costs housing production factors in order to estimate the cost of producing new comparable housing. The analysis assumes that if subsidized units were converted, they would be replaced with comparable housing quality and in compliance with current planning and building standards.

a)
Villa Margarita
i) Land Costs--$1.232,000. Villa Margarita is a three building apartment complex located at 310, 311 and 411 Lohart Avenue. To replace Villa Margarita 56,000 square feet of lot area would be required. Land costs were estimated based on information provided by local real estate agents. According to these agents, the price of a 56,000 square foot property zoned for multi-family development would be approximately $22.00 per square foot. Given that a total of 56,000 square feet are needed, land costs to replace Villa Margarita are estimated at $1,232,000 (please see Table No. 23 on the following page).
ii)	Construction Costs~$2.400,000. According to the Building Official for the City of Montebello, to construct a building similar to Villa Margarita would cost approximately $60.00 per square foot.
The Villa Margarita building permit files, indicate that it contains approximately 40,000 square feet of total construction. Thus, construction cost to replace Villa Margarita would be approximately $2,400,000.
iii)	Soft Costs-$480.000. Lisina an industry standard that soft costs u generally total 20% of the construction costs, soft cost are estimated at $480,000 ($2,400,000 x 20%). Soft costs include: architectural fees, permit fees (building, electrical, engineering, mechanical, and plumbing permits, County Sanitation, and school impact), developer profit, and fir ncing. It should be.noted that
the State of California school irr act fee, at $2.65 per square foot, is a significant expense (approximately $75,000) of these soft costs.
iv)	Total Replacement Costs $4,112.000. Based on the above costs analysis, the total cost to replace Villa Margarita is $4,112,000.
b) Beverly Towers
i) Land Costs $2.730.000. Beverly Towers sits on a 91,000 square foot lot along Beverly Boulevard. According to local real estate agents, property along Beverly Boulevard in Montebello cost approximately $30 per square foot Thus, land costs to replace Beverly Towers is approximately $2,730,000.

City of Montebello *7989 Housing Element1
ii)	Construction Costs $8,500,000. Beverly Towers is a Type II fire resistant eight story concrete building. According to the Montebello Building Official, construction of a Type II building such as Beverly Towers, costs approximately $75.00 per square foot. The entire building square footage is 112,810. Thus, construction costs for Beverly Towers is approximately $8,500,000.
iii)	Soft Costs $1.700.000. Using an industry standard that soft cost generally total 20% of the construction costs, soft cost would be estimated at $1,700,000. Soft costs include: architectural fees, permit fees (building, electrical, engineering, mechanical, and plumbing permits, County Sanitation, and school impact), developer profit, and financing,.
iv)	Total Replacement Cost $13,000,000. Based on the above costs analysis the total cost to replace Beverly Towers is approximately $13,000,000.

2. Cost of Preserving Developments At Risk of Converting
a) Villa Margarita
Villa Margarita is at-risk due to the possible elimination of its Section 8 rental subsidy contract. To determine the cost of preserving Villa Margarita, two basic factors were considered: 1) the difference between HUD established fair market rents (FMR) and rents paid by tenants; and 2) the property market value.
According to the property management company responsible for Villa Margarita, the average monthly tenant contribution towards their rent is
71
City of Montebello "1989 Housing Element1
$300 per month. HUD has established the monthly fair market rent for / T these units at $647 hence, each unit receives an average monthly rent subsidy of $347, Given that there are a total of 28 units, the total monthly subsidy for Villa Margarita is $9,716 or $116,592 annually.
Please see Table No. 24.

Monthly Preservation Cost Per Unit	$347	1
Monthly Preservation Cost For All Units	$9,716 I
Yearly Preservation Cost For All Units	$116,592 I
Villa Margarita is also at-risk of conversion due to the potential loss of its HUD 236(J)(1) subsidized loan as early as February 1, 1995. Using an industry standard price-to-earnings ratio of 10 to 1, the Villa Margarita’s value is estimated at $2,065,224. Please see Table No. 25.

Under LIHPRHA, HUD will provide mortgage loan insurance on acquisition loans for up to 95% of the equity to priority purchasers, such as non-profits and community based organizations. If Villa Margarita were sold to an eligible non-profit the total down payment cost would be $103,261. Therefore, the total preservation costs for Villa Margarita during Phase One is $219,853. Clearly, preserving Villa Margarita is considerably more cost efficient than replacing it with a new comparable building.

b) Beverly Towers
As previously indicated, Beverly Towers is only at-risk of conversion due to the possible elimination of its Section 8 rental subsidy contract. According to records maintained, by Beverly Towers, the average monthly rent paid by its residents is $160 per month. HUD has established the monthly fair market rent for these units at $455 hence, each unit receives an average monthly rent subsidy of $295. Given that there are a total of 189 units, the total monthly subsidy for Beverly Towers is $55,755 or $669,060 yearly. Therefore, preserving Beverly Towers is clearly more cost efficient than replacing with a new comparable building. Table No. 26 below provides a detailed explanation of the total rent subsidy.

Monthly Tenant Rent Contribution Per Section S Guidelines	$160
Monthly Preservation Cost Per Unit	$295
Monthly Preservation Cost For All Units	$55,755
Total Yearly Preservation Cost	$669,060
C.	Resources For Preservation
1. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
Under the provisions of the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act, owners of Federal mortgage subsidized affordable housing are entitled to incentives sufficient to yield eight percent of the preservation equity of the project should they agree to maintain the affordability controls. These incentives are negotiated mutually by HUD and the owner and must be sufficient to cover the annual authorized return, debt service on rehabilitation loans, debt service on the HUD mortgage, operating expenses, and adequate reserves.
c
Owners of Federal mortgage subsidized affordable housing interested in a voluntary sale to a priority purchaser (e.g., tenant council, nonprofit corporation, state or local government) can trigger the availability of HUD financial assistance. As discussed earlier priority purchasers have access to the following assistance: 1) insurance for financing up to 95% of the preservation equity; 2) grants up to the present value of the total projected
73
City of Montebello ”1989 Housing Element1
published fair market rents for Section 8 existing housing for the next 10 years; and 3) reimbursement for certain transaction expenses.
2.	Home Investment Partnership Act (HOME)
The City of Montebello did not meet the necessary HUD criterion to receive HOME funds directly from the federal government. However, the City plans to apply to the state for HOME funds as the City's housing needs warrant. The use of this resource would require inclusion of a program description for preservation during the fiscal year in which assistance is anticipated. Funding is expected to continue throughout the planning phase of this Housing Element, however, program funding is dependent upon federal appropriations and is therefore not guaranteed.
3.	Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
4.
As an entitlement City, Montebello has been allocated approximately $1,100,000 in CDBG funds for Fiscal Year 1992-93. Of the $1.1 million 35% of the funds are used for planning/administration and public services, hence about $780,000 could be available annually for preserving at-risk housing, assuming Montebello's CDBG allocation remains constant.
Rental Section 8 Certificates and Rental Vouchers
Through the Los Angeles County's Housing Authority, the federal government provides funding for housing certificates and vouchers (Section 8) for low-income families and individuals. The Housing Authority may direct rental certificates and vouchers towards preserving units at-risk of conversion.
5. Housing Set-Aside Funds
Redevelopment tax increment could be a source of funding for housing at-risk in Montebello. A portion of these funds could potentially be redirected should there be a need to utilize these funds for housing preservation. Currently, the Montebello Redevelopment Agency generates approximately $300,000 annually for the housing set-aside fund.
6. Nonprofit Housing Corporations
The City recently created a nonprofit housing corporation. This nonprofit could be expanded, with training and funding, to assume some responsibility in the area of property management of at-risk units if necessary.

D.	Quantified Objectives: Number Of At-Risk Units To Be Preserved
There are no units at-risk during Phase One of the 10 year planning period, July 1, 1989 -June 30,1994. However, during Phase Two, two projects as listed in Table No. 21 on page 66 are at-risk of converting to non-affordable housing. If both projects are converted, 217 affordable units would be lost. It is the City's objective to retain all 217 units as affordable housing through resources and activities discussed in the following program.
E.	Program Efforts To Preserve At-Risk Units
As previously discussed, there are no units at-risk of conversion during Phase One (July 1989 - June 1994). Program efforts listed below to preserve at risk units apply only during Phase Two, July 1994 - June 1999, The Planning Department will be responsible for administration of the programs listed below.
1.	Identify and Monitor At-Risk Units: The Planning Department must annually prepare the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) as required by the federal government. To prepare the CHAS, the Planning Department will review the Housing Element and identify all at-risk units.
The City's Planning Department will take the lead in monitoring efforts to preserve at-risk units. Upon HUD notifying the City that a "Notice of Intent" has been filed, the Planning Department will notify HCD, tenants, and other affected parties as necessary regarding the possible conversion.
2.	Work with Potential Priority Purchasers: The City will establish contact with public and nonprofit agencies interested in purchasing and/or managing at-risk units. When necessary the City will provide technical assistance to these organizations.
3.	Tenant Education: The City will work with tenants of at-risk units by providing them with education and training relating to their rights and options.
4.	Work with HUD on Plans of Action Submitted by Owners: The City of Montebello commits itself to providing timely comments to HUD on a proposed Plan of Action and to communicate its concerns to HUD throughout the application process.

INTRODUCTION:
Patterns of land use are the most visible and most definitive characteristic of the urban environment. According to how many and what kinds of homes, businesses, and industries we see, we know whether we are in the country or the city; if we are in the city, we know whether we are in a primarily residential, commercial or industrial neighborhood.
These different types of neighborhoods require different locations and different types of services. Industrial and commercial areas, for example, must be located on flat lands and be easily accessible to both people - workers and shoppers - and goods via the railroad and street systems; residential areas required neither the topography nor the access of the others and in fact are better located away from major traffic routes. Industrial and commercial areas require more parking facilities and more utility services than do residential; they must also be located near residential areas for labor force and market support.
The Land Use Element recommends locations and extent of the various uses to be allowed in the city. It also recommends standards for population density and building intensity for each use.
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
PURPOSE:
To comply with California law (Government Gode Section 65301) by formulating a plan designating the proposed general distribution and general location and extent of land uses.
GOALS:
1.	To formulate a plan which is responsive to the needs of the community and which permits the orderly arrangement of land uses, permitting sufficient areas for reasonable development .
2.	To develop and apply residential density standards which will limit the total population while providing single family development and still provide for a variety of housing types controlled by location to complement single family residential areas.

-e/fy/rs uw/h,
4.	To provide for growth and development of an industrial area in a manner compatible with other uses.
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
OBJECTIVES:
1.	That freeway frontage land of 40 to 100 acres be allocated for a Regional Shopping Center.
2.	That sufficient land in close freeway proximity be allocated for an Auto Center.
3.	That "cluster" type commercial development is preferential to proliferation of strip commercial.
4.	That the portions of the present strip commercial that would not be part of the clustered general commercial areas be redeveloped into other specialized clustered land uses, such as medical and professional offices and other compatible uses.
5.	That development of the hill areas be designed to accommodate a variety of housing types (e.g., single family; townhouse-condominiums and multiple family units.
6.	That the older portion of the City, bounded by Beverly Boulevard on the north, the Union Pacific Railroad on the south, Vail Avenue on the west, and Bluff Road on the east, be permitted to redevelop into a medium density residential area.
7.	That a minimum of 200 additional acres of recreation/ open space be provided within the Montebello City boundaries.
CONSTRAINTS:
1.	Land use patterns and community identities are already largely defined in the 68 percent of the City that is developed; existing structures and uses are difficult to recycle. The best opportunity areas for comprehensively planned development exist in the Montebello Hills.
t
-2-
2.	Flat land needed for industrial and commercial locations exists in the portion of Montebello located south of Lincoln Avenue. The hill area except for that area immediately adjacent to the Pomona Freeway would require extensive grading before these land demanding uses could be developed on it; it would therefore probably be more suitable for predominately residential development or open space uses.
3.	The existing transportation and utilities infrastructure could constrain potential intensities and locations of various types of development; for example, the hill area can support an additional 14,000 people under current utilities conditions. The circulation system would be seriously underdesigned if the community were to develop according to what existing zoning will permit.
4.	Attempts to acquire parks and open space may be constrained by high purchase prices and the highly developed nature of the City.
POLICIES:
Residential
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
1.	Residential development should aim for the density standards outlined in the Housing Element of the General Plan.
2.	Residential development of varying densities and housing types should be compatible among themselves and with adjacent commercial and industrial development.
3.	Opportunities for a variety of living needs should be available in various locations throughout the City.
4.	The existing medium density residential area characterized by mixed housing types in the central portion of Montebello should be retained.
5.	Large concentrations of high and very high density residential development should be avoided.
6.	The City*s supply of older housing which is in good condition should be preserved.
7.	Residential neighborhoods should be quiet, safe, and pleasant areas in which to live. They should be free from through traffic movements and encroachment of incompatible land uses.
-3-
8.	Building intensity in residential areas should not exceed the following maximum lot coverages:
Low density areas 40% Medium density areas 50% High density areas 60% Very high density areas 60%
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
Commercial
1.	Commercial development in the City should be sited in appropriate locations according to need.
2.	City should contain a variety of types of commercial development, including regional and community shopping facilities, local neighborhood convenience centers, highway oriented development and professional office type areas.
3.	Strip commercial developments on Whittier Boulevard, Beverly Boulevard and Washington Boulevard should be clustered into functional areas.
4.	The City’s major commercial streets, Beverly Boulevard and Whittier Boulevard, are in need of a major beautification and improvement program. This program should include street landscaping, provision of ample off-street parking, and some lot unification.
5.	The City should contain ample commercial facilities to meet the needs of its residents as well as provide taxa ble revenues to the City.
6.	Frontage areas along the Pomona and Santa Ana Freeways with good accessibility should be preserved for future commercial and industrial development.
7.	Building intensity in commercial areas may approach 100 lot coverage, less required setback and parking require ments.
Industrial
1.	The City’s industrial area should be preserved and main tained.
-4-
2.	Adequate community infrastructure, including streets and utilities, should be developed to support and service the City’s industrial development.
3.	The City of Montebello should work with the City of Commerce to assist in solving circulation problems caused by industrial traffic in South Montebello and adjacent City of Commerce.
4.	Frontage along Santa Ana Freeway should be preserved for industrial and compatible commercial development.
5.	Building intensity in industrial areas may approach 100% lot coverage, less required setback and parking requirements .
DESCRIPTION OF THE FLAN:
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
The land use plan is generally characterized by intensification and some clustering of urban uses in the flatlands and development of a variety of urban uses - including several types of residential, commercial, and open space uses - in the Montebello Hills. It proposes retention of the overall residential character of the community with development of a regional town center, to include shopping and housing facilities, in the northeast part of the hill, clustering of commercial areas in the flat-lands, and maintenance of the industrial section in the south.
A park/open space belt system would wind through the City, including existing parks as well as, possibly, the Southern California Edison Company Right-of-Way in the north and west and land along the Rio Hondo Channel along the eastern limit of the City.
Residential areas in the developed portion of the City would undergo little change. Land north of Beverly Boulevard would be predominantly occupied by single family homes; exceptions would be multiple-family dwellings located in clusters adjacent to shopping areas, generally found between Garfield Avenue and the Southern California Edison Company Right-of-Way, at the northeast corner of Wilcox Avenue and Beverly Boulevard, between Lincoln Avenue and Beverly Boulevard in the vicinity of Taylor Avenue and Howard Avenue.
Residential uses would also continue to occupy most of the land between Beverly Boulevard and the Union Pacific Railroad tracks. Single family homes would remain in the western portion and the northern portion bounded generally by Madison and Cleveland Avenues on the south and 5th Street on the east. Mixed single
-5-
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
and multiple family dwellings would occupy the areas from the bluff on the east to Vail Avenue on the west and south of the single family area just described. A high density cluster would be located generally between Whittier Boulevard and Olympic Boulevard west of Vail Avenue.
Residential uses in the southern part of the City would also remain substantially as they are. Single family homes would occupy almost the entire area east of Greenwood Avenue between Mines Avenue and the AT§SF Railroad in addition to the area west of Greenwood Avenue to Taylor Avenue and from Mines Avenue south past Beach Street. Medium density, mixed residential uses would occupy most of the area between Mines Avenue and the Union Pacific tracks east of Montebello Boulevard. High density multiple family units would be located along the west side of Greenwood Avenue between Date Street and the AT$SF tracks.
Residential uses in the hills would be of several types and densities. Low density development would be located on most of the slopes facing the City, an extension of existing development in this area. Medium density development - perhaps town-houses, patio homes, or low density apartments - would be located in several areas closer to the Pomona Freeway and to a planned commercial center in the northeastern hills. High and very high density development would be located adjacent to this planned commercial area in order to provide support for it and lend the atmosphere of a regional town center.
Commercial development, according to the plan, would generally be clustered into centers throughout the City. Neighborhood centers would be located at the northwest corner of Wilcox Avenue and Beverly Boulevard and the northwest corner of Montebello Avenue and Beverly Boulevard. Community shopping facilities would be available in the present downtown core area as well as at the southeast corner of Wilcox Avenue and Via Campo. Across Wilcox Avenue would be a highway commercial site. The planned commercial center in the northeast portion of the hills would include a regional shopping center, an auto center, and restaurants in a 40-100 acre area. Existing strip commercial development along the major east-west arterials - Beverly Boulevard, Whittier Boulevard, and Washington Boulevard - would be clustered into commercial, office, and residential areas.
-6-
Industrial uses in Montebello would continue to be focused in the southwest part; that is, south of the Union Pacific tracks and west of Greenwood, and south of the AT§SF tracks the full breadth of the City. Additional industrial uses would continue to occupy the portion of the City east of the Rio Hondo Channel, between Whittier Boulevard and Mines Avenue.
Park and open lands would be located in areas throughout the City. Opportunities for land acquisition are limited in the central and southern developed parts of Montebello; resulting shortages may be somewhat alleviated by providing recreationally oriented facilities in areas where land is more available or where school recreational facilities may be used. In addition to currently existing parks, two hundred acres in the Montebello Hills would be set aside for open space. The remaining Southern Califor nia Edison Right-of-Way could be developed into parkland similar to Ashiya Park. An 8-10 acre park site would be acquired and developed in the southeast portion of the City, probably in the vicinity of Mines Avenue.

NOISE ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION:
Sound Is anything that is or may be heard. Noise, in turn, is unwanted sound that is disruptive to an individual’s environment. Transportation and other activities, typically, produce noise as an undesirable by-product. Until recently, most communities accepted noise as a price for progress.
Adopted MCC May 27, 1975
PURPOSE:
Recognizing the adverse impact of noise on our environment, the State of California now requires a Noise Element in each community’s General Plan. Section 65302(g) of the California Government Code contains the State’s requirements.
In supplement to the California Government Code requirement, the Council on Intergovernmental Relations prepared a set of guidelines for preparation of the Noise Element. Montebello’s Noise Element is prepared in conformance with these guidelines.
DEFINITIONS AND TECHNICAL BACKGROUND:
Preparation of the Noise Element in compliance with state guidelines necessitates certain technical background studies. These studies form a foundation for goals, objectives, policies and implementation of the Noise Element. Technical background studies for Montebello’s Noise Element were prepared by J. J. Van Houten and Associates, Acoustical Consultants.
The following portion of this Noise Element summarizes major points contained in Technical Background Study for the Noise Element of the City of Montebello and other relevant sources. For additional details, see the Technical Background Study or the other sources referenced at the conclusion of this element.
1.	Ambient and Non-Ambient Noise: The typical community noise environment consists of a background noise level. This background, or ambient noise level is, typically, transportation oriented. Since the background level is lower at night, louder-than-ambient noise sources are more pronounced in their adverse effect on an individual’s environment.
-1-
Adopted MCC May 27, 1975
2.	Sound/Noise Measurement: Sound/noise is measured in decibels (dB), or tenths of a "bel" (named after Alexander Graham Bell). Zero on a decibel scale represents the lowest sound detectable by the human ear. As perceived by human hearing, a 10 dB increase represents a doubling of apparent loudness of sound.
For example, a heavy truck at 90 dB seems twice as loud as an alarm clock at 80 dB, and four times as loud as freeway traffic at 70 dB. Figure 1 illustrates decibel relationships.
A Constant Noise Equivalency Level (CNEL) measurement system is employed in Montebello’s Technical Background Study and this element. CNEL is a standard acoustical scale utilizing a weighted average to sensitize late evening and morning noise readings.
3.	Sources of Noise: Transportation facilities are primary sources of noise. These facilities include highways and freeways, railroads, mass transit and aircraft. The United States Department of Transportation projects that transportation facilities will have increasingly greater impact on our society. Nontransportation noise sources include stationary facilities (e.g., industrial plants, air conditioners and compressors), recreation activities, construction activity, and the omnipresent barking dog. Because of the magnitude of the transportation noise problem, this is the focus of this element.
The Technical Background study and this,element include a CNEL ’’contour” map of noise levels in Montebello. These ’’contour” lines connect points of equal poise level, producing a pattern of noise impacts. This pattern provides a quantitative projection of existing and proposed transportation elements. Each contour line represents a five decibel increment The map illustrates projected contours in 1984. As explained in the background study, the differences between present and 1984 patterns are minimal.
Examination of the CNEL contour map, Figure 2, indicates that highway, freeway and railroads are Montebello’s most significant noise sources. As explained in the Technical Background Study, the procedure used to derive these contours relies on research studies by the National Highway Research Board,
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), United States Department of Transportation (DOT), and United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Although

aircraft approaching Los Angeles International Airport do pass over Montebello, and helicopters occasionally land in the city, noise from these aircraft is not considered signifi cant and is not reflected on the CNEL contour map.
4.	Characteristics of Noise: Noise varies in terms of source, time of day, day of week, and distance to the individual hearing the noise.
a.	Figure 3 illustrates the relative noise emission levels for transportation vehicles, given present technology. The highway generators and rail lines have greatest relevance to Montebello.
b.	Figure 4 depicts typical noise level variation with time of day near an arterial (heavily traveled) street. Examples of such streets in Montebello would be Beverly and Whittier Boulevards.
c.	Figure 5 shows the day-of-week vehicular traffic volume (expressed in ADT: Average Daily Traffic) and accompanying noise level variation.
d.	As indicated in Figures 6 and 7, noise decreases in loudness with increasing distance from the source.
Also, the amount of sound reaching the receiver is affected by barriers between the noise source and receiver.
Adopted MCC May 27, 1975
5.	Consequences of Noise: Under certain conditions noise may affect the average individual in any of the following ways:
a.	General Hearing Loss or Damage - Highly amplified music, sports, shooting, and other recreational uses may produce sound levels capable of producing hearing loss, especially if exposures are prolonged or recurrent. The greater or longer the exposure, the greater the potential for hearing loss.
b.	Impaired Speech Communication - Noise levels of 60 dB(A) and greater make communication difficult to impossible.
c.	Sleep Interference - Noise levels above 45 dB(A) may be unacceptable, depending upon the individual.

d.	Nervousness and Tension - Growing concern has been expressed that exposure to the high noise levels of the city might contribute £o nervous disorders and tensions, but findings are still inconclusive.
e.	Economic Impacts - Costs of noise can include medical care, loss of efficiency and production, reduction In property value, abatement measures, and administrative time. Figure 8 illustrates the trend of public reaction to peak noise near residences.
6. Mitigation of Noise: Three basic variables are the key to mitigation of the impacts of noise: source, path and receiver. Changes in one or more of these variables will result in mitigation of adverse noise levels.
a.	Reduction of noise at the source is the most direct approach to noise mitigation. This places the economic impact of noise reduction on the noise producer. Transportation noise control is, however, largely outside the purview of local planning bodies. These limitations are explained under the "constraints" portion of this element. An enforceable and enforced noise ordinance can correct sources in areas where local power has not been preempted.
b.	Control of the path of noise transmission can also mitigate noise levels. By increasing the distance between source and receiver, or by placing adequate barriers between source and receiver, the effects on the receiver can be reduced. For example, highway noise can be mitigated by elevating or depressing the roadway, or by installing rigid and massive round barriers. It should be noted, however, that landscaping adjacent to a highway produces little physical reduction in noise levels unless it is very dense and of significant depth. Landscaping’s effect, in terms of noise reduction, may, however, be psychologically positive.
c.	Reduction of noise impact on the receiver is the third alternative. Land use control can assure that only relatively insensitive receivers are in noise impact areas, or that the receiver can be "hardened" to

A summary of significant noise sources/activity categories and possible mitigation measures is contained in Figures 9 and 10.
GOALS:
Adopted MCC May 27, 1975
Goals reflect broad aims and basic values. They establish emphasis and tone for policy and program formulation. The decisions and activities of the city’s government should be guided by the intent of these goals:
1.	Reduce noise to a level that does not jeopardize health and welfare.
2.	Minimize noise levels of future transportation facilities and other noise sources.
3.	Establish compatible land uses adjacent to transportation facilities and other noise sources.
4.	Allocate noise mitigation costs among those who produce the noise.
5.	Alert the public regarding the potential impact of transportation and other noise.
6.	Protect areas that are presently quiet from future noise impact.
OBJECTIVES:
Objectives focus on more specific areas of attention and/or concern. Objectives are consistent with the goals and provide a framework for policies.
1.	Residential Zones
a.	Residential areas must be generally quiet.

A. Santa Ana and Pomona Freeway Traffic Noise	Freeway traffic noise levels at setbacks from the freeway (about 40 ft.) are about 75 dB(A) with peak noise levels to 79 dB(A).	CNEL values at residential locations bordering the Pomona Freeway may exceed 65 dB(A). Recognized standards indicate that these exposures are excessive and that the locations are unsuitable for residential use.	The installation of noise barriers ought to be considered as a mitigation measure.
B. Train movements along the Santa Fe and Union Pacific Railroads and Spur Lines	Train noise levels approach 80 to 90 dB(A) at residential locations bordering the right-of-way.	Noise levels at residential locations are excessive. Recognized standards are exceeded. The primary annoyance to residents involves late night and early morning train pass-■hys..	Late night and early morning train movements should be discouraged. Redevelopment and/or noise barriers ought to be considered for spaces within 600 feet of the right-of way.
C* Los Angeles International Airport Operations	Peak noise levels at locations within the city are as high as 60 to 65 dB(A).	Impact of aircraft operations is not considered significant. Growth of activity may have an adverse impact.	Encourage the minimization of late evening and early morning operations at the airport.

D. Construction Activity	Noise level of construction approach 100 dB(A) at distances to 50 ft. and about 80 dB(A) at locations to 500 ft.	Minimal impact for two or three months of activity during daytime hours.	Heavy construction should be limited to the weekday hours from 7:00 A.M. to 6:00P.M., with minimal activity on weekends. Noise of construction equipment should be considered in the procurement of equipment by the City Departments .
E. Commercial Industrial Noise Producing Elements	Car wash facilities and industrial conditioning equipment may produce noise levels to 75 dB(A) at nearby residential locations.	In general, commercial/ industrial noise within the city is not considered excessive except where residential locations are adjacent to heavy industrial zones.	The adoption and effective implementation of a noise ordinance will insure that fixed sources of noise will remain at acceptable levels.
F. Schools, Hospitals and Parks	Noise at these locations is generated by traffic on the arterials adjacent to the spaces or facilities.	In general, the noise levels at most locations of concern is not considered excessive.	Noise ought to be a consideration in the selection or relocation of school sites and parks within the city.

1.	Source: Traffic is the major source of noise, and reduction of noise at the source is the most effective control Montebello is, however, preempted in control of most traffic noise at the source. The city’s major power in traffic noise control at the source lies in applying pressure for appropriate state and/or federal legislation
Local jurisdictions may enact noise regulations to secure and promote the public health and welfare as an exercise of their police power. Cities may prohibit the unnecessary, excessive and annoying noises of horns and signaling devices on private property, drums, animals and fowl, steam whistles, and engines in non-moving motor vehicles. There is a question, however, whether such noises can be controlled by decibel standards or only by disturbance-df-the-peace ordinances.
The local authority may enact standards limiting noise emissions which cross property lines. The use of property is generally required to conform with the performance standards stated in the noise ordinance.
These performance standards are meant to apply to noisegenerating apparatus or activities within a particular area and are not to be confused with the new product standards of EPA. License and permit type provisions may be used to limit or require compliance with performance standards as a condition to the installation or operation of equipment. In addition, curfews may be set to prohibit certain noise-generating activities during a specific time interval, usually at night.
2.	Path: Local jurisdiction have much latitude in terms of affecting the transmission path of noise. Implementation of noise barrier requirements generally does not, however, place the burden of noise control on the source. The economic burden of noise barriers often falls on the affected property’s developer, or the state or local jurisdiction. Cost of noise barriers is a major constraint.
3* Receiver: The State of California has taken the major role in noise control at the receiver. Through the noise insulation standards, effective August 22, 1974, "Interior Community Noise Equivalent Levels (CNEL) attributable to exterior sources shall not exceed an annual CNEL of 45 dB in any habitable room". The enforcement of this provision is a local responsibility.
-19-
Adopted MCC May 27, 1975
Federal activities in control of noise at the receiver are presented in the HUD policy statement:
It is the finding of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that noise is a major source of environmental pollution which represents a threat to the serenity and quality of life in population centers. Noise exposure may be a cause of adverse physiological or psychological effects as well as economic losses. Accordingly, it is the purpose of departmental policy to call attention to this threat, to encourage the control of noise at its source in cooperation with other federal departments and agencies, to encourage land utilization patterns for housing and other municipal needs that will separate uncontrollable noise sources from residential and other noise-sensitive areas, and to prohibit HUD support to new construction on sites having unacceptable noise exposures.
In summary, constraints of jurisdictional responsibility are primary factors in noise control at the source. Interference of the noise transmission path places the economic burden on individuals other than those causing the problem. Control of noise at the receiver is covered by state regulations but enforced by local jurisdictions.
POLICIES:
Constrained to degrees by other jurisdictions, Montebello's policies focus on viable approaches to noise control and reduction.
Montebello's policies are to:
1.	Actively pursue and support legislation whose effect will enhance our noise environment through the reduction of transportation and other noise sources. The economic burdens of noise control should not fall on the City or the adversely impacted receiver.
2.	Enforce and encourage enforcement of all existing noise control regulations designed to bring about attainment of acceptable noise standards.
3.	Develop an enforceable Noise Ordinance, and implement this ordinance to control noise to reasonable levels in areas where the City's jurisdiction has not been preempted.
-20-
4.	Utilize comprehensive planning, Environmental Impact Reports, redevelopment, and land use decisions to minimize adverse impact of noise in all areas of the community.
5.	Promote increased public awareness of the adverse effects of noise.
6.	Support and encourage federal, state, county and other programs to voluntarily reduce noise impact through modification of the noise source, transmission path or receiver.
7.	Require all city departments to include noise control requirements, where applicable, in the procurement of equipment.
Noise minimization should be considered in the conduct of all city activities.

INTRODUCTION:
As a result of shrinking work weeks, increasing leisure time, more people and higher incomes within the last several years, there has been a growing pressure on the land for uses as urban development and a resulting concern about the environment.
This concern has focused not only on air, noise, and water pollution but also on the ratio of land in open space to that which is used for housing development, industries and commercial facilities. The rapid growth of cities during the 1960*s and the persisting speculation that the urban region will spread have lent momentum to public interest in open space. In order to limit this spread and to preserve open spaces both within and outside of the urban areas, it is therefore necessary to formulate guidelines to help preserve the quality of the environment .
There exists a unique condition to preserve open space in Montebello: it is a close-in community with a large amount of vacant land, located in an urbanized region. This unique condition gives a feeling of open space. The main contributors to this perception are the large amounts of vacant land located in the Montebello Hills, gas storage facilities, oil fields,Whittier Narrows Dam and the settling basins along the Rio Hondo Channel; however, this condition can not be expected to last indefinitely as much of the vacant land, particularly in the Hills, is currently being planned for subdivisions by private land owners.
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
PURPOSE:
The purpose of this open space element is to comply with Califor nia law (Government Code Section 65560-70) by adopting goals and policies relating to open space, identifying open space, and formulating an action program for implementation of the open space plan.
DEFINITIONS OF OPEN SPACE LAND AND OPEN SPACE USE:
According to California State Law (Government Code Section 65560), open space land includes:

production. Use of the oil fields, now in the last phases of secondary recovery operation and production, is expected to end in the next 10-12 years. The oil fields have been a great asset to the City by acting as a holding agency; the hill area is almost the only part of the City still open and undeveloped.
Agricultural land amounts to only 1.2% of total area of the City. Dairying and orchards are the primary agricultural land in the City.
Approximately 4.1 percent of the area of the City is classified as recreational. This land is largely composed of the six parks located throughout the City plus the Montebello Municipal Golf Course.
Much of the land in Montebello is considered scenic in nature.
The hills provide a vantage point from which to view vistas of Montebello and surrounding communities as well as a landmark, an immediate point of identification, large enough to be seen from almost every location. The bluff adjacent to the Rio Hondo contains a scenic route overlooking a water course with natural vegetation. Mission Viejo and Sanchez Adobe, aside from providing cultural and historic landmarks to the City, add to the scenic qualities worthy of preservation. Park sites such as City Park and Bicknell offer residents recreational uses as well as contribute to the satisfiable perception of open space.
Necessary watershed and water recharge areas also exist within the City limits of Montebello. Settling basins on the east side of the City act as an important factor in the hydrological cycle. The water held in these basins percolates into the soil and thus raises and replenishes the water table. These basins are important to the maintenance of the quality of water necessary for the people of the region.
Certain locations within the City offer habitats to a variety of wildlife species; such animals as quail, rabbits, hawks and coyote utilize the vacant hill area as a habitat. Other types of small wildlife, located in the Whittier Narrows Dam area and the water basins, are a variety of birds and rabbits.

5.	Watershed or ground water recharge land, which is land important to the state in order to maintain the quantity and quality of water necessary to the people of the state.
6.	Wildlife habitat, which is land unusually valuable or necessary to the preservation or enhancement of wildlife resources of the state.
Open space uses may include:
1.	Public recreation, including playgrounds associated with schools.
2.	Enjoyment of scenic beauty.
3.	Conservation or use of natural resources.
4.	Utility rights-of-way, substations and storage facilities and underground gas storage.
5.	Production of food or fiber.

GOALS:
1.	To insure the preservation and conservation of sufficient open space to introduce relief from the otherwise uninterrupted urban development of the Southern California region.
2.	To insure the preservation and conservation of sufficient open space to serve the recreational, health, and welfare needs of the residents.
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
OBJECTIVES:
1.	Identify existing open space that is important to welfare of the community.
2.	Establish standards and criteria for the location and development of open space and recreation land.
3.	Provide open space and a full range of recreation facilities and programs which are easily accessible to all residents .
4.	Determine the location, size and type of recreational facilities and programs on the basis of the needs of the people.
5.	Identify unique natural features, scenic areas and historical sites.
6.	Identify methods for the preservation and acquisition of open space.
CONSTAINTS:
1.	The City of Montebello is approximately 68% developed; the remaining 32% of undeveloped land is composed of the following: 4.1% recreation, 1.2% agriculture, 5.7 % open unuseable, and 21% open useable.
2.	The hill area, which is the site of much of the 21% remaining open usable acreage, offers an opportunity to acquire land at relatively lower prices than would be required for developed flatland areas. The Citizen Attitude Survey, conducted in January, 1973, indicated that 72% of the citizens responding want playgrounds, parks and open space in the hills.

-5-
3.	Purchase of full or partial rights to land may prove expensive, and may limit the ability of a community to acquire land for open space and recreation.
4.	Difficulty in coordinating extracurricular use of school facilities may limit the City*s ability to provide adequate recreational land.
5.	Spreading grounds in the Rio Hondo Channel may not be used for recreation or other purposes unless and until technological and legal obstacles, if any, are overcome.
POLICIES:
1.	Two hundred (200) acres of land in the hills should be acquired by the City for parks, playgrounds and open space.
2.	Ecologically important areas should be viewed as areas of critical concern and should be preserved wherever possible.
3.	Open space areas should be provided or developed to serve the needs appropriate to their location.
4.	In addition to obtaining new open space areas, the City should seek to make more use or multi-use of the existing open space areas of the community. This program would include recreational use of school playground facilities during non-school hours.
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN:
The Open Space Plan proposes expansion of the parks and recreation facilities system and conservation of some of the unique features and areas of Montebello. It is characterized by proposed multiple use of lands in an attempt to amass as much recreational land as possible to meet the standards set by the City.
Existing parks, as described in the Montebello Inventory Report, would be retained; in summary, they include proposed Acuna Park, Ashiya Park, Bicknell Park, John Dutcher Tot Lot, Grant Rea Park, Holifield Park, Montebello (City) Park, and Northridge .Mini Park. Special facilities to be retained as open space land would be Taylor Ranch and Montebello Municipal Golf Course. Additional open spaces proposed to be retained as they now exist are the cemetery in northern
-6-
Montebello, gas storage facilities and the Whittier Narrows Dam. The horse-keeping properties along the Rio Hondo Channel, south of the Union Pacific Railroad, are also recommended to be maintained.
New open space lands are proposed to be located in the Montebello Hills, which contain most of the existing open land in the City.
Multiple use of some existing open land and of most school recreation areas is proposed throughout the flatlands. The Southern California Edison Right-of-Way and the settling basins in the Rio Hondo Flood Control Channel would be maintained as open space and investigated for possible multiple use depending on the ability to overcome any technological and/or legal obstacles. The park playground portion of the schools in Montebello are proposed to be available for public recreational use outside of school hours.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, nothing contained herein shall be deemed or construed to in any manner, indicate or evidence any intention on the part of the City of Montebello to, at any time in the future acquire, by purchase, eminent domain or any other means, any real property and/or appurtenances for purposes of implementing any provision of this plan.
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
ACTION PROGRAM:
The open space plan is not a static entity; rather, it requires the active review and re-evaluation in order to be effective.
In order to implement the open space plan and provide an effective program to insure that permanent open space be provided in the community, it will be necessary to use various tools, policies, programs:
1.	The City should increase required park dedication from individual developers who are developing or redeveloping various parts of the City.
2.	One technique which should be considered is increasing the amount of land dedicated under the provisions of the Quimby Act (current Montebello Park Dedication Requirements) , Standards for land dedication or in lieu cash payment should be sufficiently high so as to make land dedication preferable to cash payment.
-7-
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
3.	As an alternative to increasing park dedication standards under provision of the Quimby Act, the City should consider adopting a fee formula for park land similar to the one recommended by the League of California Cities as utilized by Arcadia and Downey. This fee formula would create a per unit tax and would include apartment and condominium projects currently not covered by provisions of the Quimby Act.
4.	The land use and housing element maps indicate a range of per acre densities over generalized areas. In order to preserve park and open space land within the generalized areas, developers should be encouraged to cluster housing units in selected areas and thereby create open space land in the remainder. This development technique, commonly referred to as the PUD or Planned Unit Development, would have its greatest applicability in the Montebello Hills.
5.	The City of Montebello and the Montebello Unified School District should work closely together to develop an ongoing program for recreational use of school recreational facilities during non-school hours. Planning, designing, and development or redevelopment of school recreation facilities should consider the recreational needs of the particular area as well as the recreational needs of the neighborhood or community; similarly, planning of city parks and playgrounds adjacent to schools should relate to the recreational needs of school children.
6.	Other techniques which should be considered to implement the park and recreation portion of the open space element include:
Gift or dedication
Bond issue
Purchase of development rights Zoning, subdivision regulations California State Redevelopment Law

INTRODUCTION:
The City of Montebello through its Park and Recreation Department maintains a comprehensive system of park and recreational facilities including neighborhood and community parks, the municipal golf course, historical sites, and specialized community services.
An analysis of these facilities, however, indicates that the City's facilities are inadequate to meet existing needs. The City's standard for park land is to provide four acres per 1,000 population. Existing community parks and park sites,excluding the municipal golf course, total 89.7 acres; approximately 90 additional acres would be required to satisfy the standard for Montebello's present population of 45,000.
PURPOSE:
The purpose of the Parks and Recreation Element is to complement and supplement the other elements of the General Plan by developing goals and policies relating to parks and recreation, identify ing existing as well as proposed general locations and acreage for park and recreational land, and by formulating an action program for implementation of the Parks and Recreation Plan, as allowed by California State law (Government Code, Section 65303).
DEFINITIONS OF PARKS AND RECREATION USES:*
Adopted MCC Jan. 28, 1974 CPA-5-75
Recreational areas serve different types of needs in the City and therefore must be developed in different ways. Various types of recreational development are:
Regional Park. A major park that offers recreational opportunities of a nature or of such wide variety that it possesses attraction for persons in the widest possible ranges of age and interest. It frequently contains two or more of the other types of areas defined here or elements of them, and generally serves people living within a radius distance equivalent to about an hour's drive.
★Parka and Recreation Element, City of Montebelloj 1966,
-1-
(J
1
Community Park. In general a "community" is a group of neighborhoods forming a recognized section or district of the city. A community recreation park is, accordingly, an area serving the several neighborhoods within a community. Planned for both young people and adults, the community recreation park provides outdoor and indoor facilities to meet a much wider range of recreation interests than the neighborhood recreation center. The community recreation park is usually served by public transportation. For those who travel to it by automobile, off-street parking is provided.

Neighborhood Park. In general, a "neighborhood” is the area served by an elementary school, A neighborhood recreation center is preferably a combination school and recreation park that provides space for outdoor and indoor recreation activities under supervision, but some neighborhood recreation centers are on sites away from schools. Regardless of location, the neighborhood recreation center is planned primarily for children from approximately five to fourteen years of age and for family groups, but usually includes an area for preschool children. When it adjoins an elementary school, it readily serves both school and neighborhood recreation needs. Like the school, it is within walking distance of the homes in the neighborhood.
Playlot. A small recreation area, usually less than two acres, serving preschool age children. Playlots are always located within easy walking distance of residential neighborhoods of medium and high density characteristics. They contain play apparatus, quiet areas, mothers’ areas and' landscaping.
Special Facility. An individual public use facility iso-lated from park areas and maintained for specialized
•	programs of a community-wide nature.
3
Historical Sites. The historical sites mentioned in this o	plan are buildings or areas having particular historical
significance to the local community. Although some of them are also marked with State or County, historical monuments,
g«	their greatest significance is found in the history and
5	development of Montebello. No particular emphasis is
placed upon these historical sites as a part of the program of activities of the City’s Recreation Department.
-2-
GOALS:
1.	To provide a full range of park and recreational facilities and programs which are easily accessible to all residents of the community.
2,	To provide 4.0 acres of park and recreational use per 1,000 residents to meet the standards of the City.
OBJECTIVES:
1.	Provide neighborhood parks and recreational facilities where-ever possible within walking distance of all residents.
2.	Expand joint-use recreational agreements with school district.
3.	Establish park and recreation space under utility easements.
4.	Expand recreational use of land in Rio Hondo Channel area;
5.	Establish park and recreational facilities in the hill area.
6.	Preserve and expand existing park and recreational facilities.
7.	Establish additional park facilities and improve existing park facilities in the South Montebello area.
Adopted MCC Jan. 28, 1974
CONSTRAINTS:
1.	The degree to which urban development has occurred in Montebello has set a limit on the amount of vacant land which can be acquired for park and recreational space. Approximately 30 percent of the land within the City is vacant, but much of that land is located in the north portion of the City. The lack of suitable vacant land in south Montebello residential neighborhoods limits the City's attempts to meet the standard of 4.0 acres of park and recreational land per 1,000 residents in this area.
2.	The financial ability of the City to purchase land which is developed or vacant for the purpose of creating additional park and recreational land, as well as the financial ability of the City to maintain these facilities, is limited.
-3-
V
(J

3.	To date, joint-use recreation agreements in Montebello have been relatively limited in scope, and based on informal staff-level agreements. Through expansion and formalization of joint-use recreation programs, and development of park-playground areas adjacent to schools, a greater range of
' community services could be provided. Joint-use recreation programs are especially desirable in cities such as Montebello, where park and school land is insufficient and costly.
TOISISS:
1.	Preserve and maintain all existing park and recreational facilities within the City.
2.	Encourage expanded cooperation and coordination between the School District and the Park and Recreation Department for the purpose of formally establishing multi-use recreational opportunities at Montebello's school sites.
3.	Wherever possible, acquire the necessary parks and recreational acreage required throughout the City to meet the standard of 4.0 acres of park and recreational use per 1,000 residents.
4.	Pursue the goals and objectives for parks and recreation.
DESCRIPTION OP-THE_PIAN
In addition to the above stated Goals, Objectives and Policies, the Parks and Recreation Element contains a Comprehensive Master Plan that will serve as a guide to the orderly development,■renovation and improvement of the parks, recreation facilities, programs and services offered by the City of Montebello. The recommendations of the Master Plan focus on the ultimate goal of ensuring optimal use of services and facilities and are based on a balanced approach to a diverse community-centered system of recreation services and parks. The recommendations address the park system as a whole, the individual.parks and specific components within those parks, and the function of the Parks and Recreation Department.
The Master Plan together with the Goals, Objectives and Policies stated In this Element represents a fiscally responsible, innovative response to the provision of recreation services. This systematic approach to the continued expansion and refinement of recreation programs and facilities ensures that the recreation needs of Montebello's residents will be sensitively considered and effectively met. The Master Plan is the result of a planning process that sought and carefully integrated the input of Montebello's residents, City Staff, community leaders and recognized recreation experts. The Master Plan will be a durable and effective tool that will successfully direct the enhancements to Montebello's recreation system well Into the twenty-first century.

Executive Summary
The purpose of this Comprehensive Parks and Recreation Master Plan is to serve as a guide to the orderly development, renovation and improvement of parks, recreation facilities, programs and services offered by the City of Montebello Parks and Recreation Department. The Master Plan has been incorporated as a part of the Recreation Element of the City’s General Plan. The planning process involved a comprehensive effort of data gathering, community input and recreation analysis. The resulting recommendations, based on a balanced approach to a diverse, community-centered system of recreation services and parks, seek to ensure optimal use of services and facilities.

The resulting recommendations of the Master Plan are based on a balanced approach to a diverse, community-centered system of recreation services and parks.
The master planning process began with broad research of the existing conditions in Montebello, its parks and surrounding influences. With much of this information gathered, the planning team moved into Montebello for In Town Week One, where intense interaction with the staff and community and observation of the parks produced an extremely well-rounded data base. Community input meetings were conducted as the first step in the public participation process. These meetings, with other information gathered during the week, resulted in a clear understanding of the issues to be addressed in the Master Plan.
The planning team moved into Montebello for In Town WeekOne, where Intense interaction with the staff and community and observation of the parks produced an extremelywell-rounded data base.
A telephone survey, based on the issues and concerns identified during In Town Week One, randomly sampled Montebello residents. Because participants were considered truly representative of Montebello's population, the results

prcfvements I rogram
Priorities for the implementation of the Master Plan recommendations were established based on available funding and immediate need. Expansion of the existing Senior Center, construction of an aquatics facility at City Park, construction of a new Cultural Arts Center at Taylor Ranch, and construction of the gymnasium at Holifield Park were identified as high priorities. Criteria for selecting projects for implementation in the future were provided so that Department staff can respond to changing conditions and available funding opportunities during the course of Master Plan implementation.
The capital improvements projects required by the recommendations proposed in the Master Plan are estimated in 1993 dollars at approximately thirty-one million dollars. This will require average expenditures of approximately one and a half million dollars a year for the twenty year duration of the Master Plan. There will also be an increase in operational costs associated with these improvements that should be anticipated in the Department budget.

Introduction
The City Council, the Parks and Recreation Commission, the Human Services Commission, and the Parks and Recreation Department of the City of Montebello have commissioned the preparation of a Comprehensive Parks and Recreation Master Plan (hereafter referred to as the Master Plan). The Master Plan has been incorporated as a part of the Recreation Element of the General Plan and will serve as a guide in the orderly development, renovation, and improvement of parks and recreation facilities and programs offered by the Parks and Recreation Department over the next twenty years.
Community input was consistently emphasized during the planning process to ensure the Master Plan reflected the unique needs and desires of Montebello’s citizens. The Master Plan presents a balanced approach to a diverse, community-centered system of recreation services and parks.
The initial stages of the planning process included collecting a variety of data that would contribute to an understanding of the community and the parks and recreation system, including census data, the mission and goals of the Parks and Recreation Department, the city's General Plan and other relevant planning documents for the area. The next step in the planning process was to gather information from people who could be considered "experts" about parks and recreation in Montebello. These individuals included City staff, elected and appointed City officials, representatives of related groups (such as other recreation providers) and, most importantly, parks and recreation services users — the residents of Montebello.
The Master Plan presents a balanced approach to a diverse, community-centered system of recreation services and parks.
The initial stages of the planning process Included collecting a variety cf data that would contribute to an understanding of the community and the parks and recreation system.

INTRODUCTION
Through a comparison of these standards with the city's existing conditions, deficiencies in services and facilities were identified. The Master Plan proposes effective planning solutions for these deficiencies.
Recommendations are presented in three major categories.- Recreation System Recommendations, Facility Development Recommendations and Administrative Recommendations,
Also critical to the planning process were the comparative standards applied to evaluate the existing conditions, e.g., the number of basketball courts, community centers, and the acres of park land that are necessary to adequately serve a given population. Recreation standards from cities throughout the nation were compiled and inventories of facilities in surrounding cities were obtained. From this data and further community observations, localized recreation standards were developed for Montebello. Through a comparison of these standards with the city’s existing conditions, deficiencies in services and facilities were identified. The Master Plan proposes effective planning solutions for these deficiencies.
The Master Plan comprehensively addresses the responsibility of the Parks and Recreation Department to provide recreation services and park facilities for the residents of Montebello. Recommendations are presented in three major categories:
•	The Recreation System Recommendations focus on a city-wide approach to the provision of recreation and parks services in Montebello;
•	Facility Development Recommendations address deficiencies and inefficiencies in existing parks and facilities; and
•	Administrative Recommendations look at the function of the Parks and Recreation Department in its effort to provide quality recreation programs and facilities.

Recreation Analysis
The City of Montebello lies within Los Angeles County approximately eight miles east of downtown Los Angeles. The city, like most of the county, has a very urban character. Three nearby freeways make Montebello a convenient "bedroom community" for commuters to downtown Los Angeles, Long Beach and a number of other work centers. Employment within Montebello is predominantly industrial and light industrial businesses located in the southern part of the city. Commercial and retail establishments are concentrated on Whittier and Beverly Boulevards as well as in the Montebello Town Center, in the northern part of the city.
Population and Social Characteristics
According to the 1990 census, nearly 60,000 people reside in Montebello. The population is over two-thirds Hispanic; Asians make up fifteen percent of the population and reside mostly in the northern areas of the city. Significant to this study, the southern part of the city has a distinctly greater percentage of children comprising the population. Single parent households occur more frequently in the south and in the northern tip of the city above the Pomona Freeway. One of five people in Montebello is over the age of fifty-five and these seniors reside throughout the city. Whereas income levels are significantly higher in the northern part of the city, the southern and western areas of the city have the highest percentage of residents below the poverty line.
Montebello's cultural diversity is an important and exciting aspect of its history and character and is thus an important recreation planning consideration. A majority of Montebello's

Histoiy
Montebello began as a part of the Franciscan Missions in the 1700's. After the Civil War, an early Italian settler established a large ranch in the area. When the ranch was divided into town sites in the late 1800's, Montebello was given its name, which means “beautiful hills’ in Italian. The city was incorporated in 1920 and grew from 2,582 to 7,064 in population during its first decade.
Montebello City Park originated as part of the City Beautiful movement in 1926, spearheaded by the civic-minded efforts of the Women's Club, who still occupy an historic

Many Montebello parks are named for individuals who have made important contributions to the city. Grant Rea was a pilot killed during World War II. Chet Holifield was a U.S. Congressman who served in the Montebello district for many years. Henry Acuna is the only Montebello police officer to be killed in the line of duty. Taylor Ranch Cultural Arts Center is the site of the Taylor family residence arid ranch. Ashiya Park is named for Montebello's sister city in Japan. Reggie Rodriguez was killed in the Vietnam Conflict. Reggie's parents still reside in the city and his mother provided input to the development of this Master Plan.

•	A significant level of pride in the parks and of satisfaction with the Department.
I elephone
The telephone survey, designed to elicit input from a representative sample of Montebello's residents, was a critical component of the community participation process. A telephone survey script was prepared which included general questions about recreation in Montebello and focused questions about issues and concerns identified in the planning process. Surveys were completed by 231 individuals, of which 171 were Montebello residents.
A Representative Sample
The telephone survey randomly sampled the residents of Montebello who had access to a working telephone. Thus, every residenthad an equal chance of being contacted and the results of die survey can be used to estimate characteristics, opinions, perceptions and needs of the entire population.

An Example: Preliminary Demand Analysis
29
COMMUNITY PAKnaPATTON
The following analysis Is an example of how the telephone survey data may be applied. Seventeen percent of the fifteen to thirty-year-old residents who responded to the survey reported playing soccer, but only slxty-four percent of those reported playing soccer In Montebello. Thus the potential unmet demand for soccer among Montebello residents in this age category may be as high as six percent. If this age category represents twenty-five percent of Montebello's roughly60,000 residents, then this unmet demand would apply to 900 soccer players. If a developed soccer field can accommodate twelve teams of fifteen players each weekly (an assumption), then the use of five developed soccer fields Is required to satisfy this unmet demand for soccer In Montebello. This preliminary demand analysis assumes that current site uses are not displaced and that Montebello residents would prefer to play soccer in Montebello's parks. These $nd other assumptions would need to be carefully examined before developing additional soccer facilities.
As intended, telephone survey respondents closely resembled Montebello’s general population. The results of the telephone survey can thus be considered truly representative of the opinions and observations of the citizens of Montebello. These results reflect the views of all of Montebello’s citizens, including those who, for one reason or another, do not use Montebello’s parks or recreations services. For that reason the planning team considered them extremely important in formulating recommendations, guidelines and design concepts.
The most important conclusions of the telephone^survey include the following:
•	An overriding concern with safety and security in Montebello’s parks, especially regarding the presence of gangs in parks;
•	The importance of adequate, well-maintained park amenities such as rest rooms, children’s play equipment, drinking fountains, etc.;
•	The importance of keeping parks clean, and free of * graffiti;
•	A need for more recreation programs for seniors and youth and for day care services;

•	General satisfaction with the maintenance and appearance of park facilities; and
•	General satisfaction with the programs provided by the Department.
Written Survey/User Cjroup JVieetings
Written survey respondents were much more familiar with Montebello'sparksand recreation services and thus provided a very Important perspective to the planning process.
A written survey paralleling the telephone survey was prepared to facilitate the input of citizens who were not able to take advantage of other community participation opportunities. Written surveys were completed by 105 individuals. Written survey respondents were not generally representative of Montebello’s population; they were much more familiar with Montebello’s parks and recreation services and thus provided a very important perspective to the planning process.
As the community became increasingly aware of the recreation planning effort, it became clear to the planning team and Department staff that additional input from recreation user groups was needed. Parks and Recreation Department staff had been trained to lead small group discussions as part of the preparation for input meetings, and were thus able to facilitate input from important recreation constituencies later in the process. Most of the written surveys received resulted from these efforts.
The written surveys confirmed and clarified many of the results of the input meetings and telephone survey:

COMMUNITY PARndPATTON
The community participation component of this planning effort resulted in two important permanent resources for Montebello: a broad and reliable data base for use in implementing specific park improvements and recreation programs; and Department leadership and staff trained for and committed to ongoing community participation in the development of recreation facilities and services.
The community participation program described above brought the opinions, hopes and concerns of a wide cross section of Montebello residents directly into the planning process. Issues identified and prioritized by Montebello’s citizens formed the basis of this plan. The community’s active participation throughout the planning process ensures that the final plan and recommendations have been sufficiently refined and are fully supported.

Improving the security aspects of each park and facility, and persuading residents that they are Indeed safe, Is the first and most Important challenge fadng the Department.
"Aguardln the park makes me feel safe; walking too far from my parked car and being out In the evenlng/dark makes me feel unsafe. I'm scared to go out at night anymore; I have asked the police to patrol my neighborhood. I'm very concerned about safety."

Recommendation:
Security
"Montebello's park facilities, and recreation programs shall be developed, implemented and maintained to ensure the safety and personal security of all recreation participants and observers."
AH aspects of the community input process identified security as a critical issue. It is dear that most Montebello residents do not feel their parks are "safe" places. Considerable data, espedally from the telephone survey, support this condusion. Residents who are potential recreation services users will not attempt to use these services if they don’t feel they are "safe." Thus, improving the security aspects of each park and fadiity, and persuading residents that they are indeed safe, is the first and most important challenge fadng the Department, In turn, the Master Plan recognizes security as the most critical recommendation.
This Master Plan recommends improving the perception and the reality of security by considering each of the following aspects at each site:
•	Increase user activity and, thus, presence;
•	Provide adequate lighting in all parking, use and activity areas to eliminate dark areas during and after operating hours;
•	Promptly remove litter and graffiti;
•	Maintain all user amenities in working condition, espe-dally rest rooms and telephones;
•	Promptly repair damage caused by vandalism;
•	Generally keep grounds and fadlities dean and attractive;
•	Carefully design circulation paths to be as secure as possible;
•	Provide constant or regular site surveillance by Park Rangers and program staff, supported by dependable response of police.
CITY OF MONTEBELLO
PARKS AND RECREATION DEPARTMENT
This Master Plan further recommends upgrading Park Ranger authority to include "passive patrol," that is, the authority to ticket for parking, alcohol, and similar violations. Security considerations at each site must be closely coordinated with the Police Department to ensure maximum visibility and minimum response time by officers. It may even be possible to encourage greater on-site presence by Park Rangers and police officers by providing a comfortable place for them to take their breaks.

mmendations
Montebello's current parks and recreation programs are generally well-used, well-maintained and responsive to the community which they serve. As they continue to be renovated, upgraded or expanded, these critical recreational facilities need to be developed with a consistent commitment to quality. All of Montebello’s recreational facilities need to be durable, cost-effective, safe, and consistent with the character and quality of the community they serve.

These Design Guidelines have been prepared as a separate document as part of this Master Plan and approval of the Master. Plan constitutes adoption of the Design Guidelines. The Guidelines will function as an internal departmental tool, to be modified at the discretion of the Department.
Recommendation: Additional Facilities
"Additional recreation facilities and programs shall be developed to effectively respond to current and future recreation deficiencies in accordance with the Planning and Design Guidelines and other recommendations of this Master Plan."
The master planning process included a careful and detailed analysis of localized recreation standards for the city. Through these standards, deficiencies in Montebello’s current facilities were identified. The most critical of these are listed below:
•	Gymnasiums (2): The most prominent deficiency in the city is a gymnasium. Indoor recreation opportunities are not currently available to the general public
•	Community center: A centrally located, large community center with meeting rooms, classrooms, kitchen

and food serving facilities, equipment storage, display and exhibit capabilities and other facilities for community use is an essential element in the development of a successful recreation services program.
•	Aquatics facilities: The pool at City Park, constructed for the 1932 Olympics, is dilapidated and should be demolished and replaced. The new facility should accommodate a full range of aquatics programs including opportunities for seniors and the physically, devel-opmentally and mentally disabled. Complete replacement of the aquatics facility at Holifieid Park is also recommended.
•	Ball fields (2-3): The need for ball fields In the city is currently accommodated by maximum use of city facilities and joint use of some school facilities. Though the continued sharing of School District facilities is highly recommended, development of two to three additional ball fields is also recommended. One to two fields are required to meet existing deficiencies; an additional field will be necessary should the ball field at City Park be relocated as recommended. These facilities will be adequate to accommodate existing needs as well as any needs generated by an expanded adult softball program, another recommendation of this Master Plan.
•	Independent soccer field: The Department currently does not sponsor any soccer programs, and it is recommended that the Department begin to offer such programs. To accommodate this need, an independent soccer field (one not overlaid on a ball field) is required.

Recommendation: Additional Acreage
RECOMMENDATIONS
"Additional park land and recreation sites or facilities shall be sought and acquired to respond to current and future recreation deficiencies, and shall be developed in accordance with the Planning and Design Guidelines and other recommendations of this Master Plan."
Three options exist for responding to deficiencies not able to be accommodated within existing park sites or facilities:
•	Acquire additional park land;
•	Develop joint use agreements with the School District and other recreational providers; or
•	Allow the deficiencies to remain. ~

COMPREHENSIVE PARKS AND RECREATION MASTER PLAN
48
RECOMMENDATIONS
The Master Plan supports accommodation of deficient facilities through the acquisition of additional park lands. Limited opportunities exist for such acquisition in Montebello. The vacant lot north of Holifieid and the armory building adjacent to City Park are two opportunities; the site at the comer of Maple and Mines Avenues is another.
Public opinion was divided on the question of acquisition of the Maple and Mines site for a park. Concerns were expressed for the impact on area residents and the safety of children crossing the railroad. Because no consensus was reached, acquisition of the site is not a strong recommendation of the Master Plan. The consultants feel, however, that the site has tremendous potential to alleviate some of the city's recreation deficiencies and that the concerns expressed, while quite valid, could be mitigated.
The planned development of the Chevron hillside properly represents a significant opportunity to address city-wide recreation deficiencies.
The planned development of the Chevron hillside property represents a significant opportunity to address city-wide recreation deficiencies identified in the previous recommendation. Development of this property also includes the rare opportunity to return or maintain some limited ravine or hillside terrain in its natural state for use as a natural facility. It is recommended that the City attempt to maximize open space in this area.
This Master Plan strongly recommends expanded Joint use of school facilities for the benefit of both agencies and to provide needed recreation facilities to the community as a whole.
The Parks and Recreation Department currently shares facilities with the schools in a number of instances. This Master Plan strongly recommends expanded joint use of school facilities for the benefit of both agencies and the community as* a whole. Such facilities must be accessible to the general public, as well as the disabled community, while maintaining the security of school grounds. Because of limited acreage available for acquisition, this joint use may be the most effective means of providing deficient recreation opportunities and for minimizing acquisition, maintenance and operations cost for all those agencies involved.
It is opposed to the spirit and intent of this Master Plan to recommend that any current or future recreational deficiencies be allowed to remain.

RECOMMENDATIONS
A process to identify, develop and evaluate needed programs and services has been provided to the City as a part of the Master Plan.
The City of Montebello Parks and Recreation Department provides programs and services for its residents in four major areas: recreation, education, public service and health, safety and welfare. The Department recognizes that identifying and providing such programs and services is as critical a responsibility as providing and maintaining parks and facilities. A process to identify, develop and evaluate needed programs and services has been provided to the City as a part of the Master Plan.
Promotion of all aspects of the Department's programs, facilities and services is essential to their full utilization.
Some conflicts exist between recreation and non-recreation uses of park sites and facilities. The most obvious of these is the Satellite School program that is conducted in a number of the parks. It is recommended that the Department assist the School District in locating other facilities for these programs.
Recommendation: Community Relations
The Parks and Recreation Department shall promote the use of its parks, facilities, programs and services to all Montebello residents through the effective use of local media, signage and information at parks and other locations, and by participation in appropriate public events and forums,"
It was clear at many stages of the input and data gathering process that the public was not aware of many facilities and programs offered by the Department. Promotion of all aspects of these programs, facilities and services is essential to their foil utilization.

Capita! Improvements P rogram
The Master Plan proposes improvements to the recreation system and parks to be implemented over the next twenty years. This section of the Master Plan outlines the priorities for implementation of the recommendations, possible funding sources and procedures for the development of capital improvement projects within the City.
Priorities Summary
The priorities developed for the Capital Improvements Program (CIP) are based on a number of factors. The first factor is the priority given to each of the recommendations by the community and City staff and officials during review of the Draft Master Plan. Another is the funds available and earmarked for certain projects or areas. A third factor is federal or state mandates such as ADA requirements. Also considered in the development of priorities is the professional expertise of the planning consultant in interpreting community needs and the city recreational deficiencies.
The priorities developed for the Capital Improvements Program (CIP) are based on a number of factors. The first factor Is the priority given to each of the recommendations by the community and City staffand officials during review of the Draft Master Plan.
When the focus groups were asked to rank the original recommendations in the Draft Master Plan, the two that ranked significantly higher than the other recommendations were the security program and the basic park amenities package; ranked third was existing parks. These three recommendations focus on improving the condition of Montebello’s existing facilities; support for the improvement of City Park was given special emphasis.
The central recreation district ranked fourth in priority. This recommendation includes agreements with the School
COMPREHENSIVE PARKS AND RECREATION MASTER PLAN
56
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PROGRAM
District and private organizations such as St. Benedicts Catholic Church and School, cis well as improvement of their facilities to meet ADA standards and the needs of public recreation facilities.
One alternative to providing additional faculties is to develop joint use agreements with the School District. Whereas the agreements themselves would not require CP funds, improvements to District facilities would.
Community relations, additional facilities and park lands were given the next highest priority, respectively. The public relations program will be implemented as part of Department policy and will not require GP funds. One alternative to providing additional facilities is to develop joint use agreements with the School District, Whereas the agreements themselves would not require CIP funds, improvements to District facilities would. Cost estimates are not provided in the Master Plan because such agreements are yet to be developed and it is beyond the scope of this Master Plan to evaluate District facilities. However, it is recommended that the City designate a portion of CIP funds for such purposes.
A number of opportunities exist to acquire additional park acreage. Proposals for City and Holifield Parks recommend acquiring additional land, and the Ashiya Park proposal includes annexing the Via Corona right-of-way. Park acreage will also be provided through the Chevron development. Acquisition of the Maple and Mines site was researched and divergent community input was obtained. The expense of acquisition and improvement would be significant. Because of the prohibitive expense and a lack of consensus from the community, acquisition of the Maple and Mines site Is relegated to a low priority. Although acquisition of other lands In the city is recommended, no opportunities exist at this time and such acquisitions have not been identified as a GP.
The street tree program and the recreation trail were eighth and ninth on the priority list. Consequently, these programs will be implemented as part of the City’s ongoing tree program and will be funded by grants or sources designated for street trees and public rights-of-way.
A number of recommendations (recreation system; recreation planning guidelines; design guidelines; programs and services; and community participation) were added to the Master Plan as a result of comments on the Draft Master Plan and thus were not prioritized with the original recommendations. Like community relations, these recommendations will
CITY OF MONTEBELLO PARKS AND RECREATION DEPARTMENT

be implemented as Department policy and do not require CIP funds.
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PROGRAM
Improvements to City Park, Grant Rea Park and Holifield Park specified as part of the ADA Transition Plan are required to be implemented within three to five years. These improvements are given priority in CIP funding allocations.
For the purposes of developing the five year and twenty year goals, it is assumed that the funds needed to implement the plan (approximately thirty-one million dollars) will be . available over the twenty year period of this Master Plan.
For the purposes of developing the five year and twenty year goals. It Is assumed that the hinds needed to implement the plan (approximately thirty-one million dollars) will be available over the twenty year period of this Master Plan.
The City currently has funds available for improvements to City Park. Los Angeles County Proposition A, which passed in the fall of 1992, allocates $1.47 million to City Park for the Senior Center and a new aquatics facility. Another $0.43 million will come to the city from “per parcel” funds. Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) funds may be available in 1993 for improvements to Taylor Ranch.
Five Year Plan
Capital improvement projects to be implemented in the first five years were chosen based on currently available funds, ADA requirements and the pressing needs of the city. It is assumed that somewhat more than a proportional amount of the funds will be spent in this initial period. Projects designated for construction within the first five years of Master Plan implementation are listed below.
Capital improvement projects to be Implemented In the first five years were chosen based on currently available funds, ADA requirements and the pressing needs of the city.
Gty Park aquatics facility and Senior Center expansion, $4.6 million: The majority of this money is available through Proposition A funds, but additional money will be required for completion. Provision and improvement of a new ball field to replace the displaced field will be included in this phase. This project is tentatively scheduled to begin in 1994.
Taylor Ranch Cultural Arts Center, $2.3 million: CRA -funding should be pursued for this site. If those funds are not available, other funding should be identified and the project should be implemented within the first five years.
COMPREHENSIVE PARKS AND RECREATION MASTER PLAN
58
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PROGRAM
Holifield Park gymnasium, $2.8 million: A funding source has not yet been identified for this project but the severe deficiency of indoor athletics opportunities in Montebello warrants that the project go forward within the first phase of Master Plan implementation.
ADA compliance at City, Grant Rea and Holifield Parks, $0.25 million: The ADA Transition Plan is being prepared concurrently with this Master Plan so detailed cost estimates are not yet available.
IfCDBG funds cannot be used to make significant contributions to other priority CIP projects listed and/or in progress, the funds should be used to provide critical aspects of the security program.
CDBG Funds: If current funding levels are maintained, Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds will be available at a rate of approximately $300,000 per year for the first five years of the project. These funds are stipulated to be expended in the year that they are granted, however, so the projects to which they can be applied are limited. If these funds cannot be used to make significant contributions to other priority CIP projects listed and/or in progress, the funds should be used to provide critical aspects of the security program. In City, Reggie Rodriguez and Holifield Parks, widened walkways and lighting can be efficiently implemented independent of the other recommendations for those parks. Priority should be given respectively as the parks are listed, it should also be noted that if CDBG funds do not continue at current levels, adjustments to these budgets will be necessary.

Year Plan
Changes In priorities and the availability of funds will Inevitably occur over the next twenty years. Therefore, general priorities have been established to provide guidelines for Implementation decisions in the future.
As a goal, implementation of the remaining recommendations in the Master Plan will occur within a twenty year period. Changes in priorities and the availability of funds will inevitably occur over that time. Therefore, general priorities have been established to provide guidelines for implementation decisions in the future.
In general, the projects identified for the first five years of Master Plan implementation address the most severe recreation deficiencies in the city. The proposals for a community
*	center in City Park and a swimming pool at Holifield Park, and
associated land acquisition if feasible, also address significant deficiencies. For this reason, these two projects should be given highest priority among remaining recommendations.
CITY OF MONTEBELLO PARKS AND RECREATION DEPARTMENT
A primary consideration in the selection of projects for construction is the amount of available funds. It is more efficient to implement all improvements proposed for a park at one time, but often this is not possible. City Park and Holifield Park will require a phasing plan for implementation. The phasing for City Park is established as follows:
Phase 1: Senior Center expansion and aquatics facility. Phase 2: Community Center and central plaza.
Phase 3: Land acquisition and gymnasium.
Holifield Park should be phased as follows:
Phase 1: Gymnasium, recreation center and central plaza. Phase 2: Land acquisition (if feasible) and aquatics facility. Phase 3: Basketball courts and general site improve-
ments.
Another phasing option is to construct pieces of a park plan that are easily separated from the overall plan, for example, field and court lighting. The highest priority of this option, however, is to provide widened walkways and security lighting. It is possible to do this efficiently in City, Ashiya, Potrero Heights, Grant Rea and Acuna Parks. Priority should be given to those parks in the order listed.

Another phasing option is to construct pieces of a park plan that areeasllyseparatedfrom the overall park plan. The highest priority of this option is to provide widened walkways and security lighting.
Given the potential contribution of the proposed park improvements to recreation in all of Montebello, improvement priorities for the individual park have been established as follows:
•	City Park
•	Taylor Ranch Cultural Arts Center
•	Chet Holifield Park
•	Reggie Rodriguez Park
•	Hemy Acuna Park
•	Ashiya Park
•	Grant Rea Park

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS PROGRAM
As a goal, the Qty should spend five percent of their capital Improvements budget on thestreet tree program and recreation trail.
Because the city is essentially built out, developer fees and benefit assessment programs do not exist to any significant degree. Therefore. the Parks and Recreation De~ partmentmustbecomem uch more creative in their efforts to obtain funds.
The street tree program and the recreation trail were given a low priority in the review of the Draft Master Plan. Consequently, these recommendations should be implemented as a part of the City’s ongoing tree program. The street improvements required for implementation of the central recreation district should also be funded in this manner. As a goal, the City should spend five percent of their capital improvements budget on these improvements.
Some recommendations in the Master Plan will cause ancillary costs to the City. Examples of these costs include improvements to recreation facilities at sites in the central recreation district (other than City Park), as well as improvements to private and school facilities that are subjects of joint use agreements when those facilities do not comply with ADA standards, it is not within the scope of this Master Plan to evaluate these improvements or to estimate their associated costs. However, the City should keep these expenditures in mind as the recommendations are implemented.
Funding Opportunities
Some of the traditional sources of funding for parks and recreation facilities are not available to Montebello. Because the city is essentially built out, developer fees and benefit assessment programs do not exist to any significant degree. Therefore, the Parks and Recreation Department must become much more creative in their efforts to obtain funds. The summary below lists some of these alternative sources for funding and key points in applying for and receiving therr*.
•	Bonds: Bonds are likely to sell, however, developing a good plan and gamering public support can be difficult.
•	New infrastructure funds: In the current political and social climate, inner cities will probably receive fends for infrastructure; the best opportunity will be for projects that provide jobs and also provide a positive diversion for youth.
•	Land and Water Conservation Funds: This source may be a viable one for parks and recreation improvements in the new Administration.
CITY OF MONTEBELLO PARKS AND RECREATION DEPARTMENT

• Matching funds: Providing matching local funds to any federal source is attractive and will increase chances of receiving support.
•	Grants: Grants should not be relied upon for fending, although innovative proposals may increase fending opportunities.
•	Housing and Urban Development and Department of Transportation: These fends are likely to be more available in the new administration to those with innovative proposals.
•	Community Redevelopment Agency and Community Development Block Grant Funds: Certain parks within the system qualify for these fends and such fends are available within the City.
•	Montebello Municipal Golf Course: The recently completed Golf Course Master Plan proposes improvements that, when implemented, will result in a significant increase in income from course operations. These fends could provide a new source of fends for the Parks and Recreation Department.
• Chevron Development: Development of the hillside property will result in tremendous opportunities for enhancement of the park system. Policy in the Open Space Element of the General Plan states that "two hundred acres in the hills should be acquired by the City for parks, playgrounds and open space." Not only should the site itself provide significant passive and active recreation facilities, but negotiations with the developer should result in the provision of needed recreation facilities elsewhere in the city. Per-unit developer fees, turn-key parks, developer agreements and other options are available to the City. A professional consultant should be enlisted to represent the City in its negotiations with Chevron.
The Master Plan recommends that the Department pursue all of these sources. Preparation and awareness of opportunities are critical to the success of receiving such fends. Maintaining a current list offending options is an effective strategy,

rocess
The Parks and Recreation Depart-ment will cany primary responsibility for developing Requests for Proposals for all park improvements.
The Parks and Recreation Department must work closely with the Public Works Department and other departments in the City to implement the proposals of the Master Plan. The following paragraphs outline a process for consultant selection, plan review and approval and construction administration to be established within the City of Montebello for park improvement projects.
The Parks and Recreation Department wilt conduct a public input an d review process for conceptual planning and design of parks.
The Parks and Recreation Department will carry primary responsibility for developing Requests for Proposals (RFP) for all park improvements. The Public Works Department will assist in the preparation of the RFP boilerplate, including licensure requirements, insurance requirements and other issues. The Parks and Recreation Department will also prepare the “short list," interview potential consultants and make the final determination on consultant selection.

The Parks and Recreation Department will conduct a public input and review process for conceptual planning and design of parks. During this phase, the Department will provide the concept plans to other departments for review on an as-needed basis.
As a viable alternative, the depart-mentshould contract with an independent professional to provide expert review of construction documents.
The Parks and Recreation Department, the Public Works Department and the Building Department will review all contract documents. Other departments that may require input will be identified on a project by project basis, including the Police Department when security issues are involved. The Parks and Recreation Department currently does not have staff with the expertise to review construction document packages. As a viable alternative, the Department should contract with independent professionals to provide expert review of construction documents. Conformance with ADA requirements by an ADA expert should be included in this review.

Individual Park Concepts
The Master Plan recommends that “The use of existing park sites and facilities shaii be optimized consistent with appropriate community input; recreation system considerations and identified recreation deficiencies; quality recreation planning and design; and cost and security considerations/
As an adjunct to this recommendation, conceptual, programmatic studies of the eight parks were undertaken based on the input provided during the master planning process. The following summaries and diagrams present the results of these studies.
The Master Plan emphasizes that these preliminary studies are conceptual and programmatic in nature. Whereas they illustrate many of the recommendations of the Master Plan, they do not represent definitive design solutions for the parks. Data and analysis beyond the scope of a master planning level study is required to develop site plans for the parks. As stated in the Recommendations Chapter of the Master Plan, such site plans shall he prepared with the input of the community and in accordance with the planning and design guidelines.

The community center will be located on the piaza on the site of the existing pool. Consideration should be given to transferring the name from the Katherine Hensel Youth Center, when it is removed, to the new community center.
The pool will be removed and a new aquatics facility will be rebuilt on the east side of the plaza. The Master Plan proposes that the armoiy building be acquired, and renovated for a gymnasium to include boxing and weight lifting facilities and storage for the Department’s rental program. New outdoor basketball courts will be located adjacent to the gym.
The senior center will be expanded to the area behind the existing building. Parking will be removed from that area and provided along Taylor Avenue in front of the senior center.
The Girl Scout House will be removed and in its place will be park rest rooms and a serving facility for the patio. A shade structure will be provided for the amphitheater.
To accommodate the proposed changes to City Park, the existing ball field must be relocated. The Montebello Stars have a very successful and worthwhile baseball program that must continue on a quality baseball facility. The new ball field must be identified and ready for play without interruption to the Stars’ program before the existing field is demolished. Alternative locations for the field include the Schurr, Montebello and Cantwell High School fields.
Funds will soon be available for the construction of the aquatics facility in City Park and construction of that facility will displace the ball field. If a new ball field cannot be identified in that relatively short period of time, consideration should be given to relocating the aquatics facility, essentially switching its location with the basketball courts. It is recommended, however, that a diligent effort to find a new field take place so that this modification is not necessary.
City Park has been designated as an ADA priority park. Upgrades to the park that bring accessibility into conformance with ADA criteria will be given priority in the Capital Improvements Program.

PARK CONCEPTS
Grant Rea Park
Grant Rea Park serves the city as its community sports complex. The five ball fields and the football field accommodate the majority of the city-sponsored sports leagues. The Barnyard Zoo is a popular attraction for the city's residents.
The intensity and variety of activity at Grant Rea Park results in some conflicts. Vehicle routes encroach into pedestrian areas and parking is inadequate during peak use hours. As with many of Montebello’s parks, there is no central space at Grant Rea Park. Also, the active sports dominate the park to such an extent that the neighborhood park function is neglected.
As proposed, the recreation building and other elements of the basic amenities package will be concentrated at the south end of the park to minimize the impact on adjacent residents. Included with the recreation building will be the central plaza and new play equipment. The existing play equipment will be removed and additional picnic shelters will be provided.
The existing recreation building at the north end of the park will remain, including the rest rooms and snack shack. The storage building behind Diamond Two and the trash structure will be removed. Storage for the youth sports organizations will be provided elsewhere on the site, whether in the existing recreation building or a new facility.
A traffic study will be performed to determine whether the parking at Grant Rea can be made more efficient. It is possible that additional spaces can be provided simply by reducing the dimensions of the existing parking lot spaces to current standards.
77ie recreation building and other elements of the basic amenities package will be concentrated at the south end of the park to minimize the impact on adjacent residents.

Chet Hoiifield Park is located in a densely urban, industrial setting. The harsh edge along Greenwood Avenue and three adjacent apartment buildings (as well as Frankel Avenue which bisects the site) allow the industrial character to infringe upon the park. Recreational facilities are over-programmed, and a number of those facilities are in a noticeable state of disrepair. Significant visual softening is needed, along with reorganization of the facilities so that the park provides relief from its urban surroundings.
Significant changes have been proposed for Hoiifield Park. A new gymnasium with a recreation center and a renovated aquatics facility are proposed adjacent to a central plaza, established to provide better organization for the site. The basketball courts will be relocated to make room for the gymnasium. A new aquatics facility is proposed, including a 25 yard by 25 meter swimming pool. Additional parking will be provided along Frankel Avenue and by the redesign of the existing library parking lot to ninety degree parking.
The Master Plan proposes that the adjacent lot to the northeast (along Washington Boulevard) be acquired for park expansion. Additional park acreage is needed to accommodate this facility-intense proposal. The Master Plan recognizes that acquisition of this land may not be feasible, and provides diagrams that address either option.

Taylor Ranch Cultural Arts Center
Taylor Ranch has served the city for years as a cultural arts center. The historic relevance of this site is very significant in the city. A variety of cultural and arts programs for seniors are provided at the old Taylor ranch house and the-renovated bam. The gazebo and water feature are often the setting for wedding pictures and receptions, but the picnic areas are not used as often as those in other parks in the city.
The ranch house has become dilapidated over the years and is in need of replacement. In contrast, the bam is in good condition and retains some historical significance. A large portion of the site, between the ranch house and the parking lot, is currently under-used. This area presents tremendous opportunities for the renovation of the site.

Henry Acuna Park functions very well as a passive neighborhood park. The unstructured open space in the park and the variety of activities that take place there illustrates the value of this type of setting in an urban environment.
While the site contains many of the basic amenities, these facilities are in need of repair or replacement. Vegetation seems to be stunted on the site so that adequate shade is not available. The Parks and Recreation Department office has meeting rooms available for public use, but still does not provide a central gathering space for the park.

Ashiya Park
The most significant factor affecting Ashiya Park is its location within a Southern California Edison Company power easement. Opportunities in the park are severely restricted by the conditions of that easement. Additionally, Beverly Boulevard and Via Corona cross the site, essentially dividing it into three separate parks. For these reasons the park appears to be under-used, even though it is the only facility serving the western area of the city.
The northwest portion of the park includes a significant fiat area that could support a variety of recreation activities. The dominating hill also provides an opportunity for a setting that is unique in the Montebello park system. Improvements in Ashiya Park focus on increasing the efficiency of the park within its existing boundaries.
The most significant proposal for Ashiya Park is the removal of that portion of Via Corona that passes through the park. The abandoned right-of-way will be planted with turf and trees, thus combining the two southern portions of the park into more usable recreation space.
In the north portion of the park, an addition to the existing recreation building is proposed to accommodate those portions of the basic amenities package that do not currently exist The play equipment will be relocated near the central plaza; the walkway that crosses the park near Beverly Boulevard will be removed to provide a more functional open space. A number of picnic shelters will be added to the park to provide shade and shelter, since planting of trees is greatly restricted by height regulations.

Potrero Heights Park is the least-known major park in the Montebello system. Located north of the Pomona freeway, the park serves only five percent of the city’s population. Many residents do not even know it exists and it is likely that most users are residents of Rosemead or the County. Negative influences from gangs outside the city have increased concerns about security and vandalism.

Other minor recreation sites exist in the city ofMontebello that were not specifically included in this Master Plan. They have been given consideration as the recreation system has been evaluated, however, and some broad recommendations can be made:
The sites include: Bicknell Park, located at the Montebello Municipal Golf Course: John Dutcher Tot Lot on Garfield Avenue below the golf course: Sanchez Adobe on Adobe Avenue above Lincoln-, Iguala Park on Iguala Street off Liberty Avenue: and Northridge Mini-Park on Arroyo Drive off Paramount Boulevard. Sanchez Adobe is an historical landmark in the city and is operated by the Historical Society. Bicknell Park consists of open space and the Armenian Monument. John Dutcher Tot Lot and Northridge Mini-park have play equipment and other minor amenities that are generally in poor condition. Iguala Park is currently a vacant lot adjacent to a closed landfill.
V
Bicknell Park, due to its isolated location on the golf course, cannot function as a neighborhood mini-park. Functions are generally restricted to picnicking and cultural festivals at the Armenian Monument The site should be enhanced with picnic tables, barbecues and other facilities to accommodate large gatherings.
The other four sites are located in residential areas and can function as classic neighborhood mini-parks. Similar to the major parks, these mini-parks should include an abbreviated version of the basic amenities package.

u﻿population element

INTRODUCTION:
The population of Montebello numbered 42,807 in 1970, according to the Federal Census of that year. That figure represented a 33.4% increase over the population in 1960, which was determined by the census to be 32,097. Since 1970, the population has grown to an established 44,500 (according to the State Department of Finance: February 1, 1973).
This population growth rate is not a new phenomenon in Montebello, but rather has been sustained over the past 40 years. The City’s population increased over 45 percent between 1930 and 1940, over 171 percent between 1940 and 1950, and almost 48 percent between 1950 and 1960. The current growth rate — about 3.3% per year — exceeds that of all surrounding communities except Monterey Park.
With the growth of the population has come a gentle shift in its characteristics. Residents of Montebello today tend to be younger, more prosperous, and members of small family units than formerly; educational achievement has changed too, with a decrease in the average number of school years completed and an increase in the proportion of students completing high school and enrolling in college.
Another integral aspect of this population increase has been the rising proportion (47%) of Spanish-surname people. This group has distributed throughout the population at all age, economic, and educational levels as well as all physical locations of the City.
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
PURPOSE:
The purpose of this population element is to analyze existing population characteristics and to develop projections for future populations of the City.
GOALS:
1.	To assure that the various elements of the General Plan are developed in compatibility with the needs of the people of Montebello.
2.	To raise an awareness of the characteristics of the people of Montebello so that they may be more aptly served by their public facilities and programs.

OBJECTIVES:
1.	To determine present and project future size and distributions of population, in order to be able to distribute public services on a planned basis.
2.	To determine special needs associated with specific segments of the population.
3.	To define standards for density and distribution of popula-
tion.	~
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
CONSTRAINTS:
1.	Existing Conditions: The current population of Montebello is 44,500 and, with its total urban environment, occupies 79 percent of the land area. Existing land use and housing type arrangements do much to determine density patterns and distributions of population: this distribution is estimated at about 22 people per acre in areas of low density housing areas, almost 30 people per acre in mixed housing areas, and almost 40 people per acre in high density areas.
2.	Age level and income distributions in Montebello parallel those for the County in general. Potential problems may be associated with the amount of poverty in the City (according to U. S. Bureau of Census definitions nearly 8% of all residents) and the decline in number of school years completed (according to Development Research Associates). High absorp tion of recently constructed multiple-unit housing indicates a demand for it in Montebello’s location. The City through its community leaders determine the degree of growth to be accommodated in Montebello at which locations, and at which densities.
3.	Facilities and Services Support System. Ability to accommodate new population is limited by the ability of the City
to service additional people. A major constraint in Montebello is utilities; current capabilities in the undeveloped portion of the hills limit population there to 14,000 people Additional constraints are abilities to provide schools, recreational facilities, and government services for new population.
4.	Zoning. The holding capacity of the current zoning map for the City is 90,000-100,000 people.
-3-
5.	Citizen Attitudes. Returns from the Citizen Attitude Survey, conducted in January, 1973, indicated a preference for ultimate population size of 45,000-55,000. Community leaders in the same survey indicated a preference for a City of 55,000-65,000. The Citizens’ Advisory Committee developed as a target an ultimate limit not to exceed 60,000 people.
POLICIES:
1.	The ultimate size of Montebello should be about 60,000-
70,000 people, distributed throughout the City as indicated in the Housing Element of the General Plan. Population growth from the current 44,500 people to the ultimate community size will be guided by density standards as indicated on the General Plan and will be characterized by development of residential uses in the hills and some intensification of residential uses in the flatlands. Present and projected populations for the City as a whole as well for three sub-areas are indicated below; the subareas are outlined on
the accompanying map. Sub-Area	1970	Proj ected
North Montebello	10,211	30,900
Central Montebello	16,794	19,200
South Montebello	15,802	17,200
Total:	42,807	67,300
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
2.	Because no specific segments of the population are unexpectedly large or have previously unidentified needs, no new special programs or facilities are determined to be necessary at this time. This situation will be reevaluated periodically in order to insure that such needs are provided for as they arise.
3.	Population density will vary according to type of housing. Generally, this density should aim for the following levels:
Hillside low density areas Low density areas Medium density areas High density areas Very high density areas
Dwelling Units Per Acre

﻿INTRODUCTION:
Early identification of potential areas of blight and decay within the City enables the community to activate various programs, improvement actions, and police power mechanisms designed to stem the continued expansion of that blight and to rehabilitate and revitalize affected areas. The identification of areas with existing or potential problems is not to be construed as an indication that the area does not warrant continuing investment or that new development should not occur; instead, the designation of areas for investigation and action within the Redevelopment Element is intended to spur both public and private action to correct known problems and create a healthy area warranting continued public and private investment and confidence.
PURPOSE:
The purpose of the Redevelopment Element of the General Plan is twofold; first, to designate the areas in which conditions of blight are found, and second, to identify the plans and programs which will lead to the elimination of blighted areas within the City of Montebello. Authorization for preparation of this element is contained in the California Government Code, Section 65303.
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
DEFINITIONS:
Redevelopment is defined under California law (Health and Safety Code Section 33020) as ’’the planning, development, replanning, redesign, clearance, reconstruction, or rehabilitation, or any combination of these of all, or part of the survey area, and the provisions of such residential, commercial, industrial, public, or other structures or spaces as may be appropriate or necessary in the interest of the general welfare including recreational and other facilities incidental or pertinent to them.” Redevelopment does not exclude the retention of existing buildings or uses where they are deemed essential to the redevelopment or rehabilitation of the area, or where they are deemed to be compatible with the proposed redevelopment of the area.
-1-
Blight is defined as conditions of deterioration, debilitation, or disfunction which exists within an area or areas of the city, characterized by substandard conditions, obsolescense, social and economic maladjustment, and other conditions which threaten the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the community, both those residing within the area and those without.
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES:
Goals established by the citizens of the community both in 19701 and 19 73^ indicate a substantial concern with community maintenance and revitalization. The goals established in 1970 were:
1.	Cooperate with private enterprise, community and public agencies and commissions in identifying areas and establishing priorities, objectives, and workable programs for the systematic maintenance and revitalization of residential, commercial, and industrial neighborhoods.
2.	Identify pockets of declining or unstable economic land use characteristics and develop methods of a continuing inventory of such areas.
3.	All neighborhood revitalization programs shall be coordinated with and complimentary to the goals and objectives established in the land use element of the plan.
4.	Examine and outline programs to facilitate the revitalization of neighborhoods. This shall include coordination of all city departmental services, as well as all other private and public agencies.
5.	Examine systems for public right-of-way vacations and reductions to effect property consolidations in connection with revitalization programs.
6.	The objectives of neighborhood revitalization programs shall be to improve the environmental quality within the neighborhoods and encourage private investments, broaden the tax base, avoid economic waste, increase retail sales, provide employment and improve housing in the manner consistent with other community goals.
^Montebello City Planning Commission.

Citizens Advisory Committee, Montebello General Plan Program, -2-
j
7.	Continuously evaluate the needs, problems and condition of housing within the City and endeavor to maintain an adequate supply of good housing through programs of code modification and enforcement and incentives to private developers.
8.	Set guidelines for supporting land use maintenance codes and enforcement programs.
A subcommittee of the Citizens Advisory Committee in 1973 developed the following goal:
Identification of declining areas should be made by the City’s Department of Community Development.
CONSTRAINTS:
The City of Montebello has few instances of marked deterioration, although some factors which characterize blight are found throughout the City. Four areas have been determined to contain sufficient conditions of blight to warrant the designation of these areas for further study and action by the community. These four areas and the factors which contri bute to the designation of each of these areas are discussed in the following paragraphs and are designated as improvement areas on the redevelopment element map.
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
South Montebello Industrial Area:
The south portion of the City of Montebello is devoted primarily to industrial activities. Development in the area has been inhibited by such factors as poor utility service, rail-road-roadway conflicts, and inadequate streets. The land has been primarily devoted to land demanding uses, particularly trucking facilities and open storage activities. As new development has gradually occurred in this area, problems have become more apparent. This area was designated for further study and potential redevelopment and revitalization for reasons which include, but are not limited to the following:
1.	Street design. Streets that exist in the study area are inadequate to provide for reasonably unrestricted movement of vehicles through the South Montebello area. Congestion and conflicts exist as people and vehicles attempt to move into, out of, and through particularly that area south of Sycamore Street and north of the Santa Ana Freeway. Problems are amplified by construction of movements caused by such major physical barriers as the Santa Ana Freeway, the Rio Hondo Channel, and the Santa Fe Railroad.
-3-
2.	Vehicular-railroad conflict. North-south traffic movement in Montebello, particularly in the southern portion of the City, is restricted to a single unseparated grade crossing of the Santa Fe Railroad at Greenwood Avenue. Vehicular movement is restricted and substantial traffic backup occurs along Greenwood Avenue when this crossing is blocked by a train.
3.	Properties with inadequate access. Lack of adequate street access to some properties in South Montebello area has inhibited their development. As a result, these properties are underutilized and represent stagnant, non-productive lands which could otherwise be useful and valuable to the economic well being of the City.
4.	Mixed land use. Residential uses are inter-mixed with industrial uses in the area; the basic standard of building and site improvement and maintenance found in these residential uses is poor. This situation represents an undesirable social condition as well as a deterrent to investment in the area.
5.	Drainage. Drainage is poor in some areas of South Montebello. In particular, this condition exists in the vicinity of Greenwood Avenue and Maple Street and at the intersection of Gage Road and Union Avenue.
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
Whittier and Beverly Boulevard Development
The land which lies along the two major east-west streets of Montebello, Whittier Boulevard and Beverly Boulevard, could potentially offer sites for commercial services facilities as well as contribute to the economic welfare of the community through the generation of sales and property taxes. The full potential of these streets, though, is not realized at the present time because they are developed in the strip-zoned street pattern typical of many urban areas. Activities which occur side by side are often unrelated and in some cases incompatible. Specific factors which have lead to the designation of these two boulevards for further study include, but are not limited to:
1.	Land use. Unused and under-utilized land and buildings represent an unproductive condition of the land. Commercially zoned lands along Whittier Boulevard are substantially developed; however, there are approximately 15 acres of commercially zoned land on Beverly Boulevard
-4-
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973

not occupied by commercial use. Both major streets are characterized by vacancy in their existing commercial structures. In early 1973 Beverly Boulevard was found by the City of Montebello Planning Department to contain 42,757 square feet of commercial use, of which 5 percent was vacant. Whittier Boulevard contained 104,940 square feet, of which 12 percent was vacant. These vacancy factors, however, do not fully illustrate the vacancy problem which exists on these two main streets, as indicated by high turnover rates in some structures and apparently marginal operations in others.
2.	Congestion and conflict. As is experienced in other areas of strip commercial development, conflicts exist between local auto traffic seeking to attain access to or egress from commercial establishments and other activities located on the major streets in competition with traffic utilizing the streets for crosstown travel. In the areas of the more intensive commercial development, pedestrian crossing of the streets further amplifies the problems of auto movement and circulation.
3.	Inadequate lot size and insufficient off-street parking.
Many of the commercial properties which front on Beverly Boulevard and Whittier Boulevard are of inadequate size or inappropriate shape for efficient commercial use.
The lots are generally too narrow and shallow to allow for adequate off-street parking. Creation of parking districts, which has begun downtown, is one method of providing adequate parking; other arrangements must be made in areas where this method if not feasible.
4.	Incompatible or undesirable arrangement of land uses.
While there is sufficient market support to permit commercial development of many of the properties along these main boulevards, some parcels have remained undeveloped or have been devoted to uses incompatible with other uses already existing along the streets. Residential uses, for example, have been mixed with commercial uses; the resulting condition is not beneficial. In some cases the inability to establish a productive and revenue producing use of these lots along the main streets has left the land stagnant and unproductive; it could be redeveloped to contribute to the welfare of both the property owners and the City.

North Montebello Hill Area
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
The hill area, between the Pomona Freeway and Lincoln Boulevard, is the major remaining undeveloped property in the City. This property has for many years been devoted to oil recovery operations and is only now beginning to be converted to urban uses. Although development has begun in the lower and flatter portions of the hills, conditions in the remaining hill area present problems to its urbanization in a manner consistent with City objectives. Primary concern of the community must be with the proper utilization of this last remaining undeveloped area to assure that it will contribute positively to the health, safety, and welfare of the City. In particular, the Land Use Element of the General Plan for the City calls for this area to be devoted to residential and commercial activities. The development of this property in the most desirable manner may be impaired by:
1.	Topography. The topography of the hill area is such that in many cases extensive grading would be required to locate housing or commercial activity on the land. The need to grade, though, conflicts with the substantial community interest in protecting and preserving the natural quality of the hill area and in conserving some of the more scenic and unusual areas to be utilized for park and open space purposes by the entire community.
2.	Utilities and Streets. At the present time the area is characterized by an inadequacy in the streets and utilities systems. Provision of an adequate street system for both through and local traffic is essential to the proper use
of this land. Similarly, adequate utility service must be available to assure that the development of the hill area does not burden the community with the creation of new public.facilities and services to serve that new department.
3.	Natural Resource Utilization. The hill area is now primarily devoted to oil recovery operations, with a portion of the area also used for underground storage of natural gas. It
is anticipated that oil operations will continue for some time but then gradually be phased out; gas storage is expected to continue indefinitely. While these operations will not necessarily prevent development of the hills, they may have an inhibiting effect unless the interface between the utilization of these natural resources and the development of urban activities is carefully controlled.
-6-
4.	Utility Easements and Rights-of-Way. The northeast area of the hills is crossed by several major electric transmission lines, located there when urbanization of the hills was not anticipated, and no projection of the types and arrangement of uses which might locate on there had been made. The configuration and alignment of these lines make proper utilization of a significant portion of the hills as envisioned by the General Plan difficult. Realignment of these easements and rights-of-way and possible consolidation of rights-of-way is necessary to assure a proper development of the portions of the hill area affected by them.
5.	Adjacent Land Uses. The land fill operation which abuts the City of Montebello exists as a major influence on the hills. Although the cover and fill operation is ultimately designated for a recreational open space use, its present character and height impair the proper utilization of lands immediately adjacent to it, cause other problems such as blowing dust and debris not contained on the site, and contribute to the continuing deterioration of the environment in the immediate area.
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
POLICIES:
Major policies of the City with regard to elimination of blighted conditions which may exist within the community are as follows:
1.	To undertake programs and actions which will reduce or eliminate the conditions of blight found to exist within any area of the City.
2.	To maintain standards of improvement which will avoid the creation of conditions of blight.
3.	To continue to enforce health, building and safety laws as a means of encouraging the maintenance and improvement of property within the City and discouraging deterioration and obsolescense.
-7-
ACTION PROGRAM:
The City of Montebello should continue programs and activites which will lead to the elimination of blight and deteriorated conditions inimical to the community interest. The City has established a Community Redevelopment Agency and, with the powers granted to this agency, is undertaking the identification of specific areas for study purposes. These survey areas may ultimately yield a designation of redevelopment project areas. Plans and programs for each project area designated should be developed in cooperation with the community, through an advisory committee and/or by owner participation, and presented to the legislative body for action.
A continuing program of analysis of conditions and remedial methods will enable the Department of Community Development and other city departments to identify and deal with problems of blight, deterioration, and obsolescense in the community. This recommended program may include, in addition to the redevelopment processes permitted under California law, strengthen ing of codes and ordinances which affect physical development in the community and establishment of public information program to acquaint its citizens with those codes and ordinances and to assist them in undertaking activities which will reduce undesirable conditions.
Adopted MCC June 26, 1973
Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, nothing contained herein shall be deemed or construed to in any manner, indicate or evidence any intention on the part of the City of Montebello to at any time in the future, acquire by purchase, eminent domain or any other means, any real property and/or appurtenances for purposes of implementing any provision of this plan.

INTRODUCTION:
Insuring the safety of its people is a basic responsibility of the City. Based upon the belief that the destructive effects of fire, and non-seismic geological events (landslides, subsidence and erosion) can be minimized by prudent city action, the Safety Element is proposed to function as a preparedness plan for community disasters.
It is anticipated that at a future date the Safety Element will be expanded in scope to include flooding, traffic safety, crime and home and occupational safety.
PURPOSE:
To comply with California State Law, Government Code Section 65302.1 as follows:
"A safety element for the protection of the community from fires and geologic hazards including features necessary for such protection as evacuation routes, peak load water supply requirements, minimum road widths, clearances around structures, and geologic hazard mapping in areas of known geologic hazard."
Adopted MCC 10-27-75 GPA-4-75
GOALS:
1.	Prevent the loss of life and injuries from fires and geologic hazards.
2.	Prevent or minimize property damage and social and economic disruption resulting from fires and geologic events.
3.	Maintain and promote safety programs which create a sense of community security and well being.
OBJECTIVES:
1.	Minimize the occurrence of community disasters.
2.	When community disasters do occur, implement programs to minimize the destruction,
3.	Achieve the most effective and economical balance of costs and benefits in community disaster prevention and control programming.
-1-
CONSTRAINTS:
A totally free environment is beyond the present means and capabilities of local communities. Even if achievable, the results of such a state may be socially and economically unacceptable to the community. A balance must therefore be met between the risk of community disaster as opposed to preventing and mitigating measures.
FIRE;
Although the threat of fire cannot be completely eliminated, the number of fires and the extent of damages can be substantially reduced. There are two inter-related methods of mitigating the threat of fire: Fire prevention and fire suppression.
Fire prevention concerns itself with eliminating the causes of fire, while fire suppression is provided by fire-fighting personnel and equipment to combat and control the effects of fire.
NON-SEISMIC GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS:
The conclusions reached by Envicom Corporation in their technical report* * for the City state that geological hazards (landslides, subsidence and erosion) are not considered a significant problem in Montebello. It is stressed, however, that because such geologic features as river beds and hillsides do exist in the City, care should continue to be exercised when development is proposed in these areas.
Adopted MCC 10-27-75 GPA-4-75
POLICIES AND ACTION PROGRAM:
1.	Regulate the development, maintenance and use of property
in the City so as to minimize the occurrence of fire to keep the expected size of fires to the minimum feasible level.
2.	Promote built-in fire protection by the private sector.
3.	Maintain capability to attack a fire in any part of the City within 3 to 5 minutes from its incipiency.

4.	Promote intercommunity cooperation, mutual aid and other joint activities which will improve the total fire defense and result in reduced costs.
5.	Continue to require engineering geologic investigations in hillside areas.
6.	Utilize the Circulation Element of the General Plan in establishing a route hierarchy with the purpose of alleviating congestion and providing emergency access or evacuation in time of crisis.
7.	Continue to require water systems capable of meeting fire flow requirements, designed to deliver flows under emergency conditions when damages or failures occur in the system.
8.	Continue to maintain and improve the City Emergency Plan.
9.	Continue to maintain and improve the City's rescue, emergency and public service capabilities.

INTRODUCTION:
This element provides for the local planning for official and unofficial scenic highways. Official scenic highways are designated by the State Scenic Highway Advisory Committee after plans have been adopted and submitted by the City. Unofficial scenic routes may also be adopted by the City of Montebello.
PURPOSE:
Government Code Section 65302(h) requires a scenic highways element of all city and county general plans, as follows:
The plan shall include a ’‘scenic highway element for the development, establishment, and protection of scenic highways pursuant to the provisions of Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 260) of Chapter 2 of Division 1 of the Streets and Highways Code.”

There are no state or county designated scenic highways in the City of Montebello, and no proposals are now pending. Although
-1-
there are or way be local streets that could be designated as unofficial scenic routes (e.g., Bluff Road, north of Sycamore Street, Lincoln Avenue between Avenida de la Merced and San Gabriel Boulevard, future streets in the Montebello Hills) none have been so designated.
POLICIES:
Montebello’s policies toward scenic highways are to:
1.	Acknowledge that there are no officially designated scenic corridors or highways in the City of Montebello.
2.	Consider promotion and establishment of unofficial scenic routes in conjunction with development and redevelopment of the Montebello Hills, Rio Hondo Channel areas, and other applicable locations in the City. Of particular promise are routes and points in the Montebello Hills where vistas of the South Coast Basin, Downtown Los Angeles, the San Gabriel Mountains and Valley, and the Whittier Narrows-Puente Hills are most impressive. Consideration of scenic route designation shall include providing turn outs, picnic areas, and vista locations to take maximum advantage of these scenic qualities.

SEISMIC SAFETY ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION:
Southern California geologic and seismic, history has been one of long and continued activity. The proximity of known major faults and the experience of many residents within the recent past verify this fact. Two major events within the Los Angeles Basin have called attention to the potential destruction that earthquakes can unleash. The first, the Long Beach earthquake, occurred in 1933. Reaction to it brought about an incorporation of seismic design standards into the building code for the first time. In 1971, the San Fernando earthquake caused appreciable damage within major portions of the Los Angeles Metropolitan area.
The experience of these two major events has produced a high level, of seismic hazard awareness on the part of both citizens and public officials of the likelihood of future occurrences. Both major earthquakes have also underscored the need for effective planning to mitigate against the effects of seismic occurrences .
It is apparent that seismic activity brings a potential for loss of life, damage to property, and economic and soc ial disruption.
Yet the task of identifying this potential is complicated by the fact that earthquakes and their resultant effects are unpredictable and infrequent. Because existing and expanded development in Montebello will be exposed to potential seismic hazards, it will be necessary to identify, delineate, and evaluate these hazards within the limits of present technology. A policy and implementation program can then be effected.

To comply with California State Law Government. Code Section 65302 (f as follows:
(!A seismic safety element consisting of an identification and appraisal of seismic hazards such as susceptibility to surface ruptures from faulting, to ground shaking, to ground failures, or to the effects of seismically induced waves such as tsunamis and seiches.
-1-
The seismic safety element shall also include an appraisal of mudslides, landslides, and slope stability as necessary geologic hazards that must be considered simultaneously with other hazards such as possible surface ruptures from faulting, ground shaking, ground failure, and seismically induced waves.”
DEFINITIONS:
A11uvium:
A general term for all sediment such as sand and gravel deposited in river beds, flood plains, lakes, and fans at the foot of mountain slopes and estuaries.
Earthquake:
Perceptible trembling to violent shaking of the ground produced by sudden displacement of rocks below and at the earth's surface.
Fault:
A fracture or fracture zone along which there has been movement (slippage) of the two sides relative to one another and parallel to the fracture.
Active Fault:
A fault that has moved in recent geologic time and which is likely to move again the relatively near future. For planning purposes, this period extends back on the order of 1.0,000 years and forward 100 years or more.
lna.ct.ive Fault :
A fault which shows no evidence of movement in recent geologic time and no evidence of potential movement in the relatively near future.
Ground Failure:
A situation in which the ground does not hold together. Examples are landsliding, mudslides, and liquefaction.
-2
Intensity:
A qualitative measure of an earthquake's destructiveness, based on observed damage or effects. (See Modified Mercalli scale Chart 1.)
Landsliding:
The perceptible downward sliding or falling of a relatively dry mass of earth, rock, or mixture of the two.
Liquefaction:
A sudden decrease of shearing resistance of a non-cohesive soil caused by collapse of the soil, structure associated with sudden but temporary increase of water pressure in the soil voids; more generally, a "quicksand" condition results from an upward flow of water through sand.
Magnitude:
A quantitative measure of the total energy release of an earthquake based on a logarithmic scale. (See Richter scale Chart _1. )
Seiches/Tsunamis;
Adopted MCC May 27, 1975
Earthquake-generated water waves; seiches occurring in enclosed or restricted bodies of water, the tsunamis occurring on the high seas. Neither hazard significant in Montebello.
Seismic Risk:
The degree of probability of earthquake impacts, including injury and loss of life, property damage, social and economic disruptions, as estimated from the history and records of past earthquakes. The varying degrees of seismic risk are illustrated in Figure 1. A further discussion is provided under "CONSTRAINTS."
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND:
Because the basis for the Seismic Element rests upon a large amount o f technical, information, an exp I ana t ion of both the general effect of earthquakes and certain specific facts of Montebello’s geology will be necessary. Only selected information is provided here in

The most widespread effect of an earthquake is ground shaking.
This is usually, but not always, the. greatest cause, of damage.
This effect poses the primary seismic, risk in Montebello from a major earthquake on either the Newport-Inglewood, Sierra Madre, or the Whittier faults. A great earthquake of nearly 8.0 magnitude on the San Andreas fault would also result in strong ground shaking. (Compare the Modified Mercalli, a qualitative scale, to the Richter, a quantitative scale on Chart 1, and the expected effects of major faults on Montebello on Chart. 2.)
Another effect of earthquakes is ground failure. This category includes such hazards as differential, settlement and liquefaction, natural landslides, rock falls, and subsidence. Each of these are considered limited hazards in Montebello.
Ground displacement, which is the surface rupture along faults, is not considered a significant hazard because no active or potentially active faults are known, to be present within the limits of the City of Montebello.
Within the City of Montebello four geologic/seismic zones were identified and then delineated such that the effects of earthquakes of different magnitudes in each zone might be analyzed.
These zones are based primarily on variations in subsurface characteristics and are characterized on Figure 2, as follows:
Zone 1 - Thick alluvium (200-800 feet) underlain by sedimentary rocks,
Zone 2 - Thick alluvium as In Zone 1. including the Gaspur Aquifer.
Zone 3 - Thin alluvium (0-200 feet) underlain by sedimentary rocks.
Zone k - Pico Formation of San Pedro Formation rocks exposed at the surface.
The major part of Montebello is underlain by alluvial deposits.
With respect to ground shaking, the most significant variation results from, the presence, of the. Gaspur Aquifer (Zone 2) . Although this zone Is limited in Montebello to- a narrow strip along the present course of the Rio Hondo in the eastern part of the city, there is potential hazard here for liquefaction.

MONTEBELLO GENERAL PIAN PROGRAM
The northern part of the alluvial, area, designated as Zone 3, thins onto the "bedrock" (Zone 4) of the Montebello hills. Here, In Zone 3, conditions are present that tend to amplify shaking frequencies that will affect low-rise to medium-rise structures. Within Zone 4, the question of slope stability was encountered and an appraisal of slope stability was made by Envicom. The results indicate that under the present "semi-natural" condition, the slopes are fairly stable. However, a modification of the terrain, such as during grading for a development, could create unstable conditions unless appropriate engineering geologic practices are incorporated.
Each of the characteristics of the four zones were projected by computer for a series of expected earthquakes to obtain their responses in terms of shaking and acceleration of the ground or the st. ructure on which it is mounted. The resul ts were tabulated in Chart 3. it is evident that each zone experiences different effects by virtue of their differing physical characteristics and because of this, each zone consequently experiences differing degrees of hazard.
To complete the analysis of earthquake hazards, an evaluat I.on. of the probability of earthquake occurrence and magnitude is necessary. Based upon the probability of an occurrence, as illustrated in Chart 2, a determination of the risk involved may be est imated,
The risk of potential seismic hazard will be reflected in the policies set forth in this Seismic Element.

6.	To provide for a periodic review of the Seismic Safety Element to reflect new information or improved technology to reduce the hazard of seismic activity.
CONSTRAINTS:
Adopted MCC May 21, 1975
The major constraint to be dealt with in. the Sc^ismic Safety Element concerns seismic risk. The degree of earthquake risk that the community is willing to accept is critical to the development of policy and implementation of the element. Because a perfectly hazard-free environment does not exist, certain types and degrees of risk are always present. The acceptability of this risk also varies and we find that citizens may be willing to accept relatively unregulated risks in the selection of their homes but not in selection and location of hospitals and public buildings. An example of structure use and the probability of occurrence of earthquakes of specific magnitudes is given In Chart 4. These magnitudes can provide standards for levels of acceptable risk that the community is willing to assign to different uses. Although these levels may provide a basis, other factors such as general geology, characteristics of the site, and structural specifications must also be considered.
The basic problem in the determination of seismic risk is that it cannot be quantified. While the fields of geology, seismology, and engineering are steadily growing in their knowledge of the mechanics of seismic processes, the great complexity of many geologic/seismxc factors related to earthquakes does not currently perm!t accurate prcdictab1c measurements nonce rni ng where , when , and how large an earthquake might occur. We thus find that risk is basically a subjective determination bastid on a variety of components which are integrated to comprise the total risk. These components include the general geology of the area, the geological characteristics of the specific site, the band use, and the structural specifications of the site. Each of these four components may be dealt with more or less independent ly to derive the estimated total risk of a specific project or location based upon its specific characteristics.
The derived total risk, developed through the procedure of risk analysis of the four components, may be applied to existing

structural, hazards, particularly to pre-1933 structures, as well as to future development. Within the scope of the state requirement that levels of acceptable and unacceptable risks be determined, risk analysis would provide the method for making such determinations.
In the reduction of seismic risk, higher costs often result.
(Chart 5.) Additional costs such as reports prepared by specialists (geologist, soils engineer), lower densities, added building requirements, and relocation studies may be considered unnecessary by many. Yet the major goal of the Seismic Safety Element Is a committment to the reduction of seismic risk to the public at large. This commitment will be met to the extent possible as described in the policies and action program of this plan.
POLICIES AND ACTION PROGRAM:
1.	To define acceptable and unacceptable seismic risks in the framework of a feasible Implementation program to reduce unacceptable seismic risks.
2.	To identify and evaluate structural hazards of existing buildings that may constitute unacceptable seismic hazards.
3.	To seek reduction of unacceptable structural hazards on a voluntary basis and through other appropriate means.
4.	To incorporate a seismic hazard review procedure in the evaluation of new developments.
5.	To emphasize seismic hazards as part of the city’s disaster preparedness plans.
6.	To promote public awareness of potential seismic risk, hazards, and mitigating measures.

	Level of Risk to Public	Kinds of Structures	Extra Project Cost Probably Required to Reduce Risk to an Acceptable Level
Failure of a single structure Failure of a single will affect primarily only	structure may affect the occupants.	substantial populations.	Extremely High	Structures whose continued functioning is critical, or whose failure might be catastrophic:	nuclear reactors, large dams, power inter- tie systems, plants, manufacturing explosives.	No set percentage (whatever is required for maximum attainable safety}
	Slightly Lower Than Above	Structure whose use is critically needed after a disaster: important utility centers, hospitals, fire, police and emergency communication facilities, and critical transportation elements, such as bridges and overpasses; also smaller dams.	20 to 25 percent of project cost
	Possible High Risk to Occupants	Structures of high occupancy, or whose use after a disaster will be particularly convenient:	schools, churches, theaters, large hotels and other high-rise buildings housing large numbers of people, civic buildings such as fire stations, secondary utility structures, extremely large commercial enterprises, most roads, alternate or non-critical bridge and overpasses.	10 to L5 percent of project cost
	An "Ordinary” Level of Risk*	Ihe vast majority of structures: most commercial and industrial buildings, smal1 hotels and apartment buildings, and single-family residences.	1 to 2 percent of project cost, in most cases (2 to 10 percent of project cost, in a minority of cases)
*”Ordinary" risk: Resist minor earthquakes without damage; resist moderate earthquakes without structural damage, but with some ron-structural damage; resist major earthquakes of the intensity of severity of the strongest experienced in California, without collapse, but with some structural as well as non-structural damage.
