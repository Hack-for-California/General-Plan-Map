                                 I. PURPOSE and AUTHORITY
California State Law, Government Code Section 65302(a), requires that a Land Use Element be
prepared as part of a city’s General Plan, as follows:
        A land use element which designates the proposed general distribution and general
        location and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space,
        including agriculture, natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty,
        education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and
        other categories of public and private uses of land. The land use element shall include a
        statement of the standard of population density and building intensity recommended for
        the various districts and other territory covered by the plan. The land use element shall
        identify areas covered by the plan which are subject to flooding and shall be reviewed
        annually with respect to those areas.
In response to this mandate, the Fillmore General Plan Land Use Element contains a written
description of each allowed land use as well as a map indicating the location and extent of each
type of land use. Population density and building intensity for each land use type is defined.
Specific information issues that are of concern to Fillmore are included. Finally, policy
statements and implementation measures that carry out identified goals are also presented.
The information in this element, including the proposed land use designations, land use
distribution, and underlying goals and policies were achieved in part through the consensus of
the General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC), a non-elected citizen representative group.
Members included representatives of various organizations, as well as private citizens and local
business people.
                                                     LU-1

                      II. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS
As a comprehensive strategy for the management of Fillmore’s diverse physical, economic, and
social resources, there is a high level of interrelationship among the topics and elements of the
General Plan. The Land Use Element provides for the types, density/intensity, design, and
distribution of development. The Housing Element provides for the manner in which existing
housing will be conserved and new housing will be produced, in the context of the locations
permitted for residential development by the Land Use Element. The Circulation Element
identifies the types of systems that will efficiently facilitate the movement of people and goods
through Fillmore to and from the existing and planned land uses. The Conservation and Open
Space Element defines policies for resource protection and enhancement of designated sensitive
areas, and policies for energy and sustainability efforts for existing and planned land uses. The
Safety Element provides for the protection of people and structures from the adverse effects of
natural and man-caused hazards. The Noise Element provides for protection from and
mitigation of noise as it relates to sensitive land uses included in this Land Use Element. The
Public Facilities Element addresses issues regarding the development, operation and
maintenance of public facilities within the community.
The City’s General Plan includes a series of goals and policies, which are contained at the outset
of the General Plan document. Within each element, including the Land Use and Circulation
elements, a series of implementation measures and actions are intended to carry out these goals
and policies. Under General Plan law, the goals, policies and implementation measures within
a General Plan must be internally consistent amongst the various elements.
                                                  LU-2

                                 III. COMMUNITY VISION
The City recently completed a community visioning process, during which the general
community values and long-term vision for the City were established. This process was
completed independently of the General Plan, and in fact there is no requirement under state
guidelines to include a vision statement that guides subsequent goals and policies. However,
the City established the following vision, which is expanded in the General Plan through goals
and policies in Section VII of this Land Use Element.
The City’s Statement of Vision follows:
        “Foster a thriving small-town atmosphere in which civic pride, personal well-being,
        and a balanced economy are nurtured and protected."
                                               LU-3

                                IV. GOALS and POLICIES
According to the State General Plan Guidelines, the General Plan is a “collection of
development policies.” These policies guide growth within the City limits and the City’s
Sphere of Influence. The development that is allowed by the Land Use Element is to be directed
by the goals, objectives, and policies in this section of the Element, and implemented through
the related implementation measures contained in the following section.
In this element, GOALS are statements that provide direction and state the desired end
condition. POLICIES are specific statements that guide decision-making. They indicate a clear
commitment by the City and generally serve as mandatory criteria.

VI. EXISTING CONDITIONS and DEVELOPMENT PATTERN
A. City Overview
        Location. The City of Fillmore is located at the confluence of the Santa Clara River and
Sespe Creek, a major tributary draining the mountains to the north. The City is within Ventura
County, on the floor of the Santa Clara Valley about 25 miles east of the Pacific Ocean (Figure
LU-1). The narrow valley runs east-west and is framed by the Oat Mountain northeast of
Fillmore and the distant peaks of Ventura County’s backcountry to the north and Oak Ridge
Mountains to the south. The valley floor is about 3-4 miles wide where Fillmore is located. The
City’s elevation of 467 feet stands in sharp contrast to the nearby mountains, which rise to over
5,000 feet above sea level.
        Physical Character. Fillmore has developed physically in a traditional style, with a grid-
pattern street system, prominent buildings of architectural interest, an identifiable downtown,
and tightly-knit surrounding residential neighborhoods. The community maintains a small
town image, mediterranean climate, and reasonably-priced housing, all of which make it a
desirable place to live. Fillmore is a relatively compact town, and exhibits a relatively dense
development pattern compared to more sprawling suburban cities.
Fillmore is one of the oldest cities in the county. A large percentage of the buildings in town are
more than 50 years old. There are a large number of county-designated historic structures in
town. The City’s historic character is important not only to its physical charm, but to its long-
term economic growth and desire to attract tourism.
The City is physically separated from neighboring communities by agricultural fields and open
space, a typical characteristic of towns in the Santa Clara River Valley, but an otherwise rare
quality within southern California. This agricultural separation is formally recognized through
the City’s greenbelt agreements with the City of Santa Paula (to the west) and Ventura County
(to the east). Santa Paula is located about 9 miles to the west, while the unincorporated
community of Piru is eight miles east. The communities in the valley are linked by State Route
126 and rail line owned by the Ventura County Transportation Commission. The primary cities
on either end of the valley are Santa Clarita, about 25 miles to the east, and Ventura, about the
same distance to the west. Irrigated agriculture is the signature characteristic of the valley, and
citrus and avocado orchards are found throughout the valley on its highly fertile alluvial soils.
Citrus is the major crop grown near Fillmore.
        City Limits, Sphere of Influence and Area of Interest. Fillmore is one of ten
incorporated cities within Ventura County.
As part of the County's Guidelines for Orderly Development, the Ventura Local Agency Formation
Commission (LAFCO) has established an Area of Interest for each city. These are very large areas,
generally extending far from existing city limit boundaries. Ventura County is responsible for land
use decisions within the portions of an Area of Interest outside the City Limit.

Within each city’s Area of Interest, LAFCO designates a Sphere of Influence, an area considered
most logical for future urban development. The City’s Sphere of Influence designates the probable
ultimate boundaries of the City. However, the City does not have direct jurisdiction over the
portion of the Sphere of Influence outside the City limits. Nevertheless, the City is responsible for
local land use planning and in some cases, providing municipal services. If the City intends to
allow urban development within its Sphere of Influence, it must first annex these areas.
Annexation may only occur with LAFCO approval.
The City’s present Sphere of Influence encompasses about 2,815 acres (4.4 square miles), which
includes the entire City itself (except as noted below) as well as hillside areas to the east of Pole
Creek. In general, the existing Sphere of Influence boundary generally follows the City Limit on its
western and southern edges. The existing City Limit of Fillmore includes 1,749 acres (2.7 square
miles), which includes 201 acres of undevelopable open space in the Santa Clara River. This area is
currently within the City, but not within the City’s Sphere of Influence. The City of Fillmore has
full land use jurisdiction over the area within its corporate boundaries. Figure LU-2 shows the
extent of the current City Limit and the Sphere of Influence.
B. Land Development Constraints
In Fillmore, several physical factors constrain land development. These include areas within
the floodplain of nearby creeks, and areas subject to geologic hazards. Potential land
development constraints are described below.
        Flood Hazard Areas. A levee has been constructed along Sespe Creek to protect the
western portion of the City from flooding. Consequently, the Santa Clara River presents the
primary flood hazard facing the community. Many of the properties south of River Street are
within the 100-year flood plain (see Figure LU-3). The recent Santa Clara River Management
Plan suggested flood protection measures, including the location of levees, which would protect
land in the southern part of the City. Portions of this levee have already been constructed.
(Please refer to the Safety Element of the General Plan to see the location of flood hazards
affecting the City.)
        Steep Slopes. While much of Fillmore is relatively flat, it is bounded by abruptly
sloping hillsides to the north and east. Much of this rugged terrain exceeds 30% slope, and in
such areas development would require extensive grading or slope stabilization. The General
Plan Safety Element and Figure LU-3 show areas of steep slopes near the City, including those
areas that exceed a 30% slope.
        Earthquake Fault Zones. The San Cayetano Fault has been designated by state
geologists as an active fault. Development in this area is severely limited under state law. The
remainder of the fault’s trace through the City is not within a state-designated zone, but has
nevertheless been identified by the county as a primary fault. Development near such faults is
subject to more stringent standards. The General Plan Safety Element shows the approximate
trace of the San Cayetano Fault, which generally follows the base of the hills along the City’s
eastern boundary. (It should be noted that the major 1994 earthquake that did considerable
damage to Fillmore

        Agricultural Issues. In general, most of the area within the existing City limits is not
cultivated. However, the City is surrounded by agricultural development, and most of the soils
within the Santa Clara River Valley are highly suitable for cultivation. Areas south of State
Route 126 within the current Sphere of Influence, but outside of the City Limit, are currently in
agricultural production. Prime soils are common throughout the areas under agricultural
production, particularly in the lower-lying areas featuring rich alluvial deposits. Some
agricultural parcels are currently under Williamson Act contract, which precludes their
development until such time as the contracts expire. Contracts are for a ten-year period and are
automatically renewed each year unless a notice of non-renewal is filed with the managing
governmental agency. In that case, the land use restrictions remain in effect until the remaining
nine years of the contract have elapsed.
        Greenbelts. The City of Fillmore is party to greenbelt agreements with the City of Santa
Paula and Ventura County. In Ventura County, greenbelts are agreements, adopted by
resolution or ordinance, between public agencies with land use control. They represent a form
of mutual regulatory control between two or more jurisdictions concerning urban form, the
protection of farmland and open space land, the future extension of urban services/facilities
and annexations. These greenbelts are intended to operate as “community separators” or
“buffers” and participating cities agree not to extend municipal services into the greenbelts or
annex greenbelt lands.
The Santa Paula and Fillmore Greenbelt Agreement was established in 1980 and reaffirmed in
the 1990s. This agreement covers approximately 34,200 acres west of the City limits. The
eastern boundary lies at Sespe Creek adjacent to Fillmore and the western boundary runs along
Santa Paula Creek, around the Santa Paula’s eastern Sphere of Influence line to an extension of
12th Street. The southern boundary is the South Mountain ridgeline. The northern boundary is
shared with the Los Padres National Forest boundary. None of the area within the current or
proposed Sphere of Influence lies within the established greenbelt.
In October 2000, the City adopted a greenbelt ordinance with Ventura County to protect lands
east of Fillmore. The Fillmore/Piru Greenbelt comprises about 72,000 acres, bounded:
    •   On the west by the eastern boundaries of the Fillmore/Santa Paula Greenbelt and the City of
        Fillmore’s General Plan Study Area;
    •   On the north by the Los Padres National Forest boundary;
    •   On the east by the Ventura/Los Angeles County boundary; and
    •   On the south by the ridgeline of Oak Ridge and the Santa Susana Mountains.
The intent is to make the greenbelt boundary consistent and coterminous with the City of
Fillmore’s ultimate Sphere of Influence as described in this General Plan update, where
applicable. Land use within the greenbelts is governed by Ventura County’s General Plan,
with such land designated as Agriculture and Open Space. Land uses within greenbelt areas
must be consistent with this designation.

         Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources (SOAR) Ordinance. The County SOAR
Ordinance was established through voter initiative in November 1998. This ordinance prohibits
redesignation of lands with Agricultural, Open Space, or Rural designations under the County
General Plan until December 31, 2020 without direct voter approval. The County’s SOAR
Ordinance does not apply to areas within the designated Sphere of Influence of any of the cities
within Ventura County, including Fillmore. If any such area were ultimately added to the
City’s Sphere of Influence or annexed, SOAR would no longer apply.
         City Urban Restriction Boundary (CURB) Ordinance. The City Council adopted an
ordinance establishing a City Urban Restriction Boundary (CURB) ordinance. The purpose of
this ordinance is to establish for the City of Fillmore a City Urban Restriction Boundary (CURB)
line which will accommodate a reasonable amount of future growth for the City of Fillmore, but
limit additional urbanization outside of the CURB without a vote of the citizens of Fillmore.
This will achieve the following objectives:
     1. Encourage efficient growth patterns and protect the City of Fillmore's quality of life by
         concentrating future development directly adjacent to developed areas consistent with the
         availability of infrastructure and services;
     2. Promote on lands outside the CURB ongoing agricultural and other natural resource and open
         space uses as defined in Government Code section 65560(b), such as preservation of natural
         resources, public and private outdoor recreation, uses that foster public health and safety, and
         productive investment for farming enterprises;
     3. Manage the City's growth in a manner that fosters and protects the small town charm of Fillmore
         while encouraging appropriate economic development in accordance with the City's unique local
         conditions;
     4. Allow the City to continue to meet its reasonable housing needs for all economic segments of the
         population, especially low and moderate income households, by directing the development of
         urban uses into areas where services and infrastructure are more efficiently available;
     5. Provide housing in areas conveniently located to the City's commercial district in order to
         encourage residents to shop locally;
     6. Promote stability in long term planning for the City by establishing a cornerstone policy within
         the General Plan designating the geographic limits of long term urban development and allowing
         sufficient flexibility within those limits to respond to the City's changing needs over time; and
     7. Allow flexibility for development within the city limits outside the CURB limits at any time
         subject to approval by the voters of the City of Fillmore, while ensuring developments, such as
         those recently proposed with the objective of changing the character of Fillmore, will be subject to
         a vote of the citizenry of Fillmore.
         Biological Issues. The hillsides north and east of the City contain Venturan Coastal
Sage Scrub habitat, while the areas on the margins of the Santa Clara River and Sespe Creek
include riparian habitat (Figure LU-3). Both habitat types support a variety of plant and animal
life, including several state and federally-listed species. Development within these areas would
be subject to policies described in the City’s General Plan Conservation Element.
C. Existing Land Uses and Vacant Land
         Existing Land Uses. Most of the City’s area is currently designated for residential use.
There are about 973 acres of residentially-designated land in the City, or about 56% of the City’s
                                                      LU-25

total area. Commercial uses comprise about 197 acres, or about 11% of the City. Industrial uses
include about 141 acres, about 99 of which are currently concentrated in the underdeveloped
North Fillmore Industrial Area. In all, industrially-designated land comprises about 8% of the
City. About 214 acres encompass public facilities, such as schools (51 acres), parks (15 acres),
rail corridors and the wastewater treatment plant. The existing distribution of land uses in the
City reflects over 100 years of building, some of which was developed before the advent of
zoning controls. Table LU-3 summarizes existing land use designations in the City and its
Sphere of Influence as of 2003.
           Buildout Potential Under the Existing General Plan. At present, most of the land
within the City Limits has been developed, with the exception of the land identified as having
development constraints. The amount of existing vacant land within the City is estimated to be
286 acres. Of this total, about 180 acres are for residential purposes. About 70 acres of
residentially designated land in east Fillmore, between SR 126 and River Street, have
development potential. However, development potential here is limited somewhat by flood
hazard due to the lack of a levee along the Santa Clara River in this location. The other large
vacant residentially-designated area includes about 94 acres of Rural Residential land located
along the hillside generally above Foothill Drive. The development potential of this area is
limited by steep terrain. The remaining vacant land consists of scattered parcels of multi-family
uses, including about 3 acres of potential development in the Central Business District (CBD).
           Non-residential vacant land encompasses about 106 acres. The North Fillmore
Industrial Park (now called the North Fillmore Master Plan area) includes the largest single area
of vacant industrial land relatively free of physical development constraints (about 49 acres). It
is estimated that this land could support up to about 640,000 square feet of industrial floor area.
There are about 57 vacant commercial acres in the City, about 13 of which are in the Central
Business District (CBD). It is estimated that these areas could support about 1.3 million square
feet of commercial floor space. Table LU-4 indicates the amount of vacant land in the City in
each land use category and the resulting buildout potential on developable acreage.

industrial land relatively free of physical development constraints (about 49 acres) is located in
North Fillmore. It is estimated that this land could support up to about 640,000 square feet of
industrial floor area. There are about 57 vacant commercial acres in the City, about 13 of which
are in the Central Business District (CBD). It is estimated that these areas could support about
1.3 million square feet of commercial floor space. Table LU-4 indicates the amount of vacant
land in the City in each land use category and the resulting buildout potential on developable
acreage.

         Population and Growth Management. The issue of population growth and how to
accommodate that growth is a key issue in planning for the future of the City. It affects all other
issues in one way or another, especially social and economic concerns. The City is required by
state law to make adequate provision for the existing and projected housing needs for all
economic segments of the community (Government Code §65580(d)). This Land Use Element
addresses the question of where growth should occur and how it should be regulated.
The City adopted a Growth Management Ordinance in 1980, which expired in December 1999.
There is currently no longer a Growth Management Ordinance in effect. However, population
growth in recent years has been very slow, and has typically been less than the previous
Growth Management Ordinance would have allowed (198 persons per year, or about 56
dwelling units annually). In 2000, for example, the City’s population grew by a reported 53
persons (Department of Finance, 2001). Population growth has been well within the long-term
projections put forward by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG).
The City’s reported January 2002 population was 14,096, an increase of 2,104 since 1990, when
the population was 11,992. From 1990 to 2000, the City added 260 dwelling units, an average of
26 per year (Department of Finance, 2001). If that rate continues, it would take about 25 years
(till 2025) to build out the current inventory of vacant residential area (under existing General
Plan designations), which would accommodate about 630 dwelling units (Table LU-4).
It should be noted that the 1989 Fillmore General Plan identified the potential for a likely
buildout population of 19,653, but that depending on various development factors, buildout
could have ranged from 14,980 to 24,325. In practice, the development potential of much of the
unincorporated area within the Sphere of Influence shown in the 1989 General Plan has been
much more limited than anticipated because of topographic, environmental or flooding
constraints. Based on the remaining residential buildout potential under the existing General
Plan of 630 dwellings in the City, actual buildout population would be about 15,986, if new
development supported 3 persons per dwelling unit. This is similar to the low end of the range
identified in the 1989 General Plan.
D. Special Areas of Concern Within the Existing Sphere of Influence
This section of the Land Use Element addresses several areas within the existing Sphere of
Influence that have distinct planning issues, constraints, and opportunities. These areas were
identified through a series of public workshops, and some are addressed in the 1989 General
Plan Land Use Element. This section also identifies areas where extensive land use changes are
contemplated. Figure LU-5 shows the location of these areas within the City.
         Central Business District. The Central Business District (CBD) has, in the past, served
as the major retail and service oriented business area in the City. With the advent of
commercial development along State Route 126, neighborhood and community retail activities
have been diverted away from the CBD. Today, the CBD provides goods and services for
tourists as well as the local population. The CBD capitalizes on its generally lower rents to cater
to commercial uses not dependent on the proximity to Highway 126. It continues to be the
commercial center for specialty retail uses, commercial service type businesses, and offices.

Development in this area is guided by the Downtown Specific Plan. Under the revised Land
Use Element, this area would not experience any land use designation changes, but mixed uses
would be encouraged under the Downtown Specific Plan.
        State Route 126. Highway 126 functions as the heart of regionally-oriented commercial
development in the City. Community level shopping centers and highway-oriented uses are
concentrated along this corridor. West of the existing City Limits, additional land fronting the
highway would be redesignated from industrial to a mix of commercial and light industrial
uses, as part of the revised Land Use Element.
        North Fillmore Master Plan Area. Under the 1989 General Plan, the large tract of land
at the northwestern portion of the City was intended as the primary location for future
industrial development in the City. It was then called the North Fillmore Industrial Park.
However, its distance from major transportation corridors, including Highway 126, has made
this area generally unattractive to prospective industrial developers. At the same time, there
are existing industrial uses in this area that are important to the local economy. Under the
revised Land Use Element, this area would transition to a more residential orientation.
        Southwest Business Park Area. This 204-acre area is generally bounded by Highway
126 to the north, C Street to the east, and the flood lines of the Santa Clara River and Sespe
Creek to the south and west. It includes about 35 acres already in the City; the remaining 169
acres are within the existing Sphere of Influence. The area is currently in agricultural
production.
Under the 1989 General Plan, this area was the City’s Industrial Reserve, intended for large-
scale industrial development. Under the revised Land Use Element, this area is envisioned as a
Business Park, which could include a variety of campus-like commercial and light industrial
uses, intended to establish the area as a focus of future employment in the city, as well as to
enhance the highway commercial corridor along Highway 126. This area would include a 20-
acre park.
        Southeast Specific Plan Area. Under the 1989 General Plan, much of the southeastern
portion of the existing Sphere of Influence was designated for low-density residential
development. However, this area, with the exception of the fish hatchery, remains in
agricultural production. Some of this land is currently constrained by its location in the 100-
year flood plain of the Santa Clara River.
Under the revised Land Use Element, development of this area (generally bounded by State
Route 126 to the north, existing development in the City to the west, the Santa Clara River to the
south, and the CURB line to the east) will be guided by a specific plan or plans. The Specific
Plan area would include about 67 acres currently in the City and 172 acres outside the City but
within the Sphere of Influence. The Specific Plan area would include an additional 62 acres
south of the existing Sphere along the Santa Clara River. In all, the specific plan area
encompasses about 301 acres.
                                                 LU-31

The key features of this area would include: a maximum of 1,000 single-family homes, a 10-acre
elementary school, a neighborhood-serving commercial component, and 20+/- acres of
community parkland. The area would include a Class I bike path linking the eastern edge of
the city with the core of Fillmore. Specific Plans within the area will also require adequate
flood protection, and the construction of a levee in this area (see Figure LU-6).
        East of Pole Creek. Under the previous general plan, the area east of Pole Creek and
north of Highway 126 was designated for Residential Rural development along the hillside, and
industrial uses in the more level areas closer to the creek. Under the revised plan, the area north
of the general alignment of Third Street would retain its existing residential designation.
Immediately west of the PanAmSat site, a 55-acre area adjacent to Pole Creek would be
redesignated for a future regional park site, with a campground that could accommodate RVs.
Open space east of that area would be to preserve communication facilities.
        The Railroad Corridor. The rail line that bisects Fillmore originally traversed the length
of the Santa Clara River Valley. The railroad was used for passenger service, shipment of
produce and distribution of inbound freight. In 1978, storm damage severed the rail line and
service was abandoned on the line east of Piru. Since that time, the Newhall Land and Farming
Company has removed the tracks between that point and the mainline connection in the City of
Santa Clarita.
In 1995, the Ventura County Transportation Commission (VCTC) purchased the Santa Paula
Branch Line and associated holdings of Southern Pacific Transportation Company. Today,
there is limited freight activity on the line from Montalvo to Santa Paula. In addition, a tourist
train operating out of the City of Fillmore uses the segment between Rancho Camulos and Santa
Paula. VCTC has completed a Master Plan for the Santa Paula Branch Line that calls for the
restoration of the rail connection to Santa Clarita and initiation of commuter rail service
between Ventura and Santa Clarita. In the interim, VCTC is investigating the use of local
commuter rail service from Piru to Ventura. Finally, VCTC has begun a recreational trail along
the line. Fillmore has developed much of the portion of this corridor that traverses the
community. In general, the railroad corridor is 100 feet wide, with 50 feet on each side of the
centerline of the track. This corridor would be designated as a Public Facility, with the intention
of reserving it for future multi-modal transportation use.
        City Entrances/Gateways. To promote visitor and general business access to Fillmore,
the City’s entrances need to be defined and enhanced. The important local gateways are the
eastern and western entrances along Highway 126, and the southern entrance from Highway
23. The entrance to the downtown area along Central Avenue is another important gateway,
currently marked by a prominent sign arching over the street. In addition, a landmark neon
sign directing highway travelers to the downtown area is located on Highway 126 at Central
Avenue.

              VII. FUTURE LAND USE, EXPANSION and BUILDOUT
This section analyzes potential development under the revised Land Use Element. Buildout
under the revised Land Use Element would be the result of three factors:
        •   Development of vacant lands within the City or Sphere of Influence;
        •   Redesignation of some lands within the City or Sphere of Influence to accommodate
            development different than what is anticipated in the previous general plan; and
        •   Development of lands within an expanded Sphere of Influence
This portion of the Land Use Element briefly summarizes the nature of land use changes within
the existing Sphere of Influence, and the areas where the City would expand its Sphere for
future annexation. Vacant lands within the City were discussed in Section III of this document.
A. Land Uses Changes Within the Existing Sphere of Influence
In general, most of the City would retain its existing land use designations. However, the
terminology used would be changed so that the land use designations and zoning would be the
same as one another. This is intended to avoid potential confusion, and would not affect the
development potential of most land in the City’s planning area.
There would be several areas, particularly undeveloped areas, where somewhat more
substantial land use designation changes are contemplated. These areas were described in
detail in Section III of this element, but are listed below for clarity (Table LU-5):
        •   North Fillmore Master Plan Area (formerly known as North Fillmore Industrial Park)
        •   Southeast Specific Plan Area (including Heritage Valley Parks Specific Plan Area)
        •   Southwest Business Park Area
        •   East of Pole Creek
Table LU-6 summarizes the nature of land uses changes within each area. Figure LU-6 shows
the proposed Land Use Plan for the City based on these changes.
B. LAFCO and Sphere of Influence Expansion
The Ventura County Guidelines for Orderly Development (originally drafted by LAFCO,
Ventura County and the 10 incorporated cities) allow the City to consider expansion into its
Area of Interest when developing long-range plans. The Area of Interest is the City’s planning
area. The Sphere of Influence that is established by the Ventura Local Agency Formation
Commission (LAFCO) designates the probable ultimate urban boundaries for the City for the
foreseeable future. If the City intends to expand its corporate boundaries into this area, it must
first process annexation applications through LAFCO.

The LAFCO policies that are required to be considered before the City plans to increase its
Sphere of Influence or plans for the annexation of adjacent land are:
     1. Sphere amendments or annexations should involve lands that are contiguous to the current City
           boundary, except for specific exceptions. The changes should not create a “leap-frog” of City
           lands out into County territory. Also, the changes should not create an “island” of County land
           that is substantially surrounded by City lands.
     2. Development of existing vacant land within the City is encouraged before any proposal is
           approved for expansion.
     3. The change should promote an orderly and efficient land use pattern.
     4. The City should consider the future service needs of the new area as it builds out.
                                                         LU-34

     5. The City should be able to provide services to the new area. Issue areas that will be considered
         include adequate water supply, adequate sewer treatment plant capacity, as well as adequate
         police and fire services.
     6. A social and economic interdependence should exist between the new area and the existing City.
     7. The proposed new territory should not contain Prime Agricultural land or be designated as Open
         Space. Urban uses are to be guided away from Prime Agricultural lands, unless it will not
         promote orderly and efficient development.
     8. The proposed new area must be part of the City’s General Plan and must be included in all
         elements.
In January 2001, the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganization Act of 2000
(AB 2838) was enacted at the state level, which amended the definition LAFCo’s purpose.
To the long-standing goals of discouraging urban sprawl and encouraging the orderly
formation of local agencies, it adds “preserving open space and prime agricultural lands” and
“efficiently providing government services.” It retains the direction that this is to be achieved
“based on local conditions and circumstances.”
Specifically, Section 56300 over the Government Code is amended to:
     • State that goals to discourage urban sprawl, preserve open space and agriculture and
         provide efficient governmental services may sometimes compete with the need for
         orderly development.
     • State providing housing is an important factor in promoting orderly development
     • Add a preference to accommodate growth within or through the expansion of local
         agencies that can “best accommodate” services and housing for all incomes in “the most
         efficient manner feasible.”
     • Promote multi-purpose governments, especially in urban areas, but recognizes the
         critical role of limited purpose agencies, especially in rural communities.
     • Add a preference that service responsibility be allocated to government agencies that
         can “best provide government services.”
In addition, new Section 56668.5 states that LAFCOs may, but are not required to, consider
regional growth goals and policies established by a collaboration of elected officials. This new
legislation, while broadly amending LAFCo’s purpose, does not replace Ventura LAFCo
policies, which still apply as stated above. Ventura LAFCo will likely review its policies in the
future to address this recent legislation.
C. Expansion Areas: Sphere of Influence Amendments and Potential Land Uses
This Land Use Element envisions an amendment to the existing Sphere of Influence to include
three expansion areas totaling 478 acres, with a variety of land uses (Figure LU-6 and Table LU-
6). These expansion areas, known as PanAmSat Site (Area 1) and Johanson Property (Area 2)
are intended for eventual annexation, and Area 3 as part of Southeast Specific Plan Area. Area
1 is intended to consolidate the long-term jurisdiction of a property that would otherwise
                                                  LU-35

remain partially within an unincorporated area upon buildout. Proposed land uses and
buildout limits were developed by the City and consultant team with input from the General
Plan Advisory Committee, Planning Commission and City Council in a series of workshops
from 1998 to 2001.
The following is a description of the expansion areas:
           Area 1: PanAmSat Site. This 217-acre area is an eastward extension of the existing
Sphere of Influence, east of Pole Creek and north of Highway 126. Currently, the PanAmSat
property is about evenly divided between area in the Sphere of Influence and outside the
Sphere (about 248 acres are within the existing Sphere, while 217 acres are outside). The City
currently provides urban services (such as water service) to this area. This change would
streamline long-term jurisdictional control within the City. Previously, full buildout under the
existing General Plan would have left half of the property within the County. The site is
currently undeveloped, apart from various communications facilities, including satellite and
cellular phone equipment. This land use pattern would not change. The area would be
designated as Open Space to provide recreational trails that connect to the City, access to views
plateaus, and access to Fillmore’s landmark letter “F”.
           Area 2: Johanson Property. This area would expand the existing Sphere of Influence by
199 acres, just east of the PanAmSat site. Because of the peculiarities of property boundaries,
one property in this area would include about 37 additional acres already in the City’s Sphere of
Influence. In all, the area would include 236 acres. This predominantly rugged area would be
developed with Rural Ranch Estate (RRE) residential uses, accommodating about 35 homes.
           Area 3: Southeast Specific Plan. This area would amend the existing Sphere of
Influence to include 62 acres, which would be included in the Heritage Valley Parks Specific
Plan.
Table LU-6 illustrates the land uses types, amounts, and buildout planned for the expansion
scenario.

D.         Development Potential and Population Growth
The Land Use Plan identifies areas where development could occur on existing City lands as
well as future annexations. Table LU-8 illustrates the maximum new development potential for
both existing City lands and the expansion areas, and summarizes the potential development
upon full buildout of the General Plan. The type and amount of development that actually
occurs will depend on market forces and an aggressive marketing plan by the City. The City
realizes that total industrial, commercial, and residential build-out may not occur within the
2020 horizon of the General Plan. However, the City is legally obligated to plan for and
anticipate General Plan Buildout.

Existing residential is from Department of Finance, January 2002. Existing Commercial and Industrial estimates are extrapolated from
land use data developed by the City of Fillmore using FARs shown in the Land Use Element. Existing Parks and Open Space are
from the City of Fillmore. Existing public schools include those outside the City that serve the City’s population. Potential growth
within City Limits is based on a vacant land inventory conducted by the City of Fillmore in January 2001. Potential growth within
sphere is from June 2001 vacant land inventory, modified by proposed land use designation changes. Currently approved projects
include 370 dwelling units, 197,000 SF of commercial uses, and one elementary school. The approved projects include the Greystone
project (144 units), Griffin (136 units), Griffin TTR 5335 (39 units), Rosewood (44 units), and various miscellaneous projects (7 units).
* Includes only designated Open Space. Does not include undevelopable land within the Heritage Valley Parks Specific Plan south of
the proposed levee along the Santa Clara River (about 190 acres, 62 of which are in the expanded Sphere of Influence).
In the future, the City’s goal is to maintain a population per household ratio of 3.25, consistent
with historic population per household sizes. Based on this reasonable projections (new lower
density residential units sustaining an average household size of 3.00), the City would have a
population of about 22,693 at full buildout under the General Plan. Note that growth in
Fillmore since 1990 has been 1.01 percent per year, and that the buildout population is within
approved SCAG/VCOG population forecasts, and consistent with the Regional Housing Needs
Assessment. This is considerably slower than the growth that occurred during the 1980s, which
was about 2.2% annually. To put these figures in historical context, the City has grown at an
average annual rate of 2.7% since 1920, when the population was 1,597.
                                                                  LU-37

As shown in Table LU-8, non-residential growth potential could include up to about 2.7 million
square feet of commercial floor space (an 84% increase from the 3.1 million existing square feet),
and about 1.9 million square feet of industrial uses (a 162% increase from the 1.2 million
existing square feet). Most of this new development would be concentrated in the southwestern
portion of the City, generally west of C Street, south of Highway 126. This area would be
designated as Business Park (BP), which could accommodate either industrial or commercial
uses, designed in such a way to be internally compatible as well as will adjacent land uses.
About 40% of new commercial development could be accommodated in infill parcels,
particularly in the Central Business District.

                VIII. LAND USE PLAN and LAND USE CATEGORIES
The purpose of the Land Use Plan Map and the Land Use Categories is to provide designations
to guide the general distribution, location, and extent of the various types of land uses in the
City. The categories also describe density and intensity criteria for physical development.
A.      Land Use Plan
The Land Use Plan Map, shown in Figure LU-6, illustrates the location of each land use
category. In any case where uncertainty exists regarding the location of boundaries of any land
use category, circulation alignment, or other symbol or line found on the Land Use Plan Map,
the following procedures will be used to resolve such uncertainty:
        •   Boundaries shown as approximately following lot lines shall be construed as following such
            lot lines.
        •   Where a land use category applied to a parcel is not mapped to include an adjacent street or
            alley, the category shall be considered to extend to the centerline of the right-of-way.
        •   Boundaries shown or approximately following the limits of any municipal corporation shall
            be construed as following such limits.
        •   Boundaries shown as following or approximately following railroad lines shall be construed
            to lie midway between the main tracks of such railroad lines.
        •   Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the centerlines of creeks, rivers, or
            other continuously flowing water courses shall be construed as following the channel
            centerline of such water courses taken at mean low water and, in the event of a natural
            change in the location of such water courses, the zone boundary shall be construed as moving
            with the channel centerline.
        •   Boundaries shown as separated from, and parallel or approximately parallel to, any of the
            features listed above shall be construed to be parallel to such features and at such distances as
            are shown on the map.
B.      Land Use Pattern
Table LU-8 illustrates the future distribution of land uses in the City, based on the Land Use
Plan shown in Figure LU-6. The proposed expanded sphere of influence would include 1,066
acres. When combined with the 1,749 acres already in the City, the City’s planning area would
include a total of 4,371 acres. About 51% of this area would be designated for residential uses.
The Southeast Area Specific Plan, which would be largely residential, would encompass
another 14% of the City’s planning area. Commercial land uses would comprise 6% of the
planning area, while industrial uses would be about 5% of the area. Designated Open Space
would encompass about 17% of the planning area of the City. However, a substantial portion of
land designated for other purposes would also remain in open space, because of development
constraints including topography and flood hazard. The remaining land would be set aside for
public facilities.

  Small but important opportunities for new residential development would be concentrated in
  the Johanson site. Residential infill on existing city land would account for about 40% of new
  housing built in the City. About half of the infill residential development would occur in the
  former North Fillmore Industrial Park area. Industrial development would be concentrated in
  the southwestern portion of the City, as would about 60% of future commercial development.
  The remainder of potential commercial development would be concentrated in the Central
  Business District.

  C.         Land Use Categories
  The following descriptions of the Land Use Categories are identified as illustrated on the Land
  Use Map; combined, these form the foundation of the Land Use Element. In cases where
  interpretation is necessary, the Community Development Director, or Acting Community
  Development Director, will make an interpretation. This interpretation is subject to appeal to
  the Planning Commission and City Council. Table LU-9 summarizes each land use category, its
                                                              LU-41
      location within the City, and the associated development density or intensity. A detailed
      description of each land use category follows.
      The City’s zoning categories use the same designations as those described below. While the
      Land Use Element provides a broad description of what would be allowed in such areas, the
      zoning ordinance implements these categories, providing further detail regarding restrictions
      and allowed uses.

     Residential Land Use Designations
     There are six residential land use categories under the General Plan, which address a range of
     housing types and allowed densities.
             Agricultural Exclusive (A-E). The Agricultural Exclusive designation provides for
             single-family detached housing in a low intensity, rural setting. The purpose of this
             designation is to assign a basic land use intensity of 1 dwelling unit per 20 acres within
             rural areas where such development may be appropriate. The designation would also
             allow agricultural activity, including limited equestrian facilities.
             Rural Ranch Estate (RRE). The Rural Ranch Estate designation provides for single-
             family detached housing in a low intensity, rural setting. The purpose of this
             designation is to assign a basic land use intensity of 1 dwelling unit per 6 acres within
             rural areas where such development may be appropriate. This designation would also
             allow agricultural activity, including limited equestrian facilities. Additional land uses,
             including churches, schools, parks and day care centers, would be allowed provided
             they are deemed compatible with surrounding development.
             Clustered development may be used to avoid high constraint areas. To provide an
             example of how this could be accomplished, assume a property owner has a 42-acre
             parcel. Under the basic permitted land use intensity, up to 7 homes could be built.
             However, assume that 20 acres are on slopes exceeding 30% and therefore constrained.
             The 7 units could be clustered on the remaining 22 acres, provided that none of the
             clustered parcels would be less than 0.5 acres in size.
             Clustering may also be used on land that does not have development constraints, at the
             discretion of the property owner.
             Maximum Land Use Intensity: 1 dwelling unit per 6 acres, or 1 dwelling unit per existing
             buildable lot, if smaller than 6 acres. If development is clustered, the minimum lot size within the
             clustered area is 0.5 acres.
             Residential Rural (RR). The Residential Rural designation provides for single-family
             detached housing in a low intensity, rural setting. The purpose of this designation is to
             assign a basic land use intensity of 1 dwelling unit per acre within rural areas where
             such development may be appropriate. This designation would also allow agricultural
             activity, including limited equestrian facilities. Additional land uses, including
                                                          LU-43
churches, schools, parks and day care centers, would be allowed provided they are
deemed compatible with surrounding development.
Clustered development may be used to avoid high constraint areas. To provide an
example of how this could be accomplished, assume a property owner has a 12-acre
parcel. Under the basic permitted land use intensity, up to 12 homes could be built.
However, assume that 4 acres are on slopes exceeding 30% and therefore constrained.
The 12 units could be clustered on the remaining 8 acres, provided that none of the
clustered parcels would be less than 0.5 acres in size.
Clustering may also be used on land that does not have development constraints, at the
discretion of the property owner.
Maximum Land Use Intensity: 1 dwelling unit per acre, or 1 dwelling unit per existing
buildable lot, if smaller than 1 acre. If development is clustered, the minimum lot size within the
clustered area is 0.5 acres.
Residential Low Density (RL). This designation provides for low-density
neighborhoods with detached single-family dwellings with private yards at a density of
up to 7 units per acre. Manufactured homes on permanent foundations would be
permitted. Other land uses that serve the needs of a low-density neighborhood
(churches, schools, parks, or day care centers) may be permitted when it is determined
that they are compatible with the surrounding area. Limited agricultural pursuits could
also be allowed under this designation.
Maximum Land Use Intensity: 7 dwelling units per acre.
Residential Medium Density (RM). The RM designation provides for medium density
neighborhoods with single-family detached homes, two-family attached or detached
homes (condominiums or townhouses, for example), multi-family residential dwellings,
and mobile home parks at a density range of up to 11 units per acre. Manufactured
homes on permanent foundations would also be permitted. Other land uses that serve
the needs of a low-density neighborhood (churches, schools, parks, or day care centers)
may be permitted when it is determined that they are compatible with the surrounding
area
Maximum Land Use Intensity: 11 dwelling units per acre.
Residential Medium-High Density (RMH). The purpose of this designation is to
provide for medium-high density neighborhoods with two-family attached and
detached homes (condominiums or townhouses, for example) and multi-family
residential dwellings at a density range of up to 15 units per acre. Other land uses that
serve the needs of a low density neighborhood (churches, schools, parks, or day care
centers) may be permitted when it is determined that they are compatible with the
surrounding area
Maximum Land Use Intensity: 15 dwelling units per acre.
                                             LU-44
       Residential High Density (RH). This designation allows for high-density
       neighborhoods with attached multi-family residential dwellings at a density up to 30
       units per acre. Other land uses that serve the needs of a high density neighborhood
       (churches, schools, parks, or day care centers) may be permitted when it is determined
       that they are compatible with the surrounding area
       Maximum Land Use Intensity: 30 dwelling units per acre.
       Central Business District (CBD). Although primarily a commercial designation for the
       historic downtown area, it can allow residential development in a mixed-use setting.
       Please refer to the full description of this land use category under “Commercial Land
       Use Designations.”
       Maximum Land Use Intensity: 50 dwelling units per acre.
Commercial Land Use Designations
There are four commercial designations under the General Plan, which typically accommodate
commercial development, but can under some circumstances allow residential or industrial
uses. The plan provides for four commercial categories that serve progressively wider needs:
Commercial Neighborhood, Central Business District, Commercial Office, and Commercial Highway.
       Commercial Neighborhood (CN). This designation provides areas that offer
       convenience goods and services to local residents without disrupting the residential
       character of an area. Commercial and office development are appropriate primary uses.
       These areas are intended to be small in size (typically 5 acres or less) and not geared to
       provide a multitude of more specialized goods or services serving a community-wide or
       regional market. Residential uses may be allowed above first floor commercial or office
       uses.
       Typical Uses. The types of goods sold in the neighborhood commercial developments
       are those that are important to daily family life. The following land uses may be
       included: markets, convenience grocery stores, drug stores, restaurants, video rental
       stores, laundromats, bakeries, shoe repair shops, small business offices, and residential
       development above the first floor, not to exceed 15 units per acre.
       Maximum Floor-Area Ratio (FAR):         0.50
       Central Business District (CBD). This designation provides for a retail business center
       with a special emphasis on tourism within the historic downtown area, distinguishing it
       from all other commercial areas in the City. In this area, commercial establishments are
       intended not only to serve City residents, but also visitors to the area. A high priority
       for this area is the establishment and support of street level retail commercial uses to
       promote a lively pedestrian-oriented district. The CBD designation is implemented by
       the Downtown Specific Plan, which identifies specific land uses, development
       standards, design guidelines, and other recommendations.
                                                LU-45

        Typical Uses: Offices, retail uses, hotels and motels, restaurants, theaters, museums,
        specialty services, mixed commercial/residential development
        Maximum Floor-Area Ratio (FAR):         2.00
        Commercial Office (CO). This designation provides for administrative and professional
        offices, financial and limited retail activities serving the general community. High-
        density residential uses are allowed on the second story of office or commercial
        development.
        Typical Uses: Offices, including but not limited to medical, financial and real estate
        offices; commercial offices.
        Maximum Floor-Area Ratio (FAR):         0.50
        Commercial Highway (CH). This designation provides for commercial development,
        typically oriented to major transportation corridors, including Highway 126. The CH
        designation also accommodates service and tourist-oriented businesses and offices.
        Typical Uses: Service and tourist-oriented businesses, including hotels, motels, service
        stations, restaurants, truck stops, and rest stops. Also accommodates regional retail
        outlets and supermarkets.
        Maximum Floor-Area Ratio (FAR):         0.35
Industrial Land Use Designations
The Industrial land use category has been developed to encourage the continued viability of
existing industrial development while providing encouragement for new industry to locate in
the City. In addition, a Business Park (BP) category is proposed to accommodate campus-like
light industrial development, particularly along the Highway 126 corridor. Descriptions of
these categories follow below.
        Industrial (M). The purpose of this designation is to provide land areas that will
        adequately serve the industrial, light industrial, business park, and office needs of the
        local and regional economy.
        To the extent possible, development in such areas is intended to be compatible with
        adjacent residential uses. Activities that produce substantial noise, safety, air quality, or
        visual impacts are not encouraged under this designation. Business parks are
        encouraged, incorporating design standards that include extensive landscaping and
        architecture compatible with neighboring non-industrial land uses. Development and
        performance standards are required to mitigate objectionable characteristics of light
        industrial development.
                                                  LU-46
        Light manufacturing activities are also allowed, provided they would not result in
        excessive dust, glare, heat, noise, odors, traffic or other safety impacts. This designation
        would allow limited retail sales, provided they would not exceed 25% of the floor area
        of the principally permitted industrial use.
        In areas determined to be appropriate by the City, and where environmental conditions
        allow, the Industrial designation may include land uses that are not compatible with
        residential development, by virtue of their potential to result in substantial dust, glare,
        heat, noise, odors, traffic or other safety impacts. In such areas, industrial uses that
        involve the storage, manufacture, or transport of hazardous materials may be
        appropriate under this designation.
        Typical Uses: Light industrial uses, including research and development, or other
        industrial uses that produce minimal noise or air quality impacts, such as medical
        technology, printing, publishing, and light fabrication; limited warehousing, offices,
        business parks. Where appropriate, this designation could also include heavy industrial
        uses, including assembly of large appliances, high volume freight distribution, chemical
        manufacturing, concrete and petroleum processing.
        Maximum Floor-Area Ratio (FAR):          0.35
        Business Park (BP). The purpose of this designation is to provide land areas that will
        adequately serve City’s changing requirements to encourage economic development in
        the southwestern portion of the community. Development should enhance this gateway
        location of the City along Highway 126, typically with campus-like designs, subject to
        specific architectural guidelines for the area. It would include a variety of uses, but
        primarily commercial/industrial business parks, light industrial uses, and highway
        commercial development. Development must be designed to include landscaping
        features and setbacks to ensure compatibility with neighboring land uses. Development
        in this area should be responsive to non-residential market conditions, encouraging uses
        that would expand the City’s skilled employment base, while minimizing
        environmental impacts, particularly related to noise, air quality, and aesthetics.
        Typical Uses: Business parks, light industrial uses, commercial offices, highway
        commercial uses, where deemed appropriate, particularly along Highway 126.
        Maximum Floor-Area Ratio (FAR):          0.25
Public Facility and Open Space Designations
The Open Space designation is used on land where the conservation of resources is the primary
concern. The Public Facility designation is applied to parks, golf courses and other recreational
areas. In addition, the Public Facility designation is established for other public lands, typically
where utilities, civic or institutional functions are found.
        Public Facilities (PF). This designation includes a range of public facilities, including
        schools, water and wastewater treatment plants, and government buildings. Fire
                                                  LU-47

        stations, police stations, libraries, hospitals, and churches would qualify as public
        facilities. Parks and public golf courses could also be built under this designation.
        Bikeways and multi-purpose trails would be other examples of recreational public
        facilities. Cemeteries would also be appropriately designated as public facilities.
        Open Space (OS). This designation applies to areas subject to flood hazards, significant
        groundwater recharge areas, areas adjacent to creekbeds, areas of surface and sub-
        surface mineral extraction, levees, and publicly-owned landscaped areas. The purpose
        of this designation is to protect public health and safety, and to preserve or manage
        environmental resources. Flood control activities, resource protection, and habitat
        enhancement are appropriate under this designation. Aquatic agriculture, general
        farming activities, limited communications facilities, and limited resource extraction
        would also be permitted, if determined to be compatible with the surrounding area.
        This is an appropriate designation for steep hillsides and significant habitat areas.
        Bicycle paths and multi-purpose trails may be appropriate in these areas.
D. Development Standards
The following standards of development are applicable to the residential, commercial and
industrial land use categories described in the previous section.
Residential Standards
        1. Clustering. Both within a single designation and among two or more designations,
            the clustered mixing of residential unit types is encouraged. The following
            principles shall apply to areas where clustered development is contemplated:
                 Activities to Avoid:
                     •   Disturbing areas within floodways, wetlands, and other sensitive
                         biological habitat areas;
                     •   Developing on steep slopes, hilltops, and ridges where development will
                         be highly visible; and
                     •   Excessive grading of hillsides
        2. Maximum Density. The maximum allowable density shall not be interpreted as the
            preferred density. Requirements for parking, setbacks, open space will help
            determine the actual density. Lower densities within a classification are permitted.
        3. Water and Sewer. Adequate water supply and sewage capacity must be available
            prior to development.
        4. Environmental Impacts. All potential environmental impacts must be addressed by
            the lead agency, and the costs of mitigation shall be borne by the developer and/or
            land owner, as appropriate.
                                                  LU-48

Commercial and Industrial Standards
        1. Compatibility. All commercial or industrial development must be compatible with
           adjacent land uses based on the following criteria:
                a. Local roadway carrying capacity;
                b. Noise;
                c. Lighting, including spillover lighting onto adjacent properties, ambient light
                   levels within a neighborhood, and general visibility;
                d. Visual quality, including design character; landscaping; building mass and
                   bulk; building materials; color and texture; and setbacks;
                e. Signs; and
                f. Accessibility
        2. Water and Sewer. Adequate water supply and sewage capacity must be available
           prior to development.
        3. Environmental Impacts. All potential environmental impacts must be addressed by
           the lead agency, and the costs of mitigation shall be borne by the developer or
           landowner.
E. Overlay Districts
Six Overlay Districts requiring special preliminary studies or development standards apply to
development in portions of the planning area. Their location is shown on Figure LU-7. Because
the development standards shown below are general in nature, specific ordinances should be
developed to further define the requirements within each Overlay District. Except as specified
for each overlay district, the development standards of the underlying land use category would
apply.
        Hillside (H). This designation applies to development in areas with an average slope
greater than 15%, as shown on Figure LU-7. The intent of this designation is to regulate
development intensity in such areas, to minimize health and safety risks to people and
property, and to minimize environmental impacts within such areas.
        The following general standards apply within the Hillside overlay district:
        1. Development, grading activities, and required supporting technical studies shall be
           based on the following table, and should be coordinated within the framework of the
           City’s Hillside Ordinance:

     overlay area)       required technical      environmental degradation, and      environmental review

                                                natural features
    2. Roadway rights-of-way and drainage requirements should respect the natural
          contours of the hillside, rather than fundamentally altering the hillside. Location
          and minimum width standards to maintain safety and reduce environmental
          impacts shall be determined by City Engineering and the City Fire Department in
          consultation with the Community Development Department.
    3. A viewshed analysis shall be performed for development in Hillside overlay areas.
          This analysis shall include sufficient documentation to illustrate how proposed
          development would blend into surrounding natural setting. Buildings should be
          located to preserve existing public views to the extent possible. Ideally,
          photosimulations would be used, showing the general distribution and intensity of
          development, the probable colors used, and the context of development in its
          immediate area. Views of proposed development should be illustrated from
          prominent public viewing locations. The analysis shall be incorporated into
          environmental review for the project.
    4. A geologic, topographic and engineering soils report shall be provided by the
          developer with the tentative tract map, or development proposal. The
          recommendations of this report shall be implemented, including those that may limit
          development intensity to less than specified in the above table.
    5. Grading shall minimize cut and fill and scarring of hillsides, consistent with the
          Grading Ordinance and as specified by the City Engineer. Grading shall retain
          major topographic features, avoid ridgelines, and avoid impacts to sensitive
          biological habitat. The use of prominent retaining walls and other features that
          cause visual impacts should be avoided.
    6. Buildings should be in scale with the natural surroundings. Building heights should
          be limited so as not to dominate the immediate surroundings, and structures should
          be stepped down the hillside, rather than prominently jutting out over natural
          slopes. Building materials should reflect the natural setting, with colors that are
          based on earthtones, and materials that minimize glare. Textured stucco, natural
          brick, and coarse block are appropriate. Roof materials shall be made of fire-
          retardant material.

        7. Landscaping shall be native and fire resistant species. A fuel modification zone of at
             least 100 feet shall be provided between structures and natural open space areas.
             Within this area, larger trees and shrubs must be pruned, and fire-resistant
             groundcover must be used.
        8. Residential clustering shall be encouraged, such that development is concentrated on
             more level areas, while steeper slopes are preserved in a natural state. (Please refer
             to the Residential Rural Ranch land use category for an example of clustering.)
        The engineering and economic practicality of extending urban services to any hillside
        area must be demonstrated to the City by the developer.
        North Fillmore Master Plan (NF). This overlay district is intended for potential
residential development in the North Fillmore area. Under the North Fillmore Master Plan,
residential development would include densities from 5 units up to 20 units per acre, but the
overall area would include no more than 894 dwelling units.
        Business Park (BP). The business park overlay is planned for business parks, light
industrial uses, commercial offices, and highway commercial uses. The purpose of this
designation is to provide land areas that will adequately serve City’s changing requirements to
encourage economic development in the southwestern portion of the community (as depicted
on Figure LU-7). Development should enhance this gateway location of the City along
Highway 126, typically with campus-like designs, subject to specific architectural guidelines for
the area. It would include a variety of uses, but primarily commercial/industrial business
parks, light industrial uses, and highway commercial development.
        Conservation /Preservation (C/P). The Conservation/Preservation overlay district is
intended to preserve historic resources within the planning area. As shown on Figure LU-7,
this district applies to the downtown core of the City, which contains the majority of the City’s
historic resources, and gives the City much of its character. In general, this area is bounded by
A Street, Fourth Street, Mountain View Street, and Santa Clara Street. New development within
this overlay district must be compatible in scale and character with the existing older
development. New development must also promote the conservation and reuse of existing
structures, many of which have historical value. The Conservation and Open Space Element of
the General Plan provides expanded discussion on the City’s historic resources.
        Specific Plan (SP). Specific Plans are adopted by ordinance, and replace underlying
zoning within areas in which they are enacted. Two areas within the City include a Specific
Plan designation. The Downtown Specific Plan regulates development in the Central Business
District, and has already been completed (Figure LU-7). A Specific Plan (or plans) will be
required for the Southeast Area as shown on Figures LU-6 and LU-7. Specific Plans must
address all aspects of development, including land uses, circulation, infrastructure, design
standards, and phasing, for the entire area in question, and forms a detailed development
blueprint that furthers the goals of the General Plan. Specific Plans must be written in
accordance with Government Code 65450, and relevant implementing guidelines, including
                                                 LU-52

Specific Plans in the Golden State (OPR, 1989). The maximum development parameters of the
City’s specific plan areas are shown in Table LU-10 below:

                                                         • Must include bike paths
         Flood Hazard (FH). The Flood Hazard overlay applies to all lands within the 100-year
flood plain, as defined by FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program maps. These areas are
shown on Figure LU-7. It is intended to prevent development from adversely affecting
drainage, and to protect lives and property from flood hazards. Any development proposed
within the 100-year flood plain shall be subject to review by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) and the City Engineer. All costs associated with project design
improvements and mitigation measures necessary to reduce or eliminate flood hazard shall be
borne by the project applicant.
         Significant Habitat (SH). This overlay district applies to highly sensitive biological
habitats, including riparian areas supporting threatened or endangered plant or animal species.
Any development proposal for property within or adjacent to a designated Significant Habitat
(Figure LU-7) shall include an analysis by a qualified biologist (subject to City approval) to
assess the impacts of the proposal on the affected habitats or species, with recommended
mitigation measures.
Whenever urban uses are proposed adjacent to such areas, a buffer of not less than 100 feet of
native and fire resistant vegetation shall be established, based on biological studies of sensitive
habitat in the area. All costs associated with project design and mitigation measures necessary
to maintain significant habitats shall be borne by the project applicant.

ES.0           Executive Summary
ES.1           Introduction
Housing is and will continue to be one of the basic needs that must be accomplished within the City of
Fillmore. The purpose of the Housing Element is to ensure that adequate provisions are made for meeting
the housing needs of all economic segments of the community. Fillmore’s Housing Element was last
updated on May 13, 2003, for a planning horizon covering the period of 1998 to 2005 (3rd Statutory Cycle).
Four years later, the City embarked on a new update for the 4th Statutory Cycle spanning the period of
2006 to 2013, but suspended the process in early 2010. Consequently, the City missed the statutory
deadline for updating its Housing Element for the 4th Cycle. As a result, this Housing Element update
covers the planning period of 2014-2021 but also addresses unaccommodated needs from prior cycles.
ES.2           Progress Report
Included in the updated Housing Element is an evaluation of the effectiveness of the goals, objectives,
policies, and actions of the 2003 Housing Element. There were many factors that affected the City’s ability
to meet the goals and objectives it established in 2003, including limited staff and funding resources. Below
is an abbreviated listing of programs from the 1998-2005 planning period that have continued relevance.
These programs have been included in the current 2014-2021 Housing Element with relevant modifications
reflecting current conditions (e.g., eliminating reference to the Redevelopment Agency as a result of AB 1x
26, replacing “Community Development Department” with “Planning Department,” etc.) . In summary, of the
38 programs that comprise the 2014-2021 Housing Plan, 33 consist of programs continued from the prior
Housing Element.

ES.3 Housing Needs
Statutory Parameters
The Housing Element consists of an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs
along with a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, financial resources, and scheduled
programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing. The analytical and policy-
program development process focuses on housing needs attributable to four basic topics: (i) Target
Income Groups - extremely low, very low, low and moderate income households; (ii) Special Population
Segments - elderly, disabled, female headed households, homeless and farmworkers; (iii) Existing
Housing Conditions - affordability, overcrowding and substandard conditions; and (iv) Future Growth
Accommodation - adequate sites, suitably zoned, to accommodate an assigned share of future regional
growth.
Existing Needs
Target income groups comprise 69% of all households in Fillmore. Comparatively speaking, Fillmore ranks
fourth among 11 jurisdictions within the County relative to having the highest concentration of low and
moderate income households. Similarly, Fillmore is ranked high (3rd overall) in terms of needs possessed
by special population segments. These population segments are recognized under Housing Element law
as having a more difficult time finding decent and affordable housing due to special circumstances
particular to these groups. In Fillmore, disabled persons and female headed households comprise the
largest share of special needs. Overall, persons paying in excess of 30% of their income for housing
represent the single biggest housing challenge for current Fillmore residents. This need, along with
overcrowding and substandard living conditions, is more pronounced for renters than with owners.

 Future Needs
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) process is prescribed by State law and apportions
future Statewide growth (and associated target income housing needs) to local jurisdictions for each
Housing Element cycle. The City’s last updated Housing Element was approved by HCD contingent upon
increasing the density of Medium-High residentially designated properties from 15 to 20 units per acre.
This density modification was not subsequently implemented, and as a consequence, unaccommodated
needs of target income groups from the 3rd Cycle must be added to the subsequent cycle. The same
holds true for unaccommodated needs from the 4th Cycle insofar as a compliant Housing Element was not
adopted within the statutory timeframe. This cumulative obligation means that the City must not only
address the 5th Cycle allocation of RHNA but also the unaccommodated needs from the 3rd and 4th
Cycles.

ES.4             Housing Resources and Constraints
Adequate Sites Analysis
The inventory of available sites to accommodate RHNA covers three separate planning periods from 1998
through 2021. For the 3rd Cycle covering the period of 1998-2005, the data set consists of all vacant
parcels as of 2002 (regardless of size) used in connection in the adopted Housing Element; for the 4th
Cycle covering the period of 2006-2013, the data set consists of vacant parcels only with a size of one or
more acres; for the 5th Cycle covering the period of 2014-2021, the data set includes both large and small
vacant parcels as of July 2013. These data sets have been separately evaluated for development
potential, density suitability and unit affordability. The result of the Adequate Sites Analysis appears in
Table ES.3. In summary, there is a residual shortfall of 173 dwellings based on available sites under
current zoning.
Constraints Analysis
Chapter 4 contains data and analysis pertaining to the resources and constraints affecting the
maintenance, improvement, and development of housing in Fillmore. The analysis focuses on four major
topics: (i) availability of sites for residential development (discussed under Adequate Sites Analysis above);
(ii) potential and actual governmental constraints on housing (e.g. land use controls, fees, etc.); (iii)
potential and actual non-governmental constraints on housing (e.g. land prices, construction costs, and the
availability of financing); and (iv) opportunities for energy conservation with respect to new development.
The results evidence the following major issues:
          Land Use Regulations. Various aspects of the City’s existing Zoning Ordinance potentially
           impair the production of housing for target income groups and special population segments. Of
           particular concern are regulations dealing with density bonuses, second dwellings and special
           needs housing (i.e., disabled, farmworkers and homeless). Removal of these constraints are
                                                                    ES-4

          addressed by the inclusion of Programs 2.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.3.5, 3.2.1, 3.2.3, and 3.2.4 as described in
          Section 5.4.
         Financial and Staff Capacity. Like many jurisdictions in California, Fillmore has been
          handicapped by the prolonged downturn in the economy coupled with the loss of redevelopment
          that served as the principal local source of financing affordable housing initiatives. Rather than
          eliminate worthy programs, the Housing Plan contained in Chapter 5.0 is guided by the assignment
          of priorities in the allocation of available staff and monetary resources.
ES.5           Housing Plan
The intent of the Housing Element is to ensure that the housing needs of all economic segments of the
community will be met through the year 2021. The housing goals and policies included in the Fillmore
Housing Element, as well as the actions (Programs) that the City will undertake to meet its housing needs,
are detailed in Section 5.4. In addition to continuing programs from the prior Housing Element (Table
ES.1), five new programs are proposed.
3.2.4 Reasonable Accommodations for Persons with Disabilities. In furtherance of SB 520 adopted
in 2001, the City shall amend the Zoning Ordinance to institute an abbreviated ministerial procedure (in
place of a variance requirement), with minimal or no processing fee, expressly designed to accommodate
reasonable exceptions in zoning and land use regulations for housing for persons with disabilities (including
individuals with developmental disabilities). In addition: (i) the Zoning Ordinance shall be amended to
clarify the definition disabled in compliance with SB 812; and (ii) information on the rights of the disabled
shall be disseminated in conjunction with Program 3.1.1.
4.1.1 Policy Consistency. The City shall amend the General Plan as necessary to: (i) achieve internal
policy consistency with the Land Use Element in regard to Programs 1.1.2 and 2.3.6; and (ii) maintain
consistency throughout the Housing Element planning cycle as may be needed to implement the balance of
the Housing Plan.
4.1.2 MS-4 Permit Implementation. The City shall actively enforce the requirements of NPDES Permit
No. CAS004002, Order No. 09-0057, that implements pollution reduction and control measures for surface
water discharge through Low Impact Development (“LID”) and Best Management Practices (“BMPs”). The
implementation program shall entail two components: (i) development and imposition of standard
conditions of approval on all discretionary land use permits; and (ii) updating locally-adopted CEQA
Guidelines to in-corporate review standards, impact thresholds and mitigation measures.
4.1.3 Program Targeting. In all new affordable housing projects, the City shall require that priority
occupancy preference be given to lower-income households and special needs population segments that
currently reside in Fillmore but who are presently overpaying, living in overcrowded conditions or residing in
substandard housing. This requirement shall apply to all inclusionary units required by operation of
California Health and Safety Code Section 33413(b), Density Bonus affordable units created under
Government Code Section 65915, and all other government-assisted development (including projects
receiving tax credit financing) over which the City has discretionary land use authority.
4.1.4 RHNA Process. The City will monitor and actively participate in the regional housing needs
assessment process to promote equitable treatment and fair allocation of future growth proportionate to the
                                                          ES-5

community’s existing size and percentage of target income households in furtherance of California
Government Code Sections 65584(d)(1) and 65584(d)(4)). The City will seek alliances with other Ventura
County communities which are similarly impacted and seek relief through all available means including, but
not limited to, the League of California Cities.

1.0 Introduction
1.1      Regional Location
Fillmore is located in the Santa Clara Valley approximately 25 miles east of the Pacific Ocean, at the
confluence of the Santa Clara River and Sespe Creek. The narrow valley runs east-west and lies between
Santa Paula Ridge to the north and Oak Ridge to the south. The valley floor is about 2 to 3 miles wide in
the Fillmore area. The City has an average elevation of 467 feet above mean sea level, while surrounding
mountains rise above 4,000 feet. San Cayetano Mountain has the highest local peak at 4,181 feet.
The City of Fillmore is located in the east-central portion of Ventura County. The City of Santa Paula is
located 9 miles to the west, with the City of San Buenaventura, also known as Ventura, still further west at
the Pacific Ocean. To the south of Fillmore lie the cities of Moorpark (11 miles), Camarillo (20 miles),
Thousand Oaks (22 miles), and Simi Valley (22 miles). The unincorporated town of Piru lies about eight
miles east of Fillmore. East of Fillmore (24 miles) is Castaic Junction in Los Angeles County and the City of
Santa Clarita. Interstate 5 (I-5) runs south from Castaic to metropolitan Los Angeles and north to the San
Joaquin Valley. North of the City is the open country of the Los Padres National Forest, including the
Sespe Wildlife Preserve. Fillmore’s location within the southern California region and the City limits are
shown in Figure HE-1.
Fillmore is physically separated from these neighboring communities by agricultural fields and open space,
a typical characteristic of towns in the Santa Clara River Valley, but an otherwise rare quality within
Southern California. Irrigated agriculture is the signature characteristic of the valley and citrus and avocado
orchards are found throughout the valley on its highly fertile alluvial soils.
Fillmore is geographically isolated from these larger cities by the Oak Ridge mountain range. Only one
road (Grimes Canyon / Highway 23) provides a connection to points south.
The City of Fillmore is party to two greenbelt agreements with the City of Santa Paula and Ventura County,
setting forth mutual regulatory control over urban form, the protection of farmland and open space land, the
future extension of urban services/facilities, and annexations. The Santa Paula and Fillmore Greenbelt
Agreement covers approximately 34,200 acres west of the City of Fillmore. This greenbelt agreement is
within Ventura County’s jurisdiction in-between the two Cities’ Sphere of Influence. In October 2000, the
City adopted a greenbelt agreement by ordinance with Ventura County to preserve agricultural lands and
reduce sprawl east of the City. The Fillmore/Piru Greenbelt Agreement comprises about 72,000 acres from
the City’s General Plan Study Area east to the Los Angeles County line.
The greenbelt agreements operate as community separators or buffers, and the participating jurisdictions
have agreed not to extend municipal services into greenbelts, or to annex greenbelt land. However, on
February 26, 2008, the City of Santa Paula approved the East Area One project, which extends into the
greenbelt zone between the City of Fillmore and the City of Santa Paula. Prior to the approval of this
project, both cities made an agreement by resolution to not extend development into the greenbelt area.
Given the approval of this project, the City of Fillmore has approached the City of Santa Paula to solidify
this agreement via an adopted ordinance.
                                                       1-1

On January 17, 2002, the City Council adopted an ordinance creating a City Urban Restriction Boundary
(CURB). The purpose of this ordinance is to establish an urban boundary around the City preserving
agricultural areas outside of the City by directing growth inside the City limits.
                               Figure HE-1.     Project Regional & Vicinity Map
1.2 Background and Purpose of the Housing Element
General Plans are a physical statement of a community’s vision and consist of policies governing land use,
circulation, housing, conservation, open space, noise and safety (each consisting of a separate “Element”
to the overall Plan). The Housing Element consists of an identification and analysis of existing and
projected housing needs along with a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, financial
resources, and scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing.
Unlike the other six mandatory General Plan Elements, the Housing Element is unique insofar as State law
requires that it must be updated at designated intervals in accordance with specific statutory parameters.
Fillmore’s Housing Element was last updated on May 13, 2003, covering a planning period from 1998-2005
(3rd Cycle). Following adoption of the 1998-2005 Housing Element, the City embarked on a new update for
the 4th Cycle spanning the period from January 1, 2006, through June 30, 2014. The process began in
2007 and entailed preparation and circulation of two working drafts for HCD review and public comment.
Following its receipt of the second draft Housing Element dated August 26, 2009, the City Council elected
to suspend the process. Consequently, this current Housing Element spans a period covering both the 4th
and 5th planning cycles and builds upon work completed through August 2009.
                                                       1-2

Under Housing Element law, needs analysis and program development is geared toward: (i) four target
income groups - extremely low, very low, lower and moderate; (ii) five special population segments –
elderly, disabled, female headed households, farmworkers and homeless; and (iii) three indicators of need
– overpaying for housing, dwelling unit overcrowding, and substandard living conditions. In addition, the
City is required to accommodate an equitable share of regional housing needs (commonly referred to as
“RHNA”) that reflects anticipated future growth throughout the State during each planning cycle. These
obligations are cumulative in the event that assigned needs are not otherwise accommodated during
previous cycles. For Fillmore, this entails “carryover” from both the 3rd and 4th Cycles.
1.3            Citizen Participation
Governing statutes require that local housing elements be prepared with the participation of all economic
segments of the community. In furtherance of this obligation, the Housing Element update process for
Fillmore has entailed extensive outreach as summarized in Table 1.A. Spanish translators were provided
at orientation workshops and housing advocacy groups were provided advance notice of key meeting
dates. As a result, the City received numerous comments throughout the update process spanning a
period from October 2008 through September 2013. The City maintained a tracking system to adequately

           maintenance and repairs, homeowner association fees, and a reasonable allowance for
           utilities.
Objective  The numerical target for some measurable outcome to be achieved by the end of the
           Housing Element planning period. Objectives must be stated for the rehabilitation,
           conservation, and development of housing.
Policy     A broad statement, consistent with a goal that guides and shapes actions in order to achieve
           an objective under that goal.
Special    Single room occupancy units, congregate care facilities and similar types of special living
Needs      arrangements for persons and families who possess extraordinary housing needs by reason
Housing    of economic, social, mental or physical disability.
Target     Under Housing Element law, needs analysis and program development is geared toward four
Income     target income groups: extremely low, very low, lower and moderate. These terms are
Households benchmarked against the area-wide median income for Ventura County, determined annually
           by HCD for each of the State’s 58 counties. The upper limit of extremely low income is
           pegged at 30% of the area-wide median, very low income is pegged at 50%, lower income is
           pegged at 80% and moderate income is pegged at 120%.
                                                   1-6

Transitional      Buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under program
Housing           requirements that call for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit
                  to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall
                  be no less than six months.
1.5           Consistency with Other General Plan Elements
The centerpiece of the Housing Element is the Housing Plan which outlines policies and programs to be
implemented over an eight-year planning horizon covering the period of October 1, 2013 through
September 30, 2021. The Housing Plan for Fillmore (detailed in Section 5.0) encompasses a total of 38
programs. Of these, 33 programs are a continuation from the current adopted 1998-2005 Housing Element
and five programs are newly proposed. With the exception of Program 4.1.1, each of the new proposed
programs entail regulatory and policy changes that merely implement State law or otherwise compliment
the implementation of other programs. In addition, two other programs have substantial changes that differ
from the 1998-2005 Housing Element; specifically, Programs 1.1.2 and 2.3.6 that designate sites to be
rezoned or densified in order to accommodate the City’s assigned share of regional housing needs and
affirmatively further the production of housing that is affordable to target income groups.
General Plan law requires that all component elements, whether mandatory or optional, must be consistent
with one another. As noted above, 33 programs are a continuation from the 1998-2005 Housing Element
and were previously assessed for policy consistency as part of a comprehensive update to the Fillmore
General Plan in 2003. No further policy consistency analysis for these particular programs are necessary.
Of the remainder, Programs 1.1.2 and 2.3.6 entail density and land use changes that potentially conflict
with the current adopted General Plan. To remedy these conflicts, Program 4.1.1 expressly requires
amendment of the Land Use Element to align policies of the Housing Element with the balance of the
General Plan. Should any other policy inconsistencies arise during the Housing Element planning period,
Program 4.1.1 requires that corresponding adjustments be made in the General Plan so as to ensure that
all component activities of the Housing Plan can be fully implemented.
1.6           Format of the Housing Element
The Fillmore Housing Element is organized into two volumes: Volume 1 consisting of the Housing Element
Text and Volume 2 consisting of the Technical Appendices. Each Volume is contained within a stand-
alone document for ease of use. The first Volume consists of four chapters in addition to this introductory
chapter:
        Chapter 2.0 Progress Report includes a discussion of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the
         previously prepared Housing Element (adopted by the City Council in 2003), and the City’s
         progress in implementing the goals and policies of the previous Housing Element.
        Chapter 3.0 Needs Assessment provides a detailed analysis of housing needs, resources, and
         constraints in the City of Fillmore. Included in this analysis is an inventory of population,
         households, and housing characteristics, including an evaluation of housing affordability current for
         the 2014-2021 planning period.
                                                        1-7

      Chapter 4.0 Housing Resources and Constraints sets forth an analysis of housing opportunities
       and constraints. The discussion of housing opportunities focuses on an evaluation of the
       availability of land for the development of new housing within Fillmore. The discussion of housing
       constraints addresses those factors that serve as barriers to the construction of affordable housing.
       These include both governmental and market constraints to the production of housing.
      Chapter 5.0 Housing Plan presents housing goals, policies, and action programs to address the
       housing needs of existing and future residents of the City. While goal and policy statements are
       general in nature, the housing programs are specific actions necessary to achieve the goals and
       policy statements adopted in principle. The City’s quantified objectives for construction,
       rehabilitation, and preservation are summarized at the beginning of the Chapter.
The second Volume consists of five Technical Appendices:
      Appendix A ......................................................................................... Land Inventory Data Sets 
      Appendix B ...................................................................... Development Potential by Zone District 
      Appendix C ..................................................................................... Affordable Housing Analysis 
      Appendix D .............................................................................. Cumulative RHNA Requirements
      Appendix E ............................................... Civic Engagement – Public Comments and Responses
                                                                 1-8

2.0 Progress Report
2.1      Introduction
Section 65588 (a) of the Government Code requires that each local government shall review its housing
element as frequently as appropriate to evaluate all of the following:
        The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to the attainment
             of the state housing goal.
            The effectiveness of the housing element in attainment of the community's housing goals and
             objectives.
            The progress of the city, county, or city and county in implementation of the housing element.
The City’s existing Housing Element was adopted in May 2003, and covers the period from 1998-2005. It
is the purpose of this Chapter to evaluate the effectiveness of Fillmore’s current adopted Housing Element,
the progress in implementing the adopted programs, and the appropriateness of continuing the existing
Housing Element goals, objectives, policies, and programs into the future.
2.2      Appropriateness and Effectiveness of the Existing Housing
         Element’s Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Its Implementation
This section evaluates the effectiveness of the goals, objectives, policies, and actions of the 2003 Housing
Element. There were many factors that affected the City’s ability to meet the goals and objectives it
established in 2003, including limited staff and funding resources. However, the City worked to implement
as many of the programs as possible.
The success or failure of all the action programs is due in large part to the time City staff is able to devote
to the implementation and upkeep of each program. The City has limited staff, and therefore limited
available resources to devote to each project. Therefore, many of the programs that were unable to be
implemented due to staff availability have been discontinued. This will leave staff more time to devote to the
programs that the City believes will create the most meaningful impact on housing issues in this housing
element period.
The following provides a review of each action program defined in the 2003 Housing Element. The review
summarizes the outcome of each program. If an outcome was less than successful, a summary of the
reasons has been provided.
Biennial Evaluation. The Planning Department was to conduct a biennial update of the inventory of
available vacant or underdeveloped residential sites that could be developed to meet the projected housing
needs. This inventory would be used in discussions with potential developers.
         Outcome. Vacant land inventories were conducted in August 2009 and July 2013 to update the
         inventory of available vacant residential sites which could be developed to meet housing needs.
                                                       2-1

          Recommendation. Continue the program.
Second Unit/Accessory Units. The Planning Department was to actively encourage the use of second
units in single-family residential areas where such second units would neither adversely affect nor alter the
character of the surrounding single-family neighborhood. The goal was to develop 10 secondary units
between 1998 and 2005.
          Outcome. There have been five second dwelling units that have been approved, permitted and
          constructed since 1998. Two additional applications were submitted but withdrawn when it was
          determined that the applicant was not going to occupy either the main dwelling or the proposed
          second unit. One other application has recently been submitted and is pending review and
          approval. According to the City of Fillmore’s second dwelling unit/granny flat standards, the
          applicant for a second unit must also serve as the occupant for either the main dwelling unit or the
          proposed second unit.
          Recommendation. The City will update the Zoning Ordinance to be in compliance with state law
          (AB 1866) with regard to the future development of second units within the City. Continue the
          program.
Medium-High Density Residential. The City was to increase the maximum density within the Medium-
High residential zone and General Plan designation from 15 dwelling units per acre (du/ac) to 20 du/ac;
ensuring that there is a sufficient supply of housing units for all economic segments of the community.
          Outcome. The density increase for the maximum number of dwelling units per acre within the
          Medium-High density residential zone was not implementing during the planning period and there
          are no remaining large lot vacant parcels (1+ acres in size) with either the R-M or R-MH zoning
          designations. .
          Recommendation. Continue the program but target Commercial Housing (CH) parcels (instead of
          the R-M or R-MH zone) to receive a density increase from 15 to 20 dwelling units per acre.
Monitor At-Risk Projects. The Planning Department was to determine the status of financial incentives for
assisted housing projects to determine whether income restrictions on such projects are at risk of being
lifted, thereby terminating the affordability of the project. Where assisted housing projects are at risk,
strategies were to be developed to preserve their affordability. This was to occur one year prior to the
housing element update.
          Outcome. According to the California Housing Partnership Corporation (California non-profit
          organization dedicated to the preservation, expansion, and supply of affordable housing), as of July
          2013, there are no federally assisted housing projects in Fillmore. Additionally, no locally or state
          assisted housing projects in Fillmore are at risk.
          Recommendation. Discontinue the program.
Housing Rehabilitation Program. The Planning Department and the former Redevelopment Agency
(RDA) were to assist applicants in accessing home rehabilitation loans for low and moderate-income
housing, and self-help housing projects.
                                                         2-2

         Outcome. The Planning Department and former RDA assisted 12 applicants in accessing
         rehabilitation and improvement loans since 1998; and approximately $330,000 was distributed
         throughout five of the City’s Rehabilitation Programs.
         Recommendation. Continue the program.
Community Education Regarding the Availability of Rehabilitation Programs. The Planning
Department was to provide information to very low and low-income households and other special needs
groups regarding the availability of rehabilitation programs through neighborhood and community
organizations and through the media.
         Outcome. The City of Fillmore created and mailed a brochure of available rehabilitation programs
         in June 2003. In 2007, a webpage was made on the City’s website for the City’s Housing
         Programs, including the Housing Rehabilitation Program, with a link to the application. The
         brochure of available rehabilitation programs was last updated in 2003.
         Recommendation. Continue the program.
Housing Condition Survey. The City Building Official was to maintain a current housing condition survey
of all housing units within the City. This survey should include the number of units in need of rehabilitation
or replacement. The survey should begin at the start of the planning period and be continually updated,
with a comprehensive update one year prior to the next Housing Element Update.
         Outcome. The housing condition survey was assigned to City staff and an implementation
         schedule was created. The City has identified underdeveloped and dilapidated units on specific
         parcels which may be eligible for rehabilitation programs in the current planning period.
         Recommendation. Continue the program.
Rental Rehabilitation Program. The Planning Department and the former RDA were to provide financial
assistance to owners of rental property to rehabilitate substandard units to enable such units to remain
affordable following rehabilitation. The goal was to provide financial assistance to owners of five rental
properties to rehabilitate substandard units.
         Outcome. The City did not receive any applications requesting rental property rehabilitation
         assistance. Therefore, no financial aid was offered due to lack of applications.
         Recommendation. Incorporate community education concerning the availability of this program,
         and continue the program with modified goals.
Code Enforcement. The City Building Official was to provide ongoing inspection services to review code
violations on a survey and complaint basis. It was the goal of this program to eliminate code violations
within Fillmore.
         Outcome. On average, the City has initiated and closed 61 code enforcement case per year since
         1998. The City performs code enforcement on an on-going basis and will continue to do so in the
         upcoming planning period.
                                                       2-3

        Recommendation. Continue the program.
Housing Replacement Program. The former RDA and Planning Department were to continue the housing
replacement program whereby large rehabilitation loan requests are automatically reviewed by the City to
determine if replacement, rather than repair would be more cost effective. The goal was to replace 15
dwelling units that would have otherwise undergone costly rehabilitation.
        Outcome. Nine dwelling units have been demolished with City assistance at an average cost of
        $10,000 per unit. All of these units were removed during the 4th Housing Element cycle (2006-
        2013). During this time frame, the City facilitated the construction of 100 affordable (deed-
        restricted) dwellings.

        Recommendation. Continue the program.
Condominium Conversion Policy. The Planning Department was to prepare and adopt condominium
conversion standards as set forth in the 1993 Housing Element that would meet the goals of retaining
affordable rental units and protection and maintenance of the City’s rental market.
        Outcome. Ordinance 03-775 was adopted January 24, 2004.
        Recommendation. Strengthen and continue program.
Energy Conservation Program. The City Building Official, in association with Southern California Edison
and the Southern California Gas Company was to implement an energy conservation program that would
minimize the costs of space heating and cooling in new and existing dwelling units.
        Outcome. The 2007 California Building Code was updated to address cost-effective building
        energy efficiency standards. This updated building code was adopted by the City, and will apply to
        both residential and non-residential buildings. The California Building Code has been revised to
        address cool roof coatings, and has updated the standards for efficient lighting, duct and pipe
        insulation, thermal energy storage, ice storage air conditioners, and the use of evaporative cooled
        condensing units.
        Recommendation. Implement program.
                                                      2-4

Affordable Housing Inventory; Pursue Available Projects. The former RDA was to explore and
inventory the variety of potential financial assistance programs from both the public and private sectors to
provide more affordable housing units. The Housing Coordinator was to provide assistance to the City in
preparation of applications for potential financial assistance programs. Additionally, the Housing
Coordinator, on an annual basis, was to specify which programs will be applied for by the City. All available
local, state, federal, and private affordable housing programs for new housing and for the conversion and/or
rehabilitation of existing housing was to be pursued. The City Housing Coordinator was to apply for the
following grants for potential financial assistance:
              One project to assist in the provision of housing accessible for disabled residents (either new
               housing or retrofit of existing low-income housing)
              Two grants to assist in the provision of housing for farmworkers
              Two grants to assist the rehabilitation of existing low-income housing
              One grant to assist the provision of housing for seniors
          Outcome. The City did not apply for the above-listed grants due to staffing limitations.
          Recommendation. Continue the program.
Partnership Program. The Planning Department and former RDA were to meet regularly with non-profit, private,
and other public entities to examine opportunities for cooperative efforts to expand the City’s supply of affordable
housing for special needs groups. These special needs groups include farmworkers, elderly, single-parent
households, disabled, large families, and the homeless. The goal was to familiarize non-profit, private, and other
public entities involved in the production of affordable housing for special needs groups within the City of Fillmore,
and thereby facilitate interest on the part of these entities in developing affordable housing for special needs groups
in Fillmore.
          Outcome. The City invited proposals from various housing builders for a particular project which needed to
          satisfy its RHNA requirement. The project was ultimately awarded to the Cabrillo Economic Development
          Corporation (29 units). The project was approved by the City Council in 2007 and has since been
          constructed. The City also conducted public workshops with the public during the planning process of the
          North Fillmore Specific Plan, which was approved in July of 2006 and subsequently modified with the
          passing of Measure I. Furthermore, the City Planning staff meets with prospective affordable housing
          builders at the office counter regularly when they inquire about the City's planning process and
          requirements.
          Recommendation. Continue the program.
Support Non-Profit Housing Sponsors. The Planning Department and the former RDA were to support
non-profit corporations in their efforts to make housing more affordable to very low, low, and moderate-
income households. The effort was to include supporting grant applications, identifying available sites for
housing development, and City involvement in the development of such sites.
          Outcome. The City worked with Cabrillo Economic Development Corporation to create a 29-unit
          farmworker housing apartment/condominium project. The project was approved by the City Council
          in 2007. The City also facilitated the development of the Park View Apartments (50 units for very
          low and low-income seniors) which completed construction in March 2007.
                                                             2-5

          Recommendation. Continue the program.
Maintain a Streamlined Application Process. The Planning Department, City Engineer, and Building
Official were to continue efforts to streamline and improve the development review process, as well as
eliminate any unnecessary delays and restrictions in the processing of development applications. This
program’s goal was to minimize the costs of residential development within Fillmore attributable to the time
it takes to review development applications and plans.
          Outcome. The City has streamlined the plan check process by reducing the number of plan check
          reviewers from five to three, thereby reducing the amount of time required for the review. The City
          has also implemented a plan tracking number system.
          Recommendation. Continue the program.
Density Bonus Ordinance. The Planning Department was to monitor statutory requirements for municipal
density bonus requirements to ensure that City density bonus provisions comply with state requirements.
          Outcome. The City currently implements a Density Bonus Ordinance; however, the
          ordinance is not up to date with current state provisions. The ordinance will be revised in
          accordance with state regulations and implemented during the upcoming planning period.
          Recommendation. Continue the program.
Density Bonus Provision. The Planning Department and the former RDA were to grant density bonuses
for the provision of affordable housing units as required by state law.
          Outcome. The City has granted three density bonuses since 1998. The first bonus was granted in
          June of 2002 (Resolution No. 02-2574) to the Park View Apartments, which is a built project
          consisting of 50 units for very low and low income seniors. The second density bonus was granted
          in January 2003 to the Rachel Apartments for a mixed use project consisting of retail space and 21
          units. The third density bonus was granted to KB Homes in June of 2003 for a residential project
          consisting of 110 units. Neither of the latter two projects has been built.
          Recommendation. Continue the program.
Priority Building Inspections for Affordable Housing Projects. The Building Official was to give priority
to very low and low-income housing projects for the building inspections that are carried out during various
stages of the construction process.
          Outcome. Priority inspections were given to the Saratoga Apartments and Maggie Apartments
          during the 3rd Housing Element cycle, as well as each of the affordable projects listed in Table 2.A.
          that were constructed during the 4th Housing Element cycle.
          Recommendation. Continue the program.
                                                         2-6

Review and Revise the Congregate Care Housing Approval Process and Requirements. The
Planning Department was to review and revise the congregate care housing approval process and
requirements to ensure that they are appropriate for use toward the approval of farmworker housing.
         Outcome. The City has adopted Ordinance 03-774 in March of 2004 which contains specific
         requirements for farmworker congregate housing. Further revisions to the Zoning Ordinance are
         now required in order to implement the provisions of Health & Safety Code 17000 (Sections
         17021.5 and 17021.6 of the Employee Housing Act), permitting farmworker housing serving six or
         fewer persons by right in all residential zones and treating “agricultural housing complexes”
         meeting the state criteria of 36 beds or 12 units/spaces (maximum) as an allowed agricultural use
         not requiring a conditional use permit or other zoning clearance.
         Recommendation. Update the Ordinance by July 2015.
Community Information. The Planning Department and the former RDA were to undertake a program to
work with HCD to prepare and provide information to the community about annual incomes for typical
occupations and the equivalent buying power of these incomes in today’s housing market, including the
annual income ranges of very low, low, and moderate-incomes, and of the typical occupations that fall into
these categories. Additionally, the information was to include examples of different types of affordable
housing projects and how they can fit into a community. The implementation of this program was to
promote community understanding of affordable housing and very low, low, and moderate-income
categories, thereby reducing potential community resistance to affordable housing development.
         Outcome. The Community Information Program has not yet been implemented.
         Recommendation. Continue the program.
Marketing Materials. The Planning Department was to prepare marketing materials to be provided to the
building industry, outlining opportunities for the development of new above moderate-income single-family
housing within Fillmore. The goal of this program was to promote the development of needed above
moderate-income housing to meet quantified objectives for new housing to meet the needs of that income
group.
         Outcome. Marketing materials outlining these opportunities have not yet been prepared.
         Recommendation. Continue the program.
Meet With Potential Developers. The Planning Department and the City Manager were to actively seek
out and conduct an annual meeting with potential developers of downtown infill sites, as well as potential
developers of above moderate-income housing as a means of generating interest on their part to undertake
residential projects within the City.
         Outcome. The City has been conducting meetings with potential developers of downtown infill
         sites and above moderate-income housing. This includes developers of the Green Apartments,
         Stern Apartments, Maggie Apartments, Park View Apartments, Shah Condominiums, CEDC
         condominiums and apartments, and the 501 Santa Clara, Reider, River Oaks, and Saticoy Lemon
         projects.

         Recommendation. Continue the program.
Housing for Existing Very Low- and Low-Income Residents. The Planning Department and the former
RDA were to utilize CDBG funds for infrastructure improvements and available federal, state, and local
housing development programs to undertake development of housing projects for Fillmore’s existing very
low, and low-income households who are living in dwellings that are in need of replacement. The goal of
this program was to provide housing assistance to 150 very low or low-income Fillmore residents.
         Outcome. The City used former RDA funds to support the construction of 50 low-income senior
         apartments for the Park View Apartments project; and 29 additional units in the Cabrillo Central
         Station project.
         Recommendation. Continue the program.
Review the Potential for an Inclusionary Housing Policy. The Planning Department was to assess the
potential for implementation of an inclusionary housing policy. The goal of an inclusionary housing policy
would be to increase the supply of affordable housing for very low to moderate-income families. This policy
would encourage developers to construct a certain percentage of new dwelling units as affordable housing.
         Outcome. An evaluation was completed on February 22, 2005. The City Council voted to not
         implement an inclusionary housing policy because the City Council believes the current statutory
         requirement to provide affordable housing in connection with all new housing development within
         the City’s designated redevelopment project areas a more effective means to achieve affordable
         housing as opposed to allowing a developer to pay in-lieu fees, which may not assure that the
         City’s affordable housing goals will be attained.
         Recommendation. Program completed.
Additional Development Incentives for Mixed Use Projects within the Downtown Area. The Planning
Department and the former RDA were to use voluntary incentives to encourage the production of affordable
housing as part of mixed use projects. Within the downtown area, incentives for the production of mixed
use affordable housing were to be provided in addition to City density bonus incentives.
         Outcome. Presently, the Downtown Specific Plan offers the following incentives for mixed-use
         projects: 100 percent lot coverage; zero setbacks; parking in-lieu fee program; three story
         buildings at corner properties and mid-block; a maximum density up to 50 du/acre; and
         one required parking space per dwelling unit. Additional planned measures include the
         establishment of a new Affordable Housing Opportunity overlay zone to facilitate RHNA goals.
         Recommendation. Continue the program.
Increase the Allowable Density of Housing within the Downtown Area. The Planning Department,
Planning Commission, and City Council were to consider amending the Downtown Specific Plan to allow an
increase in residential density to a maximum of 50 units per acre over 4.7 acres, with a maximum of
201 units within the Downtown Specific Plan area. The goal of this increase was to provide sufficient land
inventory to meet the quantified objectives for the development of housing to meet the needs of very low-
income households.
                                                       2-8

         Outcome. The Specific Plan was amended on November 13, 2001 to increase the residential
         density from 15 units per acre up to 50 units per acre. The following projects approved in the
         Downtown Specific Plan area are either approved, under construction, or already built and
         occupied:
             Green Apartments (6 units) approved but not yet built.
             Shah Condominiums (18 units), approved but not yet built.
             CEDC Central Station (29 units), built and occupied.
             Saratoga Apartments (8 units), built and occupied.
             Maggie Apartments (8 units), built and occupied.
             Park View Apartments (50 units), built and occupied.
         Recommendation. Program completed.
Cooperative Association. The Planning Department and the former RDA were to continue to refer cases
and questions to the Ventura County Fair Housing Institute and/or the Housing Rights Center for
enforcement of prohibitions on discrimination in lending practices and in the sale or rental of housing.
Additionally, the City was to create a brochure in English and Spanish, explaining how complaints can be
filed. The brochure was to be made available at City Hall in the Planning Department, and throughout the
community in places such as bus stops, public libraries, community centers, local social centers, and other
public locations.
         Outcome. The City has provided Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding to the
         Housing Rights Center for the completion of housing brochures (in both English and Spanish)
         which are made available at City Hall. The brochures address a variety of housing issues and how
         citizens can deal with these issues in the City.
         Recommendation. Continue the program.
Housing Opportunities for Special Needs Groups. The Planning Department was to provide housing
opportunities to meet the special housing needs of farmworkers, elderly, disabled, large families, and the
homeless by giving priority funding to development projects that include a component for special needs
groups in addition to other lower income households.
         Outcome. The City prioritized funding for the Park View Apartments project (50 low-income units
         for seniors) and the Cabrillo Economic Development Corporations project (29 unit farmworker
         housing project).
         Recommendation. Continue the program.
Coordination with Agencies Serving the Homeless. The Planning Department was to cooperate with
public (Ventura County Housing Authority) and private assistance agencies to develop housing (including
transitional housing), family counseling, and employment programs for the homeless. The goal of this
program was to develop housing self-sufficiency for those who are currently homeless by working with
appropriate agencies to implement housing and employment programs.
         Outcome. In 2007, the City provided CDBG funding to County of Ventura Human Services Agency
         to help fund a public service called "Rain Project Transitional Living Center", which provides
         transportation services to the homeless. Homeless people are transported to multiple locations
                                                       2-9

        countywide to places such as career centers, vocational training facilities, job interviews, and
        medical facilities.
        Recommendation. Continue the program.
Remove Constraints on the Production of Housing for Disabled Residents. The Planning Department
was to analyze and determine whether its development policies and ordinances create any constraints on
the development, maintenance, and improvement of housing intended for persons with disabilities,
consistent with Senate Bill 520, which was enacted January 1, 2002. The analysis was to include an
evaluation of existing land use controls, permit and processing procedures, and building codes. If any
constraints were found in these areas, the City was to initiate actions to address these constraints,
including the removal of the constraints or provision of reasonable accommodation for housing intended for
persons with disabilities.
        Outcome. Due to limited staff resources, the City has not yet completed this activity. In addition,
        new measures are now proposed to implement the provisions of SB 2 and SB 812 adopted during
        the past Housing Element cycle.
        Recommendation. Continue the program.
                                                     2-10
3.0 Needs Assessment
3.1     Introduction
3.1.1 Statutory Requirement
Section 65583(a) of the California Government Code requires the Housing Element to include an
assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to the meeting of
these needs. The assessment and inventory must include the following:
        An analysis of population and employment trends and documentation of projections and a
        quantification of the locality’s existing and projected housing needs for all income levels. These
        existing and projected needs shall include the locality’s share of the regional housing need.
        An analysis and documentation of household characteristics, including level of payment compared
        to ability to pay, housing characteristics, including overcrowding, and housing stock condition.
       An inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites having
        potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and
        services to these sites.
        An analysis of potential and actual governmental constraints upon the maintenance, improvement,
        or development of housing for all income levels, including land use controls, building codes and
        their enforcement, site improvements, fees and other exactions required of developers, and local
        processing and permit procedures. The analysis shall also demonstrate local efforts to remove
        governmental constraints that hinder the locality from meeting its share of the regional housing
        need.
        An analysis of potential and actual non-governmental constraints upon the maintenance,
        improvement, or development of housing for all income levels, including the availability of
        financing, the price of land, and the cost of construction.
        An analysis of any special housing needs, such as those of the handicapped, elderly, large
        families, farm workers, families with female heads of households, and families and persons in need
        of emergency shelter.
        An analysis of opportunities for energy conservation with respect to residential development.
        An analysis of existing assisted housing developments that are eligible to change from low-income
        housing uses during the next 10 years due to termination of funding contracts, mortgage
        prepayment, or expiration of restrictions on use.
                                                        3-1

3.1.2 Demographic Imbalance
Target income groups comprise 69% of all households in               Figure HE-2. Existing Needs
Fillmore. Comparatively speaking, Fillmore ranks fourth                      Demographics
among 11 jurisdictions within the County relative to having
the highest concentration of low and moderate income
households. Similarly, Fillmore is ranked third highest in
terms of needs possessed by special population segments.
These population segments are recognized under Housing
Element law as having a more difficult time finding decent
and affordable housing due to special circumstances
particular to these groups.
3.1.3 Housing Affordability
The City has very favorable statistics with regard to the cost of ownership and rental housing compared to
the County at large (Figure HE-3), yet there is a high percentage of existing residents who are paying more
than what they can afford for the homes they live in. This anomaly is attributed to the disproportionate
percentage of target income groups that make up the resident population compare to other jurisdictions. In
short, Fillmore has a very affordable supply of housing but its demographics distort its availability.
                              Figure HE-3. Affordability of Existing Housing
                                                     3-2
3.1.4 Equitable Apportionment
State housing law requires that in allocating future housing needs by income level, the local Council of
Governments avoid further “impaction,” which is the concentration of target income households in excess
of what a community already accommodates compared to other communities within the region (California
Government Code Section 65584(d)(4)) . As depicted in Table 3.A. and Figure HE-4, Fillmore is
disproportionately burdened in the allocation of RHNA goals for the 2014-2021 planning cycle.

3.2      Employment and Population Characteristics
3.2.1 Total Population
Between the beginning and end of the 3rd (1998-2005) and 4th (2006-2013) Housing Element cycles, the
population of Fillmore increased from 13,339 to 15,175, translating to an average annual increase of
0.865%. During the same period, the growth in households was even less at 0.786% per year. Together,
these numbers translate to larger household sizes, growing from 3.528 persons per household in 1998 to
3.598 persons in 2013. Another notable trend has been the rate of increase between the two past Housing
Element cycles. In this regard, the growth rate in both population and households has slowed dramatically
during the 4th Cycle compared to the prior planning period. At the same time, the rate of growth in the size
of households has more than doubled. This is generally reflective of the recessionary economy and
housing slump that the nation (California in particular) has experienced over the past few years as less
housing has been built and more people are living together.

3.2.2 Population Projections
Forecasts adopted by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) indicates that the rate
of population and household growth in Fillmore during the 2014-2021 Housing Element cycle will increase
dramatically from that experienced during the previous two periods. SCAG’s forecasts an increase of
approximately 1,808 persons and 583 households between the period of 2014 and 2021 which is nearly the
same as the total growth experienced in the previous two planning periods combined.

3.2.3 Age Distribution
Understanding age distribution in the community is important because it affects the housing market. A
declining number of young children can result in a change in the types of housing units being sought.
                                                                  3-4

Childless adults tend to have a higher combined income and prefer certain amenities, increasing the
demand for condominiums or units in planned unit developments. An elderly population creates a demand
for units with common recreation facilities and easy access to commercial, medical, and transportation
facilities. Inflationary pressures within the housing market can create disadvantages for the elderly on fixed
incomes.
It is typical that a small younger community, such as Fillmore experience a particular demographic cycle.
As the community matures, its school age children grow up and begin forming their own households. Often,
mature communities that emphasized single family housing during their earlier growth phase do not have a
sufficient supply of housing that is affordable to these emerging households. Thus, a generation of new
adults is sometimes forced to move away from their community in order to seek starter (often rental)
housing.
In addition, many small communities find that the types of housing that were well suited to young families
are not particularly well suited to seniors and empty nesters (non-senior adults whose children have grown
and started their own households). Thus, seniors and empty nesters often look to sell their homes, and
move into housing that is smaller and better suited to their needs. Sometimes suitable housing for such
older adults is not available in the community they made their homes in, and they are forced to move to
other areas. Typically, a new generation of young families moves into the community. School age
population increases, and the community once again has many young families in residence.
As noted above, not only does a community’s demographic makeup change over time, so does its housing
needs. If it is important to the community to retain its youth and elderly populations, it is important that a
variety of housing types and styles of residential development be provided, including rental and starter
housing, as well as housing for young growing families, empty nesters, and the elderly. Between 2000 and
2010, U.S. Census data indicates a gradual aging of the City’s population as the percentage of persons
below 45 years of age has declined from 72% to 68%, while persons above this threshold increased from
28% to 32%. Overall, the median age has risen by two years. This trend coincides with the downturn in
housing construction that occurred during this period as fewer new families arrived in the community. As
the housing market improves, it is expected that this trend will moderate and the demographics will return
to a distribution comparable those recorded in 2000.

3.2.4 Ethnicity
Table 3.E provides the 2000 and 2010 breakdowns of the racial and ethnic distribution of the City of
Fillmore by percentage of the population. Between 2000 and 2010, U.S. Census data indicates a
demographic shift in the City’s population as the percentage of Caucasians declined from 31% to 23%,
while the Hispanic population increased from 67% to 75%. Over this same time frame, the County’s
Hispanic population increased from 33% to 40% while Caucasians declined from 57% to 49%. In
summary, the change in ethnic make-up in Fillmore parallel those of the County at large; however, the
percentage that Hispanics comprise of Fillmore’s population is nearly twice as large as that of the County
as a whole.

3.2.5 Employment Characteristics
According to the SCAG, there were approximately 3,200 employment opportunities in the City of Fillmore in
2008. Near the end of the 5th Housing Element cycle, SCAG forecasts 3,500 jobs, and by 2035 SCAG
forecasts 3,900 employment opportunities. These statistical projections translate to a steady decline in a
local jobs/household ratio.1 This means that businesses within the community are dependent upon
bringing in workers from other communities. In summary, the statistics specific to Fillmore suggests a
growing imbalance between employment and population, contrary to regional transportation goals that
promote sustainable communities. This affirms the need for proactive measures in future Housing Element
cycles to ensure that RHNA allocations are appropriately distributed throughout the region.
1 Communities having a lower jobs/housing balance are referred to as being “housing rich”, indicating that there are more workers than jobs in
the community. This means that workers within the community are dependent upon jobs in other communities. Communities having a higher
jobs/housing balance are referred to as being “Jobs rich”, indicating that there are more jobs than workers in the community. This means that
businesses within the community are dependent upon bringing in workers from other communities.

3.3       Household Characteristics
3.3.1 Average Household Size
As noted earlier in Section 3.2.1, total population between the beginning and end of the 3rd (1998-2005)
and 4th (2006-2013)Housing Element cycles increased by approximately 14%. During the same period,
the growth in households increased by smaller percentage, resulting in rise in the number of persons per
household from 3.528 persons in 1998 to 3.598 persons in 2013. This is generally reflective of the
recessionary economy and housing slump that the nation (California in particular) has experienced over the
past few years as less housing has been built and more people are living together. It is expected that this
trend will moderate downward as the economy improves and housing starts turn upward.
3.3.2 Income
Under Housing Element law, needs analysis and program development is geared toward four target income
groups: extremely low, very low, lower and moderate. These terms are benchmarked against the area-
wide median income for Ventura County, determined annually by HCD for each of the State’s 58 counties.
Table 3.G. displays the income limits current as of 2013. As shown in Tables 3.H. and 3.I., the City
accommodates a greater percentage of low and moderate-income households than do other communities
in the County. Overall, the City ranks 4th among other County jurisdictions in regard to having the highest
concentration of target income groups. Most notably, households earning less than 80% of the areawide
median income represent 50% of all households in Fillmore.

3.3.3 Housing Tenure
During the 4th Housing Element cycle (2006-2013), the percentage of renter occupied dwellings decreased
while owner-occupancy increased. Today, the distribution between occupancy types is roughly one-third
renters and two-thirds owners. This is explained, in part, by the mix of housing types that were constructed
during this period: 122 (64%) dwellings consisted of single family and mobile homes, while 68 (36%)
consisted of multiple family units. This distribution is quite similar to the County at large where owner-
occupants represent 68% of total households compared to 32% for renters. Not surprisingly, occupancy is
influenced by income and capacity to pay for housing. Those households with higher incomes are more
likely to own their own homes while those with lower incomes are more likely to be renters.
                                                                   3-8

3.3.4 Overcrowding
The Census defines an overcrowded unit as one occupied by 1.01 persons or more per room (excluding
bathrooms and kitchens). Units with more than 1.5 persons per room are considered severely
overcrowded. These conditions are influenced by the number of large families that reside in the community
(defined as households with five or more persons). According to the 2010 census, Fillmore had 900
households consisting of five or more persons, representing 21% of all households in the City. This
percentage ranked 3rd highest among all other Ventura County jurisdictions. While the distribution of small
and large households between owners and renters is very similar, average household size and the
incidence of overcrowding is much larger for renters. Based on a detailed cross-tabulation of incomes and
household sizes conducted in 2006, the incidence of overcrowding is: (i) more prominent among renter-
occupied dwellings than with owners; and (ii) linked to income – households with lower incomes tend to
have a greater incidence of overcrowding than those with higher incomes.

3.3.5 Special Housing Needs
As shown in Table 3.I., target income groups comprise 69% of all households in Fillmore. Comparatively speaking,
Fillmore ranks fourth among 11 jurisdictions within the County relative to the highest concentration of low and
moderate income households. Similarly, Fillmore is ranked high (3rd overall) in terms of needs possessed by special
population segments (Table 3.L.; 50.5%). These population segments are recognized under Housing Element law as
having a more difficult time finding decent and affordable housing due to special circumstances particular to these
groups. In Fillmore, the elderly and disabled comprise the largest share of special needs.

The Elderly and Households Headed by the Elderly. Elderly residents are defined as 65 years of age or
older. As of 2010, 10.34 percent of Fillmore’s residents were age 65 or older. The percentage of older
residents in Fillmore is just slightly higher than that of Ventura County at large (10.2 percent). The primary
considerations in evaluating sites for elderly housing include: proximity to shopping, social services, public
transportation, and health care; compatibility with adjacent land uses; and affordability. Using these
criteria, the most likely sites for elderly housing in Fillmore would be in and around the downtown area. The
City of Fillmore has three age-restricted residential sites for seniors: (i) Park View Apartments, 50 units; (ii)
El Dorado Mobile Home Park, 302 spaces (presently, 293 rented at this time); and (iii) Fillmore Senior
Apartments, 70 units.
Disabled Persons. Persons with a disability consist of those individuals with: (i) a physical or mental
impairment that limits one (1) or more of a person's major life activities; or (ii) a record of having or being
perceived as having, a physical or mental impairment. It does not include current illegal use of, or addiction
to, a controlled substance (as defined by Section 102 of the Federal Controlled Substance Act. 21 U.S.C.
Sec. 802).
         In general, housing needs specific to persons with a physical disability include close proximity to
          transit, retail and commercial services, and their workplace. Other needs may involve modifications
          to the housing unit itself: ramps, lowered sinks, grip bars, and wider doorways. Curb cuts, ramps,
          and elevators in multi-story buildings assist persons with walkers, crutches, and wheelchairs in
          gaining access to their living units, common areas, and the street. In comparison to other Ventura
          County jurisdictions, Fillmore has the highest concentration of disabled persons at 22% of its total
          population
         Chapter 507, Statutes of 2010 (SB 812) amended State housing element law to include persons with
          developmental disabilities as a subgroup of those classified as disabled. According to the Tri-Counties
          Regional Center (“TCRC”) which provides services to the developmentally disabled, there are approximately
          10,143 such persons that reside within the Counties of Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo.
          Apportioned on the basis of total population, this translations to a developmentally disabled population of
          100 persons within Fillmore. As affirmed by TCRC in its 2008 Five-Year Housing Business Plan, the
          housing needs of these particular subgroup do not depart from that possessed by other disabled persons; in
          particular, the lack of affordable housing. In light of this need, TCRC proposes the establishment of a
          Housing Non-Profit Organization (“NPO”) expressly dedicated to providing housing for the developmentally
          disabled. TCRC further notes that this need is exacerbated by problems of stigma and discrimination,
          reinforcing the importance of equal opportunity and fair housing programs.
Female Heads of Household. The number of single-parent families, especially those headed by a female,
has increased in recent decades. These families often have special housing needs, including a strong
demand for affordable housing because of the income limitations of single-earner households. For females,
the disparity in jobs and incomes make the challenge of raising families (and securing affordable housing)
all the more difficult. In addition, the proximity to day care facilities and supportive services are important
considerations. Of the 4,294 households within the City of Fillmore, the 2010 U.S. Census reports that
12% were headed by females. This demographic is comparable to the County at large where 13% of all
households were reported as being headed by females.
Farm Workers. According to a 2000 report from the Bureau of Primary Health Care, 35,181 persons (7,758
permanent, 12,697 migrant, and 14,726 seasonal) are employed in the industries of field agriculture,
nursery/greenhouses, and food processing in Ventura County. The report estimates that approximately 942
                                                            3-11

farmworkers live within the City of Fillmore. More recent 2010 U.S. Census data suggests a lower count
(i.e., 388 persons employed in agriculture forestry, fishing and hunting, and mining). In either case, a
Ventura County Farmworker Study completed in 2002 indicates that the principal needs specific to this
population segment consist of: (i) overcrowding (41% of respondents); and (ii) housing affordability (30% of
respondents.
Persons and Families in Need of Emergency Shelter. Several government agencies and social service
providers were contacted to gather information regarding the number of homeless persons residing in
Fillmore including: (i) the Ventura County Human Services Agency office located in Santa Paula; (ii)the
Ventura County Housing and Homeless Coalition; and (iii) the Salvation Army. According to The Ventura
County Housing and Homeless Coalition 2011 Homeless Count, 10 homeless individuals, all of whom are
adults, consider Fillmore their place of residence compared to a total of 1,872 homeless individuals living in
Ventura County at large. This low incidence of homelessness is affirmed in the 2010 U.S. Census which
reported no homeless for Fillmore compared to 463 persons overall for the County.
Assisted Housing At Risk. According to the California Housing Partnership Corporation, as of July 2013,
there are no federally assisted housing projects in Fillmore. Additionally, there are no locally or state
assisted housing projects in Fillmore at risk.
3.4       Housing Characteristics
3.4.1 Residential Land Uses
The City of Fillmore General Plan Land Use Element designates eight land use categories which allow
residential uses. These categories address a range of housing types and allowed densities.
         Rural Ranch Estate (RRE). The Rural Ranch Estate designation provides for single-family
          detached housing in a low intensity, rural setting. The purpose of this designation is to assign a
          basic land use intensity of 1 dwelling unit per 6 acres within rural areas where such development
          may be appropriate. This designation also allows agricultural activity, including limited equestrian
          facilities. Additional land uses, including churches, schools, parks, and day care centers are
          allowed provided they are deemed compatible with surrounding development.
         Residential Rural (RR). The Residential Rural designation provides for single-family detached
          housing in a low intensity, rural setting. The purpose of this designation is to assign a basic land
          use intensity of one dwelling unit per acre within rural areas where such development may be
          appropriate. This designation would also allow agricultural activity, including limited equestrian
          facilities. Additional land uses, including churches, schools, parks, and day care centers are
          allowed provided they are deemed compatible with surrounding development.
         Residential Low Density (RL). This designation provides for low-density neighborhoods with
          detached single-family dwellings with private yards at a density of up to 7 dwelling units per acre.
          Manufactured homes on permanent foundations are also permitted. Other land uses that serve the
          needs of a low-density neighborhood such as churches, schools, parks, or day care centers may
          be permitted, if it is determined that they are compatible with the surrounding area. Limited
          agricultural pursuits could also be allowed under this designation.
                                                        3-12

        Residential Medium Density (RM). This designation provides for medium density neighborhoods
         with single-family detached homes, two-family attached or detached homes such as condominiums
         or townhouses, multi-family residential dwellings, and mobile home parks at a density up to 11
         dwelling units per acre. Manufactured homes on permanent foundation are also permitted. Other
         land uses that serve the needs of a medium-density neighborhood such as churches, schools,
         parks, or day care centers may be permitted, if it is determined that they are compatible with the
         surrounding area.
        Residential Medium-High Density (RMH). The purpose of this designation is to provide for
         medium-high density neighborhoods with two-family attached and detached homes such as
         condominiums or townhouses, and multi-family residential dwellings at a density up to 15 dwelling
         units per acre. Other land uses that serve the needs of a medium-density neighborhood such as
         churches, schools, parks, or day care centers may be permitted, if it is determined that they are
         compatible with the surrounding area.
        Residential High Density (RH). This designation allows for high-density neighborhoods with
         attached multi-family residential dwellings at a density of up to 30 dwelling units per acre. Other
         land uses that serve the needs of a high-density neighborhood such as churches, schools, parks,
         or day care centers may be permitted, if it is determined that they are compatible with the
         surrounding area.
        Central Business District (CBD). Although primarily a commercial designation for the historic
         downtown area, it can allow residential development in a mixed-use setting, at a maximum density
         of up to 50 dwelling units per acre.
        Commercial Highway Zone (CH). This designation is primarily for professional office, retail,
         service and tourist-oriented businesses; it can allow residential development in a mixed-use
         setting.
3.4.2 Housing Inventory
As shown in Table 3.M., the State of California Department of Finance identifies 4,425 dwelling units
existing within the City of Fillmore as of January 2013. Approximately 73% of these units are detached
single family homes. This reflects the community’s small town character and agricultural heritage,
compared to 65% single family homes Countywide.

3.4.3 Housing Conditions
The 2010 Census identified substandard housing conditions in units that were lacking complete kitchen,
telephone and/or plumbing facilities, as detailed in Table 3.M. If the lack of a fixed telephone were
removed as a criterion (given technological advancements and prevalence of cellular communications), the
percent of deficient housing within Fillmore would amount to 1.7% compared to 2.1% Countywide.

Generally, housing in the City is in good condition with a few deteriorated or dilapidated dwelling units. The
housing condition problems that do exist in Fillmore are generally concentrated in a 45-acre area west of
the downtown area. Based on past housing condition surveys and a windshield survey undertaken in early
2001, it is estimated that there are about 180 deteriorated and 20 dilapidated dwelling units within the City.
3.4.4 Housing Cost and Rents
As shown in Table 3.O. and displayed in Figure HE-5, Fillmore (along with Port Hueneme and Santa Paula)
has the lowest priced rental and ownership housing of any community in Ventura County. Less favorable
is the percentage of income that Fillmore residents pay for the housing they live in (Table 3.P.). This
anomaly is attributed to the disproportionate percentage of target income groups that make up the resident
population compare to other jurisdictions (Table 3.Q.). In short, Fillmore has a very affordable supply of
housing but its demographics distort its availability.

3.5       Existing Housing Needs
3.5.1 Income Groupings
State law requires that housing needs be determined in such a way as to ensure that the shelter
requirements of all income groups be identified, not just those households with income high enough to
compete effectively in the private marketplace. Housing need is distributed into five income categories
related to the County median household income: extremely low, very low, low, moderate, and above
moderate income. The dollar thresholds that define these terms change from year to year. Table 3.R.
provides a numeric context to these terms as of the beginning of the 2014-2021 Housing Element planning
period. As shown in Table 3.S., Fillmore is ranked 4th among 11 Ventura County jurisdictions relative to
the percentage which target income households comprise of each community’s total population.

3.5.2 Housing Affordability
Affordability is a function of household income and housing costs, with adjustments for family size and
bedroom count. Housing costs include mortgage, rent, taxes, insurance, maintenance and utilities. The
limits placed on housing costs are prescribed by State law and vary according to income category and
housing unit type. Operative terms and definitions appear in Table 3.T. along with current affordability
limits. Even though Fillmore has a favorable supply of low cost housing compared to other Ventura County
jurisdictions (Table 3.U.), the U.S. Census reports that 53% of all households are paying more than they
can reasonably afford for housing (Table 3.V.). The incidence of overpaying is more pronounced among:
(i) renters (62%) than it is for owner-occupants (48%); and (ii) households with lower-incomes. The
disconnect between incomes and affordability is attributed to the disproportionate percentage of target
income groups that make up the resident population compare to other jurisdictions. In short, Fillmore has a
very affordable supply of housing but its demographics (skewed toward lower-income households) distort
its availability.

3.6       Future Housing Needs
3.6.1 Statutory Summary
Section 65584 of the Government Code requires that the appropriate council of governments determine
each locality’s share of the region’s existing and future housing needs. SCAG, which is the council of
government for Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura Counties, adopted
                                                                3-18

a Regional Housing Needs Assessment on October 4, 2012. This document identifies future housing needs
throughout the SCAG region. Future housing need is defined as the number of additional housing units that
are needed to meet projected increases in the number of Fillmore households between October 1, 2013
and September 30, 2021. The objectives of the RHNA are as follows: (i) accommodate projected growth in
the number of very low, low, moderate, and above moderate income households; (ii) compensate for
housing demolitions and other inventory losses; and (iii) achieve a vacancy rate at the end of 2021 that
allows the market to operate efficiently (4 to 6 percent).
3.6.2 RHNA Fundamentals
The Requirement. Housing Element law requires that communities identify sites capable of meeting their
assigned share of RHNA. For the 5th Housing Element cycle, the City has been assigned 694 dwellings.
The complete breakdown between target income groups appears in Table 3.Z. Housing law does not
require that new housing units actually be constructed to meet RHNA; rather, jurisdictions must simply
evidence that they have or can provide the capacity to accommodate their assigned share of the future
regional growth. The process for determining such capacity and programs that may be required to address
shortfalls (if any) is summarized below:
              Land Inventory. A parcel-specific inventory of vacant residentially zoned sites, vacant non-
               residentially zoned sites that allow residential uses, underutilized residentially zoned sites
               capable of being developed at a higher density or with greater intensity, and non-residentially
               zoned sites that can be recycled for residential use.
              Development Suitability. A realistic forecast of development potential for the identified land
               inventory based actual construction that has occurred in the past, and an analysis of
               development suitability for non-vacant sites taking into account existing site improvements,
               market conditions and governmental incentives.
              Unit Affordability. An affordability analysis of future residential potential based on market
               conditions, financial feasibility and the characteristics of past development. In the alternative, a
               default density of at least 20 units per acre may be assumed to produce housing that is
               affordable to lower income households.
              Program Response. If the land inventory, development suitability and/or unit affordability
               analysis evidences a shortfall in the capacity to accommodate RHNA, the Housing Element
               must include an adequate sites program that that requires the unaccommodated need for
               lower-income households be meet through “by right” zoning.
The Alternatives. Up to 25 percent of the RHNA requirement may be met through substantial
rehabilitation, the conversion of ownership housing to affordable rentals, and/or the purchase of affordability
covenants. The ability to use these alternatives, however, requires that a jurisdiction commit financial
assistance by means of an enforceable agreement that assures affordable occupancy within two years of
the agreement. Given Fillmore’s financial and staff constraints, the alternative sites remedy is not
considered a viable option for the 2014-2021 Housing Element cycle.

3.6.3 Adequate Sites Analysis
Land Inventory. The inventory of available sites to accommodate RHNA covers three separate planning
periods from 1998 through 2021. For the 3rd Cycle covering the period of 1998-2005, the data set consists
of all vacant parcels as of 2002 (regardless of size) used in connection in the adopted Housing Element; for
the 4th Cycle covering the period of 2006-2013, the data set consists of vacant parcels only with a size of
one or more acres; for the 5th Cycle covering the period of 2014-2021, the data set includes both large and
small vacant parcels as of July 2013. The data sets for the 4th and 5th Cycles each include a limited
number of underutilized properties that are further discussed in Section 4.2.2. The overall inventory is
contained in Appendix A and summarized in Table 3.W.

development potential of identified sites is based on a detailed analysis of actual build-out density within
each of the zone districts that allow residential uses. For the Commercial Highway and Central Business

Unit Affordability. The adopted Housing Element for the 3rd Cycle apportions affordability by land use
designation according to a combination of anecdotal data and project information. This methodology was
accepted by HCD in its certification, but has been modified to account for the failed implementation of
Program 1.1.3. (increasing the base density of the R-MH zone from 15 to 20 units per acre). For the 4th
and 5th Cycles, the methodology for computing affordability employs a blended approach as described
below. The results are summarized in Table 3.Y. and the detailed data and modeling is contained in
Appendix C.
              Deed Restricted Units. Five projects and a total of 71 deed-restricted dwellings were
               constructed and occupied during the 4th Cycle. Each of these dwellings, according to
               household income, have been applied against the RHNA goal allocation based on the
               covenants imposed.
              Specific Plan Projects. A total of 119 single family dwelling units under the Heritage Valley
               Park Specific Plan were constructed and occupied during the 4th Cycle. Affordability of these
               units were distributed according to actual construction/sales (“turnkey”) data available from the
               Ventura County Assessor for 67 of these dwellings (more than one-half of all dwellings
               developed during this time frame; Appendix C, Table C-7). The distribution of affordability
               among target households is determined through elaborate modeling that establishes housing
               cost limits for each year of the 4th Housing Element cycle, adjusted for number of bedrooms
               and household sizes (Appendix C, Tables C-1 through C-7).
                                                                 3-22

 Miscellaneous Single Family Homes. A total of six single family dwelling, unrelated to a
  specific project, were constructed and occupied during the planning period. Lacking sales
  data or affordability covenants, all of these dwellings were assigned to persons and
  households other than low or moderate income.
 Available Sites: The inventory of available sites as of August 2009 evidences a development
  potential of 1,698 dwellings (Appendix A, Tables A-1 and A-2). This inventory is expressly
  limited to large parcels of at least one acre in size and the calculation of development potential
  is based on the intensity of actual development that has been recorded for each corresponding
  zone district (Appendix B). The gross potential of 1,698 dwellings is then reduced by the
  actual number of dwellings constructed since August 2009, resulting in a net potential of 1,634
  units (Appendix D, Table D-2). The distribution of affordability appears in Table 3.Y and
  Appendix D, Table D-5, of the updated Housing Element and is computed as follows:
            (i)   The affordability of low density residential properties is derived from actual
                  construction/sales (“turnkey”) data for the planning period available from the
                  Ventura County Assessor for corresponding zone districts (R-R and R-L; 1 to 7
                  du/ac; Appendix C, Table C-7). The distribution of affordability among target
                  households is determined through elaborate modeling that establishes housing
                  cost thresholds for each year of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Housing Element cycles,
                  adjusted for number of bedrooms, household sizes and annual income limits
                  (Appendix C, Tables C-1 through C-6).
            (ii) The development potential of properties designated as Commercial Highway
                  (CH) is derived from rental data obtained at the beginning and end of the
                  planning period for the R-MH zone district which allows a comparable residential
                  density (11-15 du/ac; Appendix C, Table C-14). The data base does not provide
                  rental information for CH-zoned properties; hence, the default to R-MH zoned
                  properties).
            (iii) The development potential of High Density Residential (RH; 35 du/ac) and
                  Commercial Business District (CBD; 50 du/ac) assumes 100% affordability to
                  lower-income households by operation of California Government Code Section
                  65583.2(c)(3).
            (iv) The “net capacity” (i.e., development potential based on the intensity of
                  developed properties) within the CH and CBD Zones is further reduced by a
                  factor of 50% to account for shared uses that are allowed within these particular
                  zone districts.
 Unaccommodated Need. The revised methodology evidences that there was an adequate
  inventory of suitably zoned sites in the 4th Housing Element cycle (in combination with actual

               Cycle as a result of Program 1.1.3 not having been implemented. In the 5th Cycle, Program

               Residential Medium-High Density (R-MH) parcels within the City.

Notes:
1. Development Potential and Affordability Distributions for the 3rd Cycle correspond to the calculations approved by HCD in its certification
    of the 1998-2005 Housing Element, with downward adjustment of the R-MH zone to account for the failed implementation of Program
    1.1.3.
2. Within the High Density Zone (35 du/ac) and Central Business District Zone (50 du/ac) for the 4th and 5th Cycles, all dwellings are deemed
    affordable for lower-income households based on the provisions of California Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B)(iii).
3. The distribution of affordability within the Heritage Valley Park Specific Plan area is based on actual “turnkey” sales data for units
    constructed and occupied during the 4th Housing Element Cycle (Appendix C, Table C-7).
4. The distribution of affordability within the North Fillmore Specific Plan area accounts for an inclusionary requirement of 15% that is
    imposed by operation of redevelopment law; the remaining development potential is assigned exclusively to households above moderate
    income.
5. The distribution of affordability within the Commercial Highway Zone for the 4th and 5th Cycles is based on actual rental data for the R-MH
    Zone which allows residential development at the same density (i.e., 15 du/ac; Appendix C).
                                                                         3-25

Program Response. The cumulative analysis of RHNA requirements is summarized in Table 3.Z. and the
detailed data and calculations are contained in Appendix D. In summary, the analysis shows that Fillmore’s
total assigned share of regional needs (including carryover from the 3rd Cycle) cannot be fully
accommodated within the inventory of land under current zoning without further program action. The
shortfall amounts to 52 units for low income households. As shown at the bottom of Table 3.Z and depicted
in Figure HE-6, the s can be fully offset by increasing the base density within the Commercial Highway
(CH) zone district from 15 to 20 units per acre Based on the provisions of California Government Code
Sections 65583.1(a) and 65583.2(a), the potential shortfall of 52 dwellings can be fully accommodated
through the implementation of Program 2.3.6 (Section 5.2) without invoking the requirements of “by right”
(re)zoning.

4.0 Housing Resources and Constraints
4.1      Introduction
Chapter 4 contains data and analysis pertaining to the resources and constraints affecting the
maintenance, improvement, and development of housing in Fillmore. The analysis focuses on four major
topics:
      Availability of sites for residential development (vacant land study / developable acres).
        Potential and actual governmental constraints on housing (e.g. land use controls, fees, etc.).
        Potential and actual non-governmental constraints on housing (e.g. land prices, construction costs,
         and the availability of financing).
        Opportunities for energy conservation with respect to new development.
4.2      Availability of Sites for Residential Development
4.2.1 Physical / Environmental Constraints
Physical/environmental constraints that potentially serve as constraints to new residential development are
discussed below and consist of two basic categories: (i) internal constrains affecting land within Fillmore’s
existing municipal limits; and (ii) external constraints that affect outward expansion beyond the City’s
boundaries. In summary, none of these factors are likely to diminish the development potential of sites
identified in Figures HE-5 or HE-6 (and itemized in Appendix A). This conclusion is based on a combination
of considerations including: (i) all of the available sites are located within the City and not affected by
external constraints; (ii) the internal constraints can be mitigated through regulatory measures (i.e., building
code standards and procurement of flood insurance) and the City’s environmental review process for
individual projects; and (iii) habitat and hillside constraints principally affect low density Rural Residential
areas that have greater siting flexibility to accommodate physical impediments.
Internal Constraints.
        Areas Subject to Flooding. A levee has been constructed along Sespe Creek to protect the
         western portion of the City from flooding. The Santa Clara River presents the primary flood hazard
         facing the community. Therefore, the City has recently constructed a levee along this river to
         protect many of the properties of the City south of River Street and adjacent to Pole Creek that are
         within the 100-year flood plain. However, FEMA is in the process of revising the flood zone maps
         and the City anticipates that FEMA will designate new areas in the flood zone, particularly areas
         south of Old Telegraph Road between A Street and the Sespe Creek and some dwellings next to
         Pole Creek. Areas in the southeast portion of the City, south of State Route 126, are also
         expected to be added to the flood zone. Once finalized, new construction within the designated
         flood zone will be required to comply with the building code to protect the occupants of those
         buildings.
                                                         4-1

         Significant Habitat. Principal habitats found within and adjacent to Fillmore consist of annual
          grassland, Ventura coastal sage scrub, and riparian. Biologically, the most important of these
          habitats are the riparian and Ventura coastal sage scrub habitats. The native and naturalized
          riparian communities are generally restricted to Sespe Creek, Santa Clara River, and Pole Creek
          drainages, while native coastal sage scrub vegetation are typically found on undeveloped hillside
          areas that surround the City. Wildlife uses of the Santa Clara River, Sespe Creek, and Ventura
          coastal sage scrub include both common wildlife species and potential special status species.
         Areas of Steep Slopes. While much of Fillmore is relatively flat, the City is bounded by steep
          sloping hillsides to the north and east. Much of this rugged terrain has slopes exceeding 30
          percent, and would require expensive grading and slope stabilization. The General Plan Safety
          Element shows these areas of steep slopes, including those areas that exceed 30 percent slopes.
          The majority of these properties are within the Rural Residential zone. Given a base density of one
          dwelling per acre, there is flexibility to site dwellings to accommodate constraints.
         Fault Zones. The San Cayetano Fault runs east of the City, and has been designated by the State
          Geologist as an active fault, since it has experienced displacement in recent geologic time. This
          fault has not been designated as a special study zone under the Alquist-Priolo Act; however,
          Ventura County has designated the fault as a Primary Fault Hazard Zone subject to recommended
          development standards (i.e., geologic mitigation to meet Uniform Building Code seismic
          requirements).

External Constraints.
      Agricultural and Open Space Issues. In general, most of the area within the existing City limits is
       not in agricultural production. However, Fillmore is surrounded by agriculture. Areas outside the
       City that are south of State Route 126, within the current Sphere of Influence, are currently in
       agricultural production. In addition, many of the parcels in the Goodenough Road area are under
       agricultural production. Prime agricultural soils are common in the areas under agricultural
       production, particularly in the lower-lying areas featuring rich alluvial deposits. Some agricultural
       parcels are currently under Williamson Act contract, which precludes their development until such
       time as the contracts expire.
      Greenbelts. The City of Fillmore is party to greenbelt agreements with the City of Santa Paula and
       Ventura County. In Ventura County greenbelt agreements are adopted by resolution or ordinance
       between public agencies. The agreements represent a form of mutual regulatory control between
       two or more jurisdictions concerning urban form, the protection of farmland and open space land,
       the future extension of urban services / facilities, and annexations. These greenbelts are intended
       to operate as community separators or buffers and participating cities agree not to extend
       municipal services into the greenbelts or to annex greenbelt lands.
            o The Santa Paula and Fillmore Greenbelt Agreement was established in 1980, and was
                reaffirmed in the 1990s. This agreement covers approximately 34,200 acres west of the
                City. The eastern boundary lies at Sespe Creek adjacent to Fillmore, and the western
                boundary runs along Santa Paula Creek, around the City of Santa Paula’s eastern Sphere
                of Influence boundary to an extension of 12th Street. The southern boundary is the South
                Mountain ridgeline. The northern boundary is shared with the Los Padres National Forest
                boundary. The current Sphere of Influence is outside of established greenbelt areas.
            o In October 2000 the City adopted a greenbelt ordinance with Ventura County to protect
                lands east of the City. The Fillmore / Piru Greenbelt comprises about 72,000 acres and is
                bounded by: (i) the Fillmore / Santa Paula Greenbelt and the City’s General Plan Study
                Area on the west; (ii) the Los Padres National Forest on the north; (iii) the Los Angeles
                County line on the east; and (iv) the primary ridgeline of Oak Ridge and the Santa Susana
                Mountains to the south. The intent of this agreement is to make the greenbelt boundary
                coterminous with the City of Fillmore’s Sphere of Influence and planning area. Land Use
                within the greenbelts is governed by Ventura County’s General Plan, with such land
                designated as Agricultural and Open Space. Land uses within greenbelt areas must be
                consistent with this designation.
                                                      4-3

        Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources (SOAR) Ordinance. The County SOAR
         Ordinance was established through voter initiative in November 1998. This ordinance prohibits
         redesignation of lands with Agricultural, Open Space, or Rural designations under the County
         General Plan until December 31, 2020 without direct voter approval. The County’s SOAR
         Ordinance does not apply to areas within the designated Sphere of Influence of any of the cities
         within Ventura County, including Fillmore.
        Urban Growth Boundary Line. Fillmore has adopted an urban growth boundary line called City
         Urban Restrictive Boundary (CURB). CURB sets a physical limit on the expansion of urban
         development and separates such development from conservation areas. The urban growth
         boundary line is based on specific criterion that allows flexibility for development within the city
         limits outside of the CURB limits at any time subject to approval by the voters of the City of
         Fillmore, while ensuring developments such as those recently proposed with the objective of
         changing the character of Fillmore, will be subject to a vote of the citizenry of Fillmore. The City of
         Fillmore will continue to meet its reasonable housing needs for all economic segments of the
         population, especially low and moderate income households by directing the development of urban
         uses into areas where services and infrastructure are more efficiently available.
4.2.2 Suitability of Sites
The inventory of available sites to accommodate RHNA covers three separate planning periods from 1998
through 2021. For the 3rd Cycle covering the period of 1998-2005, the data set consists of all vacant
parcels as of 2002 (regardless of size) used in connection in the adopted Housing Element; for the 4th
Cycle covering the period of 2006-2013, the data set consists of vacant parcels only with a size of one or
more acres; for the 5th Cycle covering the period of 2014-2021, the data set includes both large and small
vacant parcels as of July 2013. The overall inventory is summarized in Table 3.W. Two issues that
particularly affect development suitability are parcel size and current use.
Small Parcels.
The City is rapidly approaching built out; nearly half of the properties identified as vacant or
underdeveloped are less than one acre in size. The City recognizes its dependence on existing small
properties to fulfill a portion of the regional housing needs. The size of a development site has a direct
effect on the number and affordability of units that can potentially be built. For the 3rd Housing Element
cycle (1998-2005), HCD certified the document without requiring further assessment of small lot properties.
In the 4th Cycle (2006-2013), only parcels of one acre or greater are considered in the suitability analysis,
while in the 5th Housing Element cycle (2014-2021), the development potential assigned to each lot of less
than one acre is assigned exclusively to households above moderate income. Two notable exceptions in
the 5th Cycle inventory is the inclusion of a 0.87 acre parcel and a 0.63 acre parcel, each with CH zoning
and owned in common with immediately adjacent vacant large lot parcels. These parameters and resulting
analysis are reflected in the inventory contained in Appendix A.

Underutilized Parcels.
The inventory of parcels for the 3rd Housing Element cycle (1998-2005) and accepted by HCD’s certification
does not differentiate between vacant and underutilized properties. For the 4th Cycle (2006-2013), the
inventory includes ten parcels with existing uses and of these: (i) eight are existing non-conforming uses
included within Specific Plan areas that are specifically designated for residential reuse; (ii) one is being
cultivated for agricultural use but is not sustainable due to size (6.06 acres) and residential encroachment;
and (iii) one consists of open industrial storage for which the owner has already filed application of
residential reuse. In regard to the land inventory for the 5th Housing Element cycle: (i) all of the small lots of
less than one acre are classified as being vacant by the Ventura County Assessor; (ii) four lots totaling less
than 15 acres are currently cultivated for agricultural use but not sustainable and are not under a
Williamson Act contract; and (iii) one lot is used for rail storage but is owned by the City’s successor
redevelopment agency and specifically designated for CBD/residential use under Fillmore’s Downtown
Specific Plan. These notations are included in the land inventory (Appendix A), while supporting photos
and commentary appear in Figure HE-9B.

  Developed Parcels. Beyond the accommodation of RHNA needs, Program 1.1.2 of the Housing Plan
(Section 5.4) identifies: (i) four developed industrial parcels for application of an HO-CBD overlay, allowing
 50 dwellings per acre in addition to other uses permitted by the underlying M-1 zone designation; and (ii)
one developed industrial parcel for application of an HO-RM overlay allowing 11 dwellings per acre. Each
 of the five identified parcels consist of uses that are no longer viable and the owners have all expressed
  interest in pursuing redevelopment and/or adaptive reuse of the sites. These conditions are notated in
                               Appendix A and further described in Figure HE-10B.

4.3                        Land Use Controls
The City of Fillmore exercises a number of land use controls that directly affect the development of
housing. Some of these programs place certain restrictions on housing development, while others
encourage housing production. It is the purpose of this section to evaluate the extent to which these
standards may facilitate or hinder the development of housing for all economic segments of the community.
4.3.1 Density Bonus
The current Zoning Ordinance provides for the granting of a density bonus or other incentives when an
applicant agrees to construct at least one of the following: (i) twenty percent of the total units of a housing
development for persons and families of lower income, as defined in state law (Health and Safety Code
Section 50079.5); (ii)ten percent of the total units of a housing development for very low-income
households, as defined in state law (Health and Safety Code Section 50105); and (iii) fifty percent of the
total dwelling units of a housing development for qualifying senior citizen residents, as defined in state law
(Civil Code Section 51.2). These provisions have since been modified by State law (SB 1818) and
Program 2.3.3. has been added to the Housing Plan to bring the City’s Zoning Ordinance current.
4.3.2 Development Regulations
The Zoning Ordinance establishes development standards for each residential zone, as detailed in Table
4.A. Table 4.B. shows parking requirements for residential units as established by the Zoning Ordinance.
There are five basic residential zones in the City of Fillmore, and are as follows:
                          RPD (Residential Planned Development) Rural (1.0)
                          RPD Low (7.0)
                          RPD Medium (11.0)
                                                                   4-10

          RPD Medium/High (15.0)
          RPD High (35)
(Each Zone within the City corresponds directly to the land use density outlined in the General Plan; except
for the Residential High land use category. Currently, the General Plan allows a maximum density of 30
du/acre, while the Zoning Ordinance allows up to 35 du/acre. The City has acknowledged this
inconsistency and will amend the General Plan to reflect the 35 du/acre density as indicated in the Zoning
Ordinance and Program 4.1.1. For purposes of this analysis, the 35 du/acre density is provided.)

Fillmore’s maximum lot coverage and setback standards do not constrain the maximum density allowable
within the various residential zones. Even at the minimum permitted lot size, the City’s lot coverage and
setback standards would accommodate maximum allowable residential densities. Within the low density
designation, existing standards permit a 2,400 square foot building footprint on the minimum size lot (6,000
sq. ft.). Development of two-story housing would permit dwellings larger than 2,400 square feet on the
minimum allowable lot size, while maintaining the maximum allowable development density. Analyses
undertaken to confirm this conclusion were also based on 1,200 square foot average unit size in Medium
and Medium-High density areas, and a 1,000 square foot average unit size in high density areas. Actual
city standards permit smaller dwelling units than those assumed for this analysis. Therefore, there is even
more ability to achieve higher densities in multi-family housing.
Required on-site improvements for residential development are determined largely by the zoning of the
property. Fillmore’s requirements for on-site improvements as expressed in the Zoning Ordinance are
typical of California communities, and are not considered to be unusually restrictive or as a constraint on
the development of housing. In a typical subdivision, the City requires a minimum street right-of-way of 54
feet (36-foot wide street width, 10 feet of parkways, and ten feet of sidewalk, or five feet per side), which is
less than is typically required in suburban communities throughout the state. Most developers decline to
provide private streets because the cost implications are carried on to the residents of the development.
Often, a developer will ask the City to accept the street. However, the City will only accept the streets
provided they are built up to City specifications as described above. The City estimates that approximately
15 percent of the sales price of a home derives from the on/off site improvements of the project.
As shown in Table 4.A., all residential zones allow a maximum building height of 35 feet or two stories
whichever is less. The City’s older residential areas are predominantly single story homes on small lots.
However, the City permits two story structures in those neighborhoods thus allowing owners the opportunity
to increase the height to their homes. Moreover, the current residential construction market is
                                                                4-12

predominantly made up to two-story structures and the City’s building height provisions support this trend.
The City’s parking standards help to ensure that housing projects provide adequate parking for their
occupants, which is important to a bedroom community like the City of Fillmore. To maximize use of the
land for large multi-family complexes, the City allows the builder to provide parking on the ground floor and
living areas above it. Side yard setbacks have minimum requirements of 10 feet, but may be reduced to five
feet with Fire Department approval. Furthermore, the City also allows the Director to grant parking
reductions and height increments as minor variances for up to 25 percent of the requirement. This
requirement can either be “waived” or considered as a minor modification to an already approved project
where up to 10 percent of the requirement can be “waived”.
Aside from the residential zones, the City also permits housing in the Central Business District (CBD), the
Commercial Highway (CH) Zone, and the Commercial Office (CO) Zone. Multi-family and single family
housing is allowed in the CBD and there are special provisions in this district alleviating parking
requirements where only one covered parking space per unit is needed as opposed to two spaces as
needed in the residential zones. Moreover, buildings in the CBD are allowed to be up to three stories in
height and 100 percent building coverage is allowed. Mixed-use development is allowed within the CH
Zone, and is typically developed at an approximate density of 15 du/acre; subject to the approval of a
Development Permit. The CO Zone allows single family residential development with the approval of a
Development Permit, which only requires administrative review and construction subject to the Residential
Low building standards thereby reducing the cost of construction to the builder.
4.3.3 Building Codes
The State of California uses the most current edition of the Uniform Building Code for new construction, as
does the City of Fillmore. Rather than acting as an impediment to new residential construction, building
codes ensure the health and safety of building occupants and help preserve existing housing stock by
requiring property owners to make improvements to their homes when the structure falls into disrepair to
prevent un-inhabitable structures. The City of Fillmore does have additional requirements on building
construction beyond what is required by the building code. These additional construction requirements
pertain to drainage, pool construction, fire protection and seismic safety and were adopted due to special
climatic, topographical, and geological factors, as explained below:
Geological: (1) The City is in a high potential activity seismic zone. After a large seismic event, the
potential for multiple fires occurring simultaneously will likely tap available firefighting resources. There is a
likelihood of broken natural-gas mains causing other fires, leakage of hazardous materials, the need for
rescues from collapsed structures, and the rendering of first aid and other medical attention to large
numbers of people. (2) The soil conditions in the City are extremely corrosive to copper water piping. The
use of thin-walled copper pipe below grade does not support the preservation of property or the protection
of the municipal water supply. (3) The City is located where the water table is very high and the soil is very
expansive, necessitating special requirements for the construction of swimming pools.
Topographical: (1) The City has rural areas that are highly prone to fire hazards. Due to topography,
access to structures in rural areas increases response times and delays fire suppression efforts. Structural
fires in hillside areas will have a greater likelihood of starting a wildfire, and exposing additional structures
to fire damage. Emergency personnel responding to these incidents may be unduly impeded and delayed
in accomplishing an emergency response; resulting in an unnecessary risk to the protection of life, public
safety, and property (particularly in those buildings or structures without the fire sprinklers). (2) The natural
                                                        4-13

grade of the City is low-sloping towards the south west. Development on such conditions creates difficult
drainage situations affecting neighboring properties resulting in uncontrolled drainage disposal.
Climatic: (1) The City experiences periods of high temperatures accompanied by low humidity and high
winds. These conditions create an environment in which the Fire Department commits large numbers of
firefighting resources to the control and extinguishment of wildfires. These climatic conditions may result in
the concurrent occurrence of one or more fires in the more populated areas of the City without adequate
personnel to protect against and control such a situation. (2) The City experiences seasonal conditions
where rainfall does not occur for several months, potentially creating drought conditions.
These contributing factors could increase the cost of development, but the long term benefit of protecting
public health and property is outweighed by the short-term construction cost incurred by the builder. The
builder would most likely pass the cost on to the buyer of the home, but may still have to offer a competitive
price to attract buyers.
The City’s inspectors conduct construction inspections for building occupancy and also respond to
complaints concerning building violations. Due to a lack of human resources, construction plans are not
reviewed by City staff. Plans are sent to a third party hired by the City who conducts the “plan checking”
service. The usual review period by this third party is 10 business days. The applicant pays for the time
spent reviewing the plans, which is a reasonable fee comparable to other cities in the county who have the
same type of plan checking service.
The Housing Element includes a code enforcement program (Program 1.2.5) to link code violations and
rehabilitation opportunities with the appropriate housing programs.
4.3.4 Minimum Size Requirements for Dwelling Units and Rooms
The City of Fillmore maintains minimum size requirements for dwelling units, as well as for rooms within
residential dwellings. There are no local amendments added to the Uniform Building Code. Additionally,
neighboring cities such as Santa Paula and Ojai adhere solely to the Uniform Building Code for their
minimum size requirements for dwelling units and rooms. The minimum size for dwelling units is measured
on the outside of walls, and excludes basements, garages, carports, exterior courtyards and porches.
These are modest requirements and are substantially smaller than what is currently being produced in
market rate housing. Minimum dwelling unit sizes are as follows:
         Single family detached homes: 1,200 sq. ft.
         Single family attached homes: 1,000 sq. ft.
         Dwelling units within a multi-family structure:
              - 1 bedroom                    750 sq. ft.
              - 2 bedrooms                   900 sq. ft.
              - 3 bedrooms                   1,000 sq. ft.
Efficiency apartments (400 to 700 sq. ft.) are permitted in areas designated in the General plan for Medium,
Medium-High, and High density residential development.
                                                         4-14

The City’s minimum room size standards are as follows:
             Room                                                            Minimum Room Size
             Bedroom                                                               100 sq. ft.
             Full bath (tub, toilet, lavatory)                                      50 sq. ft.
             Three-quarter bath (Stall shower, toilet, and lavatory)                35 sq. ft.
             Half bath (toilet and lavatory)                                        25 sq. ft.
The requirement for minimum room size does not act as an impediment to the development of housing. In
fact, these minimum standards are much lower than what the current construction market provides. These
standards are intended to ensure the health and safety of the residents by providing housing that enhances
their quality of life. Small dwellings promote overcrowding leading to poor living conditions and rapid wear
and tear of the structure and its appurtenances. These provisions of the Zoning Ordinance help conserve
housing in the City. Up to date, City staff does not have any trouble implementing these provisions on a
housing project particularly a multi-family complex where builders seek to maximize the density of their
project.
4.3.5 Mobile Home and Manufactured Housing Development Standards
The City of Fillmore permits manufactured dwellings to be used as single family residences outside of
designated mobile home parks if the home is certified under the National Mobile Home Construction and
Safety Act of 1974, and if it meets the following standards:
        The mobile home is installed on and secured to an approved permanent foundation in compliance
         with the Uniform Building Code and the Health and Safety Code (Section 18551).
        The mobile home has a minimum eave projection of 12 inches on all sides, including 18 inches on
         at least 2 opposite sides.
        All roofs have a minimum pitch of 1:4, and are constructed of non-reflective / non-metallic roofing
         materials.
        All exterior siding is non-reflective / non-metallic, and is installed from the ground to the roof.
        The mobile home has a minimum width across the narrowest point of 15 feet.
4.3.6 Second Dwelling Units
There were five second dwelling units built in the City of Fillmore since 1998, and the need for these units
in the community still exists. With the growing number of seniors in the community, it is anticipated that
families will be encouraged to build second units for their aging relatives or caregivers assisting them with
affordable housing. The City allows second dwelling units in the Rural, Low, and Medium density residential
zones, subject to the approval of a Conditional Use Permit and the following standards:
        No more than one additional dwelling unit may be placed on a single family parcel
        The additional dwelling is only permitted on a residential parcel with an existing owner-occupied
         single family detached dwelling unit. The additional dwelling unit may be attached to, or detached
                                                               4-15

          from the existing main dwelling. No additional dwelling units are permitted on lots already having
          two or more dwelling units.
         The parcel on which the additional dwelling unit is proposed must meet all of the applicable
          standards of the zone in which it is located.
         The parcel on which the additional dwelling is proposed must have a minimum of 7,500 square
          feet, a minimum depth of 120 feet, a minimum width of 50 feet, and a minimum buildable pad size
          of 400 square feet exclusively for the additional unit.
         The size of the additional dwelling unit may be up to 30 percent of the size of the existing living
          area of the main dwelling for an attached unit and up to 1,200 square feet for a detached unit. The
          minimum permitted size for the additional unit is 800 square feet, regardless if the 30 percent
          standard is met.
         The additional dwelling must be located within the rear third of the parcel, and may be up to 35 feet
          or two stories in height.
         The additional dwelling is to be architecturally compatible with the main dwelling unit.
         The additional dwelling is to be provided with two off-street covered parking spaces in addition to
          the parking required for the main unit.
         The additional dwelling is required to be metered separately from the main unit for gas, electricity,
          and water/sewer services.
Some of these requirements are in conflict with state law (AB 1866). Additionally, some of the
requirements present a potential constraint on the development of second units, such as:
         The requirement that the owner must live in the main residence;
         The minimum parcel size and location requirements;
         The requirement that additional dwelling units are to be provided two off-street covered parking
          spaces.
         The minimum size requirement for an additional unit being 800 square feet, regardless if the 30
          percent standard is met.
A program to amend the City’s Zoning Ordinance and eliminate any potential constraints toward the
development of second units is included in the Housing Element (Program 2.3.4). This program will
facilitate and encourage the development of more second dwelling units in the City while achieving
compliance with state law.
4.3.7 Processing and Permit Procedures
Development review may affect housing costs. Because of holding costs, the longer it takes for a
development proposal to be approved, the higher the development costs. In the City of Fillmore, an
application for a residential project containing about 20 units typically requires a processing time (from filing
of the initial application to Final Map approval) of 6 to 12 months. However, actual processing time for any
residential project varies according to the scope of the project and number of units proposed for the project,
as well as the time taken by the applicant to prepare the submittals including the Final Map, improvement
                                                        4-16

plans, and other project-related documents. While the City attempts to process development applications in
a timely and efficient manner, some delays are outside the control of the City. Delays in processing can
occur if environmental review, pursuant to California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), requires an
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) to be prepared. At times, approval from state or other agencies may
also be required for certain types of projects. The following entitlements below are those required for
residential development. Each type of permit application has decision making criteria, approval procedures,
and fees as described below.
        Development Permit – A Development Permit is required for all new construction (single family and
         multi-family) except for alterations/repairs to an existing single family residence. Depending on the
         number of units in the project, this permit is reviewed and approved by the Planning Director (for 1-
         3 dwellings), Planning Commission (for four or more dwellings), or City Council (upon appeal). In
         general, projects are reviewed for compliance with City ordinances; site layout & design;
         compatibility with neighboring property/development; efficiency & safety of public access and
         parking; appropriate open space and use of water efficient landscaping; consistency with the
         General Plan; and consistency with adopted design guidelines and policies. City staff reviews the
         architectural elements of a proposed project as opposed to presenting the project to an
         architectural review body, which could create further delays in the development review process.
         The application fee for a minor Development Permit (e.g. request for a new detached garage) is
         $350. The application fee for a regular Development Permit (e.g. request for a new apartment
         complex) is $2,000.
             1. Findings. A Development Permit is approved if the proposed project is able to meet all of
                  the following findings. On, average, the majority of housing projects do not have difficulty in
                  meeting these findings:
                  a. The proposed development is permitted in the subject zoning district and complies
                       with applicable provisions and any applicable design guidelines;
                  b. The development is consistent with the General Plan;
                  c. The proposed development would be harmonious and compatible with existing and
                       future developments within the zoning district and general area, as well as with the
                       land uses presently on the subject property;
                  d. The approval of the Development Permit for the proposed development complies with
                       the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act;
                  e. The proposed development would not have potential significant effects on the
                       environment and natural resources that could not be properly mitigated and monitored;
                  f.   The subject site is physically suitable for the type and density or intensity of the land
                       use being proposed;
                  g. There are adequate public services such as water, sanitation, and public utilities to
                       serve the proposed development and would not be detrimental to the health and safety
                       of the public; and
                  h. The design, location, size, and operating characteristics of the proposed development
                       would not be detrimental to the public’s interest, health, safety, convenience, or
                       welfare of the City.
                                                       4-17

       2. Exceptions. In addition, the City’s Development Permit process allows for modification of
           development standards, which can be used to facilitate the unique needs of supportive
           housing, farmworker housing, transitional housing, SRO’s, and emergency shelters. The
           Development Permit process would thus function in a manner similar to that of a planned
           development, allowing the City to establish development standards and conditions of
           approval tailored to the needs of the facility.
       3. Proposed Modifications. To ensure that prerequisite findings are applied in an objective
           and fair manner, the following ordinance modifications are proposed as part of Program
           2.1.1:
           a. Approval, conditional approval or denial of a Development Permit (including appeals) shall be
                accompanied with findings, supported by substantial evidence, that: (i) the action is justified on
                the basis of objective criteria identified in written standards, policies, or conditions as they
                existed on the date the application was deemed complete; and (ii) the facts and evidence are
                not unreasonably exercised for the purpose of rendering infeasible the development of
                housing for any and all economic segments of the community as prohibited in Section 65913.2
                of the California Government Code.
           b. The authority to deny issuance of a Development Permit shall be expressly limited to
                situations wherein approval would have a detrimental effect upon the public interest,
                health, safety, convenience, or welfare, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily
                mitigate or avoid the detrimental effect without rendering the development unaffordable or
                financially infeasible. "Detrimental Effect" shall mean a significant, quantifiable, direct, and
                unavoidable impact resulting from: (i) a conflict with adopted General Plan policy; (ii) non-
                conformance with adopted land use regulations or design standards; or (iii) significant
                unavoidable adverse environmental impacts.
 Parcel Map – A parcel map is required when a proposed project is requesting to subdivide the
  project area into four lots or fewer. Contents of the parcel map must comply with state law (the
  Subdivision Map Act) and with the minimum lot standards of the applicable zoning district. To help
  streamline the review process and avoid delays, the parcel map is reviewed and processed
  simultaneously with any other development permits the project may need. In general, a proposed
  parcel map is approved if the findings pertaining to a Development Permit are met and the map
  complies with state law and the City’s Subdivision Ordinance. However, in some cases the project
  may only entail subdivision of land with no construction proposed. Consequently, the findings
  pertaining to actual development would not apply. The application fee for a parcel map is $2,200.
  All proposed parcel maps are reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission.
 Tentative Map – A tentative map is required when a proposed project is requesting to subdivide the
  project area into five or more lots. Contents of the tentative map must comply with the Subdivision
  Map Act and with the minimum lot standards of the applicable zoning district. As with the parcel
  map process, the tentative map is also reviewed and processed simultaneously with the other
  permits the project may need. Also, as with parcel maps, the City does not have adopted findings
  for tentative maps and provided that the findings for a Development Permit are met and the
  proposed map complies with state law requirements and the City’s Subdivision Ordinance, the
  tentative map is usually approved. The application fee for a tentative map is $2,550. All proposed
                                                    4-18

         tentative maps are reviewed by the Planning Commission and recommended to the City Council
         for final approval.
Typically, processing and permitting procedures for residential development in the City of Fillmore are as
follows:
4.3.7.1 Small Single Family Projects (One to three units)
If a development consists of one to three units, a Development Permit is required for the project and the
City’s Community Development Director can approve the project without Planning Commission or City
Council review. This administrative review process may take between three to four months.
4.3.7.2 Other Single Family Projects (Four units or more)
If a proposed development consists of four units or more, a Development Permit is required for the project
and the project is reviewed by City staff and presented to the Planning Commission for their review and
approval. Depending on the scope of the project, City Council approval may be required. Generally this
process may take between six months to a year. If the proposed development will create additional lots, a
parcel map or tentative map is required and the process may take up to a year. The following additional
steps must be taken as part of the review process:
        The environmental review must be completed in accordance with the California Environmental
         Quality Act. Fees are based on the type of environmental review (EIR, MND, ND etc.)
        Depending on the total number of lots created, the Planning Commission and/or City Council will
         need to review and approve the project.
        A Final Map is accepted by the City.
4.3.7.3 Small Multi-family Projects (Three Units or less)
If the development consists of three units or less and does not involve a zone change, subdivision,
annexation, or the like, the project will require only a Development Permit and is reviewed and approved by
the Community Development Director, which usually takes approximately three to four months.
4.3.7.4 Other Multi-family Projects (Four Units or More)
If the development consists of four units or more, the project will require a Development Permit and
processing time is usually six months. In addition, the following steps must be taken:
        Environmental review must be completed in accordance with the California Environmental Quality
         Act.
        Planning Commission will need to review and approve the project, and depending on the scope of
         the project, City Council may have to review and approve the project.
        Once the Planning Commission or City Council approves the application, the applicant may seek
         building permits.
                                                        4-19

The development of multi-family housing is encouraged to provide a variety of housing types to individuals of all
income levels. The City aims to minimize time and complications of the permit process to facilitate additional multi-
family units in the City. Typically the processing and permitting procedures for multi-family developments in the City
of Fillmore are as described above.
4.3.7.5 Dormitory-Style/Congregate Farmworker Housing
A review of farmworker housing facilities (both annual residences and migrant family facilities) operated by
various agricultural county housing authorities indicates that family farmworker housing facilities in many of
California’s agricultural counties range in density between 6 and 10 dwelling units per acre, and consist of
detached, duplex, and small attached structures. This type of housing could be developed in low, medium,
medium-high, and high density zones in the City of Fillmore. Migrant family farmworker housing facilities in
many of California’s agricultural counties were found to have a density range of 10-14 dwelling units per
acre, consisting of duplex, fourplex, and small attached structures, and could be developed in medium,
medium-high, and high density zones. The projects that were reviewed were generally built pursuant to
USDA Rural Development Program and Office of Migrant Services Farm Labor Centers, and were all
operated by county housing authorities. Due to high land costs, the Cabrillo Economic Development
Corporation (CEDC is the leading non-profit affordable housing producer in Ventura County) reported that
densities of 18-24 dwelling units per acre will be necessary within Ventura County to produce housing
affordable to farmworkers.
The City encourages the use of programs such as the USDA Rural Development Program and often seeks
assistance from the Office of Migrant Services Farm Labor Centers to facilitate and provide farmworker
housing within the Central Business District and the City’s Low, Medium, Medium-High and High density
residential land use designations. Although farmworker housing is allowed in almost all residential areas in
the City, the provision of housing for farmworkers does not necessarily create an adverse impact on the
availability of land that could accommodate new housing for very low-income, non-farmworker households.
In order to ensure that the specific needs of agricultural employees are properly addressed without
compromising neither the character of the neighborhood nor the quality of life of surrounding residents, the
City allows dormitory style and congregate housing, including farmworker congregate housing in all
residential zones with the exception of the R-R zone, and also allowed in the CBD with approval of a
Conditional Use Permit. If the project involves new construction, then a Development Permit would also be
required. City staff reviews the proposed plans and presents the project to the Planning Commission for a
decision. Normally, the process takes about six months, but could take longer depending on the scope of
the project and the type of environmental review required per CEQA. The CUP works as a tool to ensure
that the unique housing needs of farmworkers are preserved and assists the City to impose project specific
conditions and/or provisions to monitor the use of onsite amenities. For example, aside from allowing
multiple kitchen facilities in a complex, the City requires that residents of the complex be provided with a
common recreational and/or entertainment area in addition to sufficient common laundry facilities that are
accessible to all residents. Furthermore, the City allows for barber shops and beauty salons on site as well
as a drug store and/or medical facility for the exclusive use of farmworker residents. Over time facilities
such as these in the complex can fall into disrepair compromising the health and safety of its users. A CUP
helps to ensure that onsite facilities are preserved and properly maintained consistent with the provisions of
the Employee Housing Act.
                                                          4-20

To preserve the availability of these complexes for other farmworkers and future ones, the City requires
that the owner of the complex come into a written agreement with the City guaranteeing the use of these
units exclusively for farmworkers and members of their household for a minimum of 30 years. The City also
imposes criteria in defining a qualifying farmworker to prevent the use of these affordable facilities by non-
farmworkers. Moreover, to monitor compliance with these provisions, the City requires that the property
owner or the owner’s assigned agent submit an annual verification report to the City. A CUP allows the City
to impose conditions on the project ensuring that the use of these facilities are not misused and/or abused
by non-qualifying residents, thereby ensuring the success of the project for all. Typically, processing and
permitting procedures for dormitory style farmworker housing takes approximately 6-12 months in the City
of Fillmore. Currently, the City has a privately owned and managed dormitory-style farmworker housing
facility, which is built on a 2.5-acre parcel and consists of 35 rooms, one central kitchen, and contains 170
beds.
The City allows small group homes (6 people or under) as a use permitted by right in all residential zones.
However, this provision does not extend to farmworker group homes. In order to demonstrate consistency
with the provisions of Section 17021.5 of the Employee Housing Act, the City will revise Section
6.04.0410(1)(M) of the Zoning Ordinance to permit farmworker housing serving six or fewer persons by
right in all residential zones and cross reference these provisions in Section 6.04.23 that discusses
farmworker congregate housing (Program 2.3.5). Additionally, this Program will remove the processing
distinction between existing developed properties and newly proposed construction. In place of a
discretionary review process for new development that now applies to dormitory and congregate housing
for farmworkers and other special population segments, Program 2.3.5 provides for the codification of
objective management and development standards consistent with the provisions of Government Code
Section 65583(a)(4) . Finally, in order to demonstrate consistency with the provisions of Section 17021.6 of
the Employee Housing Act, the City will revise the Zoning Ordinance to allow, by right, agricultural housing
complexes meeting the state criteria of 36 beds or 12 units/spaces, since state law does not differentiate
between these types of housing complexes and “agriculture land uses”. These provisions will be cross
referenced in Section 6.04.23, in addition to amending the definition of “agriculture.”
4.3.7.6 Housing for Persons with Disabilities
The City’s Zoning Ordinance does not have any specific development standards for housing for disabled
persons. Any new residential development must comply with all applicable provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance such as setbacks, lot coverage, parking etc. and building code, including accommodating a
certain percentage of the total number of dwelling units in the project for disabled residents. Fillmore
requires development pursuant to the Uniform Building Code.
The City of Fillmore permits group homes for persons with disabilities in all residential zones. Provided the
structure is already existing, group homes serving six or fewer disabled persons are permitted by right in all
residential homes. As provided in Program 3.2.3, current zoning regulations governing supportive group
housing (including disabled persons) will be modified to remove the distinction between new construction
and existing developed property for by right uses and codify objective management and development
standards consistent with the provisions of Government Code Section 65583(a)(4) in place of discretionary
permit requirements. Group homes of seven or more persons are permitted in all residential zones with
approval of a Conditional Use Permit. Residential Care facilities are permitted by right in the Commercial
                                                       4-21

Office Zone and permitted in the Commercial Business District and the Commercial Highway Zone, subject
to the approval of a Development Permit.
In order to protect group homes comprised of non-related persons (including disabled individuals), the
City’s definition of “family”: (i) extends to unrelated members of a household who reside in together; and (ii)
imposes no restriction on the number of persons who may comprise a single housekeeping unit. The City
does not have any spacing criteria or concentration maximums for this type of housing nor other types of
development requirements that act as a constraint to the future development of these units. Disabled
persons living within a single-family home in a group home setting would be subject to the parking
standards of a single-family home (two spaces in a garage) as opposed to the parking requirement for a
congregate facility. The City facilitates the development of housing for persons with disabilities by being
able to waive certain development standards for ADA retrofit projects. In addition, Program 3.2.4 has been
added to provide special accommodations not presently allowed “by right.” As a standard practice, the
Planning Department often asks the developer of a tract home project to build at least one model as an
ADA unit to show prospective buyers that construction options for persons with disabilities are available.
As with all residential projects, a minor variance can be obtained by the project applicant to waive up to 25
percent of the parking requirement. The minor variance is an administrative procedure that only requires
approval from the Planning Director.
4.3.7.7 Emergency Shelters, Transitional Housing and Supportive Housing
Senate Bill 2, passed during the 2007-08 California Legislative Session and effective January 1, 2008,
clarifies and strengthens housing element law regarding the accommodation of emergency shelters,
transitional housing and supportive housing. Currently, the City of Fillmore permits the development of
emergency shelters in all residential zones, subject to the approval of a Minor Conditional Use Permit
(MCUP). In addition, emergency shelters are permitted in the Commercial Office Zone, subject to the
approval of a Development Permit and only those standards applicable to any other use in that zone. The
approval of such a facility is considered ministerial if the facility is less than 10,000 square feet. Transitional
and supportive housing can be provided through Single Room Occupancies (SRO’s) and is currently
permitted by right in all motels, hotels, and churches.
To comply with Senate Bill 2, Program 3.2.3. requires that the City’s Zoning Ordinance be amended to
allow transitional housing and supportive housing “by right” as a permitted use in all residential zones and
emergency shelters as a permitted “by right” use within all commercial zones subject to: (i) the same land
use parameters that apply to residential or commercial development within the same zone except; and (ii)
objective management and development standards consistent with the provisions of Government Code
Section 65583(a)(4). Emergency shelters, transitional housing and supportive housing would also be
allowed in the Public Facilities (PF) Zone, subject to the approval of a MCUP. To clarify terminology and
the relationship to congregate housing, the Zoning Ordinance amendment will include a definition of terms
consistent with Senate Bill 2.
As discussed in Section 3.3.5, homelessness in Fillmore and associated needs are quite modest compared
to the County at large. According to the most recent (2011) count of homelessness conducted by the
Ventura County Homeless and Housing Coalition (“VCHHC”), Fillmore has the third fewest homeless of all
County jurisdictions at 10 individuals. As shown in Table 4.C., there are 35 parcels with commercial zoning
                                                        4-22

that are vacant and presently available for development. Within the listed zone districts, average parcel
sizes range from 5,818 to 63,286 square feet, with an overall average of 38,665 square feet. These
numbers compare favorable to a listing of emergency facilities furnished by VCHHC. With a total
commercial land inventory of 31 vacant acres and an overall average parcel size of 38,000 square feet, the
City’s capacity to accommodate emergency homeless facilities far exceeds the needs specific to Fillmore.

4.4       Governmental Factors
4.4.1 Funding Availability
In the 3rd and 4th Housing Element cycles, local redevelopment was identified as the principal funding
source to undertake affordable housing initiatives. With the demise of redevelopment in 2011 (AB 1x 26)
and consequent loss of tax increment funds, the City is now dependent upon state and federal sources.
Fillmore is an active participant in the federal Urban County program that distributes Community
Development Block Grants (CDBG), HOME funds and Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG). HOME and
ESG funds are awarded on a competitive-discretionary basis, while CDBG funds are distributed to
participant jurisdictions according to Cooperation Agreements approved in 2012. These three-year
Agreements provide general programmatic guidelines and include a distribution formula. The local formula
mirrors HUD's formula and is based on a ratio of population, poverty and incidence of overcrowded housing
as reflected in the 2000 Census.
In years past, the City has received (on average) an annual allocation of approximately $100,000 in CDBG
funds. However, funding in the current fiscal year (FY 2012-13) was drastically reduced for CDBG and
HOME from the prior year by 21% and 48%, respectively. Another 8% to 10% reduction in funding is
expected for FY 2013-14. Funding for ESG is anticipated to be reduced by 5%. This further constrains the
ability of the City to fully implement the Housing Element. Given these dynamics, Program 2.1.1 commits
the City to explore all other state and private sources to backfill the loss of local and federal funds; in
particular, monies that are available through the Housing and Emergency Shelter Trust Fund Act of 2002
                                                            4-23

and associated programs administered by the California Department of Housing and Community
Development including:
         Housing Rehabilitation Loan Fund
         Preservation Opportunity Fund
         Emergency Housing and Assistance Fund
         Joe Serna, Jr. FWHG Fund
         School Facilities Fee Assistance Fund
         California Housing Loan Insurance Fund
         Jobs Housing Improvement Account
4.4.2 Public Services and Facilities
The provision of public services (especially water, sewers, and flood control) does not constrain the
production of new housing below the number projected by the current Regional Housing Needs
Assessment. Currently state laws governing municipal funding limits the ability of cities to provide
infrastructure from ongoing revenues. As a result, new development is generally required to pay its own
way with regard to public facilities such as water, sewer, drainage, parks, and roadways. In accordance
with AB 1600, the City enacted a development impact fee program to ensure that new development pays
for impacts to City services and not for existing deficiencies caused by prior development. A reciprocal fee
agreement with Ventura County will apply to any future development in the City’s current Sphere of
Influence. Development impact fees are identified in Table 4.C, and are collected prior to the issuance of
the Building Permit. When compared with the fees of nearby jurisdictions, the City of Fillmore fees are
significantly less. These fees are reasonable when compared with the costs that the City must expend for
review, and with fees associated with other jurisdictions. Therefore, these fees are not placing a constraint
on the production of housing.
The City of Fillmore, like many communities, determined that its public works systems cannot be over-
burdened by new development. A 20-year capital improvements program identifies and prioritizes such
needs as water main replacement, flood control, water storage, the City’s new water recycling facility, as
well as parks, streets, and sidewalk replacement. The Capital Improvement Program provides a guide for
allocating public funds in the areas where infrastructure is most needed. The status of each public works
system is described in the Public Facilities Element of the General plan; however, the water supply,
sewage disposal, and flood drainage systems have separate and unique limitations that relate to the
construction of new housing.
Water service is provided by the City of Fillmore. Potable water is extracted from the Fillmore groundwater
basin. The estimated safe yield of this basin is many times greater than the current water extraction.
Groundwater from the Fillmore Basin is expected to be a long-term water source for the City. As
development occurs, it will be necessary to bring new wells on line, construct distribution systems, and
provide additional water storage capacity. The City’s capital improvement program is designed to ensure
adequate well and storage capacity, and to connect new wells and storage facilities to the system. New
distribution lines are generally the responsibility of the developer.
As addressed in the Original and Supplemental Environmental Impact Reports for the current adopted
Fillmore General Plan, sewer facilities and proposed capital improvements are adequate to serve the level
                                                        4-24

of growth projected for the planning period. The City’s wastewater treatment plant is located at the south
end of C Street on the north bank of the Santa Clara River. A new water recycling facility in the
southwestern portion of the City is currently under construction. This facility is planned to be up and running
by July 2009.
Within the City, generally drainage is directed to the Santa Clara River thru the existing storm drain
systems. However, the City is currently improving the storm drain system to divert flow from the river. The
existing lines do not adequately drain all of the drainage areas, resulting in flooding or pooling of water in
certain locations. Generally, problem areas are located in the western half of the City, and involve general
street flooding due to flat street gradients combined with inadequate drainage infrastructure. The areas
within the 100-year flood plain were not considered as viable development areas when the development
capacity of the remaining units in the City was considered.
4.4.3 Fees and Exactions
The fees and exactions required of a development to pay for public facilities associated with the residential
development do not pose a potential constraint to housing production. Two types of fees, discussed below,
are charged by the City of Fillmore: development impact fees and planning processing fees. Table 4.C
identifies the applicability of impact fees and Table 4.D lists the fee amounts for each category. A
comparison of Fillmore’s typical residential planning fees in relation to nearby communities is shown in
Table 4.E.

    Notes:
    a. FAHR = Fully allocated hourly rate. City of Fillmore sets them as Employee Total Cost (per budget) / Hours = FAHR. City of
          Santa Paula sets them as follows, Effective January 1, 2007 Secretary 42/hr, Assistant Planner 62/hr, Associate Planner 71/hr,
          Deputy Planning Director 96/hr, Planning Director 103/hr.
    b. For Residential Uses. Fee varies for other uses.
    c. Will increase as requirements for other CEQA documents are confirmed.
In addition to the fees presented in Table 4.E, the City of Fillmore charges engineering services fees for
review of parcel and tract maps as follows:
          Tentative Parcel Map (1-4 parcels)                               $2,600 deposit against actual costs
          Tentative Parcel Map (5-20 parcels)                              $6,900 deposit against actual costs
          Tentative Tract Map (5-10 parcels)                               $3,450 deposit against actual costs
          Tentative Tract Map (11-70 parcels)                              $6,900 deposit against actual costs
Fillmore, Santa Paula, and Ojai are small residential communities. In the following table, it can be seen that
Fillmore’s planning fees are generally comparable to other small cities in its vicinity. A much larger city,
Oxnard, has higher planning fees, as shown. More significantly, the abundance of affordable housing in
Fillmore as discussed in Section 3.4.4 evidences that fees and exactions do not pose a constraint on new
residential development. Table 4.G. below presents a summary of fees for a typical residential project.

4.5         Non-Governmental Factors
4.5.1 Land Costs
The price of land is a significant factor in the total cost of housing. Developed land costs typically account
for about one-quarter of the total cost of a home. Data supplied by DataQuick supports this finding and
further indicates that land costs in Fillmore are reflective of the region at large. More significantly, changes
to economic and credit conditions have dramatically impacted job growth, employment, and vacancy rates
that have affected job/housing ratios and influenced both rental and for sale housing costs. In addition,
changes in credit markets have made purchasing or developing new housing much more difficult, even
where justified demand may exist. With this backdrop, the Housing Element’s policies and programs offer a
stable set of approaches that are relevant under a variety of economic conditions.
4.5.2 Construction Costs
Construction costs, like land, affect the ability of consumers to pay for housing. Construction cost increases
occur due to the cost of materials, labor, and government imposed building standards (e.g. energy
conservation requirements). According to the most recent information (available from DataQuick, current
construction costs for a single family home, including materials and labor, are roughly $214 per square foot.
This is typical for Southern California and does not present a significant constraint to the production of
housing with Fillmore. As noted above, the development community is currently producing market rate for-
sale housing that is affordable to moderate-income households and rental housing that is affordable to low-
income households.
4.5.3 Availability of Financing
The availability of capital to finance new residential development is a significant factor that can impact both
the cost and the supply of housing. There are two types of capital involved in the housing market: (1)
capital used by developers for initial site preparation and construction, and (2) capital for financing the
purchase of units by homeowners and investors.
In general, financing for new residential development in Fillmore at the present time (2013) is available at
reasonable interest rates. However, the recent high foreclosure rates on home loans have caused lenders
to be more cautious. Although interest rates are low, lenders are now scrutinizing applications much more
                                                                     4-28

closely than in the past. Additionally, lenders are also exercising caution when approving loans for
construction due to the market slow-down on new home sales.
Local Banks. There are four local banks in Fillmore. As a result, there are a variety of single family and
multiple family home loans available through community banks in the Fillmore area. Interest rates are
currently competitive, and are similar to those available in other communities throughout Southern
California. Interest rates for single family and multiple family construction loans are variable. VA, FHA, and
conventional loans are available. The local banks do not currently have any programs specifically oriented
toward the construction of affordable housing, other than those that are sponsored by governmental
agencies, such as the Community Reinvestment Act.
Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) 502 Housing. FmHA, established by Congress in 1946,
coordinates a nationwide rural development program and provides financing for housing in rural areas. The
self-help program provides no-money-down, low interest long-term loans through FmHA. In return, the
families must work 30 hours a week on their home or until all the homes in a group, usually 8 to 10, are
complete. The existing dwelling or proposed building site must be in a rural area with a population of
25,000 or less. The City of Fillmore does qualify for this program, since the population is approximately
15,247, well under the 25,000 limit.
The typical borrower of an FmHA loan is eligible to receive Interest Credit Assistance. This assistance can
reduce the borrower’s monthly payments to an effective interest rate of 1 percent. The subsidy attempts to
reduce the total housing costs (i.e., loan payment, taxes, insurance) to equal 20 percent of the borrower’s
adjusted income. The Interest Credit Assistance is reviewed annually and a borrower is eligible to receive
the subsidized payments until the household income exceeds the moderate income level.
Potential building sites must be less than 1 acre in size on scattered sites and less than 0.25 acres in size
in a subdivision. Exceptions can be made if the Zoning Ordinance requires a larger lot. The construction or
purchase of a new home cannot exceed the following square foot standards:
         864 sq. ft. (one occupant)
         1,008 sq. ft. (two occupants
         1,104 sq. ft. (three occupants)
         1,248 sq. ft. (four occupants)
These maximum building size requirements for dwelling units are larger than the minimums required by the
City, and therefore do not pose a constraint to development.
All building contractors must be approved by FmHA. Only new mobile homes qualify for the FH-502
program and the dealer must be approved by FmHA.
4.5.4 Affordable Housing Financing
Funding for affordable housing currently requires financing for a first mortgage, second mortgage, and
equity. An overview of each funding source is presented in the following paragraphs.
                                                       4-29

First Mortgage. Because of their low rents, affordable housing projects are financially capable of
generating enough money to make monthly payments on only a relatively small first mortgage, often as low
as 20 to 25 percent of the total project cost. For the first mortgage lender, subordinated debt increases a
project’s loan to value and debt coverage ratios to acceptable levels, reducing risk and increasing the
likelihood of obtaining private debt financing. The amount of the first mortgage that can be supported is a
function of the net operating income of the project. Tax-exempt bond proceeds are sometimes used for
permanent financing of low-income housing projects.
Second Mortgage (Gap Financing). A second mortgage is frequently necessary to partially fill the gap
between total project costs and the amount that can be supported by the first mortgage. A below-market
second mortgage provided by state or local governments or philanthropic organizations, could be
structured with a low interest rate, no interest deferred payments, or as a due-on-sale loan.
The maker of the second mortgage often prefers subordinated debt rather than a project grant even though
the former entails added risk. The mortgage usually contains restrictions to ensure that the property serves
low-income families; otherwise it becomes due and payable. Local funds are often used to provide “soft
seconds”, or mortgages whose principal and interest payments may be deferred until cash flow is available
or the project is refinanced or sold.
Equity. Equity, which is the money or capital invested in the project, reduces the amount needed to be
financed with a first and/or second mortgage. Although equity financing can be derived from several
sources, affordable housing partnerships depend greatly on the syndication of low-income housing tax
credits. Ownership of these projects if usually structured as limited partnerships; corporate or individual
owners are the limited partners who rely on the tax credits for market returns.
First Time Homebuyer Program. The First Time Homebuyer Program is administered through the City's
former Redevelopment Agency. The program is intended to provide financial assistance to lower income
households in buying their first home. The amount of the loan is dependent on the applicant's income. The
loan recipient only needs to provide three percent of the price as a down payment plus closing costs, which
are approximately three percent of the purchase price. Funds from this program are available on a first
come first serve basis. Since 1998, 49 applicants received funding totaling approximately $1,250,000.
Redevelopment Agency. Prior the State’s decision to terminate redevelopment in 2011 with the passage
and Court affirmation of AB 1x 26, the former Fillmore Redevelopment Agency (RDA) had anticipated
spending $3,500,000 through 2014 from expected set-aside funds. This would occur in four different
programs: (i) the Housing Rehabilitation Program would rehabilitate 12 units and would spend $300,000; (ii)
the First Time Home Buyers Program would assist in financing 12 loans and would spend $1,200,000; (iii)
the Vacant and Deteriorated Property Acquisition program (Demolition Program) would assist in 10 projects
and would spend $500,000; and (iv) the New Construction Development Agreement would assist in the
construction of 30 units and spend $1,500,000. As a result of AB 1x 26, funding through the City’s former
RDA is no longer certain and all Housing Element programs previously dependent on RDA funding is
wholly uncertain.
                                                       4-30

4.6       Opportunities for Energy and Water Conservation
Utilities and related energy expenditures are a major component of a households total shelter costs. Within
the City, 97.7 percent of all households have some form of space heating, 99.8 percent have complete
plumbing facilities, 99.9 percent have electrical connections, and approximately 60 percent of homes have
cooling systems, according to 2000 Census data. As an integral part of providing housing, these utilities
can represent a claim in household income ranging from 15 to 40 percent of total housing costs. Thus,
efforts to reduce energy and water consumption can significantly benefit Fillmore households.
The most effective home conservation measures are those that reduce the biggest user of energy: space
heating and cooling. Most utility companies agree that actions to reduce air infiltration are the most cost-
effective ways of minimizing space-heating/cooling requirements. Weather stripping, caulking, duct
wrapping, and attic and wall insulation are all ways to reduce such energy consumption. In addition,
furnaces equipped with setback thermostats and electronic ignition can further reduce costs. This is now
required in all new residential construction by the Uniform Building Code.
Water heating is another major energy user. Insulation blankets for water heaters, pipe insulation, and
water saving showerheads are simple; add on measures that can lower both energy bills and water
consumption. More elaborate measures incorporate solar water heating systems.
New housing construction is a great opportunity to ensure efficient energy use. Homes that are sited to
maximize solar and wind orientation can significantly reduce long-term energy needs. Further, such homes
can be equipped with energy saving appliances which also lower energy and water consumption. A
balance must be achieved between the short-term costs of building energy efficient homes and the long
term benefits they provide. There are many design, construction, and landscaping techniques available to
help reduce energy and water consumption. Some add little or no cost to the housing unit, but have not
been adopted by developers and contractors. Examples include avoiding east and west facing lots,
reducing north facing window areas, using drought tolerant landscaping, and employing paving materials
that generate less heat.
Water conservation is a significant issue for both individual households and the City. Lower water
consumption reduces monthly bills, and extends the capacities of municipal water wells and the local
sewage treatment plant. More conservative landscape watering schedules and less wasteful watering
systems make significant contributions to lower water demand. Inside the home, low-flow showerheads,
low-flow toilets, and efficient clothing and dishwashing appliances are useful in stemming the need for
water. However, by changing personal habits regarding water use (e.g., shorter showers, not pre-rinsing
dishes, etc.), reductions in water use can be achieved at little or no cost.
Presently, Southern California Gas and Southern California Edison offer conservation programs for
homeowners, renters, and landlords. Both companies participate in the state’s Residential Conservation
Service, and provide free energy audits to all households. Both companies offer cash rebates and low-
interest financing to help offset the cost of many conservation measures. In 1990, the City Council adopted
an ordinance requiring low-flow fixtures in all new development, and as a retrofit in certain remodels. The
Housing Element will continue Program 1.3.1 in addition to Program 1.3.2, setting forth specific goals and
efforts to be implemented on behalf of the City and cooperating agencies to promote energy conservation
activities and sustainable development practices in the community.

5.0 Housing Plan
5.1           Introduction
The intent of the Housing Element is to ensure that the housing needs of all economic segments of the
community will be met through the year 2021. The housing goals and policies included in the Fillmore
Housing Element, as well as the actions that the City will undertake to meet its housing needs, are
discussed in this Chapter. A summary of the actions, including identification of funding sources, responsible
entities, and time frames for implementation, is also presented. In evaluating the prior Housing Element,
the City analyzed the programs it undertook, and evaluated why implementation of some programs were
more successful than others. Accordingly, the City has included in this element the actions it believes can
successfully be implemented and that reflect the best use of the City’s limited resources. As used
throughout this Housing Plan, the term “affordable housing” has the same context and meaning as defined
in Sections 1.4 and 3.5.2 herein.
5.2           Prioritization
The lack of financial and staff resources are constraints that potentially impair the City’s ability to implement
the programs contained in this Housing Element. Given these constraints, each of the programs listed in
Section 5.4 has been assigned a priority to guide the allocation of available resources. Those programs
with an assigned priority of “1” are critically important to satisfying statutory requirements. Those programs
with an assigned priority of “2” address the needs specific to target income households and special
population segments identified in this Housing Element. Those programs with an assigned priority of “3”
represent activities that are supportive, but not critical, to implementing the programs with a higher priority
ranking. These rankings will guide program implementation and the commitment of required resources
over the duration of the planning period for the 5th Housing Element cycle from October 1, 2013 through
September 31, 2021.
5.3           Quantified Objectives
The City of Fillmore has designed a number of implementing programs that will focus City resources on
meeting its projected housing needs. The City recognizes that there are a number of factors impacting the
provision of affordable housing. Accordingly, the City of Fillmore has identified its quantified objectives for
new construction, rehabilitation, and conservation. Rehabilitation of existing units will be achieved through
the City’s efforts to link property owners with available financial assistance programs. The City has
established its quantified objectives on the basis of Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) regional housing needs projections for the City of Fillmore for the period of 2014-2021.

Provide housing that is affordable to all economic segments of the community.
Policy 2.1
Actively pursue and support the use of available County, State, and Federal housing assistance programs.
Implementing Programs
2.1.1    Affordable Housing Production. The City shall research, inventory and actively pursue financial
         assistance programs from both the public and private sectors to increase the stock of affordable
         housing units. In addition, the City shall prepare and adopt an Affordable Housing Ordinance that
         incorporates the following:
         (a)      Inclusionary Requirements. All new housing construction within the Fillmore
                  Redevelopment Project area shall provide deed-restricted affordable housing in
                  accordance with applicable and legally enforceable requirements of California

                          facts and evidence are not unreasonably exercised for the purpose of rendering infeasible
                          the development of housing for any and all economic segments of the community as

                          health, safety, convenience, or welfare, and there is no feasible method to
                          satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the detrimental effect without rendering the development
                          unaffordable or financially infeasible. "Detrimental Effect" shall mean a significant,
                          quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact resulting from: (i) a conflict with adopted
