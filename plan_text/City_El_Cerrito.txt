City of El Cerrito                                        Adopted 2015-2023 Housing Element
I. INTRODUCTION
A. PURPOSE AND CONTENT
The City of El Cerrito’s Housing Element is the component of the City’s General Plan that
addresses housing needs and opportunities for present and future El Cerrito residents
through 2023. The Housing Element provides the primary policy guidance for local
decision-making related to housing. The Housing Element of the General Plan is the only
General Plan Element that requires review and certification by the State of California.
The Housing Element provides a detailed analysis of El Cerrito’s demographic, economic,
and housing characteristics as required by State law. The Element also provides a
comprehensive evaluation of the City’s progress in implementing the past policy and action
programs related to housing production, preservation, conservation, and rehabilitation.
Based on the community’s housing needs, available resources, constraints, opportunities,
and past performance, the Housing Element identifies goals, policies, actions, and objectives
that address the housing needs of present and future El Cerrito residents.
The El Cerrito Housing Element is based on five strategic goals that have been developed by
the community over time: 1) conserve and improve El Cerrito’s existing housing supply, 2)
facilitate and encourage the development of housing to meet regional housing needs
allocations established by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), 3) expand
housing opportunities for the elderly, the disabled, households with very low- to moderate-
income, and for persons with special housing needs, 4) promote housing opportunities for
all persons regardless of race, age, marital status, ancestry, national origin, or color, and 5)
promote energy efficiency in the location, construction, renovation and maintenance of
housing units.
B. HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE PROCESS
The California State Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and suitable
living environment for every Californian as the State’s main housing goal. Recognizing the
important part that local planning plays in pursuit of this goal, the Legislature has
mandated that all cities and counties prepare a Housing Element as part of their
comprehensive General Plans (California Government Code Section 65580 et al.).
It is intended that this Housing Element be reviewed annually and updated and modified
no less than every eight years in order to remain relevant and useful and reflect the
community’s changing housing needs. This Housing Element covers the planning period
from January 31, 2015 to January 31, 2023. State law determines the time frame of the
planning period. This document represents the update required and responds to the issues
that currently face the City.
Introduction | April 2015                                                            Page 9 of 190

Adopted 2015-2023 Housing Element                                               City of El Cerrito
C. STATE LAW AND LOCAL PLANNING
1. Consistency with State Law
The Housing Element is one of the seven General Plan elements mandated by the State of
California, as articulated in Sections 65580 to 65589.8 of the California Government Code.
State law requires that each jurisdiction’s Housing Element consist of “identification and
analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies,
quantified objectives, and scheduled program actions for the preservation, improvement,
and development of housing.” The Housing Element plans for the provision of housing for
all segments of the population. Section 65583 of the Government Code sets forth specific
requirements regarding the scope and content of each Housing Element.
2. General Plan Consistency
The Housing Element is one component of the City’s overall long-range planning strategy.
The California Government Code requires that the General Plan contain an integrated,
consistent set of goals and policies. The Housing Element is affected by policies contained in
other elements of the General Plan. For example, the Land Use Element designates land for
residential development and indicates the type, location, and density of the residential
development permitted in the city. Working within this framework, the Housing Element
identifies goals, policies, actions, and objectives for the planning period that directly address
the housing needs of El Cerrito’s existing and future residents. The policies contained within
other elements of the General Plan affect many aspects of life that residents enjoy – the
amount and variety of open space, the preservation of natural, historic, and cultural
resources, the permitted noise levels in residential areas, and the safety of the residents in
the event of a natural or man-made disaster.
The Housing Element policies must be consistent with policies identified in other elements
of the General Plan. The Housing Element has been reviewed and found to be consistent
with the City’s other General Plan elements. As portions of the General Plan are amended in
the future, this Housing Element will be reviewed to ensure that internal consistency is
maintained. The 1999 General Plan contains several elements with policies related to
housing. Policies and the means for achieving consistency are summarized in Appendix E.
3. Relationship to Other Plans and Programs
The Housing Element identifies goals, objectives, policies, and action programs for the 2015-
2023 planning period that directly address the housing needs of El Cerrito. There are a
number of City plans and programs that work to implement the goals and policies of the
Housing Element, including, the City’s Municipal Code, Zoning Ordinance and the San
Pablo Avenue Specific Plan.

City of El Cerrito                                        Adopted 2015-2023 Housing Element
 a. El Cerrito Municipal Code
The El Cerrito Municipal Code contains the regulatory and penal ordinances and certain
administrative ordinances of the City, codified pursuant to Sections 50022.1 through 50022.8
and 50022.10 of the Government Code. The El Cerrito Municipal Code includes the City’s
zoning regulations.
The Subdivision Chapter of the Municipal Code (i.e., Title 18 – Divisions of Land) regulates
the design, development, and implementation of land division. It applies when a parcel is
divided into two or more parcels; a parcel is consolidated with one or more other parcels; or
the boundaries of two or more parcels are adjusted to change the size and/or configuration
of the parcels.
Title 19 - Zoning of the Municipal Code is the primary tool for implementing the General
Plan, and is designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of the people.
The Zoning Chapter designates various districts and outlines the permitted, conditionally
permitted, and prohibited uses for each zone district. Finally, Title 19 provides property
development standards for each zone district and overall administrative and legislative
procedures.
b. San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan
Specific Plans are customized regulatory documents that provide focused guidance and
regulations for a particular area to address the specific characteristics or needs for that area.
They generally include a land use plan, circulation plan, infrastructure plan, zoning
classifications, development standards, design guidelines, and implementation plan.
The San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan was approved by City Council in September 2014 with
an effective date of November 6, 2014 and represents a planning horizon through 2040.
The Plan includes a Form-Based Code that is intended to guide the physical environment
and character of the streets, buildings and opens spaces in the Plan area. It supports the
vision to create a vibrant, walkable, sustainable, and transit-orientated corridor that respects
surrounding neighborhoods.
D. HOUSING ELEMENT ORGANIZATION
California Government Code Section 65583 requires a jurisdiction’s Housing Element
include the following components:
        A review of the previous Element’s goals, policies, objectives, and programs to
         ascertain the effectiveness of each of these components, as well as the overall
         effectiveness of the Housing Element.
        An assessment of housing need and an inventory of resources and constraints
         related to meeting these needs.
Introduction | April 2015                                                         Page 11 of 190

Adopted 2015-2023 Housing Element                                             City of El Cerrito
      A statement of goals, policies, and quantified objectives related to the maintenance,
       preservation, improvement, and development of housing.
      A policy program that provides a schedule of actions that the City is undertaking or
       intends to undertake to implement the policies set forth in the Housing Element.
The El Cerrito Housing Element is organized into four parts:
      Introduction - Explains the purpose, process, and contents of the Housing Element.
      Housing Needs Assessment and Inventory - Describes the demographic, economic,
       and housing characteristics of El Cerrito and analyzes the current and projected
       housing needs in El Cerrito.
      Resources and Constraints - Analyzes the actual and potential governmental and
       nongovernmental constraints to the rehabilitation, preservation, conservation, and
       construction of housing.
      Housing Policy Program - Details specific policies and programs the City of El
       Cerrito will carry out over the planning period to address the City’s housing goals.
Given the detail and lengthy analysis in developing the Housing Element, supporting
background material is included in the following appendices:
      Appendix A: Sites Inventory
      Appendix B: At-Risk Assisted Units
      Appendix C: Review of Past Performance
      Appendix D: Summary of Community Outreach
      Appendix E: Consistency with State Law
      Appendix F: Glossary of Terms

City of El Cerrito                                        Adopted 2015-2023 Housing Element
E. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
The City of El Cerrito has encouraged and provided opportunities for public participation in
the process of identifying housing needs and formulating housing policies and programs.
The City’s objectives for the public participation process in the Housing Element update
were as follows:
       To inform the public of the purpose of the Housing Element;
       To present information regarding the City’s housing needs and current programs;
       To gather information about housing needs and ideas for addressing those needs;
       To learn from housing and social service professionals who have experience
        developing, operating or providing services to housing in El Cerrito or other Bay
        Area jurisdictions; and
       To gather comments and feedback on updated programs and policies.
The City provided several opportunities for public involvement. The City of El Cerrito’s
public outreach and community involvement activities are summarized below and
described in more detail in Appendix D.
1. Community Workshops
The City conducted community workshops on July 19, 2014 and August 13, 2014. Notices of
the public meetings were posted prior to the meetings in the citywide newsletter, on the
City’s website, through a postcard mailer to approximately 2,300 landlords and renter
households and local and regional stakeholders, as well at City Hall and the El Cerrito
Public Library. Both meetings focused on the Housing Element update process and scope,
the demographic information from the 2010 Census, housing market trends, and the City’s
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). After presenting an overview of the Housing
Element update, City staff facilitated an interactive discussion to answer questions about the
Housing Element’s purpose and solicit ideas from participants about the most critical
housing issues in El Cerrito and potential ways to address these issues. 11 people attended
the July 19th workshop and 13 people attended the August 13th workshop.
2. Housing Needs Survey
As part of the 2015-2023 Housing Element Update, the City of El Cerrito developed an
online survey to gather feedback about community housing and to help ensure that the
City’s Housing Element reflects the vision and priorities of the El Cerrito community. The
Housing Survey included 12 questions that asked respondents about their current housing
situation as well as their views on El Cerrito’s housing issues more generally. The survey
also gave opportunity for respondents to contribute written comments on El Cerrito’s
housing or other topics. The survey was publicized through announcements at the

Housing Element workshops, through the City’s website and through a press release to
local print and online media.
The online survey received a total of forty-four responses, of which forty-three (97.7%) self-
identified as currently living in El Cerrito. Forty-three responses from a census population
of 24,000 residents represents a response rate of less than 0.2%. The survey response is not
assumed to be a statistically relevant representation of the views of the city’s population.
However, the results of the survey and written comments offer insight into the views of the
people who made the effort to complete the survey and are included in Appendix D.
3. Stakeholder Workshop
On November 20, 2014, staff hosted a stakeholder roundtable discussion on the Draft
Housing Element. Local public agencies, community organizations, and developers and
realtors active in the community were invited to participate and share their views. The
meeting was attended by one representative from Stege Sanitary District who received a
presentation on the Draft Housing Element and did not have any formal comment.

II. HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND INVENTORY
A. INTRODUCTION
The Housing Needs Assessment analyzes population and housing characteristics, identifies
special housing needs among certain population groups, evaluates housing conditions, and
provides other important information to support the goals, policies, and programs to meet
the needs of current and future El Cerrito residents. An understanding of housing needs
helps formulate an appropriate and adequate housing plan for the City.
The needs assessment and inventory focuses on demographic information, such as
population trends, ethnicity, age, household composition, income, employment, housing
characteristics, general housing needs by income, and housing needs for specialized
segments of the population.
Primary data sources used in this analysis include the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Census, the 2007-
2011 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates, 2010-2012 ACS 3-Year Estimates
the California Department of Finance (DOF), the federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD), and the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). These data
sources are the most reliable for assessing existing conditions and provide a basis for
consistent comparison with historical data and for making forecasts.
B. COMMUNITY PROFILE
1. Population Trends and Characteristics
The type and amount of housing need in a community is largely determined by population
growth and various demographic characteristics. Factors such as age, race/ethnicity,
occupation, and income level combine to influence the type of housing needed and the
ability to afford housing. This section provides a summary of the changes to the population
size, age, and racial/ethnic composition of the City.
a. Historical, Existing, and Forecast Growth
The City of El Cerrito is one of 19 cities in Contra Costa County. The California Department
of Finance (DOF) estimates that Contra Costa County’s population in 2014 was 1,087,008.
Table II-1 shows historical population estimates for El Cerrito in 10-year increments from
1940 to 2010 as reported in the decennial US Census. El Cerrito was incorporated in 1917,
and the City’s population increased steadily until the 1960s. The greatest increase occurred
between 1940 and 1950, in which the City experienced an average annual growth rate of 19.3
percent. Between 1960 and 2010 the City’s population has fluctuated within 10%. A possible
explanation for the reported slight decline between 1960 and 1980 could be the City reached
build-out and household sizes declined. A possible explanation for the modest increases
from 1980 to 2010 could be an influx of residents seeking lower housing costs and larger

Figure II-1shows annual estimates of El Cerrito’s population growth since 2000 as reported
by the DOF. These figures are derived from the decennial US census figures, then adjusted
annually based on the information from the county on residential building activity. Much of
the 4.0% total population growth reported for El Cerrito since 1990 has resulted from infill
development, redevelopment, and changes in household size. The reported estimate of El
Cerrito’s population has been steadily increasing since 2008 and is currently (2014)
estimated at 24,087.

c. Age of Population
Figure II-2 shows a comparison of El Cerrito’s and the countywide population by age group
in 2010.El Cerrito had a higher percentage of residents aged 65 and older (17.9 percent) than
countywide (12.4 percent) and statewide (16.2 percent), and a lower population under 24
(22.7 percent) than either countywide (33.1 percent) or statewide (28.4 percent). Therefore, El
Cerrito has a higher median age of 44 in 2010 compared to 38 for all of Contra Costa County
and 35 for all of California. Individuals over the age of 35 comprised 65 percent of the city’s
population in 2010, compared to 54 percent countywide and 50 percent statewide.

2. Household Type and Composition
Further insight into the characteristics of the city’s population can be gained by examining
the composition of the household population, such as the proportion of families with
children, single adults, and single parents.
Table II-4 shows that two-person households represented the highest percentage of owner-
occupied households in both El Cerrito and Contra Costa County at 39.3 percent and 33.9
percent, respectively. Two-person renter-occupied households represented a larger
proportion of households in El Cerrito (32.5 percent) than countywide (25.3 percent), while
countywide there were larger percentages of large (five or more persons) owner- and renter-
occupied households.

        3. Income Characteristics
        Table II-7 shows the median household incomes in 2000 and 2011 in El Cerrito, Contra Costa
        County, and California. Income values in 2000 were adjusted using Bay Area consumer
        price index information and expressed in 2011 dollars. The 2007-2011 ACS reported that the
        median household income in El Cerrito was $83,933, an 8.6 percent increase from the 2000
        median income adjusted for inflation (i.e., in 2011 dollars). By comparison, the countywide
        median household income was $79,135, a 7.9 percent decrease from the 2000 median income
        adjusted for inflation. As shown in Table II-7, the city’s median household income is $22,301
        more than the statewide median, but only $4,798 more than countywide.
        Table II-7 shows the household income distribution from the 2007-2011 ACS. A majority of
        the city’s households have incomes greater than $100,000 (40 percent), which is 11.3 percent
        more than statewide.

        Five income categories are typically used for comparative purposes. These categories are
        based on a percentage of the Area Median Income (AMI) and adjusted for household size:
                Extremely Low-Income: household whose income is less than 30 percent of the AMI.
                Very Low-Income: a household whose income is between 31 and 50 percent of the
                 AMI.
                Low-Income: a household whose income is between 51 percent to 80 percent of the
                 AMI.
                Moderate-Income: a household whose income is between 81 percent to 120 percent
                 of the AMI.
                Above Moderate-Income: a household whose income is above 120 percent of the
                 AMI.

The median income on which these five categories are based represents the mid-point at
which half of the households earn more and half earn less. In a normally distributed
population (that is, one not skewed to either end of the income scale), approximately 40
percent of the population will have income within the extremely low-, very low- and low-
income ranges, about 20 percent within the moderate-income range, and about 40 percent in
the above moderate-income range.
Both the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) and the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) calculate annual
income limits. The HCD calculated income limits are used to determine eligibility for certain
State housing programs, and the HUD-calculated income limits are used to determine
eligibility for Section 8 and other Federal programs.
Each year HUD reports the AMI the Oakland-Fremont Metro Area. HUD uses the AMI to
set income levels (i.e., extremely low-, very low-, low, moderate-, and above moderate-
income) that are used in affordable housing programs and projects. According to HUD, the
AMI for a four-person household in Oakland-Fremont Metro Area was $88,500 in 2014. For
all income categories, income limits are defined for various household sizes based on a four-
person household. Table II-8 shows income limits for larger or smaller households,
calculated by HUD.

4. Poverty
The poverty rate is a Federally-defined level of income for minimum subsistence. The dollar
threshold for poverty is adjusted for household size and composition. Table II-10 provides
year 2013 poverty thresholds for several types of households.

6. Special Housing Needs
a. Elderly
The elderly face special housing challenges related to physical and financial conditions.
Older adults experience declining mobility and self-care capabilities, which create special
housing needs and challenges. Many older adults, even those who own their homes, face
financial challenges due to limited incomes from Social Security and other retirement
benefits. Data on the incomes and housing expenses of the elderly indicate that a substantial
number (although by no means the majority) of these older adults may need assistance
related to:
         Repair and maintenance of owned dwellings units;
         Modifications to existing homes to better meet mobility and self-care limitation;
         Financial assistance to meet rising rental costs for those who do not own; and
         Supportive services to meet daily needs.
Table II-16 shows the elderly population (65 and older) in El Cerrito, Contra Costa County,
and the Bay Area in 2000 and 2010. From 2000 to 2010 the City of El Cerrito experienced a
slight decrease in the number of individuals ages 65 to 84; however, there were increases
both countywide and in the Bay Area. Despite the decrease in the number of elderly
residents in El Cerrito from 2000 to 2010, the city’s proportion of elderly residents was still
larger than the proportion countywide (see Figure II-2).

In 2012 the incidence of poverty in El Cerrito was slightly lower among the population over
65 years of age (5.4 percent) than it was for the total population of the city (7.1 percent).This
is likely due to programs like Social Security that provide assistance to senior households.
Older adults tend to have the highest rates of homeownership of any age group. In 2010
seniors represented about 18 percent of El Cerrito’s population, but made up 36 percent of
all homeowners (2,219) and only 14 percent of renters (566).
Table II-17 describes the income composition of seniors in El Cerrito and countywide in
2011. In El Cerrito 23 percent of the city’s elderly population had an income below $30,000

and 29 percent had an income of over $100,000. Using the city’s 2011 median household

Some seniors require assisted living facilities that combine meal, medical, and daily living
assistance in a residential environment. Table II-18 shows the State Department of Social
Services licensed elderly care facilities that provide services in El Cerrito. All offer assisted
living services in a residential home setting.

The facilities listed above are primarily institutional care facilities. There is also a need in the
community to provide high quality, independent-living senior housing that provides on-site
assisted care and individual living units. Because many seniors desire to “downsize” when
they move, these senior housing developments would likely be higher density projects with
on-site supportive services. An increase in this type of available housing for seniors makes it
possible for them to sell their homes and remain in the community.
b. Persons with Disabilities
Less than 11 percent of the city’s non-institutionalized residents have physical conditions
that affect their abilities to live independently in conventional residential settings. These
individuals have mobility impairments, self-care limitations, or other conditions that may
require special housing accommodations or financial assistance. Individuals with such
disabilities can have a number of special needs that distinguish them from the population at
large.
Individuals with mobility difficulties (such as those confined to wheelchairs) may require
special accommodations or modifications to their homes to allow for continued independent
living. Such modifications are often called “handicapped access.”
Individuals with self-care limitations (which can include persons with mobility difficulties)
may require residential environments that include in-home or on-site support services,
ranging from congregate to convalescent care. Support services can include medical
therapy, daily living assistance, congregate dining, and related services.
Individuals with developmental disabilities and other physical and mental conditions that
prevent them from functioning independently may require assisted care or group home
environments.
Some people with mobility and/or self-care limitations are able to live with their families to
assist in meeting housing and daily living needs. A segment of the disabled population,
particularly low-income and retired individuals, may not have the financial capacity to pay
for needed accommodations or modifications to their homes. In addition, even those able to
pay for special housing accommodations may find them unavailable in the city.
Disabled persons often require special housing features to accommodate physical
limitations. Some disabled persons may have financial difficulty due to the cost of having
their special needs met or due to difficulty in finding appropriate employment. Although
the California Administrative Code Title 24 requires that all public buildings and “covered
multifamily dwellings” (as defined in the California Government Code, Section 12955.1) be
accessible to the public through architectural standards such as ramps, large doors, and
restroom modifications to enable handicap access, not all available housing units have these
features. According to 2010-2012 ACS, there were approximately 2,597 non-institutionalized
disabled persons over age five in El Cerrito.

Table II-19 compares the number of people with disabilities by age group. The majority of
the population with disabilities is in the senior group (aged 65 years and older). Most of the
disabilities in this group are ambulatory (22.4 percent), followed by independent living
difficulty, and self-care. About 1,369 residents reported disabilities that prevented them
from living without assistance; an estimated 1,004 of these residents, or 73.3 percent, were
seniors. Countywide the majority of the population with disabilities is in the adult group
(aged 18 to 64); 26,296 people experienced ambulatory difficulty and 20,619 people of people
aged 18-64 experienced cognitive difficulties. It is important to note that the percentages
may not sum to 100 percent as residents may have more than one disability.

Developmental Disabilities
SB 812, which took effect January 2011, amended State housing element law to require an
evaluation of the special housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities. A
"developmental disability" is defined as a disability that originates before an individual
becomes 18 years old, continues or can be expected to continue indefinitely, and constitutes

        a substantial disability for that individual. This includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy,
        epilepsy, and autism.
        According to the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS), El Cerrito
        currently (2014), has 46 individuals under 18 years old and 47 individuals 18 years or older
        with a developmental disability. Of the developmentally-disabled population in El Cerrito,
        about 91 percent live in their own home, and the remaining live either in an independent
        living facility, community care facility, or foster home.
        However, this count only includes residents who use DDS services. It is possible the count is
        much higher. An estimate from the Housing Consortium of the East Bay (HCEB) estimates
        150 individuals with developmental disabilities in El Cerrito. This estimate includes 52
        individuals younger than 14, 24 between the ages of 15 and 22, 70 ages 23 to 54, two ages 55
        to 65, and two above the age of 65. According to HCEB, there will be 50 more housing units
        needed for residents with developmental disabilities in El Cerrito by 2023.
        c. Female Heads of Households
        Most female-headed households are either single elderly women or single mothers.
        Traditionally, these two groups have been considered special needs groups because their
        incomes tend to be lower, making it difficult to obtain affordable housing, or because they
        have specific physical needs related to housing (such as child care or assisted living
        support). Single mothers, in particular, tend to have difficulty obtaining suitable, affordable
        housing. Such households also have a greater need for housing with convenient access to
        child-care facilities, public transportation, and other public facilities and services.
        As shown in Table II-20 female-headed families made up 16.9 percent of total families in El
        Cerrito, compared to 17.6 percent countywide and 17.4 percent in the Bay Area. Female-
        headed families with children under 18 made up 47.9 percent of the 1,047 female-headed
        families in El Cerrito, which was less than the 60.9 percent countywide and 58.0 percent in
        the Bay Area.

According to the 2010-2012 ACS, 8.4 percent of female-headed families are classified as
living below the poverty level, and female-headed families with related children under 18
are more likely to live in poverty (20.2 percent) than married couple families (3.0 percent). It
may be assumed that most of these households are overpaying for housing (i.e., more than
30 percent of their income), or are experiencing other unmet housing needs. As a result of
poverty, female heads of households often spend more on immediate needs such as food,
clothing, transportation, and medical care, than on home maintenance, which can result in
living units falling into disrepair.
d. Large Households
The Census Bureau defines large households as households of five or more individuals.
Large households often face special challenges in the housing market because they need to
find housing of sufficient size (three or more bedrooms) and do not always have sufficient
income to purchase or rent such housing.
Table II-21 shows household size by tenure. In 2010, large households accounted for 5.6
percent of all households, or 566 households in El Cerrito, compared to 13.2 percent in
Contra Costa County. Large owner and renter households represented 334 or 59 percent and
232 or 41 percent, respectively, of the large households in El Cerrito. In comparison renters
comprised 39.4 percent of all El Cerrito households, indicating that large households were
more likely to rent than the city’s population as a whole.

         According to 2006-2010 CHAS data 83, or 14 percent of large households in El Cerrito
         overpaid for housing (spent 30 percent or more of their household income on housing) in
         2010, compared to 37 percent of all households (See Table II-34 Overpayment by Tenure).
         Another issue that large households can face is overcrowding, defined as households with
         more than 1.01 persons per room. The 2010-2012 ACS reported that only 0.09 percent of El
         Cerrito households were overcrowded, many of which are likely to be large families based
         on the definition of overcrowding. However, this is a very small percentage of households.
         Table II-22 shows that large households tend to have slightly higher median household
         incomes than smaller households. However, even if large households have the income of a
         smaller household, it is split between more people. This means that less income is typically
         available to be spent on housing. The median household income for large households in El
         Cerrito is higher than countywide.

e. Farmworkers
El Cerrito is not an agricultural area. Therefore, the likelihood of special farmworker
housing needs is extremely low. According to the 2010-2012 ACS, less than 1 percent of the
City's residents were employed in farming, forestry, and fishing occupations of the total
labor force. Given El Cerrito’s location in an urban region, it is likely that few, if any, of
these “farmworkers” are employed in crop production or harvesting and would require
special farmworker housing. If needed, the construction of a farmworker housing project is
allowed within all residential and commercial zones.
The Employee Housing Act requires local governments to treat employee housing
providing accommodations for six or fewer employees the same way as a single family unit
with a residential land use designation. The City cannot require a conditional use permit or
other permit that is not required of a family dwelling of the same type in the same zone, and
use of a family dwelling for the purposes of employee housing for six or fewer occupants
shall not constitute a change of occupancy. The City complies with these requirements of
State law.
f. Homeless Population
The homeless population has a wide variety of needs that impact access to housing,
including physical and mental disabilities, HIV, and substance abuse. Depending on an
individual’s circumstances, these needs may be addressed via emergency shelters,
transitional housing, or supportive housing.
It is challenging to accurately count homeless populations, which include people living in
vehicles and in places not designed to be permanent housing (such as motels) in addition to
those on the streets and in shelters. Contra Costa County conducts a point-in-time count
every two years of the sheltered (annual count) and unsheltered (bi-annual count) homeless
living in the county. The count is typically conducted in the winter, when seasonal demand
is likely at its highest. The 2013 Contra Costa County Homeless Census found 3,798 total
homeless, of which 2,448 were sheltered and 1,350 were unsheltered. The 2013 count found
an overall decrease in the number of individuals experiencing homelessness, from 4,274
persons in 2011.
Table II-24 describes the unsheltered homeless population by region within the county. El
Cerrito is in the West County Region of Contra Costa County, along with Crockett, El
Sobrante, Hercules, North Richmond, Pinole, Richmond, Rodeo, and San Pablo. Of the 376
unsheltered homeless persons identified in the West County Region, approximately 7.2
percent (27 persons) were counted in the City of El Cerrito.

2013 Count.
There are no homeless or transitional shelters located in El Cerrito. The closest shelters are
located in Richmond, including: the Bay Area Crisis Nursery, which provides 20 year-round
individual beds; Calli House Youth Shelter, with six year-round beds for transition-age
youth; Emergency Shelter, with 75 year-round beds for families with children; and Bay Area
Rescue Mission with 150 year-round beds for families with children. Building Opportunities
for Self-Sufficiency’s (BOSS) multi-agency services center in the City of Berkeley – located
south of El Cerrito – is also a resource center for homeless persons in El Cerrito.
In terms of permanent housing serving the formerly homeless, the City of El Cerrito was a
sponsor of the Idaho Apartments, a 28-unit affordable housing development located on the
El Cerrito-Richmond border. In addition, the Ohlone Gardens Apartments, currently under
construction, will include ten units for households with special needs, including supportive
services where appropriate.
Contra Costa County is the primary planning agency charged with providing services to the
homeless throughout the County. The County’s Public Health Division offers a variety of
homeless programs such as the Shelter Plus Care (S+C) Program; Project HOPE; Project
Coming Home; Health, Housing and Integrated Services Network (HHISN); and other
programs. They are made available to all Contra Costa County residents, including those in
El Cerrito. Besides the County, there are a number of private non-profit organizations in and
around the Bay Area that provide services to the homeless and special needs groups. They
include Shelter, Inc., Rubicon Programs, Inc., The Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano,
American Red Cross, and Bay Area Rescue Mission.
The City supports the County’s “Ending Homelessness in Ten Years: A County-Wide Plan for the
Communities of Contra Costa County” (Ten Year Plan); particularly its “housing first” strategy,
which works to immediately house a homeless individual or family rather than force them
through a sequence of temporary shelter solutions. Additionally, the City supports the Ten
Year Plan goal of deemphasizing emergency shelters by supporting “interim housing,” also

referred to as “transitional housing,” as a preferred housing type. Interim housing is very
short-term and focuses on helping people access permanent housing as quickly as possible.
Services provided in interim housing include housing search assistance and case
management to help address immediate needs and identify longer-term issues to be dealt
with once in permanent housing. The Idaho Apartments, operated by Rubicon Programs, is
an example of permanent rental housing that offers supportive services for its residents.
Consistent with the Ten Year Plan, the City will prioritize the use of its limited housing
development resources to support permanent housing affordable to those with extremely
low, very low-, and low-incomes.
State law (Government Code 65583 (a)(4)) requires local jurisdictions to identify a zone or
zones where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use or
other discretionary permit. The City Zoning Ordinance allows emergency shelters as a
permitted use within the Community Commercial (CC) zone, as well as the Transit-
Oriented High-Intensity Mixed-Use (TOHIMU) and the Transit-Oriented Medium-Intensity
Mixed-Use (TOMIMU) zones of the San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan, subject to the operating
standards defined in the Plan.
g. Extremely Low-Income Households
Extremely low-income households are defined as those households with incomes under 30
percent of the County median income. Extremely low-income households typically consist
of minimum wage workers, seniors on fixed incomes, the disabled, and farmworkers. This
income group is likely to live in overcrowded and substandard housing conditions. This
group of households has specific housing needs that require greater government subsidies
and assistance, housing with supportive services, single room occupancy (SRO), shared
housing, and/or rental subsidies or vouchers. In recent years, rising rents, higher income
and credit standards imposed by landlords, and insufficient government assistance has
exacerbated the problem. Without adequate assistance this group has a high risk of
homelessness.
In 2014 the HUD median income in Contra Costa County was $88,500. For extremely low-
income households, this results in an income of $26,550 or less for a four-person household.
Households with extremely low incomes have a variety of housing situations and needs. In
2011, approximately 960 extremely low-income households resided in the city, representing
9.6 percent of the total households. Most (78.6 percent) extremely low-income households
experience one or more housing problems. These concerns include incomplete kitchen
facilities, incomplete plumbing facilities, overcrowding, and overpayment, exist for 84.1
percent of extremely low-income renters and 69.4 percent of extremely low-income owners.
Extremely low-income households are more likely to rent; 62.5 percent of extremely low-
income households rent compared to 38.4 percent of the total households in El Cerrito that
rent.

To calculate the projected housing needs, the City assumed that 50 percent of extremely
low-income households make up its very low-income regional housing needs allocation. As
a result, from the very low-income need of 100 units, the City has a projected need of 50
units for extremely low-income households by 2022. Many extremely low-income
households will be seeking rental housing and most likely facing an overpayment,
overcrowding, or substandard housing condition. Some extremely low-income households
could have mental or other disabilities and special needs.
7. Existing Housing Stock
a. Housing Composition
Table II-25 shows housing estimates in El Cerrito, countywide, and statewide. According to
the California Department of Finance (DOF) over two-thirds of the units in El Cerrito in
2014 are single family detached (69.8 percent), 13.5 percent are multiple units of five or
more, 12.9 percent are multiple units of two to four, 3.2 percent are single family attached
housing and 0.5 percent are mobile homes. The definition of housing unit, including mobile
home, used by the DOF is a self-reported description of the type of housing unit a survey
respondent lived in. The housing types reported in Table II-25 do not necessarily
correspond to regulated land use types or property tax assessment codes. As shown in Table
II-26, El Cerrito has a greater proportion of units in multifamily complexes with two to four
housing units (12.9 percent) compared to countywide (7.0 percent) and statewide (8.1
percent), but a lower proportion of units in larger multifamily complexes (13.5 percent),
compared to countywide (16.8 percent). In 2014 the average household size was 2.36
persons per household, which is slightly lower than the countywide 2.83 persons per
household.

b. Housing Occupancy and Tenure
Vacancy rate can be a good indicator of how effectively for-sale and rental units are meeting
the current demand for housing in a community. Vacancy rates of 6 or 7 percent for rental
housing and 1 to 2 percent for ownership housing are generally considered optimum, where
there is a balance between the demand and supply for housing. A higher vacancy rate may
indicate an excess supply of units and, therefore, price depreciation, while a low vacancy
rate may indicate a shortage of units and escalation of housing prices.
Of the 10,730 year-round dwelling units in El Cerrito reported by the DOF in January 2014,
10,156 units (94.7 percent) were occupied and 574 units (5.3 percent) were vacant. By
comparison, 93.8 percent of the dwelling units countywide were occupied and 6.2 percent
were vacant. Table II-27 shows that, in 2012, El Cerrito had a slightly lower homeowner
vacancy rate (1.0 percent) compared to the countywide rate (1.6 percent). El Cerrito also has
a lower rental vacancy rate of 3.5 percent compared to the countywide rental vacancy rate of
5.7 percent. El Cerrito’s low vacancy rates indicate there is a limited supply of available
units in the city.

c. Age and Condition of Housing Stock
The age and condition of the housing stock provide additional measures of housing
adequacy and availability in many communities. Although age does not always correlate
with substandard housing conditions, neighborhoods with a preponderance of homes more
than 40 years old are more likely than newer neighborhoods to have a concentration of
housing problems related to deferred maintenance, inadequate landscape care, outdated
utilities or interior amenities, and a need for housing rehabilitation.
The year a structure was built can, at times, be an indicator of the current condition of the
housing unit. Housing units built before 1940 may be old, but may not necessarily be in a
rundown condition if properly maintained. In contrast, newer homes that were built
equipped with adequate utilities and amenities may already be rundown due to abuse or
general lack of care. However, it is useful to look at the age of the housing stock to
determine where inadequacies may exist, or why certain units remain vacant.
Table II-30 shows that nearly two-thirds of housing units in El Cerrito were built before 1960
(65.6 percent). Less than 10 percent of El Cerrito’s housing units were built after 1980 (9.4
percent).

d. Overcrowding
Generally overcrowding is a measure of the ability of existing housing to adequately
accommodate residents and can result in deterioration of the quality of life within a
community. The U.S. Census defines an “overcrowded” household as 1.01 or more persons
per room, excluding bathrooms, porches, balconies, foyers, halls, and half-rooms. “Severe
overcrowding” occurs in households with more than 1.5 persons per room. Overcrowding
typically results when either: 1) the costs of available housing with a sufficient number of

bedrooms for larger families exceeds the family’s ability to afford such housing, or 2)
unrelated individuals (such as students or low-wage single adult workers) share dwelling
units due to high housing costs. This can lead to overcrowded situations if the housing unit
is not large enough to accommodate all of the people effectively.
Table II-31 summarizes the overcrowding status in El Cerrito and countywide. Less than
one percent of the City’s occupied households lived in overcrowded conditions in 2012; 0.8
percent of owners were overcrowded and 1.1 percent of renters were overcrowded. By
comparison, 1.6 percent of the owners and 6.8 percent of renters were overcrowded
countywide. No occupied housing units were severely overcrowded in El Cerrito, while
about one percent of households were severely overcrowded countywide. In 2012 the
average household size for owners was 2.44 persons in El Cerrito and 2.83 countywide. The
average household size for renters was 2.13 in El Cerrito and 2.79 countywide.

9. Affordability
a. Lower Income Households Overpaying for Housing
As stated previously, there are five income categories typically used for comparative
purposes based on the median countywide income: extremely low-income (0-30 percent of
median income), very low-income (30-50 percent of median income), low-income (50-80
percent of median income), moderate-income (80-120 percent of median income), and above
moderate-income (120 percent or more of median income). One method of analyzing
housing affordability for each income group is to compare the number and/or percent of
housing units by cost to the number and/or percent of households by comparable income
levels.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) establishes that a household is
“cost-burdened” (i.e., overpaying for housing) if it spends more than 30 percent of gross
income on housing-related costs. The prevalence of overpayment varies significantly by
income, tenure, household type, and household size. Those who pay 30 percent or more of
their income on housing may have trouble affording other necessities. However, to truly
evaluate housing affordability individual circumstances must be taken into account. These
factors include other long-term debt, mortgage interest rates, the number of household

members, and other large, ongoing expenses (such as medical bills). Since it is impossible to
consider each household’s individual circumstances, the 30 percent rule-of-thumb provides
a general measure of housing affordability for the average household.
Table II-35 shows overpayment by tenure. In 2010 36.9 percent of all El Cerrito households
overpaid and 17.3 percent severely overpaid for housing. This is lower than the countywide
overpayment rate of 45.0 percent and the Bay Area’s rate of 42.6 percent. Renters
experienced particularly high overpayment rates, with 46.1 percent of renter households
being cost-burdened and 26.1 percent of renter households being severely cost-burdened in
El Cerrito. Owners in El Cerrito experienced overpayment far less (29.3 percent) than
countywide (42.7 percent) and Bay Area owners (39.7 percent), but a higher proportion of
renters in El Cerrito were cost-burdened than countywide and in the Bay Area.

Table II-36 shows affordability scenarios for very low-, low-, and moderate-income
households in Contra Costa County (including the City of El Cerrito) by the number of
persons in the household. The table shows maximum affordable monthly rents and
maximum affordable purchase prices for homes. The affordable sales prices were calculated
using household income limits published by the California Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD), conventional financing terms, and assuming that
households spend 30 percent of gross income on housing costs. Households earning the
2014 area median income for a family of four in El Cerrito ($93,500) could afford to spend up
to $2,338 per month or $28,056 per year on rental housing without being considered
“overpaying.” For renters this is a straightforward calculation but homeownership costs are
less transparent.

A household can typically qualify to purchase a home that is 2.5 to 3.0 times the annual
income of that household, depending on the down payment, the level of other long-term
obligations (such as a car loan), and interest rates. In practice, the interaction of these factors
allows some households to qualify for homes priced at more than three times their annual
income, while other households may be limited to purchasing homes no more than two
times their annual incomes. These factors—interest rates, insurance, and taxes—are held
constant in the table below in order to determine maximum affordable rent and purchase
price for households of each income category.

10. Future Housing Needs
a. Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA)
This section evaluates projected future housing needs for El Cerrito based on the RHNA
adopted by Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) on July 18, 2013. ABAG, the
Council of Governments (COG) representing the region, in cooperation with local
jurisdictions, is responsible for allocating the region’s projected new housing demand in
each jurisdiction. The demand represents the number of additional units needed to
accommodate the anticipated growth in the number of households, to replace expected
demolitions and conversions of housing units to non-residential uses, and to allow for a
future vacancy rate conducive to a healthy functioning housing market. This process is
known as the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) and the goals are referred to as
the RHNA goals or the “regional share” goals for new housing construction. The allocation
takes into account factors such as employment opportunities, market demand for housing,
availability of suitable sites and public facilities, community patterns, types and tenure of
housing needs and others. The allocation is divided into four income categories:
       Very Low-Income – 0 to 50 percent of the median income
       Low-Income – 51 to 80 percent of the median income
       Moderate-Income – 81 to 120 percent of the median income
       Above Moderate-Income – more than 120 percent of the median income
In determining a jurisdiction’s share of new housing needs by income category, the
allocation is adjusted to avoid an over-concentration of lower-income households in one
jurisdiction. In addition to the allocation in the four income categories, recent legislation
requires cities to consider the needs of extremely low-income households earning 30 percent
or less of the median income.
The RHNA planning period (January 1, 2014 to October 31, 2022) is slightly different from
the Housing Element planning period of January 31, 2015 to January 31, 2023. The 2014-2022
RHNA, prepared by ABAG, assigns El Cerrito a need for 398 housing units, including 100
very low-income units, 63 low-income units, 69 moderate-income units, and 166 above
moderate-income units. State law also requires jurisdictions to estimate future housing
needs for extremely low-income households. The law allows local agencies and jurisdictions
to assume that the need for extremely low-income households is 50 percent of the very low-
income household need. This estimate is shown in the table below.

III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
A. ADEQUATE SITES ANALYSIS
Each city is mandated by State Housing Element Law to demonstrate it has adequate sites
available through appropriate zoning and development standards and with the required
infrastructure for a variety of housing types and income levels. The City must demonstrate
it has capacity or adequate sites to accommodate the projected need for housing through the
2014-2022 RHNA planning period.
1. Units Under Construction and Approved Projects
Since the RHNA planning period begins January 1, 2014, El Cerrito’s RHNA can be reduced
by the number of new units under construction or approved as of January 1, 2014. City staff
compiled an inventory of all residential projects that are (as of August 2014) under
construction or approved and anticipated to be built during the current Housing Element
planning period. The units shown as affordable to lower- and moderate-income households
are all deed-restricted affordable units.
As shown in Table III-1 (and Table A-3 in Appendix A), there are 251 units currently under
construction or approved within El Cerrito, including 86 very low-income units, 38 low-
income units, 13 moderate-income units, and 114 above moderate-income units. The Map ID
column in Tables III-1 and A-3 in Appendix A correspond with the labels in Figures A-1 and
A-2 in Appendix A.

2. Sites Summary – Future Development Potential
There is vacant and underutilized land located throughout the city ranging from very low-
to high-density zoning. Table A-4 in Appendix A, summarizes the development potential of
the vacant lots based on zoning classification, general plan land use designation, and
comments specific to the site. Figure III-1 shows the locations of all units under construction,
approved projects, and potential sites. Figures A-1 and A-2 in Appendix A include map IDs
that correspond with the “map ID” column in Table III-1 and Table A-4.
To show the development capacity to meet the remaining RHNA of 147 units, the City
conducted a site-by-site analysis of sites suitable for residential development. All of the sites
in the inventory are vacant or underutilized sites zoned for residential use and meet the
classification in State law (Government Code Section 65583.2(a)) as “land suitable for
residential development.” Together, the identified opportunity sites can yield more than 900
new housing units, exceeding the City’s RHNA.
3. Assumptions
A majority of the sites are located within the San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan. Many of these
sites are owned by Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and have additional hurdles to
development beyond that of normal land development. The City is poised to work closely
with BART and facilitate these future developments.
Before the Specific Plan was adopted, the majority of the sites within the Plan Area were
designated Commercial/Mixed Use and zoned Community Commercial or Transit-Oriented
Mixed Use (TOM), which allowed up to 35 units per acre. When the previous Housing
Element was adopted, additional density (up to 45 units per acre) was allowed through the
Page 52 of 190                                                   Resources & Constraints| April 2015

City of El Cerrito                                      Final Draft 2015-2023 Housing Element
City’s Incentives Program or through the Affordable Housing Density Bonus. The previous
Housing Element assumed 40 units per acre on these sites (i.e., halfway between the
maximum permitted density of 35 and the maximum permitted density with zoning
incentives of 45).
The San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan created two Transect Zones: TOHIMU and TOMIMU.
The Plan contains a Form-Based Code (FBC) that includes land use regulations (i.e.,
permitted uses), building height standards, and open space and parking requirements.
However, there are no maximum permitted density standards within the FBC of the Specific
Plan. Since the FBC significantly increased the allowed building heights, decreased parking
and eliminated maximum densities, the City anticipates that future development densities
under the Specific Plan will exceed the maximum permitted densities under the former
General Plan designations and zoning. As described in the next section, the Housing
Element conservatively assumes the densities allowed under the former General Plan
designations and zoning districts in order to estimate capacity on the sites within the
Specific Plan.
These sites are inventoried as lower-income in accordance with the “default density
standard” set forth in Government Code Section 65583.2(c). The default density standard is
the density “deemed appropriate” in State law to accommodate housing for lower-income
households given the type of the jurisdiction. El Cerrito is considered a “suburban
jurisdiction” with a default density standard of 20 units per acre. HCD is required to accept
sites that allow for zoning at this density as appropriate for accommodating El Cerrito’s
share of the regional housing need for lower-income households.
It has been the City’s experience that these densities are realistically achievable when all
other required development standards are taken into account. Several approved multifamily
projects have achieved densities at or exceeding 35 units per acre and 45 units per acre
through the incentives program. The Creekside project was approved through the City’s
incentives program with a density of 45 units per acre. The Ohlone Gardens Apartments,
which is currently under construction, includes housing for the persons with special needs
with services at a density of 61 units per acre. The Eden Senior Housing project, which
received approvals in 2013, includes senior housing with services at a density of 65 units per
acre.
The San Pablo Avenue Plan increased the development potential on these sites. The
densities and modified development standards that were granted under the incentives
program are now permitted by-right for sites within the San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan. As
previously stated, the City anticipates that future development densities under the Specific
Plan will meet or exceed the maximum permitted densities under the former General Plan
designations and zoning.

There are seven small sites (map numbers 80 - 86) that are currently zoned Multi-Family
Residential (RM) and designated High Density Residential. This designation allows up to 35
units per acre, but all seven of the sites are less than 0.5 acres. There is also one site (map
number 79) that is currently zoned RD and designated Medium Density Residential. This
designation allows up to 20 units per acre, but the site is less than 0.5 acres. Due to the
difficulty associated with multifamily development on small lots, these sites are inventoried
as moderate-income. All other sites were inventoried as above moderate-income.
4. RHNA Summary
Table III-3 summarizes El Cerrito’s capacity to meet the RHNA for the 2014-2022 projection
period. After accounting for capacity from units under construction, approved projects, and
potential sites, El Cerrito has a surplus of 810 lower-income units, 25 above moderate-
income units, and 796 total units. There is a deficit of 39 moderate-income units, but this
need is covered by the surplus in the lower-income categories.

B. GOVERNMENTAL RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
Governmental resources include programs that provide funds for housing-related activities,
as well as, incentives provided by the local jurisdiction for the provision of housing.
Governmental constraints are policies, standards, requirements, and actions imposed by the
government that may have a negative impact on the development and provision of housing
for a variety of income levels. These constraints may include land use controls, building
codes and their enforcement, environmental review fees and processes, site improvements,
fees and exactions required of developers, and local processing and permit procedures. State
and Federal agencies play a role in the imposition of governmental constraints; however,
these agencies are beyond the influence of local government and are, therefore, not
addressed in this analysis.
1. Land Use Controls
Land use controls include City-initiated General Plan policies, zoning regulations and
standards, permit processing requirements, and development fees.
a. General Plan
The General Plan constitutes the highest-level policy document for the City of El Cerrito.
The Land Use Element of the General Plan identifies the location, distribution, and
density/intensity of the land use within the city. Residential densities are measured in
dwelling units per acre (du/ac). The 1999 El Cerrito General Plan, as amended in November
2014, identifies seven land use designations that permit residential uses, shown in Table III-
4.

                    against hazards related to earthquakes, unstable terrain, and wild fires. In
                    addition, Very Low Density land uses are also intended to protect sensitive
                    environmental areas and features, and provide sites for larger, distinctive
                    residences.
Low Density         The Low Density category of residential land uses is intended to promote and          7 to 9 dwelling units

                    surrounding land uses. This category is intended to provide greater housing
                    choice in the city for different family sizes and incomes. Medium density
                    residential uses are intended to be located closer to community and retail
                    services, such as neighborhood shopping centers, parks, and open spaces
                    areas, and near minor and major collector streets where greater access can be
                    provided. This land use category includes a number of housing development
                    types including duplexes, townhouses, apartments, and small-lot, single family
                    residential designs.
High Density        The High Density residential land use category is intended to provide                 21 to 35 dwelling

                    environment. The range is intended to be located in areas where higher traffic
                    volumes and buildings can be accommodated. These developments should be
                    located outside of single family residential communities, where services and
                    transportation systems are adequate to serve the increased densities.
Commercial/         The Mixed-Use Commercial designation is intended primarily for all types of           Maximum of 35 units
Mixed Use           commercial uses and secondarily for residential uses or a combination of the          per net acre.
                    two. The designation is intended to encourage ground floor, pedestrian-friendly,
                    retail sales and service uses with upper floors of office and residential uses. The
                    Mixed-Use Commercial category applies to commercial activity ranging from
                    neighborhood convenience stores to community shopping centers and regionally-
                    oriented specialty stores.
                    In addition to retail stores, the Mixed-Use Commercial designation is also
                    intended to allow for residential and office uses, including administrative,
                    professional, medical, and dental offices, and “high-tech” research and
                    development uses and laboratories. The Mixed-Use Commercial designation
                    also allows for limited, small-scale specialty manufacturing uses, such as arts
                    and crafts, woodworking, and assembly processes, when located on sites
                    compatible with surrounding neighborhoods.

b. San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan and Form-Based Code
The San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan, effective date of November 6, 2014, articulates a vision
for the future of San Pablo Avenue, identifies improvements, and adopts context sensitive
regulations that can be applied within the Specific Plan Area. The Plan’s key principles are
to deepen a sense of place and community identity; attract private investment; strengthen
partnerships; enhance the public realm; promote the everyday use of transit, walking, and
biking; and foster environmental sustainability. The Plan establishes a Form-Based Code
that regulates land use and development standards based on Transit-Oriented Higher-
Intensity Mixed Use (TOHIMU) and Transit-Oriented Mid-Intensity Mixed Use (TOMIMU)
Transect Zones. Goals and strategies include:
          Maximize Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) potential along the corridor;
          Allow ground floor residential development to provide flexibility and expand the
           Plan Area’s residential base;
          Promote residential infill development through increased land use intensity close to
           existing transit infrastructure; and
          Increase the supply, diversity, and affordability of housing in proximity to existing
           or planned transportation investments.

City of El Cerrito                                       Final Draft 2015-2023 Housing Element
It is important to note that most sites included in Table A-4(Available Land Inventory) of
the Housing Element’s sites inventory zoned CC or TOM were rezoned as either TOHIMU
or TOMIMU when the San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan was adopted in November, 2014.
These available sites are subject to the development standards described in Table III-6
above.
c.     Zoning Code
The Zoning Code is the primary tool for implementing the General Plan. It is designed to
protect and promote public health, safety, and welfare, as well as to promote quality design
and quality of life. The City of El Cerrito’s residential zoning designations control both the
use and development standards of each residential parcel.
The housing types allowed within the City of El Cerrito zoning districts are described below
in Table III-7. Residential zoning includes six main districts: RS, RD, RM, TOM, CC, and CN
as well as the TOHIMU and TOMIMU Transect Zones of the San Pablo Avenue Specific
Plan (See section b. San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan). The RS District is split into four
separate subsets guiding the minimum size of each lot and other development standards
such as minimum lot depth and width and setbacks.
Single family units are permitted by right in all single family residential districts. New
single family uses are not allowed in the RM, TOM, CC, and CN districts. Multiple family
dwellings are permitted by right in the RM, TOM, CC, CN zones, and San Pablo Avenue
Specific Plan Transect Zones. Multiple family dwellings are not permitted on the ground
floor of the Theater Overlay Block of the San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan.

Residential Development Standards
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of development through the General
Plan, San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan, and the Zoning Ordinance. Provisions in the Zoning
Ordinance specify minimum lot areas, setbacks, coverage, FAR, height limits, and parking.
El Cerrito regulations are comparable to those of similar cities. In addition to the base
zoning districts described in the following tables, applicants can request rezoning to a
customized Planned Development (PD) District that allows deviation from the normal
regulations where a development project is consistent with the General Plan and meets
other community objectives. El Cerrito’s zoning regulations are not restrictive and do not
create a financial or physical constraint to residential development due to a wide range of
densities permitted by the City and flexible parking requirements. Additionally, the San
Pablo Avenue Specific Plan contains a Form-Based Code, which establishes flexible
development regulations for structures within its Plan Area, including building height,
parking, setbacks, and access (See Table III-6).

          Multifamily Housing
          The purpose of the City’s mixed-use zones is to promote and encourage multiple family
          developments at densities that are consistent with the General Plan land use designation
          and surrounding development. The intent is to provide for higher-density classifications in
          and around the development nodes and adjacent to major transit centers, and lower-density
          multifamily development in transition areas between single family development and
          commercial areas or higher-density residential areas.
          Multiple family dwellings are permitted by right in the RM, TOM, CC, CN and San Pablo
          Avenue TOHIMU and TOMIMU transect zones. Multifamily structures that contain more
          than 25 units require a conditional use permit in the CC zone. However, as described earlier,
          the TOHIMU and TOMIMU transect zones of the San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan replaced
          most of the CC and TOM zoned sites in the city. Table III-9 describes multifamily
          development standards in commercial areas and the San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan
          TOHIMU and TOMIMU transect zones.

Parking
Table III-11 summarizes residential parking requirements in El Cerrito. Parking
requirements do not constrain the development of housing directly. However, parking
requirements may reduce the amount of available lot area for residential development.

d. Planned Development District
The specific purpose of the -PD Planned Development district is to provide for detailed
review of development that warrants special review and deviations from the existing
development standards. This district is also intended to provide opportunities for creative
development approaches and standards that will achieve superior community design,
environmental preservation, and public benefit, in comparison to subdivision and
development under district regulations. All site and building requirements, including yard,
building height, lot coverage, and landscaping are determined on a case-by-case basis based
on the specific characteristics of the site and the need to provide additional zoning control
by establishing site specific conditions of approval and standards for a specific PD District.
2. Density Bonus Ordinance
In order to encourage the construction of affordable housing developments for very low-
and low-income households and senior households, and in accordance with Section 65915 et
seq. of the California Government Code, the City of El Cerrito has two different Density
Bonus Ordinances. The first is the Affordable Housing Bonus Program (Chapter 19.22 of the
Zoning Ordinance) that is governed by the requirements of Government Code Section
65915. The second is the Incentives Program (Chapter 19.23. of the Zoning Ordinance),
which is still in place but has limited applicability now that the San Pablo Avenue Specific
Plan is in place. In addition to the Affordable Housing Bonus Program, the San Pablo
Specific Plan includes a “Tier IV” review process to consider projects that provide
community benefit, such as affordable housing, but do not meet the form-based code
standards. The Tier IV process is described under “c.”, below.
a. Affordable Housing Bonus
The Affordable Housing Bonus Program is in Chapter 19.22 of the El Cerrito Municipal
Code. The City last updated its affordable housing bonus ordinance in 2008, which
implements the policies of the General Plan Housing Element for encouraging and
expanding housing opportunities for households with extremely low-, very low-, and low-
incomes, seniors, disabled, other persons with special housing needs, and development that
includes a childcare facility through density bonuses and additional incentives, consistent
with Government Code Section 65915. The program also provides additional incentives for
affordable housing containing three or more bedrooms to meet the needs of large families. It
also requires resale and rental controls on affordable housing and ensures that lower-
income rental units remain affordable for at least 30 years or such other term approved by
the City, consistent with State law.
The amount of the density bonus is set on a sliding scale, based upon the percentage of
affordable units at each income. The number of units to which the applicant is entitled can
increase to a maximum of 35 percent of the maximum allowable residential density for the
site for very low-income dwellings, low-income dwellings, condominium and planned unit
developments, and housing accompanied by land donation. Depending upon the
Resources & Constraints | April 2015                                              Page 69 of 190

percentage of affordable units and the level of affordability, the program also provides the
applicant with the opportunity to receive incentives such as increased building height,
reduced building setbacks, reduced parking requirements or other incentives that would
improve the economic feasibility of the affordable development.
b. Incentives Program (Chapter 19.32 of the ECMC)
In 1977 the City adopted an Incentives Program that provided flexibility in the application
of development standards within the RM, CC, or TOM districts in exchange for community
and environmental benefits or creative designs that enhanced quality of life in the City.
The San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan was adopted in September 2014 and rezoned the
majority of parcels zoned RM, CC, and TOM to TOHIMU and TOMIMU. Many of the
incentives provided through the program are now granted as a matter of right through the
Form-Based Code in an effort to encourage mixed-use development along the corridor. With
the adoption of the Specific Plan, the Incentives Program now has limited applicability.
c. San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan
Projects within the San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan Area will be subject to the
Administration regulations of the Specific Plan. The Plan Form-Based Code is designed to
facilitate an increased intensity of residential development in proximity to transit. In the
event that the development standards for the Transect Zones create an impediment to
achieving multifamily residential development, the developer may submit an application
for Site Plan and Design Review – Tier IV. The Tier IV Site Plan and Design Review process
is meant to incentivize overarching community benefits, including affordable housing, as
part of developments that would not otherwise be permitted under Specific Plan regulations
but nevertheless comply with the intent of the Specific Plan. Approval findings for Tier IV
Site Plan and Design Review include the following:
        That the project furthers the goals of the Specific Plan by encouraging practical and
         market-friendly development, ensuring return on investment, strengthening a sense
         of place, enhancing and humanizing the public realm, and catalyzing mode shift;
        That the project provides a public benefit which is consistent with the goals of the
         Specific Plan and furthers an important goal(s) stated in adopted city policy
         documents as identified by the Community Development Director. These documents
         include, but are not limited to:
             o   El Cerrito Climate Action Plan
             o   El Cerrito Strategic Plan
             o   El Cerrito General Plan
             o   El Cerrito Economic Development Action Plan

       That the development will not have an undue adverse effect upon the Transect Zone
        in which it is located, and will be compatible with the design features and land uses
        permitted in the Transect Zone in which the project is located;
       That the proposed development complies with the intent of the Specific Plan, and;
       That the project implements applicable goals and policies of the General Plan.
3. Residential Care Facilities
A “residential care facility” is a resident-occupied dwelling, licensed by the State/County
that provides housing and care for children and/or adults on a full-time, live-in basis.
According to the Federal Department of Health and Social Services, there are a total of 14
licensed care facilities in El Cerrito (See Table II-18. The City of El Cerrito Municipal Code
defines three types of residential care facilities as follows:
       Residential Care – General. A residential care facility providing 24-hour
        nonmedical care for more than six persons in a single unit in need of personal
        services, supervision, protection, or assistance essential for sustaining the activities
        of daily living. This classification includes only those facilities licensed for residential
        care by the State of California. Residential Care – General facilities require a
        conditional use permit in all residential and commercial zones.
       Residential Care – Limited. A residential care facility providing 24-hour non-
        medical care for six or fewer persons in a single unit, in need of personal services,
        supervision, protection, or assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily
        living. This classification includes only those facilities licensed for residential care by
        the State of California. This classification includes residential care facilities restricted
        to persons 60 years of age or older if there are six or fewer residents. Six or fewer
        persons does not include the licensee or members of the licensee's family or persons
        employed as facility staff. Residential Care – Limited facilities are permitted by right
        in all residential zones (consistent with State law), but require a conditional use
        permit in all commercial zones.
       Residential Care – Senior. A housing arrangement chosen voluntarily by the
        resident, the resident's guardian, conservator, or other responsible person; where
        residents are 60 years of age or older and where varying levels of care and
        supervision are provided as agreed to at time of admission or as determined
        necessary at subsequent times of reappraisal. Any younger residents must have
        needs compatible with other residents, as provided in Health & Safety Code Section
        1569.316 or a successor statute. This classification includes continuing care

Adopted 2015-2023 Housing Element                                                City of El Cerrito
         retirement communities and lifecare communities licensed for residential care by the
         State of California. Residential Care – Senior facilities require a conditional use
         permit in all residential and commercial zones, except in RM zones, where an
         administrative use permit is required.
4. Emergency Shelters
State law (Government Code 65583(a)(4)) requires local jurisdictions to identify a zone or
zones where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use or
other discretionary permit. The City Zoning Ordinance allows emergency shelters as a
permitted use under “Community Social Service Facilities” within the Community
Commercial (CC) zone. The definition of Community Social Service Facilities as listed in the
City’s Zoning Ordinance:
        Community Social Service Facilities. Any noncommercial facility, such as homeless
         shelters, emergency shelters and facilities providing social services such as job
         referral, housing placement and which may also provide meals, showers, and/or
         laundry facilities, typically for less than 30 days. Specialized programs and services
         related to the needs of the residents may also be provided. This classification
         excludes transitional housing facilities that provide living accommodations for a
         longer term.
As updated by the San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan, emergency shelters with fewer than 50
beds are also permitted in the TOHIMU and TOMIMU zones, with the exception of the
Theater Overlay Block, subject to specified operational standards. The definition of
Emergency Shelter as listed in the San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan is:
        Emergency Shelters. Housing with minimal supportive services for homeless
         persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person or
         family. No individual or household may be denied emergency shelter because of an
         inability to pay. Medical assistance, counseling, and meals may be provided.
Emergency shelters are permitted subject to the following operational standards: emergency
shelters shall have a maximum of 50 beds, shall provide on-site staffing and shall comply
with licensing requirements and all applicable health and safety codes. Emergency shelters
shall provide a written management plan to the Zoning Administrator. A minimum
separation of 300 feet is required between Emergency Shelters.
Nearly all Community Commercial parcels are being rezoned with the San Pablo Avenue
Specific Plan to either TOHIMU or TOMIMU. There are five vacant parcels currently (June

5. Transitional Housing and Supportive Housing
With the enactment of SB 2 in 2008, State law requires cities and counties to treat transitional
and supportive housing as a residential use subject only to those restrictions that apply to
other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. As updated in 2014 by the San
Pablo Specific Plan, transitional housing and supportive housing are allowed in the
TOHIMU and TOMIMU zones under the same standards as other types of permitted
residential uses. The definitions of transitional housing and supportive housing contained
within the San Pablo Specific Plan Land Use Definitions are:
           Transitional Housing. Buildings configured as rental housing developments, but
            operated under program requirements that require the termination of assistance and
            recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at a
            predetermined future point in time that shall be no less than six months from the
            beginning of assistance.
           Supportive Housing. Housing with no limit on length of stay that is occupied by the
            target population, and that is linked to an onsite or offsite service that assists the
            supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health
            status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and , where possible, work in the
            community.
The City has amended other sections of the Zoning Ordinance to also comply with State
law. These amendments, which will ensure that transitional and supportive housing are
treated the same as other residential uses citywide, received their first approval and reading
by City Council of the City of El Cerrito on December 16, 2014. The final reading and
adoption of the Zoning Ordinance amendments occurred on January 6, 2015.
Resources & Constraints | April 2015                                                          Page 73 of 190

6. Single Room Occupancy Units
Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units, as defined in the California Code of Regulations, Title
4, Section 10325(g)(3), are efficiency units that may include shared or private bath and
kitchen facilities and are typically between 200 and 500 square feet in size. SROs are rented
on a monthly-basis and can provide an entry point into the housing market for extremely
low-income individuals, formerly homeless, and disabled persons.
The City Zoning Ordinance allows SROs as a permitted use under “Group Housing” within
the Community Commercial (CC) zone, requires a Conditional Use Permit in the CN, and
RM zones, and requires an Administrative Use Permit in the TOHIMU and TOMIMU zones.
The definition of Group Housing as listed in the City’s Zoning Ordinance and San Pablo
Avenue Specific Plan is below:
       Group Housing. Shared living quarters without separate kitchen or bathroom
        facilities for each room or unit. This classification includes rooming and
        boardinghouses, dormitories, and private residential clubs, offering shared living
        quarters, but excludes hotels, residential care facilities and transitional housing
        facilities.
7. Second Unit Ordinance
A “second unit” is an additional residential unit on the same lot as a primary single family
dwelling that provides complete, independent living facilities for one or more persons.
Second units are usually considered to be housing that is affordable to lower-income
households because there are no land costs associated with their development and they
frequently rent for less than comparably-sized apartments. They may also occupy unused
space in large homes, and by supplementing the income of the homeowner, allow the
elderly to remain in their homes or make it possible for lower-income families to afford
homes.
The State of California has determined that second units are a valuable form of housing in
the state for extended family members, students, the elderly, in-home health care providers,
the disabled, and others. State law provides that any regulations adopted by the City to
regulate second units cannot be so arbitrary, excessive, or burdensome so as to
unreasonably restrict the ability of homeowners to create second units.
Second units may be established on any lot in any district where a primary single family
dwelling has been previously established or is proposed to be established in the RS zone in
conjunction with construction of a second unit. Only one second unit is permitted per
primary single family dwelling on the same lot. Second dwelling units must comply with
City design and development standards to ensure that they are compatible with existing
neighborhoods. The City’s Second Unit regulations (Municipal Code Section 19.20.190) sets
forth the criteria for second units including the definition of a second unit, the maximum
Page 74 of 190                                              Resources & Constraints | April 2015

City of El Cerrito                                       Final Draft 2015-2023 Housing Element
allowable square footage, and the development standards for these units. These criteria do
not pose a constraint to the development of second units. Criteria for second units include:
       Type of Unit. A second unit may be attached, detached, or located within the living
        area of the primary dwelling unit on the lot, subject to the standards of this Section.
       Minimum and Maximum Floor Area. The maximum floor area of a second unit
        shall not exceed 750 square feet or 40 percent of the floor area of the primary
        dwelling, whichever is less, except that an attached second unit of 400 square feet in
        floor area is permitted regardless of the size of the primary dwelling. Up to 1,200
        square feet, or 75 percent of the floor area of the primary dwelling, whichever is less,
        may be permitted with the approval of a Conditional Use Permit. No second unit
        may be smaller than 150 square feet.
       Development Standards. Second units shall conform to setback, height, lot
        coverage, and other zoning requirements applicable to the primary dwelling in the
        zoning district where the second unit is proposed, subject to the following additional
        standards:
            o   A detached second unit may exceed 15 foot in height with the approval of a
                Conditional Use Permit.
            o   An attached or detached second unit shall be located on the interior side of a
                corner lot or behind the existing dwelling.
            o   An attached second unit that results in two-story construction shall be
                located in the rear half of the structure.
            o   A second unit shall have a separate, private exterior entrance.
       Architectural Compatibility. The architectural design, exterior materials and colors,
        roof pitch and style, type of windows, and trim details of the second unit shall be
        substantially the same as, and visually harmonious and compatible with, the
        primary dwelling, as determined by the Zoning Administrator. Color photographs
        of the street-facing side(s) of the primary dwelling unit shall be submitted with the
        second unit building permit application.
       Parking. One additional parking space shall be provided for each second unit. This
        space may be in tandem with required parking of the principal dwelling unit, may
        be located in front setback areas provided the ground slope in this area does not
        exceed 10 percent and may be uncovered. The principal dwelling unit must conform
        to the parking requirements of Chapter 19.24: Off-Street Parking and Loading.
       Exceptions. Exceptions to Development Standards and Architectural Compatibility
        above shall require an Administrative Use Permit and a finding that the second unit

         is compatible with, and preserves, the single family character of the primary
         dwelling and the surrounding neighborhood. Exceptions to Minimum and
         Maximum Floor Area and Parking above shall require a Conditional Use Permit.
        Deed Restriction. The second unit shall not be sold, transferred, or assigned
         separately from the primary dwelling.
8. Housing for Persons with Disabilities
The U.S. Census Bureau defines persons with disabilities as those with a long-lasting
physical, mental, or emotional condition. This condition can make it difficult for a person to
do activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or remembering.
This condition can also impede a person from being able to go outside the home alone or to
work at a job or business. The provisions of SB 520 require municipalities to analyze
potential and actual constraints upon the development, maintenance, and improvement of
housing for persons with disabilities, and demonstrate local efforts to remove governmental
constraints that hinder the locality from meeting the need for housing for persons with
disabilities. Cities are required to include programs that remove constraints and provide
reasonable accommodations for housing designed for persons with disabilities.
a. Reasonable Accommodations
Chapter 19.37 of the City’s Municipal Code contains the City’s reasonable accommodations
procedures. The City of El Cerrito makes reasonable accommodations for persons with
disabilities to allow equal access to City services and facilities and equal participation in
public processes. Individuals with disabilities can request special accommodations at the
City’s public counter or make an advance request for such accommodations through one of
several communications channels offered by the City. These channels include contacting the
appropriate department via, phone, email, or permit fax line. A City staff person at the
public counter or who takes the inquiry/request determines the nature of the need and
ensures that persons requesting accommodations have adequate access to the requested
services of the responsible City department. The City follows this same accommodations
process for persons with special needs who desire to participate in public events in City
facilities (such as public hearings and meetings).
At no time has the City denied a zoning ordinance exception to an individual who has
requested a variance for access accommodations or other disabilities needs. The City
provides public information at its permit counter that summarizes processes for requesting
variances from codes and standards to accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities.
Discretionary permit applications that do not require California Environmental Quality Act
review must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the scheduled hearing dates. But for
applicants requesting permits for reasonable accommodations purposes, the discretionary
process is fast-tracked, which means that applicants can apply 20 days prior to the
upcoming hearing dates instead of the standard thirty days. Twenty days is necessary for
Page 76 of 190                                            Resources & Constraints | April 2015

City of El Cerrito                                         Final Draft 2015-2023 Housing Element
staff to route plans and comply with State public noticing requirements, which stipulates a
10-day public review and comment period prior to public hearings. Zoning Ordinance
standards and CEQA review determines if a project is discretionary. If a project or request
complies with zoning ordinance standards and is exempt under CEQA guidelines, then it is
not considered discretionary. Non-discretionary (ministerial) projects are routed through
the department responsible for the request. Typically ministerial projects in El Cerrito only
require building permits. The Building Department, via administrative procedures, ensures
that handicap accessible modifications comply with the California Building Code, so the
Department does not distribute brochures. If reasonable accommodations are requested, the
Building Department provides additional help, information, and/or consideration to
applicants on an as needed basis.
b. Permits and Processing
Residential care facilities - limited (for less than six individuals) are allowed by right in all
residential zones, consistent with State law. The City does not restrict residential care
facilities – limited other than compliance with the same zoning standards as for any other
single family use. Residential care facilities - general (for six or more individuals) are
allowed in all residential and commercial zones with a conditional use permit.
c. Zoning and Other Land Use Regulations
The City has not identified any zoning or other land use regulatory practices that could
discriminate against persons with disabilities and impede the availability of such housing
for these individuals.
Examples of the ways in which the City facilitates housing for persons with disabilities
through its regulatory and permitting procedures are:
        Supportive multiple family or single family housing for the disabled is permitted in
         any residential zone that permits non-designated single or multiple family housing.
        All multiple family complexes are required to provide handicapped parking spaces,
         depending on the size of the development. The City is flexible and works with the
         developers of special needs housing and will reduce parking requirements if the
         applicant can demonstrate a reduced need for parking. The City has no separate
         restrictions or development standards for group homes or other special needs
         housing.
        Recognizing that some persons with disabilities may require the assistance of
         specially trained persons who live with the disabled persons, the Zoning Code does
         not differentiate between related and unrelated persons occupying the same
         residential unit.

9. Building Codes and Enforcement
The City of El Cerrito building codes are adopted to preserve public health and safety, and
ensure the construction of safe and decent housing. These codes and standards also have the
potential to increase the cost of housing construction or maintenance.
a. Building Codes
The City of El Cerrito currently (2014) operates under the 2013 California Building Code,
which is based on the 2012 International Building Code and establishes construction
standards for all residential buildings. The latest edition of the California Building Code
must be submitted to the City Council from time to time together with changes or
modifications as are reasonable and necessary because of local climatic, geological, or
topographical conditions, or as otherwise permitted by State law. The regulations set forth
are designed to ensure the safety and welfare of El Cerrito’s residents. The 2013 California
Building Code and 2013 Cal Green Building Code were adopted by City Council in October
2013.
The City of El Cerrito adopted several amendments to the 2013 California Building Code,
which require more stringent building and housing regulations. One amendment (Section
16.02.080 of the City’s Municipal Code), requires automatic fire-extinguishing systems to be
installed in every building where the total floor area exceeds 5,000 square feet and in every
building having three or more stories. While this may impact high density housing and
mixed-use structures within the city, this amendment does not substantially add to the cost
of housing.
b. Americans with Disabilities Act
The Federal Fair Housing Act of 1998 (FHA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
are Federal laws intended to assist in providing safe and accessible housing. ADA
provisions include requirements for a minimum percentage of units in new developments to
be fully accessible for persons with physical disabilities. Compliance with these regulations
may increase the cost of housing construction as well as the cost of rehabilitating older units,
which may be required to comply with current codes. However, the enforcement of ADA
requirements is not at the discretion of the City, but is mandated under Federal law.
c. Code Enforcement
The City conducts code enforcement activities on a complaint basis in response to reports
from residents and other community members. When a complaint is received the City
inspects the property and determines whether there is a code violation. If there is a code
violation, the City sends a letter to the property owner informing them that they have 10
days to correct the violation. If the violation is not abated within the 10 days, an
administrative citation with a fine is issued. Each violation of the El Cerrito Municipal Code
constitutes a separate violation for every day such violation continues, and an
Page 78 of 190                                              Resources & Constraints | April 2015

City of El Cerrito                                       Final Draft 2015-2023 Housing Element
administrative citation may be issued for each and every separate violation. As such, an
administrative citation will then be issued every day until the violation is abated.
10. Local Processing and Permit Procedures
a. Building and Development Fees
Various development fees are charged by the City and other agencies to cover
administrative processing costs associated with development. These fees ensure quality
development and the provision of adequate services. Often times, development fees are
passed through to renters and homeowners in the price/rent of housing, thus affecting the
affordability of housing.
In most California cities, home builders are required to provide a full complement of on-site
improvements such as streets, curbs, gutters, water lines, and sewer lines. Many cities also
collect impact fees to fund the cost of expanding infrastructure and community services,
such as sewers, parks, and roads to serve new growth. Impact fees as high as $60,000 per
unit are common in newer East Bay cities. These fees are typically passed on to homeowners
in the form of higher sales prices. Because El Cerrito is an infill city and essentially built out,
the vast amount of development opportunities are on sites with a full complement of
existing urban services and impact fees are not required. El Cerrito is one of the few cities in
the East Bay that does not collect impact fees, except for a state transportation mitigation
program fee of $2,595 per single family home, $1,648 per multifamily dwelling, and $701 per
senior housing unit. This represents a significant savings relative to the cost of development
in nearby communities.
Water and sewer treatment facilities impact fees are levied directly by the East Bay
Municipal Utilities District (EBMUD). EBMUD charges both connection fees and capacity
fees. A typical single family residential unit will have between a 5/8” and 1” line, for a cost
of $6,193 per water connection, and a typical multifamily development will require a 3” line
for a cost of $23,892. EBMUD also charges a water system capacity fee of between roughly
$16,000 and $26,000 (if located in EBMUD Region 2) for a single family unit and $9,370 for a
multifamily unit to account for the additional demand of a new water connection.
EBMUD charges a wastewater capacity fee of approximately $1,600 per dwelling unit for
connections to the regional wastewater treatment system. Developers are required to
provide laterals to connect to local sewer lines that feed into the regional system.
EBMUD charges additional fees when unusual conditions exist, such as when the meter is
more than 25 feet from the lateral line, underground utilities or other obstructions are in the
way of a lateral line, or traffic conditions requires special traffic control measures.
Wastewater collection in the City is primarily provided by Stege Sanitary District (SSD).
New development of 10 or more residential units, 10,000 square feet or more of commercial
or more than 1,000 square feet of restaurant use must perform a sewer capacity study to
Resources & Constraints | April 2015                                                Page 79 of 190

Adopted 2015-2023 Housing Element                                               City of El Cerrito
evaluate whether there is sufficient wastewater infrastructure capacity in the system to
accommodate the proposed development. If sufficient capacity exists, SSD collects a
connection charge of $1,790 per unit. If there is insufficient capacity, including existing
deficiencies, the development project is responsible for the costs of the upgrade to the sewer
line capacity, in addition to the connection charge. As part of the implementation of the San
Pablo Avenue Specific Plan, the City is working with SSD to assess the capacity of the
wastewater collection system to accommodate the new development anticipated under the
Plan. The City will also partner with SSD to pursue outside funding to upgrade the system
to accommodate future transit-oriented development.
School impact fees are levied by the West Contra Costa Unified School District and collected
at the time of application for a building permit. The school impact fee is $4.58 per square
foot for new residential dwellings.
Based on the residential projects constructed in El Cerrito, the City has not found the
development and permit fees to hinder the supply of housing or negatively impact the
affordability of housing. City-assessed fees in El Cerrito are lower than other cities in the
region.
b. Planning Fees
Unless a property is proposed to be rezoned or contain a planned development, planning
fees represent a very small percentage of the overall project cost. As noted above in the
summary text following Table A-4 in Appendix A, most of the multifamily housing units
built during the planning period will be produced within the City’s commercial zoning
districts and within the TOHIMU and TOMIMU transect zones around the City’s two BART
stations. A Planning Commission use permit would be required as would Design Review.
By themselves, planning fees for discretionary multifamily applications represent a small
fraction of the overall development cost and do not pose barriers for multi-unit
development. Fees for environmental review under CEQA vary dependent upon the nature
of the proposed development and existing conditions. The City charges a 30 percent
administrative fee on any consultant contract for an environmental review. If the project is
small enough for City staff to conduct the environmental review, fees run from $204 for a
categorical exemption to $3,669 for a negative declaration to $10,641 for a mitigated negative
declaration. As described earlier the City does not impose any impact fees.
c. Total Fees
Based on a Development Fee Comparison prepared for the City of Emeryville Housing
Element in July 2014, the City of El Cerrito has low fees compared to other jurisdictions
surveyed in the Bay Area. Total fees for a 100-unit multifamily rental development project in
El Cerrito are approximately $736,000 or $7,357 per unit. This is significantly lower than the
median fee of $1.2 million. The same is true for owner and townhome development fees; El
Cerrito’s fees for a 100-unit development totaled approximately $809,000 (compared to the

median fee of $1.4 million) and its townhome development fees totaled approximately $1.0
million (compared to the median fee of $2.5 million). Table III-13 shows development
impact, plan review and inspection, and permit fees in the City of El Cerrito.
For an actual affordable multifamily development that was recently approved in El Cerrito,
permit fees and development impact fees were only two percent of total development costs.

   East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) and Stege Sanitary District (SSD) fees (e.g.,
   water service, installation, and wastewater fees) are not included in the multifamily
   development fees described above.
   Although the fee comparison was prepared prior to the adoption of the San Pablo Avenue
   Specific Plan, it is anticipated that fees for multifamily development within the Plan Area
   will not vary significantly from the amounts shown. Costs for building permits, grading
   permits, etc were not impacted by the Specific Plan. Planning fees in the Plan Area were
   amended slightly to reflect the Plan’s new administration fees and a Specific Plan
   Maintenance Fee of $160.00 per unit was also included. Since El Cerrito was the lowest in
   terms of development fees of all the cities surveyed in the July 2014 study, staff does not
   think these minor costs will negatively impact El Cerrito’s ability to attract new residential
   development.
   The City can further help to mitigate the cost of fees by waiving, reducing, or deferring City-
   imposed fees to reduce the initial cost to the affordable housing developer.

d. Permit Processing Procedures
Applications for development permits are made in writing to the Community Development
Department. Application processing times vary depending on the permit being requested.
In addition, some planning applications require public hearings. On average, development
projects are processed in less than 75 days. Overall, development permit approval
processing in El Cerrito does not create any unnecessary delays or increases to the cost of
housing.
The City is required to determine if an application is complete within 30 days of receipt.
Once deemed complete, application processing begins. Applications are reviewed for
consistency with the General Plan and Zoning Code, and conformance with design
standards. The City has determined that the most likely zoning categories that can
accommodate very low- or low-income housing are the RM, CC, TOM, TOHIMU, and
TOMIMU zoning districts.
Assuming that neither a general plan amendment, Planned Development or rezoning is
needed, a typical single family home will require the following permits:
       If in a new subdivision, tentative/final subdivision approval (more than four parcels)
        or minor subdivision approval (four parcels or fewer);
       CEQA compliance review (A single family home will typically be exempt or require
        a negative declaration if part of a subdivision.);
       Grading permit;
       Site work plan review (if project is not part of a subdivision) if two or more stories
        are proposed; and
       Building permit.
A typical multifamily project will require the following permits:
       Administrative design review (for small projects such as duplexes) or Design Review
        Board review;
       Use permit if housing is located on the ground floor in the TOM, CC and CN, or it
        the proposal is greater than 25 units.
       CEQA compliance review (typically a negative declaration);
       Grading permit; and
       Building permit.

Adopted 2015-2023 Housing Element                                              City of El Cerrito
Planning permits are processed by City staff. However, several types of discretionary
permits require public hearings before the Planning Commission and/or Design Review
Board. These entitlements include: tentative subdivision maps, design review applications
and use permits, These layers of review create the potential for a substantial duration of
time for project review. The City’s experience has been that even projects requiring
discretionary review can be processed within a reasonable timeframe with minimal
modifications that do not significantly affect cost or project density so long as the City’s
development standards are followed.
Developers requesting planned development approvals or participation in the Incentives
Program may find longer approval timeframes due to the complexity of these entitlements
In the City of El Cerrito, the time necessary for obtaining these typical permit approvals
varies widely depending on the complexity of the project. On average, a single family
development of more than two dwellings will require a maximum of six months for
development approvals. Delays usually occur because of complex environmental analysis.
El Cerrito acts upon tentative subdivision applications for minor subdivisions within three
months. Final maps require only one month. El Cerrito completes plan checks and building
permits within approximately three weeks.
Multifamily projects can also be reviewed and approved within six months, unless the
project requires an environmental impact report (EIR). It is anticipated that the
programmatic EIR prepared for the San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan will help facilitate
CEQA environmental review for future multifamily development in the Plan Area. Rental
multifamily projects do not typically involve subdivision of land, so tentative and final map
approvals are usually not required. However, if the project is proposed to be a
condominium project, a map would be required. In the part of the city not included in the
San Pablo Avenue Plan Area, a typical multifamily project will involve conceptual and final
review by the Design Review Board (DRB). If the project is required to secure a use permit,
it would also require a hearing at the Planning Commission. In the past, review by the
Commission and Board has not resulted in significant delay for residential projects because
of the use of study session and conceptual review to identify potential design issues early.
Multifamily projects are permitted by right within the multifamily residential zone (RM). A
use permit would be required for multifamily projects of 25 units or more within the CC
and TOM zones; however mixed use projects are permitted by right (no additional CUP
required for retail). The findings of approval required for projects that require a use permit
are listed in Section 19.343.040 of the El Cerrito Municipal Code. These findings provide
guidance to developers throughout the design and permit processes as do codified
guidelines for basic massing and compatibility with other zoning districts within the Zoning
Ordinance. The required findings of approval for a CUP are as follows:

City of El Cerrito                                       Final Draft 2015-2023 Housing Element
        The location, size, design, and operating characteristics of the proposed development
         will be harmonious and compatible with and will not adversely affect the livability
         or appropriate development of abutting properties and the surrounding
         neighborhood.
        The location and design of the proposal will provide a convenient and functional
         living, working, shopping, or civic environment that will be an attractive amenity for
         the City.
        The proposal is consistent with the purposes of the district where it is located and
         conforms in all significant respects with the El Cerrito General Plan and with any
         other applicable plan adopted by the City Council.
In the part of the City that is in the San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan Area, if a project meets
all of the development parameters stated in the Form Based Code, (e.g. height, parking,
open space) it qualifies for Tier II design review and it will only require one hearing before
the Design Review Board. A completely residential project would no longer require a use
permit, even if greater than 25 units. However, if a proposal had a use that did require a use
permit, (e.g. restaurant serving alcohol) it would still be required to hold a hearing before
the Planning Commission. This approach set out in the FBC is intended to incentivize
developers to bring high quality residential multifamily projects forward to the City in
return for a streamlined entitlement process. If a project cannot meet the development
parameters of the FBC, the City will still make every effort to process the project in a timely
fashion, likely in a time frame similar to the previous municipal code of six months if the
CEQA documentation is not complex.
Design Review
Throughout the City, the construction of multifamily housing requires a public hearing
before the Design Review Board. In practice, design review by the Board does not add
significant time for approving a multifamily project.
Outside the Plan Area, if a developer wishes to design a project that varies from the City’s
zoning requirements, the Incentives Program is available to permit variations from the
underlying standards in exchange for a project-specific design review. Projects that
incorporate “desirable features” can qualify for modified parking, setback, building, lot
coverage, and other standards. Because many of the desirable features for which the City
may grant incentives relate to project design, the Incentives Program is used in conjunction
with design review. However, as described earlier, the Incentives Program has limited
applicability now that the San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan provides the flexible
development standards as a matter of right.

San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan’s Tier System.
As mentioned above, if an application for a new project conforms to the standards of the
FBC, then it qualifies for Tier II review. Inside the Plan Area, if a developer wishes to design
a project that varies from the standard of Tier II but has a project that the City feels will
serve the goals of the Specific Plan, they can apply for a Tier IV review. This will include
review from both the Planning Commission and the Design Review Board. Tier IV is
intended to allow high-quality new development projects that would not otherwise be
allowed under a strict interpretation of the Specific Plan regulations but nevertheless
comply with the intent of the Specific Plan and that help ensure the City’s long-term
financial sustainability. With the double hearing requirement, this entitlement path is
anticipated to take about the same amount of time as steps that an applicant would have
needed to through under the prior zoning review process.
Environmental Review
All applications for development are subject to the requirements of the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and require some level of environmental review. The
higher levels of environmental review can include the preparation of an environmental
document (e.g., environmental impact report or mitigated negative declaration) before a
project can be approved. The requirement to prepare an environmental document can
substantially lengthen the development review process, sometimes taking up to one year to
obtain project approval. However, the cost associated with preparing an environmental
document is not considered to disproportionately constrain residential development in El
Cerrito. The costs associated with development project review will vary between projects. El
Cerrito utilizes an efficient and comprehensive approach towards development review and
permitting that allows for quick response to developer applications. In addition, the City
utilizes many practices such as expedited application processing, reducing costs, and
clarification of the process to developers and homeowners to minimize City impacts on the
development process. Increased development costs resulting from the City’s development
review and permitting process are not considered to constrain housing development.
11. Former Redevelopment Agency and Successor Agency
Pursuant to AB1x26, which dissolved redevelopment agencies in California in 2012, the City
of El Cerrito elected to serve as the Successor Agency. The Successor Agency assumed all of
the former Redevelopment Agency’s assets, liabilities, and obligations. The City’s role is to
serve as a fiduciary agent for the Successor Agency, administering payments and
performance of its obligations. As allowed under AB1x26, the City elected to retain the
housing functions of the former Redevelopment Agency. Prior to the dissolution of
Redevelopment Agencies, the Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Fund (LMIHF) was the
main source of housing funds used to support the City’s housing programs. State law
required that the Redevelopment Agency deposit 20 percent of the gross tax increment
revenues from redevelopment project areas into the LMIHF to be used exclusively for
housing for persons of low and moderate income. Prior to its dissolution, the LMIHF

City of El Cerrito                                     Final Draft 2015-2023 Housing Element
provided $7.5 million in financial assistance to the Ohlone Gardens and Eden Senior
Housing affordable developments to create 120 units of affordable housing. With the
elimination of the Redevelopment Agency, there will be no future funding for the LMIHF
from property tax increment.
a. Federal Entitlement Funds
The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) is the largest federal housing-related
program for affordable housing. It is a "pass-through" program that allows local
governments to use Federal funds to alleviate poverty and blight. Cities with populations of
over 50,000 receive CDBG funds directly from HUD, while smaller cities usually use county-
administered CDBG funds. HUD makes allocations based on a formula that takes
population, poverty, and housing distress into account. CDBG funds are used for a variety
of housing efforts including activities aimed at reducing costs for private development
(helping fund site acquisition, improvement, and other soft costs); housing acquisition and
rehabilitation through short and long-term loans, grants, or loan guarantees; direct payment
of rent or mortgage and housing counseling services; and fair housing activities. CDBG
funds are best used in combination with other subsidy sources or to provide
predevelopment funding to initiate housing development.
El Cerrito’s population is under 50,000, and thus CDBG funds are administered and
allocated by Contra Costa County to fund program and service priorities that are
established and implemented through the Five-Year Contra Costa County Consolidated
Plan. Contra Costa County will receive $2,976,594 in CDBG funds for the 2014-15 fiscal year,
of which $1,342,443 (45.1 percent) will be used for housing.
The Home Investments Partnership (HOME), like CDBG, is a Federal formula-based block
grant program. HOME funds must be spent only on housing, and are intended to provide
incentives for the acquisition, construction, and rehabilitation of affordable rental and home
ownership units. HOME requires local governments to provide matching funds, though the
matching ratio depends on the specific uses to which HOME funds are to be put. The
Federal-to-local matching ratio for tenant assistance is currently four-to-one, while the
match for rental construction is two-to-one. The fiscal year 2014/15 budget for HOME funds
is $1,946,574 million for Contra Costa County. Eligible housing projects in El Cerrito are
eligible to apply on a competitive basis for County HOME funds.
Section 8 is rental assistance provided to a household which bridges the gap between 30
percent of the household's gross monthly income and the fair market rent of a unit.
Although this long-standing Federal assistance program is not expected to increase in size
or scope, it remains an important program for affordable housing by helping to balance
household income and housing costs. Section 8 assistance in El Cerrito is administered by
the Contra Costa County Housing Authority.

Other funding sources include Housing Opportunities for Persons Living with Aids
(HOPWA) funds from the HUD, California Housing Finance Authority (CalHFA) and
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) program funds at the State
level, and low income housing tax credit equity funds. Any other loans, grants, or financial
assistance from any other public or private sources may be used if available.
12. On and Off-Site Improvements
The cost of producing a housing unit not only includes land, construction, and design costs,
but also infrastructure connections, site improvements, and payment of fees to ensure
adequate public facilities and services. Because many sites are small and being reused,
improvements consist of upgrading water and sewer lines if needed for intensification of
use, providing parking and on-site circulation, and placing utilities underground. Public
improvements may also be required to improve the safety and livability of the city. These
include curbs, gutters, and sidewalks, street trees, street reconstruction, traffic signals, utility
lines, and park and greenway improvements.
For new subdivisions, the City may require developers to dedicate land, construct on and
off-site improvements, or pay fees necessary to construct the necessary improvements.
Pursuant to the City’s Subdivision Ordinance, the City may require construction of streets,
including curbs, gutters and sidewalks; and all necessary public utilities. For new projects,
underground utilities are required. In addition to the required on-site improvements, the
City may require off-site improvements as mitigation measures to certain project impacts.
These off-site mitigations are determined as necessary on a project specific basis through the
CEQA process.
There are virtually no privately held parcels in El Cerrito, within zoning districts that allow
residential uses, which are large enough to require new streets at the time of development.
Nearly every street in the city is improved with curbs, gutters, and sidewalks that continue
to serve future residential development. It is extremely unlikely that new projects would be
required to dedicate or construct a significant amount of off-site street improvements due to
the built-out nature of El Cerrito. Street widening could possibly occur within existing
public rights-of-way, if necessary, but it is unlikely that any project would need to dedicate
right-of-way or construct a public street with a right-of-way wider than that of a minor
street. There are no additional major or secondary streets identified for construction in the
City’s General Plan.
C. NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
1. Land Prices
Land costs have a demonstrable influence on the cost and availability of affordable housing.
Land costs are affected by such factors as zoning density, the availability of infrastructure,
the existence or absence of environmental constraints, and the relative amount of similar
land available for development. As land becomes less available, the price of land increases.

Land costs in the San Francisco Bay Area are relatively high as compared with the rest of the
nation.
A search of Trulia and LandAndFarm land-for-sale records in August 2014 uncovered five
vacant properties for sale in El Cerrito. The land characteristics and price per square foot are
outlined in Table III-14. As shown in the table, the price per square foot ranged from $27 per

whether the property is improved or unimproved, entitled for an approved project, or has
other constraints or considerations.

Given the relatively high land costs in El Cerrito, increases in density would need to be
significant enough to reduce the unit cost of building a dwelling unit to the level of
affordability for low- or moderate-income households. Densities of 45 units or more per
acre, combined with small dwelling unit sizes, would be necessary to construct affordable
housing for moderate- and some low-income households without significant public
subsidies.
2. Construction Costs
Construction costs are primarily determined by the costs of materials and labor. They are
also influenced by market demands and market-based changes in the cost of materials.
Construction costs depend on the type of unit being built and the quality of the product
being produced.
The most significant constraint on development of new housing in El Cerrito is the overall
cost, including land costs and construction costs. Many factors can affect the cost to build,
including the type of construction, materials, site conditions, finishing details, amenities,
and structural configuration. Development costs were developed from estimates provided
Resources & Constraints | April 2015                                                             Page 89 of 190

by residential builders who work in the region. Permitting costs and fees are between
$30,000 and $35,000 for an average size home. Once a vacant parcel is purchased, the
contractor has to make certain site improvements to prepare for building on the property.
Such improvements include connections to existing utility systems, rough grading, and
installation of water and sewer lines. This type of work generally costs between $55,000 and
$80,000 depending on the amount of work required at each location. Including impact fees
and land costs (assuming a single family home) the minimum cost to produce a modest
home for a family of four in El Cerrito would be nearly $450,000.
Based on the costs listed above for a single family home, none of the very low-, low-, or even
many moderate-income households in El Cerrito could afford to own a new housing unit
constructed in the City. The scarcity of easily developed land, combined with the great
demand, indicates that housing construction costs are likely to remain high in the future. El
Cerrito will continue to follow the trend of increasing housing costs that is occurring
throughout the Bay Area.
Construction costs for multifamily residential units can vary more than those for single
family homes due to the greater range in which they can be built. As a comparison in 2013,
RS Means (a reliable published source for construction industry costs) estimated that the
hard construction costs in the Oakland area were $135 per square foot for typical four- to
seven-story multifamily residential construction and $114 per square foot for one- and two-
family residential construction. This equals a rough estimate of $135,000 for a 1,000 square
foot apartment and $228,000 for a 2,000 square foot single family home. A high-end senior
complex with senior-friendly amenities will cost more than an affordable multifamily
complex. Construction costs for a recent multifamily mixed-use development in El Cerrito
totaled approximately $237,000 per unit.
To reduce construction costs, developers may build at higher densities to increase the
economies of scale. In most cases, reduced parking requirements can also make construction
more affordable. Developers can also reduce costs by using better, newer construction
methodology such as modular construction, off-site manufacturing, and prefabrication.
Many of these techniques help save time, control quality, and eliminate waste and labor
costs – thereby keeping costs to a minimum. Amenities such as elevators, common open
space, and landscaped areas can also add to the overall cost.
3. Financing
Mortgage interest rates have a large influence over the affordability of housing. Higher
interest rates increase a homebuyer’s monthly payment and decrease the range of housing
that a household can afford. Lower interest rates result in a lower cost and lower monthly
payments for the homebuyer.
When interest rates rise, the market typically compensates by decreasing housing prices.
Similarly, when interest rates decrease, housing prices begin to rise. There is often a lag in
Page 90 of 190                                           Resources & Constraints | April 2015

City of El Cerrito                                     Final Draft 2015-2023 Housing Element
the market, causing housing prices to remain high when interest rates rise until the market
catches up. Lower-income households often find it most difficult to purchase a home during
this time period.
During the early to mid-2000s (2003, 2004, 2005), lenders provided an increasing number of
subprime and adjustable-rate loans, and, in response to high housing costs, many lenders
provided mortgages of up to 95 percent of the value of the home, rather than the
traditionally allowed 80 percent. In 2006 and 2007, as interest rates increased, borrowers
began to default on those loans leading to a foreclosure crisis and housing market crash. In
response in 2008 lenders significantly tightened their lending standards. In 2013 lenders
began to reduce the qualifications required for a competitive mortgage rate, and as the
economy continues its recovery, lenders may continue to make mortgage loans more
accessible, although they may never be as easy to obtain as they were prior to 2008.
Although there is more scrutiny of developer’s credentials and banks are requiring a higher
loan-to-value ratio, the cost of construction financing is historically low, with prime rates
below five percent in 2013.
As shown in Figure III-3 mortgage interest rates have been steadily declining since January
2010. Interest rates are at historic lows in 2014, but have started to increase. When interest
rates decline, sales increase. The reverse has been true when interest rates increase. Interest
rates are determined by national policies and economic conditions and there is little that a
local government can do to affect these rates.

Federal, state, and local housing programs, particularly first-time homebuyer programs and
similar mortgage assistance programs, can be a useful tool for providing help with down
payment and closing costs, which can be significant obstacles to home ownership for lower-
income and minority groups.
4. Energy Conservation
There are many opportunities for conserving energy in new and existing homes. New
buildings, by design, can easily incorporate energy-efficient techniques into the
construction.
In July 2010, the California Building Standards Commission (CBSC) adopted the 2010
California Green Building Standards Code, otherwise known as “CALGreen,” which
became effective January 1, 2011. CalGreen includes optional “tiers” with higher standards
for green building. The California Building Code was most recently updated in 2013, and El
Cerrito has adopted the 2013 Green Building Standards Code.
El Cerrito adopted a Climate Action Plan (CAP) in May 2013. Prepared by the City’s
Community Development Department, the CAP assists the City Council and the
community in determining the best actions to reduce energy use and to create a safer and
more sustainable city. The City adopted targets to reduce GHG emissions by 15 percent
below 2005 levels by 2020 and 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2035. The plan suggests
resource conservation measures designed to achieve greater energy efficiency, water
efficiency, and renewable energy in existing and new buildings through education,
incentives, and ordinances.

City of El Cerrito                                       Final Draft 2015-2023 Housing Element
El Cerrito provides free booklets and information on Contra Costa County’s Green Building
program at El Cerrito City Hall and online. The Green Building Program promotes
designing and constructing buildings that conserve energy, water, and material resources
and are healthier, safer, and more comfortable.
Since much of El Cerrito is already developed, it is important to consider the opportunity
for energy savings in existing housing also. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the
concept of energy efficiency in buildings is demonstrated by the building envelope, which is
everything that separates the interior of the building from the outdoor environment: the
doors, windows, walls, foundation, roof, and insulation. All the components of the building
envelope need to work together to keep a building warm in the winter and cool in the
summer.
Constructing new homes with energy-conserving features, in addition to retrofitting
existing structures, will result in a reduction in monthly utility costs. There are many ways
to determine how energy efficient an existing building is and, if needed, what
improvements can be made. PG&E offers free home energy audits and can specify areas for
energy conservation. Examples of energy conservation opportunities include installation of
insulation and/or storm windows and doors, use of natural gas instead of electricity,
installation or retrofitting of more efficient appliances and mechanical or solar energy
systems, and building design and orientation that incorporates energy conservation
considerations.
a. Pacific Gas and Electric
PG&E also provides a variety of energy conservation services for residents and participates
in several other energy assistance programs for lower-income households, which help
qualified homeowners and renters conserve energy and control electricity costs. These
include the following:
       The California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Program - Provides a monthly
        discount on gas and electric rates to income qualified households, certain nonprofits,
        facilities housing agricultural employees, homeless shelters, hospices, and other
        qualified non-profit group-living facilities.
       The Relief for Energy Assistance through Community Help (REACH) Program -
        Provides one-time emergency energy assistance to low-income customers who have
        no other way to pay their energy bill. REACH aims to assist those who are in
        jeopardy of losing their electricity services, particularly the elderly, disabled, sick,
        working poor, and the unemployed, and those who experience severe hardships and
        are unable to pay for their necessary energy needs. Customers who have
        experienced an uncontrollable or unforeseen hardship may receive an energy credit
        up to $200.

      The Balanced Payment Plan (BPP) - Designed to eliminate big swings in a
       customer’s monthly payments by averaging energy costs over the year. On
       enrollment, PG&E averages the amount of energy used by the household in the past
       year to derive the monthly BPP amount. PG&E checks the household’s account
       every four months to make sure that its estimated average is on target. If the
       household’s energy use has increased or decreased dramatically, PG&E will change
       the amount of monthly payment so that the household does not overpay or
       underpay too much over the course of a year.
      The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) Block Grant -
       Funded by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services, it provides two
       basic types of services. Eligible low-income persons, via local governmental and
       nonprofit organizations, can receive financial assistance to offset the costs of heating
       and/or cooling dwellings and/or to have their dwellings weatherized to make them
       more energy efficient. This is accomplished through these three program
       components:
      The Weatherization Program - Provides free weatherization services to improve the
       energy efficiency of homes, including attic insulation, weatherstripping, minor home
       repairs, and related energy conservation measures.
      The Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) - Provides financial assistance to
       eligible households to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling dwellings.
      The Energy Crisis Intervention Program (ECIP) - Provides payments for weather-
       related or energy-related emergencies.
      The Family Electric Rate Assistance (FERA) Program - PG&E’s rate reduction
       program for large households of three or more people with low- to middle-income. It
       enables low-income large households to receive a Tier 3 (131 percent to 200 percent
       of baseline) electric rate reduction on their PG&E bill every month.
      Medical Baseline Allowance Program - PG&E offers additional quantities of energy
       at the lowest (baseline) price for residential customers that have special medical or
       heating/cooling needs because of certain medical conditions.
      Energy Works Program/Energy Partners Program - The Energy Works Program
       provides qualified low-income tenants free weatherization measures and energy
       efficient appliances to reduce gas and electricity usage. In order to qualify for the
       program, a household’s total annual gross income cannot exceed the income as set in
       the income guidelines (http://www.hacsc.org/energyworksprogram.htm);
       households must receive gas and/or electricity from PG&E; and the residence cannot
       have participated in the Energy Partners Program in the past 10 years.

       PG&E's SmartAC™ Program - This program offers a simple and convenient way to
        help prevent power interruptions. When customers sign up, PG&E installs a free
        SmartAC device that slightly reduces the energy the air conditioner uses
        automatically in case of a state or local energy supply emergency. PG&E customers
        receive $50 for signing up for the SmartAC™ program.
b. Local Programs
El Cerrito supports the programs described above, and also partners with Community
Energy Serves Corporation to provide free solar assessments to help residents and
businesses consider their energy efficiency and solar options.
East Bay Energy Watch
East Bay Energy Watch (EBEW) is a collaboration between Pacific Gas and Electric
Company and local governments, and non-profit and for-profit energy service providers in
the East Bay dedicated to providing innovative energy efficiency solutions for residents and
businesses in communities throughout Alameda and Contra Costa Counties
EBEW’s direct install programs bring energy efficiency services to local governments, small
and medium businesses, and residents throughout the year. Through partnerships EBEW
has helped communities across the East Bay save millions of kilowatt hours of energy.
EBEW provides no-cost home energy assessments, or Green House Calls, for Alameda and
Contra Costa County residents. EBEW also provides energy assistance to businesses,
institutions, nonprofits, and multifamily buildings. Services include no-cost energy
assessments of buildings, where Energy Watch professionals make recommendations for
cost effective retrofits and improvements that are designed to save business owners money
on their utility bills. Such recommendations are based on an inventory of each business’
energy consuming equipment. Recommendations can include such simple solutions as
replacing old and inefficient lighting or improving efficiency of refrigeration systems.
The Energy Watch program also offers technical assistance for implementation of energy
efficiency projects and rebates to help defray project costs. The rebates typically cover
between 50 percent and 70 percent of the total project cost and, in some instances, can cover
up to 90 percent of the total project cost.
Energy Upgrade California
       Multifamily Building Enhancements. Energy Upgrade California in the Bay Area
        offers planning assistance and cash rebates for multifamily properties that undertake
        energy and green upgrades. The program assists in planning energy saving
        improvements designed to save 10 percent or more of a building’s energy usage and
        provides 750$ per unit in rebates to help pay for the upgrade.

        in collaboration with the California Energy Commission.
Building Design
Many modern building design methods are used to reduce residential energy consumption
and are based on proven techniques. These methods can be categorized in three ways:
Building design that keeps natural heat in during the winter and keeps natural heat out
during the summer. Such design reduces air conditioning and heating demands. Proven
building techniques in this category include:
       location of windows and openings in relation to the path of the sun to minimize
        solar gain in the summer and maximize solar gain in the winter;
       use of “thermal mass,” earthen materials such as stone, brick, concrete, and tiles that
        absorb heat during the day and release heat at night;
       “burying” part of the home in a hillside or berm to reduce solar exposure or to
        insulate the home against extremes of temperature;
       use of window coverings, insulation, and other materials to reduce heat exchange
        between the interior of a home and the exterior;
       location of openings and the use of ventilating devices that take advantage of natural
        air flow (particularly cool evening breezes);
       use of eaves and overhangs that block direct solar gain through window openings
        during the summer but allow solar gain during the winter; and
       use of zone heating and cooling systems, which reduce heating and cooling in the
        unused areas of a home.
Building orientation that uses natural forces to maintain a comfortable interior temperature.
Examples include:
       orientating the long axis of a dwelling north-south;
       minimizing the southern and western exposure of exterior surfaces; and
       locating dwellings to take advantage of natural air circulation and evening breezes.

City of El Cerrito                                       Final Draft 2015-2023 Housing Element
Use of landscaping features to moderate interior temperatures. Such techniques include:
       use of deciduous shade trees and other plants to protect the home;
       use of natural or artificial flowing water; and
       use of trees and hedges as windbreaks.
In addition to natural techniques, a number of modern methods of energy conservation
have been developed or advanced during the present century. These include:
       use of solar energy to heat water;
       use of solar panels and other devices to generate electricity;
       window glazing to repel summer heat and trap winter warmth;
       weather-stripping and other insulation to reduce heat gain and loss;
       use of natural gas for dryers, stovetops and ranges;
       use of energy efficient home appliances; and
       use of low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators to reduce hot water use.
El Cerrito’s Mediterranean-like climate is typical of coastal northern California with year-
round mild temperatures that provides an opportunity to use solar energy techniques to
generate electricity, heat water, and provide space heating during colder months. Natural
space heating can be substantially increased through the proper location of windows and
thermal mass. Use of solar panels can generate 1,000 watts of electricity on a sunny day.
This can constitute more than enough power for daily residential operations and a special
converter attached to the solar panels can take excess electricity and funnel it back into the
PG&E grid.
5. Environmental and Infrastructure Constraints
Environmental hazards affecting housing units include geologic and seismic conditions,
which provide the greatest threat to the built environment. The following environmental
concerns may impact future development of residential units in the city.
a. Noise
The major sources of noise in El Cerrito are related to vehicular traffic including automobile
and truck traffic, particularly in areas along Interstate 80 and San Pablo Avenue. This traffic
noise is expected to continue to be a major noise source in the future, however, there is not
expected to be a significant increase in noise from these sources. A 3 dBA change is realized
by a doubling or halving of the traffic volume or by about 7 miles per hour increase or

decrease in speed. Interstate 80 at the present time only has a direct noise impact on El
Cerrito at the northern end of San Pablo Avenue near Cutting and Potrero. In most of this
area, the freeway and San Pablo Avenue are just 450 feet apart and the combination of the
two generates levels of noise exceeding 70 decibels.
BART noise affects the city differently in that unlike traffic, which is characterized by
gradual changes in volumes, train noise is characterized by numerous discrete, periodic
events during train pass-bys. Based on existing studies, BART trains produce maximum
noise levels typically in the range of 72-76 dBA. When the trains travel farther away from
the station at a significantly higher speed maximum noise levels range from 75-80 dBA.
Multifamily housing is subject to the requirements of Title 24 of the State Building Code and
would require further detailed analysis during the design of these projects due to noise
exposure. A major concern of the residential land use pattern along the Ohlone Greenway is
high levels of noise due to proximity of the BART tracks and San Pablo Avenue. New
construction standards and development requirements are expected to mitigate interior
noise levels by incorporating required sound barriers such as double paned windows, wall
insulation and building orientation.
b. Geologic and Seismic Hazards
The Hayward Fault passes through El Cerrito, generally following the route of Arlington
Boulevard. The city is also potentially subject to ground-shaking from a major earthquake
on the San Andreas Fault, located about 18 miles away. According to earthquake predictions
made in 2008 by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Southern California
Earthquake Center (SCEC), and the California Geological Survey (CGS) with support from
the California Earthquake Authority, there is a roughly one in three chance of a large
earthquake of a magnitude 6.7 or greater in the next 30 years (beginning in 1990) along the
Hayward Rodgers Creek Fault and about a one in five chance of a large earthquake on the
San Andreas Fault. The area immediately adjacent to the Hayward Fault has been
designated as a special study zone, which imposes some additional development
restrictions.
From a geologic and geotechnical standpoint, the primary concerns in El Cerrito are (1)
slope stability, (2) earthquake ground shaking, (3) fault ground rupture, and (4) liquefaction
potential. According to the Tri-Cities Seismic Safety Study (Bishop 1973), virtually all of the
upland areas of El Cerrito have a moderate to high landslide risk. The highest risk for
ground shaking is in the flatter areas, which have shallow alluvium. The greatest risk of
ground rupture is along the fault trace. Several small areas along Baxter and Cerrito creeks
are identified as having a high liquefaction potential.
c. Flood Hazards
A number of large storms have caused drainage problems and flooding in the past in El
Cerrito. Recent completion of the first phase in the City’s storm drain master plan program

City of El Cerrito                                      Final Draft 2015-2023 Housing Element
has addressed the highest priority sites and significantly reduced localized flooding issues
in the city. During past years of heavy rains, only three sites had drainage-related flooding
problems. The only portion of El Cerrito located in a FEMA Flood Insurance Zone is the area
located west of San Pablo Avenue and south of Central Avenue. Flooding is generally
caused by the relatively low ground elevations and high tides in this area, coupled with
hydraulic restrictions in the existing downstream channels located in Richmond between El
Cerrito and San Francisco Bay. There are two parcels, shown in Figure A-2 as site 82, that
are within the FEMA 100-year flood zone. As noted in Table A-3, no units are counted
towards the RHNA on this site.
d. Water
Water supply to the Planning Area is provided by the East Bay Municipal Utility District
(EBMUD), which derives its water source from the Mokelumne River in the Sierra Nevada.
This pristine water is transmitted, via aqueduct, to storage and treatment facilities
throughout EBMUD’s service area, and then distributed to customers. EBMUD operates five
terminal reservoirs within the following East Bay areas: Briones, Chabot, Lafayette, Upper
San Leandro, and San Pablo.
To improve water supply reliability in future droughts, EBMUD is adopting a multi-
pronged approach to reduce water demand, increase water storage capacity, and find
alternative sources of water supply. Some ongoing programs include the Freeport Regional
Project, Seawater Desalination Research, and Groundwater Banking Program. These efforts
should improve the water supply situation during the planning period.
e. Wastewater
El Cerrito is located in the Stege Sanitary District, which comprises 5.3 square miles and
includes the communities of El Cerrito, Kensington, and a portion of Richmond Annex west
of El Cerrito and south of Potrero Avenue. The sewage collection system includes 147 miles
of collection lines and two small pump stations. The primary elements of this collection
system are the public main sewers and the private lateral sewers. The SSD owns and has
maintenance responsibility for the main sewers located in public rights-of-way or in
easements on private land. Individual property owners own and have maintenance
responsibility for their lateral sewers installed between the building plumbing and the main
sewer. Wastewater collected in the SSD system flows to the Special District #1 Interceptor
sewer and is then conveyed to the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) Wastewater
Treatment Facility in Oakland. The anticipated growth of the District is through building on
the remaining vacant or underutilized parcels and commercial area redevelopment.
Average annual rainfall is 26.3 inches and generally occurs between November and April.
As of 2013 the average age of the collection system is about 57 years. The oldest lines in the
District are 90 years old. District main lines are predominantly vitrified clay pipe (VCP) with
cement mortar joints, and six inches diameter. Over 90 percent of the VCP sewers were
installed prior to the introduction of modern pipe joints such as compression gaskets, which

were not available until the 1960s and the introduction of improved VCP manufacturing
standards initiated in the mid 1950s.
In 1995 a System Rehabilitation Program (SRP) was developed as a result of the need to
maintain the collection system in a serviceable condition for the current and future
generations of customers of the District. Its emphasis is on optimizing the useful life of the
collection system and eliminating costly and environmentally damaging system failures.
The methodology employed first defines the sewer line segments in terms of their
vulnerability to failure by assessing various physical, technical, and cost rating factors to
each line segment and then ranking the lines by their overall rating. Lines most vulnerable
to failure are scheduled for video inspection for verification of condition and possible
rehabilitation. Video inspection of the sewer line segments will continue at a rate of
approximately 167,000 feet per year until the entire collection system is inspected and rated
as to its condition. Each year lines found to be cost-effective for replacement will be
scheduled for construction when within the financial resources of the District.
Approximately $750,000 per year is planned for these purposes. The SRP is planned to
continue indefinitely. The District is in its 100th year of existence and the majority of the
collection system is over 50 years old. Implementation and continuation of the SRP will
assure the customers of the District of an economic and reliable sanitary sewer system into
the future.
f. Electricity and Gas
Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) currently provides gas and electric services to El Cerrito
homes and businesses and is regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission
(CPUC). PG&E obtains its energy supplies from power plants and natural gas fields in
northern California and delivers electricity through high voltage transmission lines.
Electrical power is provided to the City of El Cerrito from various distribution feeders
located throughout the city. The availability of electricity and gas services is not expected to
become an issue during the housing planning period since almost all land inventory sites
are located within urban infill areas close to existing development. If increased capacity is
needed, PG&E can increase demand from regional power plants and natural gas fields or
construct new electrical substations in the region, as necessary.
While there is no way to completely eliminate additional energy use, improved
transportation, conservation and design standards can curtail both existing and future
demand for additional energy. Housing Element Goal 5 promotes the residential energy
conservation objectives of the City’s Climate Action Plan to support efforts to both conserve
energy and reduce housing costs.

IV. HOUSING POLICY PROGRAM
Previous sections of the Housing Element establish the housing needs, opportunities, and
constraints in the City of El Cerrito. The Housing Policy Program contains policies and
programs that will be implemented to address a number of important housing-related
issues. This section also contains quantified objectives for housing construction,
rehabilitation, and the preservation of affordable housing.
City staff regularly reviews Housing Element programs and progress towards
accommodating the City’s share of the regional housing need. The City will prepare an
annual implementation report and provide it to the California Office of Planning and
Research (OPR) and California Department of Housing and Community Development
(HCD).
A. GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
This section describes the City of El Cerrito’s Policy Program for the 2007-2014 planning
period. The Policy Program contains broad policy statements to guide decision making and
describes specific actions necessary to address present and future housing needs, meet
statutory requirements, and consider the input by residents and stakeholders. In developing
this Policy Program, the City assessed its housing needs, evaluated the performance of
existing programs, considered available staff and financial resources, and collaborated with
residents and stakeholders.

B. QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
State law requires that the City plan to accommodate its fair share of the Regional Housing
Needs Allocation (RHNA). In addition, this Housing Element includes quantified objectives,
shown in Table IV-1, for the number of units that can reasonably be expected to be
rehabilitated, conserved, or constructed during the next eight years. The quantified
objectives expected to be met through Housing Element programs are estimated based on
past program performance, construction trends, land availability, and anticipated future
program funding. These quantified objectives reflect current economic conditions and the
dramatic decrease in funding with the elimination of the Redevelopment Agency.

Final Draft 2015-2023 Housing Element                                              City of El Cerrito
APPENDIX A: LAND RESOURCES
The number of units identified in Table A-3, Available Land Inventory, takes into account
Zoning Ordinance standards, General Plan requirements, and the new standards in the San
Pablo Avenue Specific Plan Form-Based Code. Figures A-1 and A-2 show the sites in the
northern and southern sections of the city, respectively. The “Map No.” column corresponds
with the numbers and letters associated with each site in Figures A-1 and A-2. For the vacant
parcels in the Single-Family Residential (R-1) zoning districts, some of the lots are constrained,
as noted in Table A-3, by their topography (steep slopes) or small size. A few of these sites are
within landslide and/or seismic hazard zones based on their proximity to a fault that runs along
the eastern border of the City. Both potential landslide hazards and topography specific to each
site determine whether and where residences and/or accessory structures can be built.
For sites within the San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan (SPASP), there are no maximum density
standards. The City considered factors such as commercial development potential, height,
parking, and open space requirements in assessing residential development potential on these
sites. These factors may limit the number of residential units that can realistically be developed,
and the comments on the City’s analysis in Table A-3 reflect those limitations. In some cases, the
inventory includes sites that are not counted towards the RHNA. These sites have residential
potential, but site specific constraints and other uncertainties prevent the City from counting
units towards the RHNA. These sites have a “0” in the “Units Counted Towards RHNA”
column and are explained in the “Constraints and Comments” column.
Other factors that govern residential development on vacant sites include design criteria and
building height. Site-specific design requirements that aid in ensuring the compatibility of a
development with surrounding uses dictate how a site is configured, thus affecting the number
of units created. Design criteria for mixed use, general commercial, industrial, high-density, and
duplex zoning districts are determined by the City’s Design Review procedures. Design Review
is a discretionary process whereby developments are reviewed either by staff or the City’s
Design Review Board for quality and adequacy in architecture and landscaping. Sites in the RS
single-family residential zoning district are not subject to Design Review.
Table A-2 summarizes height limits by zoning district. In medium- to high-density residential
zones, the maximum allowable building height is 35 feet, which restricts housing unit
construction to within three stories. In the TOMIMU zoning district the maximum allowable
building height is 55 feet, or 65 feet for an affordable housing project. In the TOHIMU zoning
district the maximum allowable building height is 65 feet, or 85 feet for an affordable housing
project. Within the SPASP, affordable housing projects can also request open space and parking
requirement reductions to increase the building footprint.
Even with the parking, design, and height limits discussed above, the City has determined that
the densities of 35 and 45 units per acre are achievable, and perhaps conservative, for residential
and mixed-use projects within the TOMIMU and TOHIMU zones. As discussed in Section III A,
Adequate Sites Analysis, the City anticipates that densities within the Specific Plan will meet or

exceed the maximum allowed densities allowed under the previous zoning. However, in an
effort to conservatively estimate future densities, the inventory uses the same density
assumptions as the previous housing element for sites within the Specific Plan.

APPENDIX B: AT RISK ASSISTED UNITS
1. Assisted Housing Units at Risk of Converting to Market Rate Rents
Housing that receives governmental assistance is often a significant source of affordable
housing in many communities. Because of its significance, this section identifies publicly
assisted rental housing in El Cerrito, evaluates the potential of such housing to convert
to market rate during a 10-year planning period (2015 to 2025), and analyzes the options
and associated costs to preserving these units.
Covenants and deed restrictions are the typical mechanisms used to maintain the
affordability of publicly assisted housing, ensuring that these units are available to
lower-and moderate-income households in the long term. Over time, the City may face
the risk of losing some of its affordable units due to the expiration of covenants and
deed restrictions. As the relatively tight housing market continues to put upward
pressure on market rents, property owners are more inclined to discontinue public
subsidies and convert the assisted units to market-rate housing.
Table B-1 provides the inventory of assisted rental housing units in El Cerrito as of
August 2014. Of the 487 total assisted units within five developments, 58 units in two
developments are at risk of converting to market-rate during the 2015 to 2025 period. A
total of 31 at-risk units are reserved for seniors. Hazel Shirley Manor was at-risk in 2026
but the developers (Eskaton Properties Inc.) renewed the affordability restrictions.

2. At-Risk Units
The following is a summary of the two developments with at-risk units:
       El Cerrito Royale. The El Cerrito Royale is a 102-unit congregate care facility that
        is licensed through the State. The project includes 31 very low-income units. The
        El Cerrito Redevelopment Agency held the ground lease though a partnership.
        The County issued tax-exempt bonds for the project. The initial 30-year period of
        affordability is set to expire in 2019. Room, board, and care are included in the
        monthly rent and some units are double occupancy. This makes the market value
        of the project difficult to estimate as this project is not a typical multi-family
        rental development. For this analysis, the market value was estimated assuming
        an operating cost that included an estimated social service expense.
       Del Norte Place. Del Norte Place is a 135-unit apartment complex in El Cerrito
        near the Del Norte BART Station. In exchange for El Cerrito Redevelopment
        Agency assistance through a Disposition and Development Agreement and a
        ground lease, the development allocates 27 units for very low-income
        households. These units are also restricted through the Low Income Housing Tax
        Credit program. The term of affordability is set to expire in 2020. Because it is not
        possible to only acquire the 27 affordable units in Del Norte Place, the estimated
        market value is calculated for all 135 units in the project, as shown in Table B-2.
3. Preservation and Replacement Options
To preserve the existing affordable housing stock, the City must either preserve the
existing assisted units or facilitate the development of new units. Depending on the
circumstances of the at-risk projects, different options may be used to preserve or
replace the units. Preservation options typically include: 1) transfer of project to non-
profit ownership; 2) provision of rental assistance to tenants using other funding
sources; and 3) purchase of affordability covenants. In terms of replacement, the most
direct option is the development of new assisted multi-family housing units.
Transfer of Ownership. Transferring ownership of an at-risk project to a non-profit
housing provider is generally one of the least costly ways to ensure that the at-risk units
remain affordable for the long term. By transferring property ownership to a non-profit
organization, affordability restrictions can be secured and the project would become
potentially eligible for a greater range of governmental assistance.
The estimated market value for the at-risk units in the two projects is shown in Table B-
2. Because it is not possible to only acquire the affordable units in the Del Norte and El
Cerrito Royale developments, the estimated market value is calculated for all units in
each of the projects, as indicated in Table B-2. Current market value for the projects is
estimated on the basis of the project’s potential annual income, and operating and
maintenance expenses from the 2007 Bay Area Local Initiatives Support Corporation
(LISC). As indicated below, the estimated market value of the two projects is $44.8

Rental Assistance. Rental subsidies using other funding sources can be used to maintain
affordability of the 58 at-risk affordable units. These rent subsidies could be structured
to mirror the federal Section 8 program. Under Section 8, HUD pays the difference
between what tenants can pay (defined as 30 percent of household income) and what
HUD estimates as the fair market rent (FMR) on the unit. In Contra Costa County, the
2014 FMR was $1,255 for a one-bedroom unit and $1,578 for a two-bedroom unit. The
feasibility of this alternative is highly dependent upon the availability of reliable
funding sources necessary to make rent subsidies and the willingness of property
owners to participate in the program.

As indicated in Table B-3, the total cost of subsidizing the rents of all 58 at-risk units is
estimated at $21,437 per month or $257,244 annually. This is $14.1 million over 55 years.

Tax-Exempt Bond Refinancing. Contra Costa County acts as a conduit issuer of
mortgage revenue bonds. The El Cerrito Royale was partially financed with County-
issued tax-exempt bonds. A potential way to preserve the affordability of the 31 very
low-income restricted units at the El Cerrito Royale under the bond program is to
refinance the remaining mortgage on the project. When refinanced, the project would be
required by the 1986 Tax Reform Act to commit its 20 percent affordable units for the
greater of 15 years or as long as the mortgages are outstanding. The costs to refinance
the project would include the difference in interest rates on the remaining debt between
the previous and renegotiated loan packages, an issuance cost to be paid up front by the
County, and administrative costs. To provide the property owner with an incentive to
refinance, the County could offer to refinance the project with a new tax-exempt bond
issue at an interest rate lower than the rate on the initial bond. Other assistance, such as
rehabilitation loans or grants, may also be available.
Purchase of Affordability Covenants. Another option to preserve the affordability of
the at-risk project is to provide an incentive package to the owner to maintain the project
as affordable housing. Incentives could include writing down the interest rate on the
remaining loan balance, providing a lump-sum payment, and/or supplementing the
rents to market levels. The feasibility of this option depends on whether the complex is
too highly leveraged. By providing lump-sum financial incentives or ongoing subsides
in rents or reduced mortgage interest rates to the owner, the City can ensure that some
or all of the units remain affordable.

Construction of Replacement Units. The construction of new low-income housing units
is a means of replacing the at-risk units should they be converted to market-rate units.
The cost of developing housing depends upon a variety of factors including density, size
of the units, location, land costs, and type of construction. The average construction cost
for a rental residential unit is approximately $456,940 (including land costs), based on
assessments from a recent multi-family developments in El Cerrito. Based on this
estimate, it would cost approximately $26.5 million to develop 58 new units should both
projects convert to market rate.

4. Cost Comparisons
The previous analysis attempts to estimate the cost of preserving the at-risk units under
various options. The cost of acquiring both projects and transferring ownership to non-
profit housing organizations is highest at approximately $44.8 million, due to the large
number of market-rate units that would also need to be purchased. In comparison, the
annual costs of providing rental subsidies to preserve the 58 assisted units are relatively
low ($257,244 annually); however, long-term provision of rental subsidies for at least 55
years would cost more than $14.1 million. New construction of 58 replacement units is
another option at approximately $26.5 million. However, this option is constrained by a
variety of factors, including growing scarcity of land zoned for residential use and land
costs.
5. Resources for Preserving At-Risk Units
Available public and non-profit organizations with the capacity to preserve assisted
housing developments include Contra Costa County, the City of El Cerrito, and various
non-profit developers, including Eden Housing, Resources for Community
Development, Mercy Housing, EAH, and Bridge Housing Corporation. Financial
resources available include CDBG and HOME funds, Section 8 rental assistance, and low
income housing tax credits.
According to a list of qualified entities maintained by the California Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD), there are a number of non-profit
housing providers that would be suitable candidates to receive the transfer ownership of

are well established non-profit housing providers active in Contra Costa County,
including BRIDGE Housing Corporation (San Francisco), Resources for Community
Development (Berkeley), and Eden Housing, Inc. (Hayward), which could be suitable
candidates for the transfer of ownership. The HCD list does not include a number of
housing developers who have the capacity to own and manage this type of property.
The entities named above are representative of the active developers in the County.

APPENDIX D: SUMMARY OF COMMUNITY OUTREACH
The City of El Cerrito has encouraged and provided opportunities for public participation in the
process of identifying housing needs and formulating housing policies and programs. The
City’s objectives for the public participation process in the Housing Element update were as
follows:
        To inform the public of the purpose of the Housing Element;
        To present information regarding the City’s housing needs and current programs;
        To gather information about housing needs and ideas for addressing those needs;
        To learn from housing and social service professionals who have experience developing,
         operating or providing services to housing in El Cerrito or other Bay Area jurisdictions;
         and
        To gather comments and feedback on updated programs and policies.
The City provided several opportunities for public involvement. The City of El Cerrito’s public
outreach and community involvement activities are described below.
1. Community Workshops
The City conducted community workshops on July 19, 2014 and August 13, 2014. Notices of the
public meetings were posted prior to the meetings in the citywide newsletter, on the City’s
website, through a postcard mailer to approximately 2,300 landlords and renter households and
local and regional stakeholders, as well at City Hall and the El Cerrito Public Library. Both
meetings focused on the Housing Element update process and scope, the demographic
information from the 2010 Census, housing market trends, and the City’s Regional Housing
Needs Allocation (RHNA). After presenting an overview of the Housing Element update, City
staff facilitated an interactive discussion to answer questions about the Housing Element’s
purpose and solicit ideas from participants about the most critical housing issues in El Cerrito
and potential ways to address these issues. 11 people attended the July 19th workshop and 13
people attended the August 13th workshop.
The input from the meetings was used to update the Housing Element, particularly the goals,
policies, and programs.
Community Workshop, July 19, 2014
        Following is a summary of input from this workshop:
        What are potential housing solutions for the lowest income population? Are micro units
         a solution?
Appendix D | April 2015                                                             Page 159 of 190

Final Draft 2015-2023 Housing Element                                              City of El Cerrito
      Would like to see options such as large units for larger household or multigenerational
       families, or flexible housing that can accommodate those households
      El Cerrito is part of a continuous urbanized area. If El Cerrito creates its share of
       affordable housing, would there be priority for people who live in El Cerrito?
      Does senior housing transition to disabled housing? As people age, they may need a
       wheelchair, etc.
      How does the city encourage accessibility in affordable housing?
      To encourage housing development, the City should allow variances on road width,
       EBMUD utility requirements, C3 (stormwater run-off) requirements, parking, and
       increases to allowed FAR (floor area ratio).
      Government fees are a huge component of development costs.
      WCCUSD is a barrier to people wanting to move here, people prefer Kensington
       (Elementary School) to other schools in the district.
      The City of El Cerrito should annex Richmond’s property along San Pablo Avenue to
       better redevelop El Cerrito.
      Encourage alternative construction techniques such as manufactured housing to reduce
       costs, including the cost of construction transport.
      Attracting developers means reducing some of the barriers – improving the school
       district, reducing government fees (EBMUD) and regulations.
      City government wants to increase its tax base. As a current resident, why should I be
       interested in creating any more housing, especially high density housing?
      City should bring data showing vacancy rate trends. Our population hasn’t grown
       much. I don’t see an urgent need for housing.
      (Responding to comment above.) Vacancy rates do not vary a whole lot with housing
       demand. Rents increase with increased housing demand but vacancy rates do not
       change very much. If you see for-sale and for-rent signs, that doesn’t mean that there is
       not an extraordinary demand for housing.
      General Plan and the housing element is a statement of values of the community. It’s our
       moral obligation to provide our fair share of housing. Also, acknowledging that the
       housing shortage has evolved over many years and there is no way we are going to
       build our way out of it in 8 years.
      Can you explain the intersection between affordable housing and Section 8 housing?

       I am surprised that no one’s suggested rent control instead of building smaller and
        smaller shoe boxes.
       San Pablo Avenue has a lot of vacant commercial space. Maybe these landlords are
        holding their units vacant because they can’t get the rents they want.
       Does the rental price data reflect mom and pop who rent out a single family home or a
        new apartment building?
       Single family properties are exempt from rent control under State law.
       You can’t maintain affordability with rent stabilization because every time a tenant
        vacates, the unit rent goes to market-rate. You may want to look at something like a just-
        cause for eviction ordinance. A rent stabilization program would be pretty expensive to
        do in a small community. However, a just cause ordinance could assist tenants in
        providing some stability, especially tenants who have children in school where it would
        be disruptive if they had to move.
       How many units of El Cerrito’s 2007-2014 RHNA actually happened?
       Is the 398 units of the RHNA a minimum number?
       Is the 398 units a maximum number?
       Because our population has stayed the same since 1960, we are taking on the burden of
        providing housing for the Bay Area by accepting the 398 RHNA numbers.
       398 units spread over 8 years isn’t that much growth in a city with 10,000 housing units.
       Rent control tends to serve older and more stable tenants and is a disincentive for
        building rental housing. (Rent control) is why developers tend to build condos instead
        (of rental housing). Adding more housing stock, at whatever income level, is best
        approach to solving housing need.
       What is the site inventory about?
       I was a Planning Commission meeting where (City) staff told the Planning Commission
        that there was no longer a requirement for affordable housing (inclusionary housing).
        What requirement does the City have, if any, for affordable housing?
       What sort of measures or strategies are in the current plan and the new one to address
        meeting the lower income housing needs?
       If it’s cheaper to build a higher story building, why not just build a 20 story building?

Community Workshop, August 13, 2014
Following is a summary of input from this workshop:
      Residential energy efficiency policies/programs should focus on voluntary energy
       upgrades and promoting opportunities for rebates and other types of incentives.
      Request that City zoning and planning policies encourage alternative models of housing
       such as co-housing.
      Is there any way to track rental increases? Concerned about neighbors experiencing
       significant rent increases, such as 69% in one instance. Could the City do something
       about rent increases? If the rents go up all over the City, renters will have to move, there
       will be a large impact on people and on the City. People like me will have to relocate.
       Where do we go?
      Could the housing element address rent increases?
      Concerns about existing homeless persons around El Cerrito Creek and El Cerrito Plaza.
       It seems like homeless population is growing. Maybe related to Albany Bulb closure.
       How do we get on top of that? Does the housing element address that? Maybe we can be
       proactive.
      Does the City market itself to housing developers and to developers?
      Our experience with the local school district has been very good and I think we should
       use the fact that we have good schools to market the community.
       (Responding to comment above.) WCCUSD is a problem. People don’t have a good
       perception of the schools.
      More market-rate housing will help bring more revenue to the city through property
       taxes.
      What is the City doing regarding the vacation rental issue, i.e. VBRO, AirBnB?
      Concerned about Creekside Walk (approved residential project in the pipeline) and the
       flow of traffic.
      Want to see demographic data on income levels of residents of El Cerrito.
      If a city meets part of its RHNA during a cycle, how is that accounted for in the next
       cycle RHNA?
      We should help stabilize renter households.

       Don’t want to see changes in zoning in single family neighborhoods.
       City needs to fiscally responsible, look for other sources of funds, manage assets wisely.
       I want to age in this community, want to be closer to BART, in a more walkable
        neighborhood. I want other housing options such as co-housing close to BART.
In addition to comments received at workshops, written comments were submitted which
expressed concern for the housing stability of older residents who rent and tend to be on fixed
incomes in a time when rents are increasing significantly. Another resident offered co-housing
(currently supported by the Land Use Policy LU1.6 of the City’s General Plan) and “tiny
house”-style stand-alone dwelling units as potentially affordable solutions to the housing
shortage. The suggestion was also made that large, infill developments consider purchasing
conservation easements in nearby areas with available agricultural and open space. There was a
concern that the Climate Action Plan should specify that, for new residential development, the
City should specify that building materials and methods be used that can show a net climate
benefit.
2. Housing Needs Survey
As part of the 2015-2023 Housing Element Update, the City of El Cerrito developed an online
survey to gather feedback about community housing and to help ensure that the City’s Housing
Element reflects the vision and priorities of the El Cerrito community. The Housing Survey
included 12 questions that asked respondents about their current housing situation as well as
their views on El Cerrito’s housing issues more generally. The survey was publicized through
announcements at the Housing Element workshops, through the City’s website and through a
press release to local print and online media. There were 44 responses to the survey.

  Q12: Are there any other suggestions or comments you would like to share regarding
                           housing or other topics of interest to El Cerrito?
 No.   Responses
   1   More commercial areas! more cafes on san pablo. that's my dream.
   2   I would like to see more newer affordable single family homes and townhouses that are close
       to public transportation(BART) and stores ( Safeway complex and El Cerrito Plaza). El Cerrito
       is a beautiful city and I would love to be able to walk to more shops to fulfill my daily needs
   3   Housing isn't as much of a problem as is the lack of businesses. Especially along San Pablo
       between Central, Stockton, Moser, and Portero. How long will the old Safeway stay un-
       occupied? or the Guitar Center building? or the dozen or so vacant store fronts? We need to
       focus on local business development more.
   4   The single option questions are unnecessarily restrictive and will not produce rational results.
       Very poor design.
   5   Encourage in-law units on existing single residency sites vs more apartment/condo buildings.
       Taller residential building on San Pablo encourage and concentrate traffic.
   6   More walkability. It's already great, but could always be better. Encourage and support local
       business clusters to promote foot traffic and getting people out of their homes. Slow down cars
       like they do in Berkeley with all of those crazy concrete pylons.
   7   Please improve the middle and high school education. Thanks
   8   Mixed use housing is a smart choice in our small city.
3. Stakeholder Workshop
On November 20, 2014, staff hosted a stakeholder roundtable discussion on the Draft Housing
Element. Local public agencies, community organizations, and developers and realtors active in
the community were invited to participate and share their views. The meeting was attended by
one representative from Stege Sanitary District who received a presentation on the Draft
Housing Element and did not have any formal comment.
4. Public Review of Documents
Throughout the process of updating the Housing Element, the City posted relevant documents,
including presentation materials and draft documents on the website for easy download and
review by residents and interested parties.
As appropriate, the Housing Element has been revised to address public comments.

APPENDIX E: CONSISTENCY WITH STATE LAW
1. Consistency with Housing Element Law
The Housing Element is one of seven General Plan Elements required by the State of California.
Updated every eight years, this document serves as the guide for residential development and
addressing housing needs in the City of El Cerrito. Per State Housing Element law, the
document must:
          Outline a community’s housing production objectives;
          List policies and implementation programs to achieve local housing goals;
          Examine the need for housing resources in a community, focusing in particular on
           special needs populations;
          Identify adequate sites for the production of new housing serving various income levels;
          Analyze potential constraints to production; and
          Evaluate the Housing Element for consistency with other components of the General
           Plan.
Table E-1 summarizes these requirements and identifies the applicable sections in the Housing
Element where these requirements are addressed.

2. General Plan Consistency
Housing Element policies must be consistent with policies identified in other elements of the
General Plan. The policies and programs in this Element reflect the policy direction contained in
other parts of the General Plan, which was last updated in 1999. As portions of the General Plan
are amended in the future, this Housing Element will be reviewed to ensure that internal
consistency is maintained.
The 1999 General Plan contains several elements with policies related to housing. Policies and
the means for achieving consistency are summarized in Table E-2. The City will ensure
consistency between the Housing Element and General Plan policies through the following
actions:

                                    by a qualified biologist.
                       R1.1
                                    No new housing units are proposed in environmentally sensitive areas, and if
 Resources and
                                    development should occur, any loss of habitat will be fully compensated onsite. If
 Hazards
                                    off-site mitigation is necessary, it should occur within the El Cerrito planning area
                                    wherever possible.
                                    Encourage development patterns that minimize impacts on the City’s biological,
                                    visual and cultural resources, and integrate development with open space areas.
                       R1.3
                                    The updated Housing Element does not propose the development of housing in
                                    any environmentally sensitive areas.

                                    For development adjacent to creeks and major drainages, provide adequate
                                    building setbacks from creek banks, provision of access easements for creek
                                    maintenance purposes and for public access to creekside amenities, and creek
                                    improvements such as bank stabilization. Also, protect riparian vegetation
                                    outside the setback.
                     R1.9
                                    Any new housing units constructed adjacent to creeks and major drainages will
                                    require the necessary building setbacks regulated by the City, and special
                                    consideration for the natural vegetation in the area will be taken in to
                                    consideration.
                                    Control development on ridges to protect the form of the ridges and, in particular,
                                    by restricting development on ridgelines. Natural contours and vegetation on
                                    ridgelines should be maintained. Locate and design structures and other public
                                    and private improvements so as to minimize cut and fill areas that will impact
                                    public views, safety and surrounding uses, and avoid building profiles
                     R1.12          (silhouettes) being located above the ridgelines when viewed from public and
                                    designated public access areas.
                                    No new housing units developed in the City will be developed on ridgelines. All
                                    new units will be constructed in a way that minimizes cut and fill areas that could
                                    potentially impact public views, safety, and surrounding uses.
                                    Preserve prominent views of visual resources and the bay, and consider visual
                                    access and view corridors when reviewing development proposals. Require
                                    assessment of critical public views, ridgelines, scenic overlooks, bay vista points,
                                    significant knolls, stands of trees, rock outcrops, and major visual features as
                                    part of the project review process to assure that projects protect natural
                     R1.13          resources through proper site planning, building design and landscaping, and
                                    that public access is provided if possible to vista points.
                                    An assessment of critical public views will be taken into consideration in every
                                    housing-units proposal. All prominent views of visual resources and the bay will
                                    be preserved.
                                    Evaluate new development on sites that may have involved hazardous materials
                                    (such as older fill sites, historical auto service uses, industrial uses, or areas
                                    where hazardous materials may have been used) prior to development
                                    approvals.
                     H1.9
                                    All new housing units proposed by the updated Housing Element will comply with
                                    the City’s Building Code and will be inspected by the City’s Building Inspector for
                                    compliance with all geological hazards prevention standards
                                    Flood Hazards. Assure existing and new structures are designed to protect
                                    people and property from the threat of potential flooding. New development shall
                     H1.15
                                    be designed to provide protection from potential impacts of flooding during the
                                    “1% chance” or “100-year” flood.
                                    In order to maintain unobstructed drainage courses, existing laws prohibiting the
                                    dumping of debris, fill or other waste materials into creeks and channels, and the
                                    littering of garbage should be strictly enforced. The City will also continue to
                     H1.16
                                    maintain a high level of maintenance for its storm drainage facilities. New
                                    developments will be carefully reviewed to insure that adequate storm drain
                                    facilities are available both on and off the site.

calculated at 30% of the household’s adjusted gross monthly income (GMI). “Section 8”
includes programs for new construction, existing housing, and substantial or moderate
housing rehabilitation.
Shared Living. The occupancy of a dwelling unit by persons of more than one family in
order to reduce housing expenses and provide social contact, mutual support, and
assistance. Shared living facilities serving six or fewer persons are permitted in all
residential districts by §1566.3 of the California Health and Safety Code.
Single-Family Dwelling, Attached. A dwelling unit occupied or intended for
occupancy by only one household that is structurally connected with at least one other
such dwelling unit. (See “Townhouse.”)
Single-Family Dwelling, Detached. A dwelling unit occupied or intended for
occupancy by only one household that is structurally independent from any other such
dwelling unit or structure intended for residential or other use. (See “Family.”)
Single Room Occupancy (SRO). A single room, typically 80-250 square feet, with a sink
and closet, but which requires the occupant to share a communal bathroom, shower, and
kitchen.
Subsidize. To assist by payment of a sum of money or by the granting to terms or favors
that reduces the need for monetary expenditures. Housing subsidies may take the forms
or mortgage interest deductions or tax credits from federal and/or state income taxes,
sale or lease at less than market value of land to be used for the construction of housing,
payments to supplement a minimum affordable rent, and the like.
Substandard Housing. Residential dwellings that, because of their physical condition,
do not provide safe and sanitary housing.
Supportive Housing. Housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the
target population as defined in California Health and Safety Code Section 53260(d), and
that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive housing resident in
retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her
ability to live and, when possible, work in the community. “Target population" means
adults with low incomes having one or more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV

or A IDS, substance abuse, or other chronic health conditions, or individuals eligible for
services provided under the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act and
may, among other populations, include families with children, elderly persons, young
adults aging out of the foster care system, individuals exiting from institutional settings,
veterans, or homeless people. [California Health and Safety Code Sections 50675.14(b)
and 53260(d)]
Target Areas. Specifically designated sections of the community where loans and grants
are made to bring about a specific outcome, such as the rehabilitation of housing
affordable by Very-Low and Low-income households.
Tax Increment. Additional tax revenues that result form increases in property values
within a redevelopment area. State law permits the tax increment to be earmarked for
redevelopment purposes but requires at least 20% to be used to increase and improve
the community’s supply of very low and low income housing. Pursuant to changes in
State law effective 2011, the collection of tax increment revenue for new redevelopment
and affordable housing projects is no longer permitted.
Tenure. A housing unit is “owned” if the owner or co-owner lives in the unit, even if it
is “owned only if it is mortgaged or not fully paid for. A cooperative or condominium
unit is “owned only if the owner or co-owner lives in it. All other occupied units are
classified as “rented,” including units rented for cash rent and those occupied without
payment of cash rent.
Townhouse. A townhouse is a dwelling unit located in a group of three (3) or more
attached dwelling units with no dwelling unit located above or below another and with
each dwelling unit having its own exterior entrance.
Transitional Housing. Shelter provide to the homeless for an extend period, often as
long as 18 months, and generally integrated with other social services and counseling
programs to assist in the transition to self sufficiency through the acquisition of a stable
income and permanent housing. (See “homeless” and “Emergency Shelter.”)
Undevelopable. Specific areas where topographic, geologic, and/or superficial soil
conditions indicate a significant danger to future occupants and a liability to the City are
designated as “undevelopable” by the City.

GROWTH MANAGEMENT
A. Introduction
The Growth Management Element establishes a comprehensive, long-range
program that matches demand for public facilities generated by new development
with policies and standards for traffic level of service (LOS) and performance
criteria for fire, police, parks, sanitary facilities, water supplies, and flood control.
The Growth Management Element is concerned with maintaining defined urban
service levels; it is not intended to limit growth or to direct growth into certain areas
of the community on a priority basis. Most importantly, the Element’s policies
ensure that new development impacts that threaten to degrade established traffic
performance or public service thresholds are mitigated through project
modification, capital improvement programming, or contributions to
improvements.
This element satisfies the obligations established under Contra Costa County’s 2004
Growth Management Program (referred to as Measure J). Measure J (2004) is a 25-
year extension of the previous Measure C Contra Costa Transportation
Improvement and Growth management Program approved by the voters in 1998.
In addition to the public facilities and services identified within this Growth
Management Element, Chapter 3: Circulation Element, establishes goals, policies,
and programs for traffic services, and roadway improvements, bicycle and
pedestrian movement, and Transportation Demand Management (TDM) programs.
Chapter 10: Housing Element, includes an expanded list of policies and programs
that describe the City’s efforts to foster access to safe, quality housing for people of
all income levels.
Measure J
In November 2004, the voters of Contra Costa County approved Measure J, thereby
approving both Transportation Improvement and Growth Management Programs
and authorizing a 0.5% sales tax to fund associated improvement projects. In order
to receive local street maintenance and improvement funds under Measure J, the
County and each city in the county is required to develop a Growth Management
Element as part of their General Plan. The overall intent of the Measure J program
is:
•     To establish a long-range program matching the demand for multi-modal
      transportation facilities to serve new development with plans, capital
      improvement programs, and development impact mitigation programs; and,
•     To ensure that growth takes place in a manner that will ensure protection of
      health, safety and welfare of both existing and future residents of Contra Costa
      County; and,
                                                                Community Development and Design 4-51

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     •    The Urban Limit Line is intended to promote compact urban development
                          patterns and restrict the extension of infrastructure into areas where urban
                          development is not planned.
                     In order to receive funding under Measure J, each land use agency within Contra
                     Costa County must adopt and implement a Growth Management Element that
                     substantially complies with the Contra Costa County Transportation Authority
                     Model Growth Management Element. The previous requirements of Measure C to
                     receive funding required each land use agency within Contra Costa County to
                     establish policies and standards for traffic levels of service (LOS) and set
                     performance standards for fire, police, parks, sanitary facilities, water, and flood
                     control to generally ensure that adopted standards for public facilities are maintained
                     as the community grows. Although Measure J does not require these policies and
                     standards, they remain adopted.
                     El Cerrito Growth Management
                     While this element satisfies obligations established under Measure J, the City has
                     clearly established its commitment to managing new development in a manner that
                     not only ensures adequate public facilities, but also protects the quality of life
                     enjoyed by residents. Growth management issues are discussed in detail in various
                     other elements of this General Plan, including Land Use, Transportation and
                     Circulation, and the Public Facilities and Services and Resources and Hazards
                     chapters. Policies in those other Elements/Chapters are noted in the Goal and
                     Policy tables.
                     Organization of the Element
                     The Growth Management Element is organized into three main sections. This
                     Introduction provides an overview of growth management topics, a description of
                     the organization of the element, and requirements for the element as specified under
                     State law. A Goals and Policies section provides specific policy guidance for growth
                     management topics.
                     Consistency with State Law
                     Authorization for Growth Management Element
                     California Government Code Section 65302 does not require a Growth
                     Management Element to be included in a General Plan. However, Section 65303
                     states the following:
                          "The general plan may include any other elements or address any other subjects which, in
                          the judgment of the legislative body, relate to the physical development of the City."
                     This element has been prepared in conformance with all mandatory requirements of
                     State law and also satisfies the planning obligations established under Contra Costa
                     County’s Measure J.

                                                                                     EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
Relationship to Other Elements of the General Plan
This Growth Management Element is closely related to the Land Use and
Transportation & Circulation Elements. This Growth Management Element is
intended to incorporate the requirements set forth in Measure J. It is also related to
the Public Facilities and Services and Resources and Hazards chapters of the
General Plan.
The Growth Management Element is not intended to supersede the goals or
policies of the other elements of the General Plan. When other elements of the
General Plan are updated, it may be appropriate to amend the Growth Management
Element to ensure an internally consistent and comprehensive set of City goals,
policies and actions.
Urban Limit Line
As part of the 1996 Contra Costa County General Plan, the County delineated an
Urban Limit Line (ULL) to identify areas appropriate for urban expansion. The
Measure J (2004) Transportation Expenditure Plan included a Growth Management
Plan (GMP) which contained an urban limit line component mandating that local
jurisdictions adopt and continuously comply with a voter approved ULL. Measure L
(2006) the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisor ULL was passed by a majority
of voters in Contra Costa at the November 7, 2006 election. The Measure L ULL
was also approved by a majority of voters in the City at the November 7, 2006
election. The City adopted the Measure L ULL by resolution on October 16, 2006.
The adoption of the Measure L ULL specifically complies with the purposes of
Measure J as follows:
•    Ensure the preservation and protection of identified non-urban land, including
     agricultural, open space, parkland, and other areas, by establishing a line beyond
     which urban development is prohibited; and
•    Link land use decisions with the transportation investments in Measure J by
     channeling future growth to locations more suitable for urban development;
     and
•    Ensure that land use policies within the voter Approved Urban Limit Line
     effectively promote appropriate development that accommodates the area’s
     projects housing and job needs in the future.
Housing Options
Consistent with the requirements of Measure J and state Law, the City’s Housing
Element establishes a range of goals, policies and programs that outline the City’s
efforts to support balanced housing development in the City. Measure J expands
upon the program requirements identified in the Prior Measure C, and requires
ongoing reporting to CCTA of the City’s progress in implementing the goals and
objectives listed in the Housing Element.
                                                              Community Development and Design 4-53

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     California Government Code Sec. 65400(b) requires the preparation of the annual
                     report summarizing the City’s progress implementing the Housing Element of the
                     General Plan, and submitting copies of the report to the Contra Costa
                     Transportation Authority biennially as part of the Authority’s Growth Management
                     Plan Compliance Checklist.
                     Measure J requires that the annual report on the implementation of the Housing
                     element of the General Plan be submitted to CCTA every other year. The report
                     must include the specified housing reporting period and must be submitted to
                     CCTA in one of the following formats:
                     •    The number of housing units approved, constructed or occupied in the City
                          since the beginning of the reporting period, compared to the average number of
                          units needed annually to meet the fair share regional housing need;
                     •    A description of how the City’s adopted land use, housing, and regulatory plans
                          and programs have provided sufficient opportunities for and removed undue
                          constraints to the achievement of the City’s fair share regional housing need; or
                     •    A description of how the plans and policies of the General Plan and the land
                          use regulations of the Zoning Ordinance facilitate the improvement and
                          development of the City’s fair share regional housing need.
                     B. Traffic Service Standards
                     Projected increases in travel have the capacity to influence disproportionately the
                     shape and character of El Cerrito, if traffic congestion and improvements to the
                     travel network are not managed through local and cooperative regional policy
                     implementation. The Land Use Element (Community Development and Design
                     chapter) establishes the timing and density of future growth within the city. The
                     Transportation Element (Transportation and Circulation chapter), supplemented by
                     the Growth Management Element's defined levels of intersection performance and
                     policies for mitigation of traffic impacts, are useful sources of options and strategies
                     to influence regional growth patterns that extend their influence beyond El Cerrito's
                     borders.
                     Routes of Regional Significance
                     Measure "C" required that all freeways and selected arterials in the county be
                     designated as Routes of Regional Significance, or "regional routes." These roadways
                     experience extreme levels of congestion, and carry significant levels of through-
                     traffic to other parts of the Bay Area. There are many obstacles to improving
                     conditions on these regional routes, including the high cost of expanding physical
                     capacity and the uncertain role of outside agencies' funding decisions. Within El
                     Cerrito, these regional routes include Interstate Freeway 80, San Pablo Avenue, and
                     Cutting Boulevard.
4-54 Community Development and Design

                                                                                 EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
Characteristics of El Cerrito's Regional Routes
Interstate Freeway 80
The freeway consists of three lanes in each direction through West County.
Interchanges serving El Cerrito include Central Avenue, Carlson Boulevard, Potrero
Avenue, and Cutting Boulevard. Interstate 80 is the most congested of all regional
routes. Congestion extends from Pinole Valley Road south to Central Avenue
during the AM peak period and from Central to the Carquinez Bridge tollbooth
during the PM peak period. Congestion on I-80 causes high traffic volumes and
consequent delays on San Pablo Avenue, the primary parallel route.
I-80 has one of the highest percentages of through traffic in the West County
corridor, with 52% of AM peak hour direction travel, measured at the Carquinez
Bridge. Ninety-two percent of that traffic originates in Napa and Solano counties.
Truck traffic, which contributes to travel delay, makes up 9% of total AM
Eastbound (non-peak direction) volume, much of which enters or leaves the
freeway on the San Pablo Avenue corridor.
The West Contra Costa County Action Plan identifies a number of improvements
to the I-80 corridor needed to alleviate the expected breakdown of capacity. Those
improvements of most significance to El Cerrito include:
•    HOV interchange at Cutting Boulevard to serve the El Cerrito Del Norte
     BART station (constructed)
•    Parallel route improvements on San Pablo Avenue including signal upgrades
     (on-going)
•    Transportation Management Plan to include transit, ride sharing, public
     information/marketing and vehicle monitoring.
San Pablo Avenue
In El Cerrito, San Pablo Avenue is an urbanized thoroughfare between the southern
City limits at Cerrito Creek near Carlson Boulevard to the northern city limits just
south of McDonald Avenue with two lanes in each direction. At most intersections
there are left turns operating with left-turn signal phasing. The speed limit is 30
MPH. Average daily traffic volumes on San Pablo Avenue are greatest at its
southerly extreme in the County. Near Cutting Boulevard, the highest average daily
volume is 29,900 vehicles. During the AM peak period, the highest volumes occur
near Potrero Avenue at 2,275 vehicles per hour. The highest PM peak hour period
volumes occur near Barrett Avenue in Richmond, and frequently cause traffic
backup into El Cerrito.
The San Pablo Avenue Corridor has been studied on a regional and local basis to
determine the improvements necessary to maintain the routes as a parallel to I-80
and to serve locally approved uses. Coordination of improvements is difficult given
the number of jurisdictions through which the street passes, and variety of volumes
and functions that it serves. Alameda and Contra Costa counties are currently
installing various improvements along San Pablo Avenue to improve inter-
jurisdictional and intra-jurisdictional signal coordination.
                                                             Community Development and Design 4-55

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                      Cutting Boulevard
                      The portion of Cutting Boulevard in El Cerrito designated as a regional route
                      extends from Key Boulevard to the westerly city limit. It links San Pablo Avenue
                      and the Del Norte BART station to I-80. The road encompasses two lanes in each
                      direction with improved medians and left-turn pockets, except for a segment which
                      is one-way westbound between the BART station and San Pablo Avenue. Most
                      significant congestion occurs at the intersection of San Pablo Avenue and Cutting
                      Boulevard in El Cerrito.
                      Regional Action Plans
                      Local jurisdictions participated in the development of programs to control regional
                      traffic impacts on these routes through a series of Action Plans approved by one of
                      the Regional Transportation Planning Committees created under Measure C. El
                      Cerrito has been working closely with the WCCTAC (West Contra Costa County
                      Traffic Advisory Committee) to work on an update of the 2000 and 2009 action
                      plans for the west county area. Once approved, the updated Action Plan will be
                      combined by CCTA with other regionally recommended Action Plans to create a
                      countywide comprehensive transportation plan. The City recognizes that the success
                      of attaining Action Plan objectives depends upon participation of other jurisdictions
                      in both planning and funding of necessary improvements.
                      Basic Routes
                      All roads not indicated on the map of Routes of Regional Significance are Basic
                      Routes. The Growth Management Element is required to assess the operating
                      capacity of signalized intersections on Basic Routes, estimate future service impacts
                      resulting from significant, foreseeable increases in home building and job-formation,
                      according to the city's General Plan land use and housing policies.
                      Level of Service – General
                      The Transportation Element of the El Cerrito General Plan classifies vehicle routes
                      according to the character of surrounding development and their linkage to sources
                      of traffic congestion from other jurisdictions. Table 4-4 describes the city's Basic
                      Route signal controlled intersections and the minimum service level at which the
                      intersection is expected to operate based on future development activity:

       Level of Service and Future Land Use
       Nearly all significant new increments of housing and employment will occur on
       parcels located within the San Pablo Avenue corridor, or in joint use with BART
       station facilities. Expanding jobs and housing opportunity inside El Cerrito's
       borders will not necessarily eliminate commute travel to and from the region.
       However, it will offer an alternative to the commuter lifestyle and enhance options
       for El Cerrito's economic development that do not burden the regional roadway
       network.
       While most of the direct traffic impact of local land use intensification will fall upon
       Regional Routes such as San Pablo Avenue and Cutting Boulevard, it is equally
       important that such activity not burden the basic route system and degrade the
       minimum service levels for signalized intersections described above.
       The city is committed, as part of the region-wide effort to reduce traffic congestion
       and improve the efficiency and safety of its local street system for all users including
       pedestrians and bicyclists, to monitor traffic conditions on a systematic basis and
       develop programs to maintain established service standards. El Cerrito is a "mature"
       city with only limited growth potential. However, even the relatively small increment
       of growth potential described in this Element can burden local and regional
       transportation facilities without a prescribed means of measurement and defined
       mitigation programs.
       C. Urban Service Performance Standards
       Park and Recreation Facilities
       Service Function
       The City of El Cerrito provides a rich diversity of parks and recreational
       opportunities. Parklands include approximately 32 acres of City-owned parks, 100
       acres of City-owned open space used for recreation and conservation purposes, 23
       acres of other City-maintained recreation facilities, and 27 acres of School District-
       owned and maintained recreation areas. More details are provided in Chapter 6.
       Service Standard
       Five (5) acres of publicly owned parkland for each 1,000 residents.
       Fire Suppression and Related Emergency Services
       Service Function
       The El Cerrito Fire Department provides first response to structural, vehicular and
       wildland fires, medical emergencies, hazardous materials incidents and natural
       disasters. The Department’s ability to meet these needs is facilitated through active
                                                                     Community Development and Design 4-57

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     participation with Richmond, Kensington, and the West County fire departments in
                     an automatic response agreement that uses the combined resources of all four
                     agencies to serve these needs irrespective of jurisdictional lines. The departments
                     share the costs of dispatch and training services and have established common
                     standards for staffing, apparatus and equipment.
                     Service Standard
                     The interagency agreement specifies the following response protocol for all
                     emergency service requests:
                     •    Maximum response time for first engine arrival of six (6) minutes including one
                          (1) minute dispatch time and three (3) minute-travel time from responding
                          station.
                     •    Three (3) person engine company is minimum response.
                     •    Minimum training level of responders shall be Firefighter 1 and Emergency
                          Medical Technician 1.
                     Police Emergency Services
                     Service Function
                     The El Cerrito Police Department’s mission is to respond to requests for law
                     enforcement emergency services, deter criminal activity, investigate crimes against
                     persons and property and undertake proactive programs to reduce the opportunity
                     for criminal activity. The department also acts proactively to reduce dangerous
                     motor vehicle operating practices and offers community education outreach
                     programs about personal and neighborhood security.
                     Service Standard
                     The Police Department is committed to maintaining a level of personnel and capital
                     equipment for first-unit response in three (3) minutes to requests for emergency
                     service. The City's resources alone are insufficient to meet the multiplicity of
                     demands upon a modem police agency. Hence, the Department contracts with the
                     City of Richmond for emergency dispatching, and with various state and county
                     agencies for specialized investigative support services.
                     Sanitary Sewer and Treatment Services
                     Service Function
                     Two agencies work together to serve El Cerrito’s sanitary sewer needs. Stege
                     Sanitary District provides the underground lines leading from customer discharge
                     sites to the regional treatment plant. That plant, operated by the East Bay Municipal
                     Utility District at Point Isabel, provides tertiary level treatment to RWQCB
                     standards for discharge to the Bay.
                     Service Standard
                     Service capacity planning is based on a 130-gallon daily increment per person.

Domestic Water Services
Service Function
East Bay Municipal Utility District provides domestic water service to residential
and institutional customers in the city. Past droughts, which curtailed water service
in some areas, have reminded people of the need to conserve water whenever
possible.
Service Standard
250 gallons/day for each residential household to 4 (four) persons +62 gallons for
each additional person in the household. 90% of 1986 use for commercial
connections and 95% of 1986 use for institutional uses, to be reevaluated upon
improvement in prevailing drought conditions.
Flood Control
Service Function
Flood hazards arise from natural rainstorms, failure of water storage facilities, and
from the secondary effects of landslides. Because the watersheds in El Cerrito's
foothills are relatively small, risk of flood damage through the sudden release of
accumulated water behind a collapsed mass of landslide debris is also small. The
greatest flood hazard risk is posed by the current condition of the storm drain
system that is under study for long term and comprehensive remediation.
Only a small portion of Cerrito Creek is subject to inundation in the 1% (100 year
event). Property damage from such an event is predictable, but would be confined
to isolated locations in the flood path. The Contra Costa County Flood Control
District establishes maintenance and development standards in the floodway. The
City has also established restrictive development policies in its Municipal Code as a
condition of continued eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program.
Service Standard
Containment of the 100-year flood event according to the federal Flood Insurance
Rate Maps. Continued restriction on construction within flood hazard zones
through establishment of minimum floor level elevations above the projected 100-
year flood event level, as established by the Flood Control District.

IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
The following is a summary of the major tools available to the City for
implementation of the policies in this chapter, Community Development and
Design.
     1. Beautification Program
A city beautification program is excellent way to increase public awareness and
participation in creating good design and quality spaces. City beautification
programs can take many forms and involve both the public and private sectors.
They can include; design awards for building design and landscaping, yard
maintenance; landscape planting programs such as flower planting, street tree
planting; and, public art projects or other civic improvement programs. They may
also include the development of public scenic turnouts, rest stops, and overlooks to
take advantage of views and vistas from the hillsides. Many city beautification
programs are sponsored jointly by the city government and local civic organizations
to promote civic pride while enhancing the physical appearance.
     2. Building Code
El Cerrito should consider adopting amendments to the Building Code that
promote energy efficiency and better uses of natural resources. This could be the
part of the charge to a citizen task force that looks into possible ways of
encouraging El Cerrito to agree upon and adhere to applicable principles of
sustainable development.
     3. Capital Improvement Program
The Capital Improvement Program (CIP) is a compilation of the capital
improvements planned for construction over the next five years in El Cerrito. It
includes cost estimates, the phasing of specific improvements and associated costs
and methods with which specific improvements will be financed. The City should
continue to conduct annual reviews of the CIP and add money for transportation,
infrastructure, and public facility improvements as funding sources are identified.
The CIP also provides the basis for planning for and funding of new community
buildings and facilities.
     4. CEQA Review
The City should ensure that the CEQA review process identifies impacts of new
development upon the transportation system, utilities, and public facilities.
     5. City Entry Design Program
The City can sponsor the design and construction of entry monuments and other
landscape improvement projects to improve the appearance of city streets. These
landscape improvement projects can also be developed in cooperation with civic
organizations or sponsored by local business to create new entry signs, monuments,
and landmarks at major entry points to El Cerrito.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                          6. Creek Restoration
                     The City may contribute through its storm drainage improvement program, or seek
                     funding from other agencies or private sources, to restore various segments to
                     creeks or other streets (on surface or through removal of pipes) and restoration of
                     riparian habitats.
                          7. Design Guidelines
                     Design guidelines are a tool for ensuring that development is compatible with the
                     surrounding area and that it functions well for the community. To the extent
                     possible, the guidelines should be specific: guidelines that are quantifiable should be
                     considered for incorporation into the development regulations.
                          8. Development Incentives
                     Providing development incentives to developers and property owners can influence
                     good community design. Development incentives can be in the form of density and
                     development intensity bonuses, reduced development standards (i.e., reductions in
                     parking requirements, height restrictions, setbacks, etc.). Incentives may be granted
                     where they promote closer adherence to City objectives by providing desirable
                     features, such as exceptional design, creative design of off-street parking,
                     enhancements to public amenities, environmental benefits, such as creek
                     restoration, and similar benefits to the community.
                          9. Development Regulations (zoning)
                     The development regulations, primarily the zoning regulations and the subdivision
                     ordinance, provide the standards for development, prescribe allowable uses, contain
                     specific incentive provisions, and include other standards and procedures related to
                     approval of development projects.
                          10. Development Review
                     The development review process includes discretionary review by the Planning
                     Commission and the Design Review Board, based on consideration of General Plan
                     objectives and policies, and criteria established by the zoning and subdivision
                     ordinances and other city regulations and adopted guidelines. Most discretionary
                     actions are subject to the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act
                     (CEQA). The development review process also includes administrative review of
                     projects to verify compliance with Planning Commission and Design Review Board
                     requirements, as well as standards set by the City through adoption of building and
                     fire codes, engineering standards, and other regulations and ordinances.
                     Development review should be used to assess the impact of new development on
                     the demand for transportation and public facility improvements and to implement
                     mitigation measures and other mechanisms to help finance needed improvements.
                          11. Economic Development Strategy
                     The city should maintain a strategy to retain and attract businesses. This strategy
                     should be reviewed frequently to ensure that it reflects current economic and
                     business trends and makes use of the city’s advantages as a business location. The

city staff, elected officials, and business organizations should then actively market
the city as a location for desirable types of businesses.
     12. Fiscal Impact Assessment
The City should consider development of a fiscal impact assessment process that
would identify the economic and fiscal impacts of new development projects. The
process should establish size thresholds that trigger the assessment, integrate the
assessment with CEQA review, and ensure that the fiscal impact assessment is not
an undue burden on economic development of the City. Also see Implementation
Measures in Chapter 6 on a Public Facilities Fee and Traffic Impact Fee.
     13. General Plan Consistency Review
Review all public projects for consistency with the General Plan as early as possible
in order to minimize wasted effort on projects deemed not to be in conformance.
     14. Grant Funds
The City should determine whether grant funds are available from federal or state
sources for restoring creeks, preparing design guidelines to reduce crime, and
developing guidelines for pedestrian friendly areas near either or both BART
stations.
     15. Historical Inventory and Designation
The City should initiate, or work with a local civic group to initiate, an inventory of
structures or sites that may have architectural, historical, archeological, or cultural
significance to the community. The City should then consider action to list the
most significant structures or sites on the California Register of Historical Resources
and the National Register of Historic Places.
     16. Housing Program
The city’s housing program consists of those actions necessary to achieve the
policies of the General Plan and the goals of the Housing Element. The housing
program should monitor progress toward achieving goals to ensure that suitable
land and incentives are available. The housing program also includes the
responsibilities of the Housing Functions Successor Agency to support affordable
housing goals.
     17. Intergovernmental Coordination
The City should coordinate with adjacent jurisdictions, the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission, Contra Costa County, AC Transit, BART, Caltrans,
and other applicable agencies. The Contra Costa County Transportation Authority
(CCTA) West County Action Plan for Routes of Regional Significance defines a
regional vision for Hercules, Pinole, San Pablo, Richmond, and El Cerrito. This
document defines many of the City’s positions with respect to regional
transportation improvements.
In addition to, and in support of, these regional key items, the following are City of
El Cerrito interagency coordination positions:
                                                              Community Development and Design 4-71

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     a.   As opportunities present themselves, improve freeway access to El Cerrito,
                          particularly around the Del Norte area and at the Central Avenue interchange.
                     b. Oppose transportation projects that would diminish access to Interstate 80
                          from El Cerrito.
                     c.   Oppose capacity enhancements to San Pablo Avenue except when the
                          improvements serve local traffic and do not compromise bus, pedestrian and
                          bicycle travel.
                     d. Support physical enhancements to San Pablo Avenue to make it a transit and
                          pedestrian friendly multi-modal street.
                     In addition to the above, the City should work with Caltrans to install adequate
                     highway landscaping improvements along I-80.
                          18. Joint Watershed Goals
                     In 1995 the cities of El Cerrito, Albany, Berkeley and Richmond, the East Bay
                     Regional Park district, and the University of California at Berkeley, endorsed a goals
                     statement expressing mutual intentions to restore creeks to natural conditions, to
                     make use of creek corridors for pedestrian and bicycle transportation purposes, to
                     assure adequate flow of freshwater for nourishment of creeks, and to promote
                     public awareness of the value of healthy watersheds. The statement includes a
                     mutual agreement to seek opportunities for grants and other cooperative efforts.
                          19. Parking Districts
                     Parking districts can be formed by local property owners to help finance needed
                     parking in impacted commercial areas. Parking districts provide for centralized
                     parking lots and parking structures that allow participants to build and rehabilitate
                     existing buildings at a higher intensity of development.
                          20. Public Facilities Fee
                     The City should consider adopting a citywide public facilities impact fee ordinance,
                     under the requirements of the applicable laws, to fund new community and public
                     facilities, including public safety facilities, required to serve new residents and
                     employees in the City.
                          21. Redevelopment Program
                     In support of its economic development strategy, the City may choose to pursue
                     post-Redevelopment Dissolution tools that may become available to attract and
                     retain desirable commercial and residential development, and provide supportive
                     public improvements.
                          22. Sign Ordinance
                     The sign ordinance is a tool to regulate the appearance, size, and location of signs in
                     the City of El Cerrito. Well-designed signs contribute to the overall visual quality of
                     the built environment by reducing clutter as well as helping in way-finding and
                     locating business and other activities.

                                                                                    EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
     23. Special Districts
Special districts can be formed by local property owner to help finance desired
neighborhood improvements including street lighting, streetscape enhancements,
and landscaping improvements.
     24. Specific Plans
Certain areas of the city need to be planned comprehensively, but in more detail
than can be done in a general plan. A specific plan can integrate land use, design,
transportation, utilities and other issues into an action strategy.
The Draft San Pablo Avenue Specific Plan is currently being developed to address
planning needs in the San Pablo Avenue corridor. As conditions change and as
development proposals come forward, additional areas of the City may also need
more-detailed planning efforts.
     25. Street Tree Program
A citywide street tree planting program can dramatically enhance neighborhood
streets, increase property values, and improve the overall appearance of the city.
The city should continue its street tree planting program by offering free street trees
to any resident or business in the City.
     26. Streetscape Improvement Program
Many of the commercial streets in El Cerrito can be improved with a concerted
effort to provide new improvements to make the right-of-way more attractive and
pedestrian friendly environments. The City should continue efforts to make
streetscape improvements on San Pablo Avenue and other major arterial streets in
the City.
     27. Traffic Impact Fee
To help avoid public costs of traffic impacts, the City should consider collecting a
traffic impact fee from developers of projects, citywide. Fee payments would fund
transportation improvements to mitigate the traffic impacts of new development.
The traffic impact fee would be in-lieu of the off-site mitigation requirements, but
would not replace the developer’s responsibility for frontage improvements. The
traffic impact fee may be used to fund roadway extensions, intersection
improvements, safety improvements, or improvements and amenities to pedestrian,
bicycle or transit facilities.
     28. Travel Demand Management (TDM)
Support and promote TDM measures to reduce the percentage of person trips made
by automobile and to reduce the annual vehicle miles of travel. Reduce the
percentage of trips made by automobile and provide the opportunity and facilities to
divert trips from automobiles to other modes. Encourage small businesses in areas
of employment concentration to form cooperatives that can collectively provide
effective TDM options to employees.
     29. Underground Utility Districts
                                                                Community Development and Design 4-73

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     Creating underground utility districts is a way of financing undergrounding of
                     overhead utility lines. This process can speed up the process of removing overhead
                     utility lines along selected streets.

CHAPTER 4 COMMUNITY
                                 DEVELOPMENT AND
                                 DESIGN
The Community Development and Design Chapter is extremely important because
it, together with the Transportation and Circulation Chapter, provides the
foundation for growth on which the other chapters are based. This chapter includes
the state-mandated land use and housing elements, as well as the county-required
Growth Management Element. Community design, not a required topic, is also
included because of the importance the residents of El Cerrito place on improving
the quality of development.
This chapter is divided into the following subsections:
• Land Use
• Community Design
• Housing
• Growth Management
LAND USE
Land use goals and policies establish the overall type and location of activities, while
the community design goals and policies establish the “quality” of those places that
contain or facilitate the activities. Land use is also closely related to housing and
growth management because both have spatial implications.
A. Setting
Uses of Land
The land area within the city limits of El Cerrito is approximately 2,386 acres or
about 3.7 square miles, including vacant land and rights-of-way. Of this total, 1,193
acres are in residential uses. The city has approximately 8,537 tax assessor’s parcels.
Residential
El Cerrito has a predominantly residential pattern of land use. Multiple family
dwellings are concentrated along both sides of the BART right-of-way and west of
San Pablo Avenue near Central Avenue. Elsewhere, single-family homes spread
eastward into the hills and westward beyond I-80 into a small area on either side of
Potrero Avenue. Within these residential neighborhoods are support facilities such
as schools, parks, recreation facilities, and open space.
Almost 50 percent of the land area, or 1,193 acres, of El Cerrito is used for
residential purposes. Of this total, 1,098 acres are occupied by single-family houses;
25 acres by duplexes, 69 acres by multifamily units, and 1 acre by hotels, motels,
group housing, and trailer park units. The significant residential activity since the

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     last general plan has been continued infill of single-family lots and major apartment
                     development such as Del Norte Place, Civic Plaza, and El Cerrito Royale.
                     Commercial
                     Approximately 5 percent of the land area, or 113 acres, of El Cerrito is used for
                     commercial purposes. Of this, 84 acres are used for retail, residential, and
                     entertainment purposes, 8 acres for offices, 13 acres for auto services and sales, and
                     8 acres for wholesale and manufacturing purposes. Some significant changes that
                     have recently taken place include the new Target store, Del Norte Marketplace, and
                     conversion of some automobile-oriented uses to retail uses.
                     Commercial development is almost exclusively concentrated along the San Pablo
                     Avenue corridor with the greatest concentrations at the El Cerrito Plaza, the
                     intersection of San Pablo and Moeser, and the Del Norte area. Region-serving retail
                     facilities (Home Depot, Target, and Honda) are primarily located in the northern
                     part of the corridor and at El Cerrito Plaza (although much less region-serving since
                     the departure of the Emporium) along the city’s southern boundary. Two
                     neighborhood commercial centers are located on Fairmount Avenue between
                     Colusa and Ramona and on Stockton between Ashbury and Everett.
                     Commercial office uses are located in the commercial corridor along San Pablo
                     Avenue, in and adjacent to El Cerrito Plaza, and in the two neighborhood
                     commercial areas (primarily in the Stockton-Norvell neighborhood, which contains
                     several medical offices).
                     As noted above, the commercial land-use category also includes automobile and
                     industrial uses. These include several automotive-related uses along San Pablo
                     Avenue, a lumber mill on Schmidt Lane, and a sheet metal processing plant on
                     Kearney Street near Madison.
                     Institutional
                     Institutional uses consume 116 acres, or approximately 5 percent of the land area, of
                     El Cerrito. Of this total, school and childcare facilities account for 48 acres,
                     government and utilities for 47 acres, and other institutions for 21 acres. In recent
                     years the only significant change has been the conversion of a portion of the Madera
                     School site to residential uses. Chapter 6 provides a more complete description of
                     institutional uses.
                     Recreational/Open Space
                     Approximately 16 percent of the land area, or 379 acres, of El Cerrito is used for
                     recreational and open space purposes. Of this total, 181 acres are in public parks or
                     recreational facilities, 33 acres in utility-owned open space, and 165 acres in private
                     recreational facilities or open space. Open space areas are located throughout the
                     city. Major areas within the city include the Mira Vista Country Club in the
                     northeastern portion of the city, the Hillside Natural Area located near the center of
                     the city, and several parks and playgrounds at schools (see Chapter 6).

                                                                                     EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
Vacant Land
As noted above, vacant land accounts for 124 acres, or approximately 5 percent of
the land area, in El Cerrito. This low inventory of vacant land reflects the city’s
maturity as it approaches build-out. This amount of developable vacant land has
decreased in recent years due to the gradual infill of scattered sites.
Compatibility Issues
El Cerrito is fortunate in that the number of land-use compatibility issues is
relatively limited. There are noise compatibility issues in the western part of the city,
caused primarily by traffic on I-80 and by the BART system. (Although I-80 and
BART noise can be nuisance in other parts of the city, the area where significant
effects have been measured is limited to location generally west of Richmond
Street.) There are also some fire-related compatibility issues in the eastern part of
the city due to potential fire hazards in natural areas near residential neighborhoods.
There are land-use compatibility issues, perhaps more potential than current, along
the San Pablo Avenue corridor. Parking, noise, and scale of development (both
recent and proposed) in this area have been raised as concerns by some residents.
Some incompatibility exists, not so much because the actual uses are incompatible,
but because of wide differences in building condition and maintenance. Also,
vacant lots next to developed lots can be considered a compatibility problem
because vacant lots are sometimes poorly maintained and because they can cause
pedestrians to feel concerned about safety, especially at night.
Economic Development Activities
In 1999, the City began structuring a new economic development program which
aims to retain and attract business and other activities, with the particular objective
of improving the City’s fiscal well being.
El Cerrito has a Redevelopment Agency, which was created in 1974. As of July 1,
1999, the City placed the Redevelopment Agency in an inactive status. The Agency
remains a legal entity, however, and the City may find occasion in the future to
activate the Authority of the Agency in support of broad economic development
strategies.
After years of relatively few developments and several significant setbacks, there are
many signs of renewed developer interest and economic strength that hold promise
for El Cerrito. Projects recently completed or under construction are transforming
the areas around the Del Norte BART station. The potential to revitalize and
transform the El Cerrito Plaza BART station site and the adjacent shopping center
continues to attract the interest of developers. The next ten years may be critical in
the transformation of the San Pablo Corridor into a vital center (or sequence of
centers) for the city – a development that is critical for the city’s long-term financial
health.
By law, the Redevelopment Agency must address affordable housing needs through
its redevelopment activities. While residential uses may be incorporated into new

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     redevelopment projects near the BART stations (to support businesses as well as
                     transit use), the manner in which such housing is to be incorporated in these
                     projects—if at all—is a subject of considerable community debate.
                     B. Trends
                     Due to the largely “built-out” nature of the city, its existing development pattern
                     will remain largely unchanged in the 20-year planning period. The city is
                     characterized by single-family homes in most areas, with commercial uses and
                     higher density housing clustered along the San Pablo Corridor and in the vicinity of
                     the two BART stations. Although the overall pattern is not expected to change,
                     some replacement of and changes in individual businesses will take place.
                     In most cases, issues of development compatibility can be ameliorated on a site-by-
                     site basis through good design and site planning. Building and site design standards,
                     and a City design and development review process will ensure proper setbacks,
                     heights, building massing, scale, and style of new development. In addition, design
                     guidelines should be adopted in order to provide continuity of judgement in the
                     development review process, as changes take place over time among staff and
                     members of the Planning Commission and Design Review Board.
                     Growth Strategy
                     This General Plan calls for a balanced growth strategy with emphasis on retail and
                     office uses. The Plan assumes that all commercial growth and most residential
                     growth will take place within the San Pablo Avenue corridor. Specifically, the Plan
                     assumes 189,350 square feet of additional retail space, 166,570 square feet of
                     additional office space, and 775 new housing units. Of these totals, the only
                     development assumed to be someplace other than the San Pablo Avenue corridor
                     are 90 housing units, which represent a combination of accessory units and infill of
                     vacant lots.
                     It should be noted that new retail and office space will actually be more than as
                     indicated above because some existing retail and office space will be replaced by
                     new development. No replacement of residential units is assumed, although some
                     may occur.
                     The balanced growth strategy calls for most of the growth to take place in three
                     areas along San Pablo in order to take advantage of the two BART stations and a
                     large area between the stations that offers an opportunity for a large-scale mixed-use
                     concept. These focal points⎯Del Norte BART Station Area, Midtown Area, and
                     El Cerrito Plaza Area⎯are shown on Figure 4, Development Concept.

                      Eastern Residential Area
                      This plan preserves the predominantly single-family neighborhoods in their current
                      land uses. These neighborhoods are characterized by two major patterns of
                      development: first, a “historic grid” street pattern from Richmond Street east to
                      Navellier Street and Colusa Avenue, and second, a hillside curvilinear development
                      pattern from Navellier Street and Colusa Avenue to the top of the ridgeline.
                      The plan assumes that over the next twenty years the vacant lots in the residential
                      areas will be infilled with new single family homes consistent with the density and
                      development patterns (lot setbacks, building heights, lot coverage, etc.) of the
                      surrounding land uses. In addition, it is likely that additional “in-law” units (known
                      in El Cerrito as “accessory units”) will be constructed on existing single-family lots.
                      Accessory units consist of small studios or one-bedroom apartments built within
                      existing single-family houses or in small cottages in rear yard areas. These units
                      often provide residences for family members, but may also be rented to non-family
                      occupants, under El Cerrito’s regulations.
                      New single-family homes will add to the value of surrounding property by creating
                      newer, larger homes. Family activity patterns in the new homes (auto trips, night
                      and day use, size of families, etc.) will be similar to surrounding families and present
                      no significant conflicts. Infill of vacant lots will help reduce potential vandalism,
                      loitering, and the cleanliness of the area. New homes may also reduce potential for
                      grass fires on vacant lots, improve safety and security of the neighborhoods, and
                      generally improve the quality of life for neighborhoods with new families and
                      children.

Ohlone Greenway Residential Area
The Ohlone Greenway Residential Area currently consists of a mixture of single-
and multifamily residential development extending west from Richmond Street in
and around the BART tracks to Kearney Street in the central and southern portions
of the City. Higher intensity development generally occurs on the blocks closer to
the BART tracks and San Pablo Avenue. A preponderance of single-family homes
occurs on the blocks to the east from Liberty Street to Richmond Avenue.
This plan assumes that some of the existing older apartment buildings and single-
family homes will be redeveloped with higher-density residential uses. In particular,
older buildings in poor condition closer to San Pablo Avenue are the most likely
candidates for replacement. Older “stucco box” apartment buildings will be
replaced with more up-to-date and better quality apartments and condominiums.
Higher-density apartments and condominiums will most likely replace some older
single-family buildings, currently surrounded by apartments.
New buildings will be designed to meet contemporary development standards
(setbacks, open space and yards, building heights, onsite parking spaces, etc.) and
are expected to be of higher-quality design than current structures in the area.
Building ornamentation and landscaping should be sufficiently detailed as to make
the property attractive from the sidewalk as well as the street. Building design
should maintain the visual rhythm of the street edge, avoiding abrupt changes in
scale and setbacks except where the presence of important public buildings (e.g.,
churches, civic buildings, new library) would warrant.
A major concern of the residential land use pattern in the Ohlone Greenway
Residential Area is high levels of noise due to proximity of the BART tracks and San
Pablo Avenue. New construction standards and development requirements are
expected to mitigate interior noise levels by incorporating required sound barriers
such as double-paned windows, wall insulation, and building orientation. However,
noise from BART and traffic on San Pablo Avenue will affect users of yards and
patios.
New, higher intensity residential development will be compatible with surrounding
residential uses in those blocks west of Liberty Street, where existing multifamily
buildings presently exist. Land uses east of Liberty Street are generally single-family
homes, and the Plan assumes that the design, style, and type of residential
construction of any new development in the area will be similar to established
development.
Del Norte BART Station Area
The Del Norte BART station area consists of the commercial areas along San Pablo
Avenue adjacent to the El Cerrito Del Norte BART station north of Potrero
Avenue and west of Key Boulevard. Currently this area consists of predominantly
lower-intensity commercial uses, including “big box” retail establishments, fast-food
restaurants, car sales, and two motels. The area contains the new mixed-use Del

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     Norte Place development, which includes high-density residential units, built above
                     ground-floor retail uses. A number of lots and buildings in the area are currently
                     vacant or underutilized. It is assumed that over the next 20 years, these lots will be
                     developed with a higher-intensity use.
                     This plan assumes the development of current vacant and underused lots with a mix
                     of residential units and offices with ground-floor commercial uses. It also assumes
                     that new development will consist of mixed-use buildings on lots adjacent to San
                     Pablo Avenue. Lower-density housing (townhouses, maximum three-story walk-
                     ups) may replace a portion of the BART parking lots along Key Boulevard. The
                     plan assumes that the retail uses will provide restaurants and services to both offices
                     and residents, as well as to surrounding residential neighborhoods.
                     Noise impacts to interior spaces from San Pablo and the BART tracks will be
                     mitigated with double-paned windows and appropriate sound insulation. The
                     mixed-use development will provide a more transit oriented development pattern
                     and create a more pedestrian friendly environment. The greater mix of uses will
                     also help support the retail activity in the area. This scenario will help reduce overall
                     auto use and encourage transit use.
                     El Cerrito Plaza Area
                     The El Cerrito Plaza area consists of El Cerrito Plaza, El Cerrito Plaza BART
                     property, and the area along both sides of San Pablo Avenue to just north of Central
                     Avenue. The existing land uses include an underused and outdated community
                     shopping center and BART parking lots. The existing shopping center layout and
                     design sets retail stores back from San Pablo Avenue within a large surface parking
                     lot. Some of the existing stores are vacant, the most notable vacancy being the one
                     large department store at the Plaza, the former Emporium building.
                     This General Plan encourages the development of a more balanced, mixed-use
                     development at the Plaza and the surrounding area. Both retail and office uses will
                     be encouraged in this area, most likely with retail on the ground floor. The plan
                     does not preclude housing uses as part of a mix of uses in this area. This overall
                     approach is compatible with surrounding land uses in the area. A mixed-use
                     development pattern will support use of the BART transit system and reduce
                     reliance on auto trips by local residents. The many different users will contribute to
                     a lively and active street life during weekdays, evenings, and weekends.
                     San Pablo Avenue Between the Del Norte BART
                     Station Area and El Cerrito Plaza Area
                     The area between the two BART station areas contains a mix of land uses including
                     housing, office, retail, and more traditional industrial uses (lumberyard and a sheet
                     metal plant). The development pattern is varied and includes auto-oriented “strip
                     development,” several mixed-use office/retail centers, and limited housing. Many
                     of the lots are small with retail stores that lack adequate onsite parking. Some of the

                                                                                       EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
older retail store buildings are in very poor condition or vacant. Much of the area
on the west side of San Pablo Avenue is within the Richmond city limits.
This plan assumes a mix of retail, office, and housing uses along San Pablo Avenue.
This mix will include new retail, housing, and mixed-use developments (housing
with ground-floor retail uses). The commercial development pattern will
accommodate a range of retail types and services, including additional “big-box”
uses (to the extent adequate sites can be assembled) as well as community and
neighborhood uses.
Opportunities also exist for creating a more intense mixed-use development pattern
at the major cross-streets (Fairmount Avenue, Stockton Avenue, Moeser Lane, and
Manila Avenue). In particular, the “Midtown” area, extending from south of
Moeser Lane to north of Manila Avenue, provides a significant re-use opportunity
as obsolete buildings are vacated and either rehabilitated or replaced. The range and
variety of activity will create the most variation in activity during the day, night, and
weekends. Auto traffic and pedestrian movements will be more balanced
throughout the day and week. Noise levels from the street will be mitigated with
construction and design techniques.
Residential Areas West of San Pablo Avenue
This plan assumes that the two residential neighborhoods west of San Pablo Avenue
will have no major land use changes. West El Cerrito (the neighborhood west of
Highway 80) will be maintained as a predominantly single-family residential
neighborhood. A few individual single-family homes may be constructed on vacant
lots in the area. All new homes will be compatible with the neighborhood.
In the area near Central Avenue, this plan will allow for a small increase in
residential units over time as older single-family houses are replaced by new
multifamily structures (duplex, three- and four-unit apartments, condos, and
townhouses). All new development will conform to local development standards
and design and development review requirements. In most cases, the plan assumes
that new construction will be better designed, providing for more amenities than the
structures being replaced.
C. Land Use Categories
The general type and location of land uses in the City of El Cerrito for the next 20
years are shown in Figure 5, Land Use and Circulation. Definitions for each land
use type or category are provided below. The allowable densities and intensities of
development for all land use categories are described in the final section before the
Goals and Policies. The Land Use and Circulation map will be amended in the
event that the City makes changes to the designations of any land areas, or the
routes or classifications of circulation facilities.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     Residential
                     Residential land uses are areas suitable for dwellings. Residential land uses are
                     divided into five subcategories based on dwelling unit density expressed as the
                     number of allowable residential units on each “net” acre of land (“net acres” is the
                     total site area less the area devoted to public streets). Planned Unit Development
                     (PUD) communities, which allow for clustering of both detached and attached
                     homes, can be incorporated into all residential categories if the overall development
                     design is compatible with adjoining residential areas and the overall goals and
                     objectives of the General Plan are accomplished. All residential areas allow for
                     private uses such as parks, playgrounds, churches, day-care centers (both for
                     children and the elderly), open spaces and home occupations, with appropriate
                     zoning permits. The addition of accessory units on single-family lots is allowed in
                     single-family zones.
                     Very Low Density (Up to 6 dwelling units/net acre)
                     The Very Low Density category of residential land uses is intended for single-family,
                     residential units on large lots. Typically the Very Low Density category is to protect
                     sensitive hillside areas from extensive development and to protect against hazards
                     related to earthquakes, unstable terrain, and wild fires. In addition, Very Low
                     Density land uses are also intended to protect sensitive environmental areas and
                     features, and provide sites for larger, distinctive residences.
                     Low Density (7 to 9 dwelling units/net acre)
                     The Low Density category of residential land uses is intended to promote and
                     protect single-family neighborhoods.
                     Medium Density (10 to 20 dwelling units/net acre)
                     The Medium Density category of residential land use accommodates more intensive
                     forms of residential development while still remaining compatible with surrounding
                     land uses. This category is intended to provide greater housing choice in the City
                     for different family sizes and incomes. Medium density residential uses are intended
                     to be located closer to community and retail services, such as neighborhood
                     shopping centers, parks and open spaces areas, and near minor and major collector
                     streets where greater access can be provided. This land use category includes a
                     number of housing development types including duplexes, townhouse projects,
                     apartments, and small-lot, single-family residential designs.
                     High Density (21 to 35 dwelling units/net acre)
                     The High Density residential land use category is intended to provide opportunities
                     for multiple-family residential development in a well-designed environment. The
                     range is intended to be located in areas where higher traffic volumes and buildings
                     can be accommodated. These developments should be located outside of single-
                     family residential communities, where services and transportation systems are
                     adequate to serve the increased densities.

Mixed-Use Commercial
The Mixed-Use Commercial designation is intended primarily for all types of
commercial uses and secondarily for residential uses or a combination of the two.
The designation is intended to encourage ground floor, pedestrian friendly, retail
sales and service uses with upper floors of office and residential uses. The Mixed-
Use Commercial category applies to commercial activity ranging from
neighborhood convenience stores to community shopping centers and regionally
oriented specialty stores.
In addition to retail stores, the Mixed-Use Commercial designation is also intended
to allow for residential and office uses, including administrative, professional,
medical and dental offices, and “high-tech” research and development uses and
laboratories. The Mixed-Use Commercial designation also allows for limited, small-
scale specialty manufacturing uses, such as arts and crafts, woodworking, and
assembly processes, when located on sites compatible with surrounding
neighborhoods.
Parks and Open Space*
This designation is applied to public and privately owned lands used for low-
intensity, open space activities, such as hiking, walking, or picnicking;
environmentally sensitive lands and habitats; creeks; and City parks and recreation
facilities.
Institutional and Utilities
This designation is applied to public and privately owned lands used for activities
such as private utilities (electrical, gas, water, and telecommunications), schools
(both private and public), and other city, county, state or federal facilities. A major
intent of this land use designation is to preserve and protect limited valuable
resources, facilities and sites for possible future public use and to allow for careful
consideration by the City Council of changes in land use when private institutional
uses are no longer viable.
Development Densities and Intensities
The density and intensity ranges for the above land use categories are as shown on
Table 4-2. Residential and mixed-use projects shall comply with both the floor-area
ratio (FAR) requirements and the density requirements, except that the FAR for
* In 1997, the City sold a site of approximately 2.76 acres between Moeser Lane and the PG
& E transmission lines, near Seaview Avenue. The site was designated open space at the
time of the sale. The buyer has stated an intention to subdivide the property for single-
family lots. It is proposed through this General Plan to retain the open space designation of
this property in contemplation of the property owner’s application for a General Plan
amendment as part of the owner’s application package for subdivision approval. In this
manner, the General Plan amendment for the property can be processed as part of
development review for the subdivision thereby allowing for a clearer focus regarding
development of this property.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     projects built pursuant to state-mandated density bonuses may be increased beyond
                     the city’s allowable limits if necessary to accommodate the increased density.
                     State laws and guidelines for General Plans require that maximum building
                     intensities be stated in the Land Use element. The adoption of a FAR – the total
                     floor space of a building divided by the area of its site – is a common and acceptable
                     way of meeting the requirement to define a maximum intensity. The FAR provides
                     an outside measurement of how much building may be developed on a site; it does
                     not provide any specifications about how tall a building is or otherwise how it is
                     shaped or how it looks. Thus, the FAR does little to define the character of a
                     building or the quality of buildings within a neighborhood.
                     Those tasks are left to other mechanisms that are more precise than the General
                     Plan. To better regulate the quality and character of single buildings and groups of
                     buildings, cities may specify various restrictions on height, bulk, coverage and
                     setbacks of buildings, usually through the zoning ordinance. Another means of
                     defining character is through adoption of a “form code” which may contain more
                     definitive formulas of how buildings are shaped and how they relate to each other
                     and to streets and open spaces. More qualitative standards addressing architectural
                     style, materials, and other details are frequently set through a set of adopted design
                     guidelines.
                     State-mandated density bonuses and city incentives may be used for the same
                     project, but in no case should any combination of city incentives and state-
                     mandated density bonuses result in a density in excess of the maximum allowed
                     under either program as shown in Table 4-2.
                     For purposes of interpreting Table 4-2, the following definitions apply:
                     • Density is the number of permanent residential dwelling units per total net acre
                          of land in the development site.
                     • Floor area ratio (FAR) is the gross floor area, excluding the area devoted
                          exclusively to parking, divided by the total net area of the development site.
                     • Incentives include density bonuses, FAR bonuses, and other benefits that the
                          City may grant in return for special benefits provided by the development
                          project to the City; density and FAR bonuses may only be given pursuant to the
                          criteria contained in the City’s zoning or other land use regulations.
                     In order to convert density expressed in units per acre to density expressed in

 *Within the High Density Residential and Mixed-Use Commercial land use categories, up to 70 dwelling units
   per acre may be allowed through a city density-bonus incentive program for housing for elderly and
   handicapped persons where there is a commitment to provide services such as congregate care, onsite
   counseling, or medical services for residents.
The City has an incentives program in place (Zoning Ordinance Chapter 19.32,
adopted 1977, amended 1997). Under the program, development incentives may be
granted for a project where the incentives will promote closer adherence to City
objectives. Incentives may include increased density reduced parking, greater
building height, or other deviations from regular zoning standards. In exchange for
such incentives, the City will require desirable features, such as exceptional design,
creative design of off-street parking, enhancements to public amenities,
environmental benefits such as creek restoration, and similar benefits to the
community. The program most frequently has been used for minor density
increases in projects ranging from 5 to 20 dwelling unites, never exceeding 40 units
per acre. The program has allowed more substantial density increases for projects
for the elderly and disabled, up to 76 units per acre. Some of those projects have
also been granted increased height, reduced parking, and reduced setbacks.
Appendix G is a tabulation of the results of applying the Incentives Program from
1983 through 1997.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     COMMUNITY DESIGN
                     Community design is the process of giving physical design direction to urban
                     growth, conservation, and change. It is understood to include directions for site
                     organization and planning, landscape design, as well as building design, including
                     rehabilitation, preservation, and new construction.
                     The physical form and appearance, which are related to land use and transportation,
                     establishes the character and image of the city, and influences the quality of life of
                     residents and visitors. Land use policies establish the overall type and location of
                     activities, while the community design goals and policies establish the “quality” of
                     those places.
                     The process of making an urban design concept politically viable or economically
                     feasible is a “piece-meal” decision-making process that goes on continuously, day
                     after day, site by site. To shape the physical form and direction of the city, decision-
                     makers need both a strong vision of what ought to happen and the opportunities to
                     influence critical decisions.
                     Making physical improvements in the city is a process intimately connected to the
                     social and economic conditions of the community. The design of cities is often
                     unintentional, but it is not accidental. It is the product of decisions made for single,
                     separate purposes, with interrelationships and side effects that have not been fully
                     considered. The design of our cities has been determined by engineers, surveyors,
                     lawyers, and investors, each making individual, rational decisions for rational
                     reasons, but leaving the overall design of the city to take care of itself later, if at all.
                     This section identifies development patterns, community assets, challenges, and
                     opportunities for change and improvement in the City’s physical form and
                     appearance. Taken together, these elements influence El Cerrito’s visual image and
                     character, and create a “sense of place.”
                     The “sense of place,” which can be designed, affects how one perceives and
                     experiences the environment around us. A major goal of the community is to
                     strengthen and protect those special qualities that make El Cerrito a great place to
                     live while enhancing the character of the City through improving the quality of
                     design and amenities. These special qualities include making El Cerrito a pedestrian
                     friendly place with attractive streets, buildings, and public places.
                     A. Setting
                     El Cerrito lies between the dramatic shoreline of the San Francisco Bay and the
                     green backdrop of the East Bay hillsides. The rising topography of the hills forms a
                     strong north-south edge to the City on the east, while the I-80 freeway creates a
                     formidable north-south barrier on the west.
4-22 Community Development and Design                                                       August 30, 1999

                                                                                    EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
To those who know it, El Cerrito is a community of graceful neighborhoods, rich
with vistas and open spaces, and a number of distinct landmarks, physical features,
and activity areas. To many “outsiders,” however, El Cerrito’s identity is primarily
shaped by the views from the I-80 corridor and the suburban auto-oriented
commercial strip along San Pablo Avenue. The freeway with its raised structure,
berms and sound walls creates a visual, physical, and psychological barrier on the
western edge of the City.
The tree-lined neighborhoods of Kensington and Albany bound the city on the
south. The hillside housing of the City of Richmond and the unincorporated area of
East Richmond Heights bound the City on the north. Just west along much of San
Pablo Avenue is a section of Richmond called the Richmond Annex. Although
within a different city, this residential neighborhood has a strong visual connection
with El Cerrito.
Development Patterns
El Cerrito’s urban development pattern can be divided into a series of distinct
north-south bands or “layers” from the Bay lowlands on the west to Wildcat
Canyon ridge tops to the east. These layers are differentiated by major physical
elements, including the type and pattern of streets, primary activities, land uses and
structures, and changing topography.
The San Francisco Bay
While physically separated from the Bay’s shoreline by industrial and residential
areas in Richmond, the San Francisco Bay forms our perception of El Cerrito’s edge
and is a strong orientation feature in the region.
The I-80 Corridor
With extensive sound walls, berms, freeway structures and constant noise and
vehicular movement, the freeway provides an inhospitable environment for the
pedestrian and limits direct connections to the Bay. The I-80 corridor, with its
sound walls and berms, increases the City’s isolation and auto-oriented character.
The few connections under the freeway (Central, Potrero, and Cutting) offer limited
visual relief and a generally foreboding environment.
The San Pablo Avenue Commercial Corridor
A wide, auto-oriented suburban boulevard and an irregular pattern of strip
commercial development characterize the San Pablo Avenue commercial corridor.
The Historical Grid Neighborhoods
The residential areas east of San Pablo Avenue and the BART tracks consist of a
traditional street grid, relatively small lots and a mix of housing types, ages, and
designs. The higher density areas just east of San Pablo Avenue offer a transition
from commercial to residential use. Some existing moderate density housing has
been designed to integrate into the neighborhood fabric, while other box-like
structures create a negative image. Lower density neighborhoods further east have

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     generally quiet streets and a variety of housing designs. Several streets function as a
                     north-south bypass to San Pablo Avenue (such as Richmond Street).
                     BART Tracks
                     The elevated BART tracks, with the Ohlone Greenway below, run north-south
                     through the City of El Cerrito and accentuate the linear development pattern and
                     form of the community. Higher intensity housing and commercial areas generally
                     lie west of the BART tracks along the San Pablo Avenue Corridor. Lower intensity
                     residential neighborhoods lie east of the BART tracks.
                     “Hidden” El Cerrito
                     Perhaps less well known are the residential areas west of San Pablo and Carlson,
                     “hidden” El Cerrito. The Carlson residential area located at the base of Albany Hill
                     shares the traditional grid street pattern and has a mix of housing types. With
                     imposing views of Albany Hill, it is also bounded by an open and accessible part of
                     Cerrito Creek. A second “hidden” area, West El Cerrito, is located just west of I-80,
                     off Potrero. This area is physically separated from the rest of the City by I-80 but
                     shares many of the positive qualities of the other traditional residential areas.
                     The Hillside Residential Districts
                     Further east, as development moves into the hillsides, curvilinear streets follow the
                     hillside contours, the housing is generally larger and newer, informal trees and
                     landscaping mask the houses, and urban sidewalks give way to street edges with
                     curbs and gutters only. The diversity of these hillside areas is striking. Some are
                     heavily landscaped, while other areas offer sweeping vistas of the Bay and beyond.
                     Housing densities, ages, and styles vary. Steep open hillsides separate many of the
                     lower hillside homes from upper areas. In most cases, the Bay view is the most
                     prominent visual feature from the homes and streets. However, the views toward
                     these hillsides from other parts of the City and the freeway are as visually important
                     as the outward views.
                     The Ridgelines
                     The final layer encompasses the East Bay hills and the open spaces and ridgelines of
                     Wildcat Canyon Park. In some places, view homes back onto these open spaces. In
                     other locations, the ridges extend into the open spaces of the Mira Vista golf course.
                     These open spaces and ridgelines form a continuous and dramatic green edge to the
                     City.
                     B. Community Design Elements
                     Community design is the process of organizing and shaping physical form in the
                     landscape. This section outlines the major physical elements in the City of El
                     Cerrito that contribute to making a more attractive place to live.

                                                                                      EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
Gateways and Entry Features
Because it is bounded by urban development on the north, south, and west, there
are few visual clues that one is entering El Cerrito. However, there are
opportunities to create a more distinct identity and improve legibility and direction
for residents and visitors. The BART stations lack signage, graphics, landscaping,
and other symbols of entry. Orientation signage, kiosks, maps, art and distinctive
landscaping and pedestrian features could help inform visitors approaching on
BART and create a “sense of arrival” to the City.
Along the Ohlone Greenway, bicyclists and pedestrians have pleasant views of
adjoining parks and open spaces, and are generally served by adequate signage for
cross-streets and entry into the City. There are several areas where the views from
the road into the greenway, with its variety of landscape features (such as a restored
creek corridor), creates an inviting image. These areas merit protection and further
enhancement. The Ohlone Greenway lighting program, recently completed, has
been very effective, and additional lighting along the Greenway should be
completed in the future. Signage may need improvement to make drivers and
pedestrians more aware of the greenway.
For the driver entering El Cerrito there are few distinctive entries. The character of
buildings, signage, landscaping, and land uses are relatively undifferentiated from
one developed area to the next. Arriving from the north or south along San Pablo
Avenue, there is a continuous uneven commercial strip development pattern with
minimal signage and few landmarks. At El Cerrito Plaza, a driver views only a
conventional City limits sign obscured by poles and retaining walls.
Similarly, residential neighborhoods are undifferentiated with surrounding
communities. Many neighborhoods increasingly lack street trees as one moves
north from North Berkeley and Kensington into El Cerrito.
The freeway interchanges also have no distinctive features that help identify entry.
Opportunities for signage, landscaping, lighting, sculpture, and art, can enhance the
“sense of arrival” and help create a distinctive and identifiable entrance for the auto
users.
From the Arlington, an interesting brick gateway remains between Terrace and
Arbor. This feature creates a distinctive tone and quality for the area. Other
“gateways” of unique design could be used to distinguish and announce
neighborhoods and commercial hubs throughout the City. Residential streets with a
substantial tree canopy offer visual relief and interest along streets. Even a relatively
discontinuous tree pattern can create visual gateways. Other street features can be
used to identify commercial and residential areas such as traffic circles (e.g.,
Kensington Circle and Marin Circle) or extended sidewalks and planting beds.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     The San Pablo Avenue Commercial Corridor
                     San Pablo Avenue is a continuous suburban, strip-commercial street. Typical of an
                     older state highway, the strip has a variety of low-scale commercial malls, surface
                     parking, and older one- and two-story commercial and residential buildings in a
                     variety of sizes, characters, ages, and styles. These conditions will require a
                     cooperative effort with the City of Richmond to create an attractive and unified
                     visual character.
                     The streetscape changes throughout its length, with a mix of landscaped median
                     designs and sidewalk character. The west side of San Pablo Avenue from
                     approximately Bay View Avenue on the north to San Jose Avenue on the south is
                     outside the City limits. Sidewalks are in various states of disrepair. There are few
                     benches or other pedestrian amenities, and maintenance is generally lacking.
                     Landmarks, distinctive architecture, crosswalks, and unique commercial and public
                     activity areas are lacking. San Pablo Avenue could benefit from a conscious strategy
                     to create distinct nodes of higher density and activity with public space and
                     pedestrian amenities.
                     With the mixed-use Del Norte Place near one end of San Pablo Avenue and
                     opportunities for El Cerrito Plaza redesign at the other end, El Cerrito’s segment of
                     the avenue has the unique potential for two lively and definable places adjacent to
                     BART.
                     Activity Centers
                     Activity centers are where people gather to meet, recreate, shop, or do business.
                     Centers can be formed at major grocery stores, neighborhood retail hubs, transit
                     stops, and civic or community locations. Successful activity nodes work better
                     when a variety of uses cluster in and around a common location, create day and
                     night activity, and provide a public space for meeting people. The most successful
                     centers have a variety of places to eat, shop, play, and work⎯a place to see and be
                     seen. El Cerrito has several existing centers of activity, but many need improvement
                     to meet their potential.
                     Retail Centers
                     Several neighborhood retail centers are located along San Pablo Avenue. Generally
                     anchored by a grocery store and a drugstore, these retail activity centers can also
                     include banks, restaurants, and neighborhood-serving convenience retail stores. The
                     existing centers are located at approximately half-mile intervals along San Pablo
                     Avenue and provide retail access to the surrounding residential neighborhoods.
                     Although not pedestrian friendly environments from surrounding residential
                     neighborhoods, they do provide for everyday necessities. These centers generally
                     lack the visual character and distinction of more active and vital town centers. They
                     are low-scale, single-use, and auto-oriented retail centers with large parking lots
                     fronting the street, few pedestrian amenities, suburban-style architecture, and no
                     public gathering space.
4-26 Community Development and Design                                                     August 30, 1999

                                                                                        EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
Just west of the City limits in the City of Richmond, the new Ranch 99 Market has
created a regional serving, specialty retail center. Just north of the city limits, on San
Pablo Avenue in the City of Richmond, is another major retail center. This center
provides local shopping and retail stores to El Cerrito residents living in the
northern portion of the City.
El Cerrito’s centers could be enhanced with the addition of a small plazas and public
meeting places, cafés and coffee shops, and the addition of pedestrian amenities,
improved building facades, landscaping, and safe connections to surrounding
residential areas.
Del Norte Area
The northern area, Del Norte, is more regional serving in character, providing a “big
box” shopping destination around and north of the corner of Cutting and San Pablo
Avenue. The Del Norte area is an area in transition. Some of the older retail stores
are now vacant. Due to the direct freeway access, new “big box” retail uses are
replacing older strip commercial uses along this portion of San Pablo Avenue. The
proximity to the Del Norte BART station, however, provides a unique opportunity
for higher intensity, transit-oriented development.
El Cerrito Plaza
Some uses and stores in the El Cerrito Plaza are currently being remodeled. The
current visual and design problems are evident: a sea of surface parking; blank
building facades far from the street and sidewalk, no landscaping or pedestrian
amenities, inhospitable buildings, single use with limited marketability, poor entries
and signage, and an unattractive retaining wall. The importance of this site lies not
only in its location at the door to El Cerrito, the commercial district, and BART, but
also in its proximity to Cerrito Creek and its future development potential.
BART Transit Centers
The Ohlone Greenway provides a unique foreground to the BART stations.
However, other design elements are lacking around the BART stations. The
stations could be enhanced with new signage, landscaped parking, safe pedestrian
ways to surrounding neighborhoods, and distinctive landmarks. BART patrons
should be able to see inviting architecture and land uses as they exit BART.
Neighborhood Convenience Centers
El Cerrito has two interesting and attractive neighborhood serving, retail centers
including the Fairmount Center at Colusa and the neighborhood retail cluster on
Stockton. Another small neighborhood center at the Colusa Circle lies just south of
the City limits. These areas offer attractive retail nodes to the east of San Pablo
Avenue.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     Midtown City Center
                     Some portions of San Pablo Avenue offer opportunities to create additional centers
                     both large and small. The civic uses at San Pablo Avenue and Manila provide an
                     opportunity to create a major Midtown City Center. Presently this is a single-use
                     destination. Adding mixed-use retail activity, residential and office uses, and a
                     public place for meeting and gatherings would enhance the site considerably.
                     Parks, Open Spaces, and Environmental Resources
                     Parks, open spaces, and environmental habitat areas are valuable resources for the
                     community, both for active recreational use and passive visual enjoyment. The
                     open space areas include existing schools and park spaces, as well as a portion of the
                     steep El Cerrito hillsides. The existing Mira Vista Golf and Country Club and the
                     Sunset View Cemetery add valuable open space to the city character and form.
                     Several of the major hillside features add to the quality of these open spaces,
                     including the Albany Hill just south of the city, the Canyon Trail Park, Poinsett
                     Park, and Tassajara Park.
                     Creeks and drainages could make up a more significant part of the City’s visual and
                     recreational environment. The few locations where creeks are open provide
                     opportunities for viewing points, critical habitats, and walkways. Portions of Cerrito
                     Creek may have potential to be “daylighted” and used for recreational purposes.
                     Views and Vistas
                     Views from the upper hillside areas of El Cerrito are spectacular, offering grand
                     vistas of bridges, the San Francisco and San Pablo bays, Mt. Tamalpais and Marin
                     County, the Golden Gate and, on a clear day, the Pacific Ocean beyond. The
                     hillsides offer dramatic night views of San Francisco and other Bay cities. While
                     many of the dramatic views are from private residences, the hillside streets, such as
                     Moeser, Potrero, Cutting, and Barrett, provide public views along the streets.
                     Views from Moeser Lane are most impressive. The wide-open street, the steep
                     elevation changes, and the low landscaping help create the wide-open vistas.
                     Overhead power lines, however, detract from the view throughout the length of the
                     street.
                     Many significant views in El Cerrito are those looking back at the East Bay hills
                     from the city below. Views to Albany Hill also add to the unique quality of the
                     community, particularly in the southeast portions of the city, such as along
                     Fairmount and Rockway Streets.
                     Special Features, Landmarks and Sacred Places
                     Landmarks and “sacred places” also shape our image of the city. Landmarks are
                     typically special buildings, towers, spires, or natural features such as trees, rock
                     outcroppings and hillsides. Landmarks help us to locate ourselves in space, mark
                     special destinations, differentiate one location from another, and create a distinct
                     image.
4-28 Community Development and Design                                                    August 30, 1999

                                                                                   EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
El Cerrito has several distinguishing landmarks. Some of the most dramatic are
natural features, such as a large rock outcropping at the top of Cutting Boulevard.
Other landmarks are the churches and schools in the residential areas, such as the
distinctive Chinese architecture of Windrush School on Cutting and Elm Street, and
the Sunset View Cemetery Chapel at the end of Fairmount Avenue.
Sacred places are significant activity places in a community⎯places were people
meet for either formal or informal events. Sacred places are created by tradition and
use and not necessarily by distinctive architecture. Sacred places help to create a
“sense of community” and history. Sacred places provide memorable experiences
of our communities that give meaning and significance to our everyday lives.
El Cerrito has a number of interesting sacred places. Some are natural, such as
Cerrito Creek, and others are created through traditional use, such as the Pastime
Hardware Store on San Pablo Avenue, schools, City Hall, the library and the
Community Center. Many informal, local meeting and eating places are also
considered sacred places, such as Fat Apples restaurant on Fairmount Avenue.
Opportunities exist for creating new landmarks in the community, while enhancing
and protecting existing landmarks and sacred places. Landmarks can be encouraged
at the major activity centers in the community and along San Pablo Avenue.
Landmarks can also be used to help identify the major commercial centers and the
BART stations. New civic buildings, such as a new city hall can provide
opportunities to create significant landmarks through dramatic architectural design,
use of clock or bell towers, and a central public plaza.
C. Trends
This section outlines a number of design trends as major organizational concepts
and design principles for shaping the future of El Cerrito. These concepts build on
the existing land use and development patterns in the City of El Cerrito, listed
above, and help set the policy direction for future design and development
improvements, both in the private and public sector.
A City of Homes
El Cerrito will continue to be a “City of Homes.” The predominant land use
pattern in the city consists of single-family residences extending into the East Bay
Hills. Residents of the upper hillside homes have commanding views of the scenic
San Francisco Bay. Smaller, well-kept homes form quiet residential neighborhoods
in the areas closer to San Pablo Avenue. Residential densities increase in scale and
intensity as one approaches San Pablo Avenue and the BART tracks. Housing types
and design reflect the character, scale, and height of adjoining single-family
residents.
August 30, 1999                                              Community Development and Design 4-29

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     This major land use and organizational pattern will not change in the foreseeable
                     future. Thus a major goal of the plan is to protect and preserve the character of
                     these residential neighborhoods. Improvements to the residential areas include
                     undergrounding utilities over time, planting street trees, and improving sidewalks,
                     streets and recreational amenities.
                     Three Major Activity Centers
                     The San Pablo Avenue corridor provides virtually all the development opportunities
                     for new office work places and shopping. Recent development trends reflect that
                     retail development forms are shifting from suburban strip commercial and
                     community malls to more pedestrian friendly, transit oriented villages. El Cerrito’s
                     unique location provides an opportunity to take advantage of these changing
                     marketing trends.
                     El Cerrito has the potential to create three major centers⎯the El Cerrito Plaza
                     Area, the Del Norte Area, and a Midtown Area. These three major activity centers
                     are envisioned as pedestrian friendly, mixed-use villages, with ground floor retail
                     uses and upper floors of office and residential uses. Both El Cerrito Plaza and Del
                     Norte Center take advantage of their regional location next to the BART stations.
                     These three major centers are connected along San Pablo Avenue, BART and the
                     Ohlone Greenway with additional office, retail, and housing uses in between. Each
                     center has its own unique character and function. The Plaza provides an
                     opportunity for larger, high-end retail users providing goods and services both
                     locally and more regionally. Del Norte provides an opportunity for a new regional
                     work place with new office space for smaller, entrepreneurial enterprises, live-work
                     studios, R&D office space, and for traditional insurance and banking services. The
                     Midtown Center provides an opportunity to cluster development around new civic
                     functions.
                     Neighborhood Retail Centers
                     Another design concept is to continue to provide local neighborhood retail
                     opportunities in smaller neighborhood retail centers away from San Pablo Avenue.
                     These small, unique shopping areas are clustered at the end of Fairmount Avenue
                     and on Stockton Street.
                     A Pedestrian Friendly Place
                     Future improvements in the City of El Cerrito are linked by a system of pedestrian
                     friendly streets, pathways, and open spaces. The pedestrian friendly concept is to
                     create an environment that places an emphasis on the pedestrian, bicyclist, and
                     public transit systems, slowing auto traffic and providing an attractive setting.
                     Pedestrian friendly places are intended to improve the “quality of life” for residents
                     by making safer, more attractive, and walkable places throughout the city.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     HOUSING
                     The Housing Element is one of the seven required General Plan elements and is an
                     integral part of the El Cerrito General Plan. Because the majority of El Cerrito’s
                     land use is in housing, the Housing Element is a key component of the City’s future
                     plans. The Housing Element is subject to more state guidance and review than the
                     other required elements. State law requires it to be revised every five years, based
                     on the periodic regional housing needs determination made by the Association of
                     Bay Area Governments (ABAG). Because of budgetary constraints; no new needs
                     determination has been published since 1989; therefore, the Housing Element is not
                     being updated as part of the 1999 General Plan Update Program.
                     The Housing Element was last updated in 1991 and adopted by amendment as part
                     of the El Cerrito General Plan. Among other things, the element takes into
                     consideration the city’s housing needs as determined by ABAG and the potential for
                     meeting those needs based on land use designations and an inventory of vacant and
                     under-utilized properties. The regional allocation of 1989 was 722 units. Of those
                     required, 339 units had been produced by the end of 1998. At the time the Housing
                     Element was adopted in 1991, it was determined that, although the supply of vacant
                     residentially zoned land in El Cerrito is limited, there remained adequate capacity to
                     meet the city’s share of projected regional housing needs. Of the total projected
                     1,183 additional units that could be built:
                     •    165 (44 multifamily and 121 single family) could be accommodated through
                          infill development on vacant land in the city limits; and
                     •    1,018 (all multifamily) could be accommodated through development in the
                          city’s redevelopment project areas (principally around the city’s two BART
                          stations).
                     El Cerrito is expected to adopt a new Housing Element in 2001. In the meantime,
                     the existing adopted Housing Element is included as Appendix A to this General
                     Plan.

GROWTH MANAGEMENT
A. Setting
The Growth Management Element establishes a comprehensive, long-range
program that matches demand for public facilities generated by new development
with policies and standards for traffic level of service (LOS) and performance
criteria for fire, police, parks, sanitary facilities, water supplies, and flood control.
The Growth Management Element is concerned with maintaining defined urban
service levels; it is not intended to limit growth or to direct growth into certain areas
of the community on a priority basis. Most importantly, the Element’s policies
ensure that new development impacts that threaten to degrade established traffic
performance or public service thresholds are mitigated through project
modification, capital improvement programming, or contributions to
improvements.
The Growth Management Element is part of the General Plan because Contra
Costa County voters approved a one-half (.5%) percent sales tax increase in
November 1988, commonly known as "Measure C," that includes both
Transportation Improvement and Growth Management Programs. The overall
goals of the Measure C program are:
•    To relieve congestion created by past development through road and transit
     improvements funded by the proceeds of the sales tax increase.
•    To prevent future development decisions resulting in deterioration of public
     services and acceptable traffic performance levels.
The Growth Management Element concerns itself primarily with the latter goal of
the countywide growth management program. To be eligible for its share of revenue
generated under Measure C, the City must commit itself, as matter of public policy,
to carrying out the following objectives:
•    Manage congestion by adopting and applying traffic service standards for
     streets, roads and Regional Routes.
•    Adopt standards for fire, police, parks, water, flood control, and sanitary sewer
     services which will be met as the city grows, accomplished by 'Performance
     Standards' for provision of necessary facilities.
•    Reduce dependency on single-occupant automobile travel through adoption of
     a local and countywide Transportation Systems Management (TSM) program
     applied to large-scale employers in the city.
•    Anticipate needed investments by adopting a five-year Capital Improvement
     Program that lists projects, their costs and funding mechanisms.
•    Ensure that new development "pays its own way" through mitigation and fee
     programs.
•    Reduce the number and/or length of automobile commute trips by enhancing
     El Cerrito's housing and job opportunities.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     B. Traffic Service Standards
                     Projected increases in travel have the capacity to influence disproportionately the
                     shape and character of El Cerrito, if traffic congestion and improvements to the
                     travel network are not managed through local and cooperative regional policy
                     implementation. The Land Use Element (Community Development and Design
                     chapter) establishes the timing and density of future growth within the city. The
                     Transportation Element (Transportation and Circulation chapter), supplemented by
                     the Growth Management Element's defined levels of intersection performance and
                     policies for mitigation of traffic impacts, are useful sources of options and strategies
                     to influence regional growth patterns that extend their influence beyond El Cerrito's
                     borders.
                     Routes of Regional Significance
                     Measure "C" requires that all freeways and selected arterials in the county be
                     designated as Routes of Regional Significance, or "regional routes." These roadways
                     experience extreme levels of congestion, and carry significant levels of through-
                     traffic to other parts of the Bay Area. There are many obstacles to improving
                     conditions on these regional routes, including the high cost of expanding physical
                     capacity and the uncertain role of outside agencies' funding decisions. Within El
                     Cerrito, these regional routes include Interstate Freeway 80, San Pablo Avenue, and
                     Cutting Boulevard.
                     Characteristics of El Cerrito's Regional Routes
                     Interstate Freeway 80
                     The freeway consists of three lanes in each direction through West County, with a
                     55 MPH speed limit. Interchanges serving El Cerrito include Central Avenue,
                     Carlson Boulevard, Potrero Avenue, and Cutting Boulevard. Interstate 80 is the
                     most congested of all regional routes. Congestion extends from Pinole Valley Road
                     south to Central Avenue during the AM peak period and from Central to the
                     Carquinez Bridge tollbooth during the PM peak period. Congestion on 1-80 causes
                     high traffic volumes and consequent delays on San Pablo Avenue, the primary
                     parallel route.
                     I-80 has one of the highest percentages of through traffic in the west county
                     corridor, with 52% of AM peak hour direction travel, measured at the Carquinez
                     Bridge. Ninety-two percent of that traffic originates in Napa and Solano counties.
                     Truck traffic, which contributes to travel delay, makes up 9% of total AM
                     Eastbound (non-peak direction) volume, much of which enters or leaves the
                     freeway on the San Pablo Avenue corridor.
                     The West Contra Costa County Action Plan identifies a number of improvements
                     to the I-80 corridor needed by the year 2000 to alleviate the expected breakdown of
                     capacity. Those improvements of most significance to El Cerrito include:
                     •    HOV interchange at Cutting Boulevard to serve the El Cerrito Del Norte
                          BART station (constructed)

                                                                                  EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
•    Parallel route improvements on San Pablo Avenue including signal upgrades
     (Phase I is under construction. Phase II will implement transit preferential
     signal timings and include physical enhancements to transit operations on San
     Pablo Avenue.)
•    Transportation Management Plan to include transit, ride sharing, public
     information/marketing and vehicle monitoring.
San Pablo Avenue
In El Cerrito, San Pablo Avenue is an urbanized thoroughfare between the south
City limit at Cerrito Creek Carlson to the north city limit just south of McDonald
Avenue with two lanes in each direction. At most intersections there are left turns
operating with left-turn signal phasing. The speed limit is 35 MPH. Average daily
traffic volumes on San Pablo Avenue are greatest at its southerly extreme in the
County. Near Cutting Boulevard, the highest average daily volume is 29,900
vehicles. During the AM peak period, the highest volumes occur near Potrero
Avenue at 2,275 vehicles per hour. The highest PM peak hour period volumes
occur near Barrett Avenue in Richmond, and frequently cause traffic backup into El
Cerrito.
The San Pablo Avenue Corridor has been studied on a regional and local basis to
determine the improvements necessary to maintain the routes as a parallel to I-80
and to serve locally approved uses. Coordination of improvements is difficult given
the number of jurisdictions through which the street passes, and variety of volumes
and functions that it serves. Alameda and Contra Costa counties are currently
installing signal interconnect along San Pablo Avenue to improve inter-jurisdictional
and intra-jurisdictional signal coordination.
Cutting Boulevard
The portion of Cutting Boulevard in El Cerrito designated as a regional route
extends from Key Boulevard to the westerly city limit. It links San Pablo Avenue
and the Del Norte BART station to I-80. The road encompasses two lanes in each
direction with improved medians and left-turn pockets, except for a segment which
is one-way westbound between the BART station and San Pablo Avenue. Most
significant congestion occurs east of Carlson Boulevard. Measured delays at San
Pablo Avenue have been relatively minor during the PM peak hour, and no
improvements within El Cerrito are specified.
Regional Action Plans
Local jurisdictions are expected to participate in the development of programs to
control regional traffic impacts on these routes through a series of Action Plans
approved by one of the Regional Transportation Planning Committees created under
Measure C. El Cerrito has been working closely with the WCCTAC (West Contra
Costa County Traffic Advisory Committee) to develop an action plan for the west
county area. Once approved, the Action Plan will be combined by CCTA with other
regionally recommended Action Plans to create a countywide comprehensive
transportation plan. The City recognizes that the success of attaining Action Plan

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     objectives depends upon participation of other jurisdictions in both planning and
                     funding of necessary improvements.
                     Basic Routes
                     All roads not indicated on the map of Routes of Regional Significance are Basic
                     Routes. The Growth Management Element is required to assess the operating
                     capacity of signalized intersections on Basic Routes, estimate future service impacts
                     resulting from significant, foreseeable increases in home building and job-formation,
                     according to the city's General Plan land use and housing policies.
                     Level of Service – General
                     Measure C requires adoption of traffic level of service (LOS) standards for basic
                     routes, which are related to existing and projected land use. These standards are
                     then applied throughout the remaining General Plan elements to ensure consistency
                     in development decision-making. The Growth Management Element uses traffic
                     LOS as an indicator of present levels of congestion at signalized intersections and as
                     a measuring device to determine the success of congestion relief strategies. Measure
                     C has standardized the criteria for intersection performance related to land use,
                     based on the categories described in Table 4-3.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                      El Cerrito has connected these terms to the local street hierarchy in the
                      Transportation Element, which classifies vehicle routes according to the character
                      of surrounding development and their linkage to sources of traffic congestion from
                      other jurisdictions. Table 4-4 describes the city's Basic Route signal controlled
                      intersections and the minimum service level at which the intersection is expected to
                      operate based on future development activity:

                      Infrastructure Conditions
                      As a result of deferred maintenance, local streets have deteriorated to the point
                      where reconstruction now is necessary in some cases. The existing traffic signals on
                      Richmond Avenue have the oldest controllers in Contra Costa County, and parts no
                      longer are available to repair them. Additionally, the Public Safety Commission has
                      identified three problem intersections that may require the installation of new
                      signals at a future date (Richmond and Fairmount, Richmond and Schmidt, and Key
                      and Cutting). A program to reconstruct streets in the city's network will emphasize
                      arterial and collector streets. The streets to be reconstructed first would be the lower
                      portion of Barrett Avenue and Potrero Avenue between Arlington and Navellier.
                      Reconstruction will include removal and replacement of deteriorated curbs, storm
                      drain inlets and catch basins, new pavement, and installation of access ramps where
                      feasible.
                      Level of Service and Future Land Use
                      Nearly all significant new increments of housing and employment will occur on
                      parcels located within the San Pablo Avenue corridor, or in joint use with BART
                      station facilities. Expanding jobs and housing opportunity inside El Cerrito's
                      borders will not necessarily eliminate commute travel to and from the region.
                      However, it will offer an alternative to the commuter lifestyle and enhance options
                      for El Cerrito's economic development that do not burden the regional roadway
                      network.
                      While most of the direct traffic impact of local land use intensification will fall upon
                      Regional Routes such as San Pablo Avenue and Cutting Boulevard, it is equally

                                                                                   EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
important that such activity not burden the basic route system and degrade the
minimum service levels for signalized intersections described above.
The city is committed, as part of the region-wide effort to reduce traffic congestion
and improve the efficiency and safety of its local street system, to monitor traffic
conditions on a systematic basis and develop programs to maintain established
service standards. El Cerrito is a "mature" city with only limited growth potential.
However, even the relatively small increment of growth potential described in this
Element can burden local and regional transportation facilities without a prescribed
means of measurement and defined mitigation programs.
C. Urban Service Performance Standards
Park and Recreation Facilities
Service Function
The City of El Cerrito provides a rich diversity of parks and recreational
opportunities. Parklands include approximately 32 acres of City-owned parks, 100
acres of City-owned open space used for recreation and conservation purposes, 23
acres of other City-maintained recreation facilities, and 27 acres of School District-
owned and maintained recreation areas. More details are provided in Chapter 6.
Service Standard
Five (5) acres of publicly owned parkland for each 1,000 residents.
Fire Suppression and Related Emergency Services
Service Function
The El Cerrito Fire Department provides first response to structural, vehicular and
wildland fires, medical emergencies, hazardous materials, incidents and natural
disasters. The Department’s ability to meet to these needs is facilitated through
active participation with Richmond, Kensington, and the West County fire
departments in an automatic response agreement that uses the combined resources
of all four agencies to serve these needs irrespective of jurisdictional lines. The
departments share the costs of dispatch and training services and have established
common standards for staffing, apparatus and equipment.
Service Standard
The interagency agreement specifies the following response protocol for all
emergency service requests:
•    Maximum response time for first engine arrival of six (6) minutes including one
     (1) minute dispatch time and three (3) minute-travel time from responding
     station.
•    Three (3) person engine company is minimum response.
•    Minimum training level of responders shall be Firefighter 1 and Emergency
     Medical Technician 1.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     Police Emergency Services
                     Service Function
                     The El Cerrito Police Department’s mission is to respond to requests for law
                     enforcement emergency services, deter criminal activity, investigate crimes against
                     persons and property and undertake proactive programs to reduce the opportunity
                     for criminal activity. The department also acts proactively to reduce dangerous
                     motor vehicle operating practices and offers community education outreach
                     programs about personal and neighborhood security.
                     Service Standard
                     The Police Department is committed to maintaining a level of personnel and capital
                     equipment for first-unit response in three (3) minutes to requests for emergency
                     service. The City's resources alone are insufficient to meet the multiplicity of
                     demands upon a modem police agency. Hence, the Department contracts with the
                     City of Richmond for emergency dispatching, and with various state and county
                     agencies for specialized investigative support services.
                     Sanitary Sewer and Treatment Services
                     Service Function
                     Two agencies work together to serve El Cerrito’s sanitary sewer needs. Stege
                     Sanitary District provides the underground lines leading from customer discharge
                     sites to the regional treatment plant. That plant, operated by the East Bay Municipal
                     Utility District at Point Isabel, provides tertiary level treatment to RWQCB
                     standards for discharge to the Bay.
                     Service Standard
                     Service capacity planning is based on a 130-gallon daily increment per person.
                     Domestic Water Services
                     Service Function
                     East Bay Municipal Utility District provides domestic water service to residential
                     and institutional customers in the city. Past droughts, which curtained water service
                     in some areas, have reminded people of the need to conserve water whenever
                     possible.
                     Service Standard
                     250 gallons/day for each residential household to 4 (four) persons +62 gallons for
                     each additional person in the household. 90% of 1986 use for commercial
                     connections and 95% of 1986 use for institutional uses, to be reevaluated upon
                     improvement in prevailing drought conditions.

Flood Control
Service Function
Flood hazards arise from natural rainstorms, failure of water storage facilities, and
from the secondary effects of landslides. Storage tanks for East Bay MUD located
south of Potrero Avenue below Bay Vista Court are considered at minimal risk of
failure in a seismic event; however, their safety can be improved by installation of
flexible couplers and check valves. Because the watersheds in El Cerrito's foothills
are relatively small, risk of flood damage through the sudden release of accumulated
water behind a collapsed mass of landslide debris is also small. The greatest flood
hazard risk is posed by the current condition of the storm drain system that is under
study for long term and comprehensive remediation.
Only a small portion of Cerrito Creek is subject to inundation in the 1% (100 year
event). Property damage from such an event is predictable, but would be confined
to isolated locations in the flood path. The Contra Costa County Flood Control
District establishes maintenance and development standards in the floodway. The
City has also established restrictive development policies in its Municipal Code as a
condition of continued eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program.
Service Standard
Containment of the 100-year flood event according to the federal Flood Insurance
Rate Maps. Continued restriction on construction within flood hazard zones
through establishment of minimum floor level elevations above the projected 100-
year flood event level, as established by the Flood Control District.

                            evaluate policy options and changes,
                            alternative standards, and proposed
                            mitigation measures to achieve the
                            minimum service levels and describe the
                            findings upon which these alternatives
                            were deemed infeasible.

IMPLEMENTATION
The following is a summary of the major tools available to the City for
implementation of the policies in this chapter, Community Development and
Design.
     1. Beautification Program
A city beautification program is excellent way to increase public awareness and
participation in creating good design and quality spaces. City beautification
programs can take many forms and involve both the public and private sectors.
They can include; design awards for building design and landscaping, yard
maintenance; landscape planting programs such as flower planting, street tree
planting; and, public art projects or other civic improvement programs. They may
also include the development of public scenic turnouts, rest stops, and overlooks to
take advantage of views and vistas from the hillsides. Many city beautification
programs are sponsored jointly by the city government and local civic organizations
to promote civic pride while enhancing the physical appearance.
     2. Building Code
El Cerrito should consider adopting amendments to the Building Code that
promote energy and better uses of natural resources. This could be the part of the
charge to a citizen task force that looks into possible ways of encouraging El Cerrito
to agree upon and adhere to applicable principles of sustainable development.
     3. Capital Improvement Program
The Capital Improvement Program (CIP) is a compilation of the capital
improvements planned for construction over the next five years in El Cerrito. It
includes cost estimates, the phasing of specific improvements and associated costs
and methods with which specific improvements will be financed. The City should
continue to conduct annual reviews of the CIP and add money for transportation,
infrastructure, and public facility improvements as funding sources are identified.
The CIP also provides the basis for planning for and funding of a civic center and
other community facilities.
     4. CEQA Review
The City should ensure that the CEQA review process identifies impacts of new
development upon the transportation system, utilities, and public facilities.
     5. City Entry Design Program
The City can sponsor the design and construction of entry monuments and other
landscape improvement projects to improve the appearance of city streets. These
landscape improvement projects can also be developed in cooperation with civic
organizations or sponsored by local business to create new entry signs, monuments,
and landmarks at major entry points to El Cerrito.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                          6. Creek Restoration
                     The City may contribute through its storm drainage improvement program, or seek
                     funding from other agencies or private sources, to restore various segments to
                     creeks or other streets (on surface or through removal of pipes) and restoration of
                     riparian habitats.
                          7. Design Guidelines
                     Design guidelines are a tool for ensuring that development is compatible with the
                     surrounding area and that it functions well for the community. To the extent
                     possible, the guidelines should be specific: guidelines that are quantifiable should be
                     considered for incorporation into the development regulations.
                          8. Development Incentives
                     Providing development incentives to developers and property owners can influence
                     good community design. Development incentives can be in the form of density and
                     development intensity bonuses, reduced development standards (i.e., reductions in
                     parking requirements, height restrictions, setbacks, etc.). Incentives may be granted
                     where they promote closer adherence to City objectives by providing desirable
                     features, such as exceptional design, creative design of off-street parking,
                     enhancements to public amenities, environmental benefits, such as creek
                     restoration, and similar benefits to the community.
                          9. Development Regulations (zoning)
                     The development regulations, primarily the zoning regulations and subdivision
                     ordinance, provide the standards for development, prescribe allowable uses, contain
                     specific incentive provisions, and include other standards and procedures related to
                     approval of development projects.
                          10. Development Review
                     The development review process includes discretionary review by the Planning
                     Commission and the Design Review Board, based on consideration of General Plan
                     objectives and policies, and criteria established by the zoning and subdivision
                     ordinances and other city regulations and adopted guidelines. Most discretionary
                     actions are subject to the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act
                     (CEQA). The development review process also includes administrative review of
                     projects to verify compliance with Planning Commission and Design Review Board
                     requirements, as well as standards set by the City through adoption of building and
                     fire codes, engineering standards, and other regulations and ordinances.
                     Development review should be used to assess the impact of new development on
                     the demand for transportation and public facility improvements and to implement
                     mitigation measures and other mechanisms to help finance needed improvements.
                          11. Economic Development Strategy
                     The city should maintain a strategy to retain and attract businesses. This strategy
                     should be reviewed frequently to ensure that it reflects current economic and
                     business trends and makes use of the city’s advantages as a business location. The
4-58 Community Development and Design                                                     August 30, 1999

                                                                                    EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
city staff, elected officials, and business organizations should then actively market
the city as a location for desirable types of businesses.
     12. Fiscal Impact Assessment
The City should consider development of a fiscal impact assessment process that
would identify the economic and fiscal impacts of new development projects. The
process should establish size thresholds that trigger the assessment, integrate the
assessment with CEQA review, and ensure that the fiscal impact assessment is not
an undue burden on economic development of the City. Also see Implementation
Measures in Chapter 6 on a Public Facilities Fee and Traffic Impact Fee.
     13. General Plan Consistency Review
Review all public projects for consistency with the General Plan as early as possible
in order to minimize wasted effort on projects deemed not to be in conformance.
     14. Grant Funds
The City should determine whether grant funds are available from federal or state
sources for restoring creeks, preparing design guidelines to reduce crime, and
developing guidelines for pedestrian friendly areas near either or both BART
stations.
     15. Historical Inventory and Designation
The City should initiate, or work with a local civic group to initiate, an inventory of
structures or sites that may have architectural, historical, archeological, or cultural
significance to the community. The City should then consider action to list the
most significant structures or sites on the California Register of Historical Resources
and the National Register of Historic Places.
     16. Housing Program
The city’s housing program consists of those actions necessary to achieve the
policies of the General Plan and the goals of the Housing Element. The housing
program should monitor progress toward achieving goals to ensure that suitable
land and incentives are available. The housing program also includes the
responsibilities of the Redevelopment Agency to support affordable housing goals.
     17. Intergovernmental Coordination
The City should coordinate with adjacent jurisdictions, the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission, Contra Costa County, AC Transit, BART, Caltrans,
and other applicable agencies. The Contra Costa County Transportation Authority
(CCTA) West County Action Plan for Routes of Regional Significance (12/9/94)
defines a regional vision for Hercules, Pinole, San Pablo, Richmond, and El Cerrito.
This document defines many of the City’s positions with respect to regional
transportation improvements. Some of the key Action Plan items are:
a.   Support inclusion of the West County BART extension in the MTC Track 2
     Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) project lists.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     b. Pursue every opportunity to speed the funding and construction of the West
                          County BART extension to Crockett.
                     c.   Expand efforts urging MTC to determine the best express transit system(s) for
                          the Interstate 80 corridor and, based on the results of the MTC study,
                          encourage timely implementation of planned transit capital and service
                          improvements.
                     d. Promote Carquinez Bridge alternatives that will achieve mainline metering of
                          Interstate 80 into West Contra Costa County.
                     e.   Support efforts by Caltrans, CCTA, and MTC to tailor capacity of the
                          Carquinez Bridge improvements to downstream capacity.
                     f.   Support efforts by AC Transit to study the feasibility of bus rapid transit
                          treatments along San Pablo Avenue.
                     g. Support mixed-use development, high employment commercial, and higher-
                          density residential development in transit corridors and near BART stations.
                     h. Consider additional transit mitigation alternatives, as appropriate, in future
                          Action Plan Deficiency Strategies.
                     In addition to, and in support of, these regional key items, the following are City of
                     El Cerrito interagency coordination positions:
                     a.   As opportunities present themselves, improve freeway access to El Cerrito,
                          particularly around the Del Norte area and at the Central Avenue interchange.
                     b. Oppose transportation projects that would diminish access to Interstate 80
                          from El Cerrito.
                     c.   Oppose capacity enhancements to San Pablo Avenue except when the
                          improvements serve local traffic and do not compromise bus, pedestrian and
                          bicycle travel.
                     d. Support physical enhancements to San Pablo Avenue to make it a transit and
                          pedestrian friendly multi-modal street.
                     In addition to the above, the City should work with Caltrans to install adequate
                     highway landscaping improvements along I-80.
                          18. Joint Watershed Goals
                     In 1995 the cities of El Cerrito, Albany, Berkeley and Richmond, the East Bay
                     Regional Park district, and the University of California at Berkeley, endorsed a goals
                     statement expressing mutual intentions to restore creeks to natural conditions, to
                     make use of creek corridors for pedestrian and bicycle transportation purposes, to
                     assure adequate flow of freshwater for nourishment of creeks, and to promote
                     public awareness of the value of healthy watersheds. The statement includes a
                     mutual agreement to seek opportunities for grants and other cooperative efforts.

     19. Parking Districts
Parking districts can be formed by local property owners to help finance needed
parking in impacted commercial areas. Parking districts provide for centralized
parking lots and parking structures that allow participants to build and rehabilitate
existing buildings at a higher intensity of development.
     20. Public Facilities Fee
The City should consider adopting a citywide public facilities impact fee ordinance,
under the requirements of the applicable laws, to fund new community and public
facilities, including public safety facilities, required to serve new residents and
employees in the City.
     21. Redevelopment Program
In support of its economic development strategy the City may choose to use the
authority of its Redevelopment Agency in attracting and retaining business and
other activities, and in providing supportive public improvements.
     22. Sign Ordinance
The sign ordinance is tool to regulate the appearance, size, and location of signs in
the City of El Cerrito. Well-designed signs contribute to the overall visual quality of
the built environment by reducing clutter as well as helping in way-finding and
locating business and other activities.
     23. Special Districts
Special districts can be formed by local property owner to help finance desired
neighborhood improvements including street lighting, streetscape enhancements,
and landscaping improvements.
     24. Specific Plans
Certain areas of the city need to be planned comprehensively, but in more detail
than can be done in a general plan. A specific plan can integrate land use, design,
transportation, utilities and other issues into an action strategy. Areas to be
considered for a specific plan include the Midtown area along San Pablo Avenue,
extending from south of Moeser to north of Manila Avenue, and the Del Norte
BART station area. A specific plan for the El Cerrito Plaza area, including the
BART station and the area along San Pablo Avenue between Fairmount and Central
avenues, should be prepared to provide overall direction during the next 20 years.
     25. Street Tree Program
A citywide street tree planting program can dramatically enhance neighborhood
streets, increase property values, and improve the overall appearance of the city.
The city should continue its street tree planting program by offering free street trees
to any resident or business in the City.
     26. Streetscape Improvement Program
Many of the commercial streets in El Cerrito can be improved with a concerted
effort to provide new improvements to make the right-of-way more attractive and
August 30, 1999                                                   Community Development and Design 4-61
EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     pedestrian friendly environments. Selected streets can be improved with pedestrian
                     streetscape amenities, decorative lighting, decorative crosswalks, and additional
                     landscaping. Special street improvement projects can be phased over time and
                     included in revitalization efforts of major areas along San Pablo Avenue.
                           27. Traffic Impact Fee
                     To help avoid public costs of traffic impacts, the City should consider collecting a
                     traffic impact fee from developers of projects, citywide. Fee payments would fund
                     transportation improvements to mitigate the traffic impacts of new development.
                     The traffic impact fee would be in-lieu of the off-site mitigation requirements, but
                     would not replace the developer’s responsibility for frontage improvements. The
                     traffic impact fee may be used to fund roadway extensions, intersection
                     improvements, safety improvements, or improvements and amenities to pedestrian,
                     bicycle or transit facilities.
                           28. Travel Demand Management (TDM)
                     Support and promote TDM measures to reduce the percentage of person trips made
                     by automobile and to reduce the annual vehicle miles of travel. Reduce the
                     percentage of trips made by automobile and provide the opportunity and facilities to
                     divert trips from automobiles to other modes. Encourage small businesses in areas
                     of employment concentration to form cooperatives that can collectively provide
                     effective TDM options to employees.
                           29. Underground Utility Districts
                     Creating underground utility districts is a way of financing undergrounding of
                     overhead utility lines. This process can speed up the process of removing overhead
                     utility lines along selected streets.

CHAPTER 5 TRANSPORTATION
                                 AND CIRCULATION
Transportation and circulation – the movement of people by all modes, and
provision of support facilities, most notably parking – are crucial to quality of life
and economic vitality. They are also key components of providing emergency
services and facilitating the movement of goods. Circulation is also a mandatory
general plan element.
The circulation element describes those services, facilities and capital improvements
needed to facilitate vehicle, pedestrian, transit, bicycle, and emergency
transportation. It also describes means for promoting and encouraging the use of
alternative transportation modes, accommodating growth in travel demand, and
preserving safety.
A. Setting
Street and Highway System
Street Hierarchy
Although El Cerrito has a hierarchy of highways and streets, it lacks a central
business district with a traditional grid pattern of streets. Instead, the City is
developed along San Pablo Avenue, which serves as its spine. El Cerrito's existing
streets and their functional classifications are shown in Figure 6.
Freeways and Interchanges
Interstate 80 is the major freeway serving El Cerrito, although Interstate 580 is also
located in the area. Historically, Interstate 80 has been heavily congested in the
southbound (westbound) direction in the a.m. peak period and the northbound
(eastbound) direction in the p.m. peak period. Recent reports indicate that
Interstate 80 ranks among the top five most congested freeways in the San
Francisco Bay Area. Caltrans has recently completed construction of high
occupancy vehicle lanes and will soon be completing the remainder of the ramp
improvements on I-80.
Three interchanges provide access from Interstate 80 to El Cerrito:
1. The Central Avenue Interchange is the first El Cerrito Interchange from the
    south. Although the interchange is located in the City of Richmond, as is the
    Interstate 580 Interchange with Central Avenue, Central Avenue is the primary
    travel route to southern El Cerrito, the El Cerrito Plaza and the El Cerrito Plaza
    BART Station.
2. The Carlson Boulevard Interchanges with Interstate 80 and 580 are also located
    in the City of Richmond. Although these interchanges provide access to areas of
    the Richmond Annex, they provide only limited benefit to the City of El Cerrito
August 30, 1999                                                        Transportation and Circulation 5-1

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                         because there is no direct connection between Carlson Boulevard and San Pablo
                         Avenue in the vicinity of the interchanges.
                     3. The Cutting Boulevard/Potrero Avenue Interchange with Interstate 80 is a split
                         interchange with Cutting Boulevard providing the northbound I-80 on- and off-
                         ramps and Potrero Avenue providing the southbound Interstate 80 on- and off-
                         ramps. This split freeway ramp configuration, in combination with the heavy
                         traffic flows to and from local businesses, adjacent residential areas, and the
                         BART Station creates congestion in the Del Norte area.
                     Traffic conditions on Interstate 80 and at its interchanges have a major influence on
                     El Cerrito surface streets. When an accident or unusual condition causes a
                     breakdown in freeway traffic flow, regional traffic diverts to local arterials: San
                     Pablo Avenue (State Route 123) and the portions of Cutting Boulevard, Potrero
                     Avenue, and Central Avenue west of San Pablo Avenue. San Pablo Avenue is very
                     heavily affected by regional transportation conditions because it parallels Interstate
                     80 from the City of Emeryville to the City of San Pablo and beyond as far as the
                     Carquinez Bridge, serving as an alternative travel route for regional and semi-
                     regional traffic.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     Traffic Operations
                     Figure 7 identifies existing and projected (under General Plan build-out conditions)
                     daily traffic volumes on area streets and highways. The operation of transportation
                     facilities (freeways, roadways, intersections) is classified in six “level-of-service”
                     categories. Level of service (LOS) is defined in terms of a letter grade ranging from
                     A to F. LOS A is the best level of operation, representing free flow conditions, and
                     LOS F is the worst level of operation, representing excessive delays, long vehicle
                     queues, and generally intolerable conditions. The City of El Cerrito policy calls for
                     achievement of LOS D or better conditions.
                     Most intersections in El Cerrito currently operate at LOS C or better. All City
                     operated intersections (not along San Pablo Avenue) operate at LOS A. Traffic
                     operation in the Del Norte area, other portions of San Pablo Avenue, and the
                     Central Avenue Interchange can be as bad as LOS E or F conditions when an
                     incident on Interstate 80 results in a higher-than-normal diversion of regional traffic.
                     As of 1999, traffic on Central Avenue can be quite backed up. It is not known,
                     without further study, whether this is a temporary or ongoing problem.
5-4 Transportation and Circulation                                                       August 30, 1999

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     Truck Routes
                     In accordance with the California Vehicle Code, trucks are allowed on all streets to
                     make deliveries. However, through truck traffic (trucks on a street where no
                     delivery is being made) is not permitted on local streets. The state allows local
                     jurisdictions to limit truck traffic on other streets as well by designating truck routes
                     that provide access to all areas of the City. El Cerrito does not post accepted truck
                     route signs, but it posts truck prohibitions and areas with truck weight limits (see
                     Figure 8).
                     Truck prohibition signs are posted in the southwest corner of the City in the area
                     bounded by Central Avenue, Carlson Boulevard, Cerrito Creek, and the City of
                     Richmond City limits. Truck weight limits are used in El Cerrito to prohibit heavy
                     trucks from attempting to travel on steep streets such as Moeser Lane and the
                     eastern portion of Potrero Avenue. Other streets with truck weight limits are a
                     small segment of Cutting Boulevard between Fairview Avenue and Arlington
                     Boulevard, and Rifle Range Road east of Arlington Boulevard.
                     Emergency Response Routes
                     Emergency response routes are the routes that police, fire and paramedic vehicles
                     use when traveling to the scene of an emergency. These routes are generally located
                     on streets with adequate width to accommodate large vehicles. All arterials are
                     generally considered part of the emergency response routes, although emergency
                     vehicles may avoid these streets during heavy peaks when the arterials are congested.
                     El Cerrito emergency response routes are shown in Figure 8.
5-6 Transportation and Circulation                                                          August 30, 1999
EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     Parking
                     Most residences in El Cerrito have at least one off-street parking space, and there is
                     generally on-street parking available for additional cars and the vehicles of visitors.
                     Most non-residential uses (retail and office) in El Cerrito also have an adequate
                     supply of on-site parking with the exception of many commercial areas on San
                     Pablo Avenue. Along much of San Pablo Avenue, older businesses do not provide
                     off-street parking facilities, leaving only on-street parking for customers, which is
                     sometimes inadequate. This lack of parking tends to thwart full productive use of
                     properties.
                     The other exception is in the vicinities of the two BART stations, which experience
                     high parking occupancies and parking spillover onto adjacent properties.
                     Neighborhood parking permits have been used to protect residential areas
                     surrounding BART stations from parking intrusion. In areas with neighborhood
                     parking permits (see Figure 9), residents displaying parking permit stickers are
                     permitted to park for an unlimited time. Vehicles without permits can park for only
                     two or four hours, depending on the posted sign, and run the risk of being ticketed
                     if they park for a longer time.
                     BART Stations
                     The Del Norte BART Station provides over 2,000 off-street parking spaces,
                     including about 1,300 in a parking structure. There are also about 1,000 on-street
                     parking spaces within a half-mile radius of the BART Station.
                     El Cerrito Plaza BART contains about 800 on-site parking spaces. In addition, by
                     courtesy of the El Cerrito Plaza Shopping Center operators, BART riders are
                     currently permitted to park on a portion of the El Cerrito Plaza Shopping Center
                     parking area. This generally is parking that, in the past, served the Emporium store,
                     which closed in 1996. Based on observations made in March 1997, about 350
                     BART riders were parking on the Plaza site. As of spring 1999, the owners of the
                     Plaza are proposing substantial reconstruction of the center, and it is not expected
                     that BART patrons will continue to be able to park on the side of the shopping
                     center.
                     Funds are available to the City from the Contra Costa Transportation Authority to
                     build a parking structure of approximately 400 spaces as an expansion of BART
                     patron parking. Although the City has considered locating the structure on a
                     portion of the shopping center site, it appears most likely that the parking will be
                     developed on BART property, possibly in conjunction with a mixed-use
                     development on the western part of the BART site.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                      Transit
                      El Cerrito is served primarily by AC Transit and BART but, because the Del Norte
                      BART station is a major transit transfer location, it is also served by WestCAT
                      Transit, Vallejo Transit, and Golden Gate Transit. Figure 10 shows the current
                      transit routes within El Cerrito.
                      BART
                      The El Cerrito Del Norte and El Cerrito Plaza BART stations lie on the
                      Richmond - Fremont and Richmond – San Francisco/Colma lines. The El Cerrito
                      BART station is the closest station to the Bay on the East Bay portion of the
                      system. BART service runs from approximately 4 a.m. to midnight, with headways
                      of approximately 15 minutes throughout the day. Figures provided by BART in
                      1996 showed that approximately 7,100 people enter and 8,000 people exit the Del
                      Norte BART station, the larger of the two stations, during a typical weekday. The
                      imbalance is due primarily to morning peak period carpoolers (including casual
                      carpoolers) who use BART to return in the afternoon. Roughly 28 percent of the
                      daily BART traffic occurs during the a.m. peak period (6 to 9 a.m.) and 32 percent
                      occurs during the p.m. peak period (4 to 7 p.m.).
                      On weekends, BART service is offered from 6 a.m. to midnight on Saturdays and 8
                      a.m. to midnight on Sundays, with headways of approximately 20 minutes
                      throughout the day. Figures provided by BART in 1996 showed that approximately
                      2,500 people enter and 2,900 people exit the Del Norte BART station during a
                      typical Saturday.
                      AC Transit
                      AC Transit bus coverage within El Cerrito is fairly comprehensive, with most
                      houses within a quarter mile of a transit stop and all houses within a half-mile. Due
                      to budget constraints, AC Transit has reduced or eliminated weekend and off-peak
                      (particularly evening) service on many routes such that route frequencies are less
                      than desired frequencies on most routes. Transit routes are: San Pablo Avenue; the
                      Colusa Avenue – Ashbury Avenue – Navellier Street – Ganges Street – Glen Mawr
                      Avenue – Cutting Boulevard corridor; Arlington Boulevard in the north-south
                      directions; Barrett Avenue; Cutting Boulevard; Potrero Avenue; Stockton Avenue;
                      and the Central Avenue – Fairmount Avenue corridor in the east-west direction.
                      San Pablo Avenue is one of AC Transit's key transit corridors. AC Transit has
                      received grant funding and is scheduled to prepare a planning study for the San
                      Pablo Avenue corridor. The study will evaluate bus rapid transit treatments for
                      high-frequency routes: Line 72, which serves North Oakland, and Line 82, which
                      serves South and East Oakland. The study will also evaluate physical and
                      technological enhancements that can be used to improve transit vehicle travel times.
                      Transit First
                      The City of El Cerrito has taken a step toward making AC Transit more efficient by
                      adopting a Transit First Policy. It is the official policy of the City of El Cerrito to
                      encourage public transit among El Cerrito residents and visitors, and expedite the
                      movement of transit vehicles.

                      Bicycles
                      Bicycle travel is possible on several north-south and east-west streets in the City of
                      El Cerrito. Topography poses a serious challenge to bicycling and walking in the
                      eastern portion of the City, but the majority of El Cerrito streets are flat or have
                      only small grades (5 percent of less). Figure 11 shows the existing bicycle and trail
                      facilities in El Cerrito.
                      The City of El Cerrito has a number of hiking trails and dedicated public paths, but
                      the Ohlone Greenway, which travels under the BART tracks from the City's
                      southern border to San Pablo Avenue just south of MacDonald Avenue, is the only
                      formal multi-use trail. The El Cerrito Plaza Shopping Center renovation may also
                      include a multi-use trail along Cerrito Creek at the City's southern boundary.
                      Albany proposes a continuation of this trail to Pierce Street along the southern side
                      of Cerrito Creek in its Bicycle Master Plan, but the two cities would likely need to
                      work together on this effort since Cerrito Creek forms the border between the
                      cities.
                      There are a number of informal trails in the City of El Cerrito that provide hiking
                      and mountain-biking opportunities. These trails are unimproved pathways in many
                      locations but provide high quality recreation experiences.
                      El Cerrito does not currently have any bike lanes or bike routes, but a number of
                      streets are wide enough to permit easy implementation. The City of Albany Bicycle
                      Master Plan proposes bike lanes on Santa Fe Avenue, which leads to Colusa Avenue,
                      and bike routes on Cornell Avenue, which leads to El Cerrito Plaza and aligns
                      roughly with Liberty Street, and Adams Street, which aligns with Carlson Boulevard.
                      At Adams Street, a bicycle and pedestrian bridge is proposed over the Cerrito Creek.
                      Both BART stations, El Cerrito Plaza, and many schools currently provide bicycle
                      parking facilities. BART stations have historically been locations where bicycles are
                      stolen or vandalized. The City of El Cerrito is currently considering bicycle
                      enclosures at both BART stations. The City has recently installed bicycle racks at
                      intervals along San Pablo Avenue, with funding from the Bay Area Air Quality
                      Management District.
                      Pedestrian
                      A continuous and interconnected system of sidewalks is available throughout most
                      of El Cerrito, although many major intersections lack striped crosswalks or curb
                      cuts. One exception is the segment of Contra Costa Boulevard between Moeser
                      Lane and Devonshire Drive, which lacks sidewalks (see Figure 11). One of the key
                      pedestrian corridors in El Cerrito is San Pablo Avenue. San Pablo Avenue provides
                      10- to 20- foot sidewalks on both sides of the street throughout most of its length.
                      Based on the California Vehicle Code, even where no striped crosswalks are
                      provided, pedestrians have the right to cross at all corners of intersections unless
                      pedestrian traffic is explicitly prohibited with barriers and signs such as those
                      installed at the intersection of San Pablo Avenue and Cutting Boulevard. When

                                                                                    EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
intersection approaches are uncontrolled or controlled by stop signs, pedestrians
have the right-of-way (i.e., vehicles are required to yield to pedestrians in the
crosswalk).
Figure 11 identifies pedestrian obstacles in El Cerrito. Most of the pedestrian
obstacles relate to inadequate pedestrian crosswalks. These occur near both BART
stations; the primary problem is the lack of a signed and striped crosswalk. Areas
lacking crosswalks are San Pablo Avenue between Cutting Boulevard and Hill
Street, Hill Street east of San Pablo Avenue, and Fairmount Avenue between
Liberty and Richmond Streets.
As is the case elsewhere in the East Bay Hills, the El Cerrito hill neighborhoods
contain a number of narrow city-owned rights-of-way, which serve as mid-block
paths running between private properties. The rights-of-way generally are five to
fifteen feet in width. Some have been improved by the placement of asphalt or
concrete pathways or steps. The majority, however, are unimproved. The city has
not had the financial resources to improve the pathways that remain unimproved
and those that are improved are not maintained on a regular basis. In some cases
these open areas have been a subject of complaints from adjacent neighbors about
trees and vegetation. On the other hand, improvement and maintenance of these
public rights-of-way would enhance pedestrian enjoyment of the City.
Freeway interchanges also tend to provide limited pedestrian facilities, and, where
free right turns are provided at on- and off-ramps, pedestrians must cross an
uncontrolled stream of traffic. This occurs at the Cutting Boulevard, Potrero
Avenue, and Carlson Boulevard interchanges. Although uncontrolled right turns do
not exist at the Central Avenue Interchange, the number and length of street
crossings required to get from the east side of Interstate 80 to the west side makes
pedestrian travel uncomfortable.

B. Trends
Assumptions
Traffic in El Cerrito will continue to be heavily influenced by conditions on
Interstate 80 and BART. The influences are particularly marked during periods with
incidents on the freeway or delays in BART service. However, on a day-to-day
basis, the majority of traffic using El Cerrito's streets is locally generated, either
beginning and/or ending within El Cerrito.
Regional traffic access to El Cerrito's BART stations also heavily affects conditions
on streets in the Del Norte area and, to a much smaller degree, in the El Cerrito
Plaza area.
The Interstate 80 Corridor
The Interstate 80 corridor consists of Interstate 80, San Pablo Avenue, and other
north-south streets that provide continuous travel opportunities in El Cerrito.
Regional growth forecasts indicate that congestion in the Bay Area is expected to
grow significantly. The bulk of this growth will occur in areas with significant new
development such as San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties. For Interstate 80
through El Cerrito, regional forecasts indicate an average 2.4 percent traffic growth
per year through the year 2020.
With this level of growth on an already congested freeway, drivers may seek parallel
alternative travel routes such as San Pablo Avenue. It is important to note,
however, that San Pablo Avenue will also become more congested due to
development within El Cerrito. In addition, in an effort to reduce the impacts of
regional traffic on El Cerrito, no significant capacity enhancements are
recommended for San Pablo Avenue. As a result, San Pablo Avenue will become a
less attractive route. The result of increased travel demand and congestion on the
principal routes within the Interstate 80 corridor is likely to be changes in the times
of day that people travel (i.e., peak hour spreading), changes in travel modes (i.e.,
increased use of transit), and possibly changes in destinations (i.e., elimination of
trips within the corridor).
The forecasts made for the General Plan build-out assume that the amount of
through traffic currently on San Pablo Avenue will increase by at least 15% to 20%.
This is based on an estimate that about one-fourth to one-third of the peak hour
traffic presently on San Pablo Avenue consists of through trips, neither beginning
nor ending in El Cerrito. As a result of this 15% to 20% growth in the through-trip
component, the total amount of traffic on San Pablo Avenue will increase by about
5%. Traffic will also grow as a result of new development within El Cerrito. This
traffic growth is estimated using a detailed traffic forecasting model, representing
the potential changes in activity levels in over 20 different sub-sectors of the City.
The locally-generated growth is added to adjusted background traffic. Combined,
the effects of regional and local growth produce increases in San Pablo Avenue
traffic of approximately 50%.
August 30, 1999                                                        Transportation and Circulation 5-15
EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                      BART
                      El Cerrito transportation is also heavily influenced by BART and could change
                      dramatically if BART were to extend service further along the Richmond Line or if a
                      connection were made to BART in Richmond with a commute rail line, making Del
                      Norte BART station less of a regional facility. The General Plan forecasts do not
                      assume a BART extension because no extension has been programmed or funded
                      within the lifetime of the General Plan.
                      Automobile travel to individual BART stations is also heavily influenced by the
                      amount of parking available at or near the station. Parking supply around both
                      BART stations is decreasing, even when considering the proposed structure at the
                      Plaza station, and no additional parking increases are programmed or funded.
                      In view of the above factors, the traffic forecasts assume a modest 5% increase in
                      vehicle traffic to the Del Norte BART station. Although modest, this traffic growth
                      assumption is conservatively high, based on the fact that parking supplies at both
                      BART stations is decreasing, and demands from local sources will be increasing as
                      new land uses emerge in El Cerrito in accordance with the General Plan.
                      Travel Forecasts
                      Figure 7 showed the daily traffic volumes on major streets in El Cerrito under
                      General Plan build-out conditions assuming land uses described in the Community
                      Development and Design Chapter. Traffic on most residential streets in El Cerrito
                      will remain constant. Along minor arterials, traffic will grow by 5 to 10%, with the
                      exceptions of Eastshore Boulevard and the portion of Fairmount Avenue near San
                      Pablo Avenue, which have projected growth of about 65 percent. Along major
                      arterial, traffic will grow by 30 to 50 percent. For San Pablo Avenue, traffic will
                      increase by an average of about 50 percent, or about 2.5 percent per year.
                      Modeling Methods
                      Traffic modeling is a four-step process consisting of trip generation, trip
                      distribution, mode split, and trip assignment. The modeling effort undertaken as
                      part of the El Cerrito General Plan update includes application of
                      state-of-the-practice modeling techniques using the Contra Costa Transportation
                      Authority (CCTA) West County Model and a local-area sub-model developed for El
                      Cerrito. The CCTA model was used to derive regional growth and trip distribution
                      assumptions. The sub-area model was used to generate, distribute and assign traffic
                      from developments within El Cerrito. The local area model developed for El
                      Cerrito contains about 20 traffic analysis zones, which is more detail than similar
                      models in other jurisdictions and significantly more zones than are contained within
                      the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) or CCTA models within El
                      Cerrito. The local area model was also validated against highly sophisticated models
                      like the CCTA and MTC models, through the series of reasonableness checks
                      described below.

Reasonableness Checks
With all modeling efforts, it is essential that model results be reviewed for
reasonableness. For the El Cerrito model, reasonableness checks included
comparisons of projected growth with: (1) historic growth trends, (2) the CCTA
model, (3) the MTC model, and (4) the El Cerrito Evaluation of Interstate 80
Expansion of Traffic Impact.
      •  Historic Growth Trends - Over the last 15 years, traffic forecasts on San
         Pablo Avenue have increased about 0.8 percent per year. (California
         Department of Transportation, Volumes on California State Highways,
         1980, 1990, and 1995)
      •  CCTA Model - The CCTA model predicts a 1.5-percent per year increase in
         daily traffic and negligible PM peak hour traffic growth. (West Contra Costa
         County Action Plan for Routes of Regional Significance, December 4,
         1994)
      •  MTC Model - The MTC predicts a growth rate of less than one percent per
         year. (Metropolitan Transportation Commission Regional Model Loaded
         AM Peak Hour Networks for 1990, 2005, and 2015, February 9, 1994 and
         September 3, 1996)
      •  El Cerrito Evaluation of Interstate 80 Expansion of Traffic Impact
         (October 11, 1995) - The subject study was prepared for the City and MTC
         in anticipation of the Interstate 80 reconstruction project. It predicts a
         reduction in San Pablo Avenue traffic levels between 1990 and 2000 due to
         expansion of Interstate 80 and a modest increase between 2000 and 2010,
         with the net result that 2010 traffic volumes would be similar to or even
         slightly lower than 1995 volumes.
It is important to note, that each of the above references reports traffic growth from
all sources, including growth and shifts in through traffic and locally generated
traffic. Therefore, the range of estimates from these references is a growth rate in
total traffic on San Pablo Avenue of 1.5% a year or less. By comparison the El
Cerrito General Plan build-out projected a growth rate of 2.5 percent per year. As
these reasonableness checks indicate, the General Plan forecast is a worst-case
assessment of potential traffic conditions.
Although the General Plan forecasts, under worst-case assumptions, considerable
traffic growth on El Cerrito arterials, most arterials will have sufficient capacity to
accommodate expected traffic growth, but delays can be expected to increase
significantly throughout the City. Specific spot improvements required to facilitate
acceptable traffic flow are described in the next section. Improvements are
specified in a manner that attempts to promote a balance among the competing
access and mobility needs of the community. This balance will allow worse traffic
congestion on the cities arterials, as long as they: 1) do not violate the City's Level
of Service standards, 2) provide a closer balance between congestion on the freeway
and congestion on the parallel arterial to discourage traffic diversions from the

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                      freeway, and 3) maintain street widths and pedestrian crossing distances at levels
                      that promote walking, bicycling and transit use, rather than placing the primary
                      emphasis on facilitating traffic flow.
                      Traffic Operations
                      The projections indicate that most intersections in El Cerrito will continue to
                      operate at LOS C or better in the future. Around El Cerrito Plaza, the intersections
                      of San Pablo and Central avenues and San Pablo and Fairmount avenues will
                      deteriorate to LOS D, but will still operate acceptably. Three intersections will
                      deteriorate to LOS E or worse and will require improvements. The intersections
                      and improvements necessary to attain LOS D or better are described below.
                      • San Pablo Avenue/Knott Avenue, which is controlled by stop signs on the Knott
                         Avenue approaches, will operate at LOS F under General Plan build-out
                         conditions. Signalization of the intersection would improve its operation to LOS
                         C.
                      • San Pablo Avenue/Hill Street/Eastshore Boulevard, which is a signalized
                         intersection with five intersection approaches, is projected to deteriorate to LOS
                         E conditions under General Plan build-out conditions. The addition of an
                         exclusive southbound right-turn lane on San Pablo Avenue to Eastshore
                         Boulevard, an exclusive westbound left-turn lane on Hill Street to San Pablo
                         Avenue, and a second exclusive eastbound left-turn lane from Eastshore
                         Boulevard to San Pablo Avenue would improve this intersection to LOS D.
                      • Key Boulevard/Cutting Boulevard, which is controlled by all-way stop signs, will
                         operate at LOS E under General Plan build-out conditions. The addition of a
                         southbound right-turn lane on Key Boulevard will improve the intersection’s
                         operations to LOS C.
                      These improvements are not currently programmed or funded but would likely be
                      made in combination with development of adjacent and surrounding properties.
                      Although planning-level service level calculations indicate that the Central Avenue
                      interchange with I-80 will operate acceptably under future conditions, due to severe
                      operational constraints including close intersection spacing and multiple approach
                      lanes and changes in area freeway ramp configurations, a more detailed review of
                      traffic operations at this interchange is recommended.

T2.1      Land Use Patterns. Recognize the link         • Development Review
          between land use and transportation.
          Promote land use and development
          patterns that encourage walking,
          bicycling, and transit use. Emphasize
          high-density and mixed land use patterns
          that promote transit and pedestrian travel.
          Where feasible, emphasize the following
          land use measures:
          1. Promote conveniently located
               neighborhood complexes that
               provide housing and commercial
               services near employment centers and
               within transit corridors.
          2. Promote land use patterns that
               maximize trip-linking opportunities
               by assembling uses that allow people
               to take care of a variety of daily
               needs.
          3. Encourage pedestrian-oriented land
               use and urban design that can have a
               demonstrable effect on transportation
               choices.
          4. Direct growth to occur along transit
               corridors.

          around BART stations by using parking         • Parking Regulations
          structures. To reduce parking demand at
          BART stations, encourage an improved
          transit feeder system to BART stations
          including consideration of new transit
          technologies. Encourage BART parking
          not to obstruct pedestrian access from

                      Implementation measures below are listed in alphabetical order.
                      1. Bicycle Master Plan. Prepare a comprehensive Bicycle Master Plan that
                          complies with the 13 elements outlined in the California Bicycle Lane Account
                          (BLA). The Bicycle Master Plan should include an active public input process to
                          develop a comprehensive bicycle circulation and support facilities system; design
                          standards for bicycle facilities; standards for the provision of bicycle support
                          facilities; evaluation of current bicycle education and promotion programs in El
                          Cerrito; analysis of bicycle accidents in El Cerrito; and a capital improvement
                          program. The Bicycle Master Plan should encourage local access to the BART
                          stations by bicycling as an alternative to short-distance driving. Develop a
                          strategic approach to pursuing state and federal funding for bicycle projects,
                          working closely with surrounding jurisdictions and Contra Costa County. Work
                          with the City of Richmond to provide a clear connection between the Ohlone
                          Greenway and the planned Richmond Greenway.
                      2. Capital Improvement Program. Ensure that adequate funding is available to
                          implement transportation improvements required to mitigate the effects of
                          growth.
                      3. Circulation Map. Use the circulation map in the General Plan to guide
                          activities related to goods movement, emergency routes, and street closures.
                      4. Development Review. Undertake development reviews to ensure compliance
                          with applicable local, regional, state, and federal laws and adopted policies.
                          Ensure that developers contribute funding for on-site and off-site
                          improvements. Adopt an ordinance requiring developers to do the following:
                         a.   Construct transportation improvements along their property frontages when
                              appropriate; and
                         b. Fund traffic impact studies that identify on-site and off-site effects and
                              mitigation measures.

5. Intergovernmental Coordination. Coordinate with adjacent jurisdictions, the
    Metropolitan Transportation Commission, Contra Costa County, AC Transit,
    BART, Caltrans, and other applicable agencies. The Contra Costa County
    Transportation Authority (CCTA) West County Action Plan for Routes of
    Regional Significance (12/9/94) defines a regional vision for Hercules, Pinole,
    San Pablo, Richmond, and El Cerrito. This document defines many of the City’s
    positions with respect to regional transportation improvements. Some of the
    key Action Plan items are:
   a.  Support inclusion of the West County BART extension in the MTC Track 2
       Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) project lists.
   b. Pursue every opportunity to speed the funding and construction of the West
   c.  Expand efforts urging MTC to determine the best express transit system(s)
       for the Interstate 80 corridor and, based on the results of the MTC study,
       encourage timely implementation of planned transit capital and service
       improvements.
   d. Promote Carquinez Bridge alternatives that will achieve mainline metering of
       Interstate 80 into West Contra Costa County.
   e.  Support efforts by Caltrans, CCTA, and MTC to tailor capacity of the
       Carquinez Bridge improvements to downstream capacity.
   f.  Support efforts by AC Transit to study the feasibility of bus rapid transit
       treatments along San Pablo Avenue.
   g. Support mixed-use development, high employment commercial, and higher-
       density residential development in transit corridors and near BART stations.
   h. Consider additional transit mitigation alternatives, as appropriate, in future
       Action Plan Deficiency Strategies.
   In addition to, and in support of, these regional key items, the following are City
   of El Cerrito interagency coordination positions:
   a.  As opportunities present themselves, improve freeway access to El Cerrito,
       particularly around the Del Norte area and at the Central Avenue
       interchange.
   b. Oppose transportation projects that would diminish access to Interstate 80
       from El Cerrito.
   c.  Oppose regional capacity enhancements to San Pablo Avenue except when
       the improvements serve local traffic and do not compromise bus, pedestrian
       and bicycle travel.
   d. Support physical enhancements to San Pablo Avenue to make it a transit and
       pedestrian friendly multi-modal street.
   e.  Encourage the City of Richmond and Caltrans to conduct a detailed
       operations analysis of the Central Avenue interchange and be an active
       participant in this study. This study should address an existing base year
       condition as well as a 20-year growth forecast including expected growth

                              from development in El Cerrito, Richmond and Albany. It should also
                              address weekday and Saturday conditions. It should be conducted using a
                              detailed operations analysis such as Synchro and/or CORSIM.
                      6. Neighborhood Traffic Management Plan. Develop a Neighborhood Traffic
                          Management Program (NTMP) to respond to problems in a consistent and
                          methodical way. The NTMP should have a strong citizen participation element
                          so that residents can evaluate the benefits and trade-offs of various measures and
                          be actively involved in the decision-making process. Develop a standard
                          procedure for residents to initiate a local NTMP and provide a handbook
                          describing the process and specific steps. At a minimum, the handbook should
                          define the standard procedure, type of data collection, toolbox of potential
                          traffic calming measures, prioritization methodology, and funding mechanism(s).
                          Ensure that the process is vigorously maintained and administered by City staff
                          at all levels.
                      7. Parking Management Plan. Conduct an evaluation of long-term parking
                          needs in commercial areas with current or anticipated parking shortages.
                          Investigate the feasibility of developing common off-street parking facilities in
                          target areas. Consider various funding sources for new parking facilities
                          including in-lieu fees for development projects, redevelopment money, and
                          formation of parking assessment districts.
                      8. Parking Regulations. Develop parking requirements that permit projects to
                          provide less parking if they can demonstrate high use of alternative
                          transportation modes. Specify maximum and minimum parking ratios. Allow a
                          reduction in the individual use parking requirements where two or more non-
                          residential uses provide joint parking, and encourage developers of compatible
                          land uses to provide joint parking facilities. Encourage developers to locate
                          parking lots to the rear or sides of buildings, except where infeasible, to prevent
                          lots from becoming barriers to walking.
                      9. Pavement Management Plan. Maintain a systematic pavement management
                          program and identify and prioritize maintenance projects in the City’s Capital
                          Improvement Program (CIP).             Street maintenance should also include
                          maintenance and regular cleaning of bicycle routes to remove debris and poor
                          pavement conditions that discourage bicycle riding. The Pavement Management
                          Plan should also address signage and pavement on the Ohlone Greenway.
                      10. Pedestrian Circulation Plan. Review existing pedestrian circulation within the

                          constrained locations (including pedestrian street crossings), and incorporate
                          pedestrian enhancement projects into the City Capital Improvement Program
                          (CIP). Encourage local access to BART stations by walking as an alternative to
                          short-distance driving. Develop new sidewalk width standards consistent with
                          the type and intensity of adjacent land use. Attention should be paid to the issue

    of tree damage to sidewalks and obstruction of sidewalks by signs.            When
    constructing or modifying sidewalks:
   a.   Maintain accessibility for all users.
   b. Within commercial, office, and mixed-use areas, provide or improve sidewalk
        pedestrian amenities, such as seating, bicycle parking, pedestrian-scale
        lighting, street trees, flower boxes, trash receptacles, drinking fountains, and
        awnings. In many cases, this may be in combination with the development
        of adjacent properties.
   c.   Systematically inspect and maintain sidewalk facilities to clean and repair
        damaged surfaces and remove or relocate impediments, such as poles and
        newspaper racks that interfere with pedestrian flow.
   d. Build at sufficient width to allow at least two people to walk side-by-side.
        Make sidewalk widths in commercial areas more generous.
   e.   Where possible, channel or guide pedestrian traffic along sidewalks to
        increase commercial opportunities.
   As part of a pedestrian circulation plan the City should examine the value for
   pedestrians of mid-block paths in the hills, and should identify improvements
   needed to make them safe and effective routes, as well as identify an ongoing
   maintenance program. The City should consider for abandonment paths that
   could not affordably and effectively function as part of the pedestrian circulation
   system.
11. Residential Permit Parking Program. Maintain the City’s current residential
    permit parking program. Develop a standard procedure for evaluating permit
    parking requests and implementing residential permit parking.
12. Streetscape Design Standards. Develop street typologies (residential street,
    commercial main street, boulevard, etc.) with design standards to protect the role
    of the street as a public space.
13. Traffic Monitoring. Ensure regular monitoring of traffic levels and intersection
    capacity to update base data and respond to changing conditions.
14. Transit First Policy. It is the official policy of the City of El Cerrito to
    encourage and promote the use of public transit among El Cerrito residents and
    visitors, and expedite the movement of transit vehicles. The City has directed
    the Planning Commission, the Design Review Board and the Community
    Development Department to consider and incorporate various methods of
    expediting transit service and encouraging greater use of transit. Some of the
    specific methods for accomplishing these goals are:
    a.   Evaluation of automobile turning movements that conflict with transit
         vehicles;
    b. Consideration of transit preemption;

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                          c.   Evaluation and optimization of bus stop locations, designs and maintenance;
                               and
                          d. Provision of improvements to facilitate pedestrian and bicycle access to
                               transit stops.
                      15. Transportation System Performance Measures. Develop a level-of-service
                          standard for traffic operations that assesses service levels for all street users,
                          including buses, pedestrians, and bicycles. Consider modifying the City’s current
                          LOS D standard to allow for higher levels of automobile congestion during peak
                          hours in order to reduce the need for improvements that decrease opportunities
                          for alternative transportation modes or reduce parking supply.
                         Using a level of service standard worse than LOS D maybe considered
                         acceptable where:
                         a.     Upstream or downstream bottlenecks control the flow of traffic through an
                                intersection such that capacity enhancements (i.e., improvements) would
                                have marginal benefit;
                         b.     Retaining a bottleneck would discourage regional or semi-regional traffic
                                from using a facility; or
                         c.     Traffic capacity enhancements would degrade pedestrian, transit or bicycle
                                conditions (i.e., additional lanes increases pedestrian crossing distances).
                         In order to maintain consistency with the Congestion Management Plan, LOS E
                         is the worst level of service standard that could be adopted for San Pablo
                         Avenue.
                      16. Preference for Cut-through Streets. In conjunction with the Neighborhood
                          Traffic Management Plan, neighborhoods along residentail streets which bear
                          cut-through traffic (as measured by up-to-date traffic data) should be given
                          priority for neighborhood improvements to compensate for the effects of traffic.
                          In addition to traffic management techniques, such improvements might include
                          amenities such as street tree planting and utility undergrounding.

17. Travel Demand Management (TDM). Support and promote TDM measures
    to reduce the percentage of person trips made by automobile and to reduce the
    annual vehicle miles of travel. Reduce the percentage of trips made by
    automobile and provide the opportunity and facilities to divert trips from
    automobiles to other modes. Encourage small businesses in areas of
    employment concentration to form cooperatives that can collectively provide
    effective TDM options to employees.

CHAPTER 6 PUBLIC FACILITIES
                                   AND SERVICES
Public services and facilities – including basic utilities and infrastructure – must be
considered in the planning process in order to identify potential opportunities and
constraints for new development. Public service and facility issues relate to several
of the state’s mandatory general plan elements, including Safety, Conservation,
Open Space, and Land Use. Since there is a direct relationship between the City’s
ability to provide community services and the public facilities available in the
community, it is appropriate that public facility and public service policies and goals
be included in the General Plan.
The Public Facilities and Services element includes those services, facilities, and
capital improvements needed to service the entire community, including the City
Hall, police and fire facilities, and parks. A range of services and facilities, including
schools and libraries, are provided to El Cerrito residents by other service providers.
The City works with the West Contra Costa Unified School District (WCCUSD),
Contra Costa County, and other service providers to maintain service to current and
future residents and employees.
Specific public facility and service needs, goals, and policies are addressed in the
following subsections:
•    Parks and Recreation
•    Non-Recreational Facilities
•    Public Services and Infrastructure
PARKS, RECREATION, AND OPEN SPACE
A. Setting
El Cerrito is blessed with many fine parks, major open space areas, several creeks,
and easy access to the regional park system. Residents of the City enjoy a rich
diversity of parks and recreational opportunities, including a variety of City-operated
recreational programs (including childcare programs) and City-maintained parks and
recreation facilities. While program fees have helped cover basic service costs,
however, growing demand for these services and the age of many recreation
facilities (mostly built in the 1950s and 1960s) have resulted in a growing list of
deferred facility capital improvement needs.
August 30, 1999                                                            Public Facilities and Services 6-1

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                       Existing Facilities
                       Park and open space facilities in El Cerrito include approximately 31.6 acres of City-
                       owned parks, 99.9 acres of City-owned open space, 23.3 acres of other City-
                       maintained recreational facilities, and 26.6 acres of school district owned and
                       maintained recreational areas for a total of approximately 181.4 acres of publicly
                       owned recreation and open space facilities (Table 6-1). The amount of City-owned
                       open space includes approximately 2.9 acres in two areas not previously designated
                       for recreation or open space, but so designated by this Plan. These figures do not
                       include two significant creek areas – Cerrito Creek at El Cerrito Plaza and Baxter
                       Creek near Key Boulevard – that total approximately 2.6 acres, which may be
                       secured through easements rather than fee title.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                       In addition to City facilities, El Cerritans benefit from close proximity to major
                       regional recreation facilities operated by the East Bay Regional Park District
                       (EBRPD). These facilities include Wildcat Canyon Regional Park, located just east
                       of El Cerrito; Point Isabel Regional Shoreline, located west of El Cerrito; and
                       Miller-Knox Regional Shoreline, located west of El Cerrito.
                       Recreation Programs
                       The City also operates a wide range of recreation programs:
                       •   Adult Recreation Programs. This includes programs and classes covering a
                           range of activities and topics. The programs serve 400 to 500 people per week
                           and are paid for by class fees. The department also organizes and supervises
                           men’s and women’s softball leagues each summer.
                       •   Senior Center. The City leases the “Open House” Senior Center from the
                           West Contra Costa Unified School District. The center is located at 6500
                           Stockton Avenue, near the City library, and includes a dining area, lounge, and
                           meeting rooms. The facility accommodates social activities such as dances,
                           classes, crafts, and meetings. It also houses programs available to older
                           residents, including daily lunch, home-delivered meals, grocery shopping, adult
                           day care program, equipment loans for disabled persons, counseling, and senior
                           discount card services. The center is funded by participants, private donations
                           and the general fund, and serves between 800 and 1,000 seniors per week. The
                           center also handles a discount paratransit voucher program and special van trips
                           for seniors and disabled riders, with funds received from Measure C.
                       •   Youth Services. The City provides childcare (for children 5 to 12 years), pre-
                           school programs (20 months to 5 years), and summer day camps (3.5 to 15
                           years). Childcare is provided in state-licensed centers adjacent to each of the
                           four public elementary schools in El Cerrito. In addition, the City provides an
                           offsite childcare center and transportation from schools for children on the
                           waiting list for the onsite centers. Over 1,500 youth participate in these
                           programs.
                       •   After-School Programs. Middle school students are served by free after-
                           school enrichment programs funded by the West County Public Education
                           Fund and delivered by staff of the City’s Community Services Department.
                           This program serves 200 Portola Middle School students.
                       •   Youth Recreation Programs. Fee-based classes and activities are provided by
                           independent contractors for youth aged 3 to 18 years. These programs serve
                           250 to 350 young people per month.
                       •   Jobs and Volunteer Positions. Youths aged 12 to 18 are encouraged to
                           participate in division activities as volunteers and counselors for younger
                           children.
                       •   Swim Programs. The El Cerrito Swim Center houses programs (classes, lap
                           swims, swim teams, etc.) that serve more than 2,000 swimmers each year.

The City’s Community Services Division also coordinates a number of community
events and fundraisers each year such as the Golf Scramble, July Fourth Celebration
(sponsored by the El Cerrito Rotary and co-sponsored by the City), and Annual Egg
Hunt. The Division also works to provide support for community-based groups
such as the Tennis Club, Garden Club, and NAACP Youth Group.
Many community facilities are available for rental to groups, including the
Community Center, Senior Center, clubhouses, Swim Center, and picnic facilities.
Open Space
El Cerrito is blessed with many fine parks, major open space areas, several creeks,
and easy access to the regional park system. The western portion of the City is built
on an extension of the San Francisco Bay Plain. The eastern half of the City extends
into the Berkeley Hills, with the ridgetop lying near the eastern City Limits.
Although these west-facing slopes are gentler than the east-facing slopes in Wildcat
Canyon, El Cerrito contains some very steep areas.
The City of El Cerrito has substantial open space and natural resources under
various forms of ownership. The City itself has large holdings, while other parcels
are under the stewardship of various public and non-profit agencies as well as
private landowners. The Hillside Natural Area (HNA), which is a 165-acre open
space area, is located east of Navellier Street and west of Contra Costa Drive. The
HNA has a number of trails that are used for both recreation and emergency access.
The largest portion of the area is centrally located, and contains a number of
woodlands, grasslands, and fuel breaks, and surrounds an old quarry. In addition,
there is a significant amount of undeveloped property adjacent to the HNA, owned
by a number of private individuals (zoned residential), and other lands which are
used by public entities including: EBMUD, PG&E, City of El Cerrito, and Stege
Sanitary District.
The City’s tree-covered hillsides, creeks, the west facing slopes of the Berkeley Hills,
and the approximately 2,600 acre Wildcat Canyon Regional Park, which is
contiguous with two-thirds of the City’s eastern boundary, are important resources
to preserve and enhance. Other open space resources include: (1) the Mira Vista
Country Club, a 110-acre parcel, zoned for open space use, but privately owned by
the Mira Vista Country Club – it contains a golf course, and the main
building/clubhouse; (2) Camp Herms Boy Scout Camp, which is an 18-acre parcel,
zoned for open space use, which is privately owned by the Boy Scouts of America
(BSA) and used as a camp; and (3) the Sunset View Cemetery, which comprises a
total of about 60 acres, with a small portion of the cemetery (6 acres) within the
bounds of the city and zoned for open space use.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                       Open space serves several purposes: (1) preservation of certain natural resources,
                       such as habitats and watersheds; (2) protection of lands used for the managed
                       production of resources, such as timber and crops; (3) provision of outdoor
                       recreation, such as parks and trails; and (4) protection of public health and safety,
                       such as lands subject to unstable soils or flooding. The same open space parcel
                       may serve several of these purposes. This General Plan includes the primary
                       discussion of open space in this chapter because of its close connection to parks
                       and recreation uses. Specific aspects of open space that relate to preservation of
                       natural resources or protection of public health and safety are discussed in
                       Chapter 7.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                        Level of Service Standards
                        Prior to adoption of this updated General Plan, El Cerrito did not adopt park
                        standards similar to those established by nationally recognized organizations, such as
                        the National Recreation and Parks Association. Instead, the City modified the 1975
                        General Plan to include a Community Services Element that laid out a detailed
                        activity program for every neighborhood park, each citywide recreation center, and
                        each specialized open space facility. In each instance, service standards and
                        programs were based on an evaluation of the limiting effects of geography,
                        distribution of age groups, and availability of complementary facilities (i.e., school
                        grounds and parks in adjoining cities). This approach worked well in the past, but a
                        new system is easier to implement and monitor. Many other cities, including some
                        that are subject to Contra Costa County Measure C, have adopted a commonly used
                        level of service standard of five acres of park and recreation facilities per thousand.
                        Adoption of this standard would allow some residential growth in El Cerrito
                        without having to acquire more land for parks.
                        B. Trends
                        The trend in El Cerrito, as well as in other cities in California, is an increasing
                        demand for more and better recreation facilities, especially sports fields. These
                        demands should be taken seriously because recreation facilities contribute to the
                        quality of life and economic well being of the City.
                        Several key issues of concern over the coming years relate to maintenance costs and
                        acquisition of open space.
                        1. Open Space Maintenance Costs. Maintenance costs for any City-owned open space
                             would include fire prevention, weed control, litter and safety patrol, and
                             cleaning of drains and culverts. Facilities such as restrooms, playgrounds, and
                             game courts involve additional maintenance costs. Liability for fire, landslides,
                             flooding and injuries is another operational cost. Long-term expenses need to
                             be considered when priorities are set for acquiring land and developing
                             recreational facilities.
                        2. Open Space Acquisition Methods. The type of acquisition that is appropriate for a
                             given parcel depends on the location, physical characteristics, designation and
                             intended use of the land. If the parcel’s value is its visual amenity, then a scenic
                             easement would be sufficient. If the only reason to keep a parcel in open space
                             is to avoid hazards, the existing open space designation would serve this
                             purpose. To preserve habitat in areas already designated open space, all that is
                             needed is to maintain the designation.
                        3. Open Space Alternatives. Although recreational uses generally require more than a
                             designation or granting of an easement, fee ownership by the City may not
                             always be necessary. A neighborhood park for a new development could be set
                             aside as a dedication to a neighborhood association, which could maintain it.
                             Play areas can be developed in cooperation with schools. Regional acquisitions
                             can provide connections in regional trail corridors. Access easements can
                             provide passageways to “landlocked” parcels.

While program fees have helped cover basic recreation service costs, growing
demand for park and recreation services and the age of many facilities (mostly built
in the 1950s and 1960s) have resulted in a growing list of deferred facility capital
improvement needs. These needs include replacement of play equipment, turf
renovation, replacement of irrigation systems, large-scale replacement of fencing
and large backstops, and replacement or refurbishing of steps, bleachers, and food
shack. Present estimates for addressing these capital improvement and restoration
needs in parks (excluding buildings, such as the Swim Center) range from $925,000
to $1.35 million (see Table 6-4). This is an “order of magnitude” estimate prepared
by City staff based on a preliminary needs assessment. This assessment has taken
into consideration projects that could be undertaken as volunteer projects (through
Adopt-a-Park or Earth Day activities), in addition to improvements that require
major capital outlays (over $5,000). Volunteer activities, however, do require a
commitment of supervisory staff time.
As of Spring 1999, the Parks and Recreation Commission is continuing a park-by-
park review of facilities and programs, and a more detailed cost estimate for needed
improvements will be developed. This will then feed into the City’s “Services for
the 21st Century Program” which is designed to reach community consensus on a
variety of budget and public service issues.

In addition to capital improvement needs for existing facilities, Community Services
Division staff has identified several areas where facilities are inadequate to meet
existing and projected community demand for recreation programs:
•    Youth Activities and Facility. There is a strong and growing demand for
     recreation programs for teenagers. This year (1999) the division is adding
     several new recreational programs for youth (e.g., girls hoops and a “creative
     arts academy). The staff has identified the need for a “gymnasium/teen center”
     or similar facility as an important issue for the future.

                        •    Senior Center. The City has a long-term lease for the “Open House” Senior
                             Center from the West Contra Costa Unified School District. The center has
                             several deficiencies, including inadequate parking and a lack of space to
                             accommodate new programs. There is also a trend toward decentralizing
                             recreation services and targeting programs to the “well senior” (representing a
                             growing portion of the senior population). These issues will need to be
                             considered and addressed when the current facility lease expires.
                        •    West El Cerrito. The City needs a community facility and park to serve the
                             residents in its western portion. This could possibly be accomplished in
                             partnership with community churches, neighborhood schools, or other
                             institutions located in the City of Richmond.
                        The City Council, at its 1999 annual goal setting session, adopted a five-year goal of
                        expanded recreational opportunities for citizens of all ages. It adopted a top priority
                        action item to develop a parks and recreation facilities financing measure that
                        includes the Swim Center, Canyon Trail Clubhouse, gymnasium/teen facility, and
                        playing field.

C. Goals and Policies
The Implementation Measures associated with each policy are described at the end
of this chapter.
Goal PR1: Adequate, diverse, and accessible recreational opportunities for
             all residents – including children, youth, seniors, and others with
             special needs – in parks, school yards, and open space.
Policies                                               Implementation Measures
PR1.1       Priorities for Rehabilitation. Place the      • Capital Improvements
            highest priority on maintaining and             Program
            rehabilitating existing recreational          • Public/Private
            facilities to operational and safety            Partnerships
            standards that, at a minimum, comply          • Grant Funds
            with applicable state and federal laws and
                                                          • Special Taxes
            regulations. The highest priority facility
            for rehabilitation is the Swim Center on
            Moeser Lane.
PR1.2       Regular Maintenance Program.                  • Annual Budget
            Continue regular inspection and
            maintenance of park facilities to prolong
            the life of equipment, ensure facility
            safety and accessibility, and enhance the
            enjoyment of park users.
PR1.3       Level of Service Standard. Use a level        • Development Review
            of service standard of five acres of
            publicly owned parkland per 1,000
            residents as the minimum requirement for
            recreation and open space land.
            Additional requirements for publicly
            owned recreation and open space land
            may be imposed by the City on
            development approvals, dependent upon
            the characteristics of the project,
            including its proximity to existing
            recreation and open space facilities. This
            requirement is independent of any
            requirements for project-scale open space
            addressed by Policy CD3.2.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                        NON-RECREATIONAL FACILITIES
                        A. Setting
                        The City owns and maintains the buildings that house the City’s public safety
                        departments (police and fire) and administrative functions. It also owns and
                        maintains a variety of buildings to meet the cultural and other needs of El Cerritans.
                        These buildings include the Public Safety Building; City Hall; City Community
                        Center and Swim Center; Cerrito Vista Childcare Center; Library; Contra Costa
                        Civic Theater; and clubhouses and childcare facilities at the City’s parks and public
                        elementary schools. In addition, the City owns and maintains the corporation yard
                        and recycling center. The City also maintains the Open House Senior Center, which
                        it leases from the school district. The Community Facilities Map provides a
                        complete listing of City-owned facilities. The map also shows facilities owned by
                        the school district and several private entities.
                        The City recently completed an ADA-compliance program (Americans with
                        Disabilities Act), including completion of its Transition Plan in accordance with
                        federal laws. This effort was funded from the proceeds of property sales by the
                        City.
                        B. Trends
                        Most City-owned and maintained facilities were constructed during the 1950’s and
                        have significant deferred maintenance issues, including rotting roofs and tile
                        flooring; deteriorated plumbing; outdated wiring; and antiquated equipment. At the
                        Swim Center (built in 1962), the training and lap pools need resurfacing; a significant
                        portion of the pool deck needs to be replaced; the bathhouse roof requires
                        replacement; and the pool’s pumps, lighting, plumbing, and filter systems need to be
                        replaced.
                        In addition to these maintenance issues, nearly all of the City’s facilities require
                        major structural work to bring them up to modern building standards. These code-
                        related issues include the need for further accessibility modifications to meet the
                        requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act; the need to remove lead-based
                        paint and asbestos; and the need for seismic retrofitting.
                        This last issue – seismic retrofitting – is particularly important given El Cerrito’s
                        proximity to the Hayward Fault (it passes through El Cerrito near the eastern city
                        limits, generally following the route of Arlington Boulevard). Experts have
                        determined that there is a high probability of a large earthquake (magnitude 7 or
                        greater) in the next thirty years along this fault segment and other nearby faults.
                        Two buildings where seismic retrofitting is of particular concern are the Public
                        Safety Building on San Pablo and Manila and the Community Center on Moeser.
                        The Public Safety Building is the designated primary facility for emergency
6-18 Public Facilities and Services                                                           August 30, 1999

                                                                                    EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
operations in El Cerrito, while the Community Center is a “second alternate” for
emergency operations and is the only Red Cross-certified emergency mass care
facility in the city. (Some schools may be eligible for certification.) Both facilities
require seismic evaluation and retrofitting, and the Community Center requires an
emergency generator. Furthermore, the Public Safety Building has inadequate
facilities for accommodating male and female police officers and there is insufficient
storage space. The exterior design of the building does not allow for the safe
conveying of suspects from the parking lot into the building. A Sallyport or drive-in
enclosed garage would be preferable from a security standpoint.
A conservative cost estimate for bringing City facilities up to current code
specifications and giving them another 30 years of life is in the range of $2 million
to $3 million. This does not include any type of construction for a new City Hall,
which has been housed in temporary “portables” at its Manila and San Pablo
location since 1987.
The City Council, at its 1999 annual goal setting session, adopted a five-year goal of
investment in City infrastructure and facilities. It adopted two applicable high
priority action items:
• Begin developing a community center by having a community discussion on
   form and placement of a City Hall/Safety Building and a Cultural/Arts and
   History Center.
• Develop a financing measure for the Public Safety Headquarters, Community
   Center, and neighborhood clubhouses to make them seismically safe and ready
   to respond to natural disasters.

                        A. Setting
                        In addition to providing public safety services, police, fire protection, emergency
                        medical services, and emergency preparedness, the City also provides a storm
                        drainage system, a recycling center and curbside collection of recyclable materials,
                        and manages and maintains facilities located in the public rights-of-way. Other
                        community services are provided by regional agencies, including East Bay Municipal
                        Utility District (EBMUD), which provides the City’s water supply and wastewater
                        treatment; Stege Sanitary District, which provides wastewater collection; East Bay
                        Sanitary Company, which provides solid waste collection and disposal; and the West
                        Contra Costa Unified School District (WCCUSD), which provides elementary and
                        secondary schools. The following section discusses needs, goals, and policies for
                        those services provided by the City.
                        Police Services
                        The El Cerrito Police Department provides police services throughout the City,
                        including community policing and education programs that involve citizens in crime
                        prevention. A recent enhancement to the department’s operations is a Bicycle
                        Patrol program, partly in response to community concerns about crime activity on
                        the Ohlone Greenway (BART) bicycle path. The police operate out of the Public
                        Safety Building at 10900 San Pablo Avenue, which they share with the Fire
                        Department.
                        The Police Department has a number of intergovernmental partnerships that
                        provide and support police services. The Richmond Police Department provides
                        emergency police dispatching and, starting in 2000, will provide communications for
                        all emergency services as well as normal operations under contract to El Cerrito.
                        The El Cerrito Police Department is working with Contra Costa County to
                        coordinate all police records management by the year 2000. Moreover, the El
                        Cerrito Police serve on a West Contra County Narcotics Task Force with other City
                        staff and with state and federal agencies to cooperate on drug enforcement. Lastly,
                        the Police Department contracts with the State of California for the California
                        Identification System to use its computer technology to evaluate fingerprint
                        evidence for the identification of criminals.
                        Fire Protection Services
                        The El Cerrito Fire Department operates two fire stations in the City, including the
                        newly constructed Station 72 on Arlington Boulevard. The Department ensures a
                        full range of fire suppression and emergency services through joint operations
                        agreements with the City of Richmond Fire Department and West County (Contra
                        Costa) Fire District. The El Cerrito Fire Department directly serves Kensington
                        under a contract with the Kensington Fire Protection District. The East Richmond

with the Richmond and Contra Costa County Fire Departments. The service area
of the Department includes four areas that have been identified as “Very High Fire
Hazard Severity Zones” by the California Department of Forestry: the El Cerrito
Hills Area; the Canyon Trail Area; Cerrito Creek adjacent to Albany Hill; and nearly
the entire community of Kensington. In these areas the City has established
standards for vegetation management to reduce fire hazards.
Storm Drain Facilities
The City has completed the first phase of a comprehensive storm drain
rehabilitation program, funded by a $6.3 million bond issue in 1993. Through this
program, the City has addressed the highest priority needs in the storm drain
system, reducing the incidence of system overflows and localized flooding during
periods of heavy rain (with only three problem sites reported during the heavy rains
of this past winter). Following completion of the first phase improvements, the City
plans to undertake a follow-up assessment to determine remaining system
improvement needs to ensure adequate system capacity and proper long-term
functioning. Because the City’s creeks are an integral part of the storm drain system,
the current effort has also been exploring opportunities for creek restoration. In the
past several years, three creek sites have been restored as part of the storm drain
improvement program. As of 1999, the City is budgeting approximately $25,000 per
year for creek restoration in order to met its federally mandated NPDES
requirements.
Recycling Services
The City operates a Recycling Center at the east end of Schmidt Lane. The Center
serves as a processing facility for the materials collected by City’s commercial and
residential recycling programs, as well as a popular drop-off site that serves the
region. The Center collects approximately 4,300 tons of recyclable materials each
year, 2,500 tons of which are through its drop-off program. The East Bay Sanitary
Company, the City’s franchised refuse and green waste hauler, began providing a
residential curbside green waste collection program in April 1997, which diverted
1,883 tons of compostable materials in its first year of operation. El Cerrito is one
of five member cities of the West Contra Costa Integrated Waste Management
Authority, which establishes contracts and rates for refuse disposal and green waste
composting services, and provides regional education and program planning for
waste diversion. Recycling has been and will continue to be an important part of
the City’s and the region’s integrated waste management program.
Public Rights-of-Way
The City is responsible for the management and maintenance of facilities located in
the public rights-of-way, including streets, signals, sidewalks, pathways, curbs and
gutters, street trees, signage, and street lights (with the exception of San Pablo
Avenue from the City’s southern boundary to Cutting Boulevard, which is State
Route 123 and therefore managed and maintained by CalTrans). Chapter 5,
Transportation and Circulation, includes additional discussion and several policies
on rights-of-way.

                        B. Trends
                        In addition to the existing deficiencies in public services and facilities, the projected
                        growth and development in El Cerrito will contribute additional demand. As the
                        City continues to grow there will be an increasing demand on public safety services.
                        The Police Department is currently facing potential staff reductions due to ongoing
                        fiscal constraints. The Department is also seeking funds for a major seismic retrofit
                        and expansion of the City’s Public Safety Building. The Fire Department is also
                        concerned with the increasing fuel loads in the City’s parks and the wildland
                        interface in East Richmond Heights (where there is no fuel reduction ordinance in
                        effect). The needed seismic retrofit and expansion of the City’s Public Safety
                        Building is also an issue for the Fire Department, as is the need for improvements
                        to EBMUD’s water supply system in the City.
                        Deferred maintenance has taken a toll on many streets, creating a pressing need for
                        resurfacing and other improvements. The City estimates that approximately $5
                        million is needed to address existing deferred maintenance issues for asphalt
                        resurfacing. Subsequent to this investment, an ongoing program of preventive
                        maintenance could address street pavement needs within the current budget
                        framework (approximately $250,000 annually).
                        The City Council, at its 1999 annual goal setting session, adopted a five-year goal of
                        investment in City infrastructure and facilities. It adopted an applicable high priority
                        action item to expand enhancement and restoration of El Cerrito creeks, with a
                        watershed emphasis.

                                                                                       EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
IMPLEMENTATION
The following is a summary of the major tools available to the City for
implementation of the policies of this chapter, Public Services and Facilities.
1. Annual Budget
The annual budget should provide adequate funds for community facilities,
infrastructure, and services. In particular, it should place a high priority on the
inspection and maintenance of recreational facilities, especially on ensuring the
safety of these facilities. Once the existing problems of deferred maintenance are
corrected, it should be avoided because it inevitably leads to higher costs.
2. Asset Replacement Fund
The City should create an asset replacement fund such that City facilities can be
brought up to current code specifications. Funding could include general fund
reserves, state grants for seismic upgrades, and voter-approved special taxes. An
initial goal of $3 million for the Asset Replacement Fund would allow for the code
upgrades and would delay the need for facility replacement in the near term. In
addition, the City should make annual contributions to the asset replacement fund
equal to between 3 and 5 percent of the total replacement cost of all major civic
facilities so that they can be rebuilt or significantly renovated within 20 to 30 years.
3. Bicycle Master Plan
More information about a Bicycle Master Plan is contained in Chapter 5,
Transportation and Circulation.
4. Capital Improvements Program
The Capital Improvement Program (CIP) is a compilation of the capital
improvements planned for construction over the next five years in El Cerrito. It
includes cost estimates, the phasing of specific improvements and associated costs
and methods with which specific improvements will be financed. The City should
continue to conduct annual reviews of the CIP and add civic and public facilities as
funding sources are identified. The CIP should provide a systematic set of priorities
for non-operating expenditures such as major facility restoration and upgrades, as
well as any new parks and recreation, community, and infrastructure facilities that
might be needed to meet level of service standards. Priority should be on ensuring
public safety.
5. City Policy
The City can undertake several of its implementation measures by making changes
in its internal operating policies, assuming these changes would be within budget
limits.
6. City Project Design
When the City designs facilities or is a participant in a project, it should ensure that
the design is consistent with the policies in this Plan.
August 30, 1999                                                            Public Facilities and Services 6-31
EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                        7. Development Review
                        The City should assess the impact of new development on the demand for services,
                        public facilities, and infrastructure and should implement mitigation measures and
                        other mechanisms to help finance needed improvements. In particular, projects
                        should be evaluated for their potential impacts on parks and recreation facilities, the
                        resources of the project site relative to the park and recreation needs of the
                        community, their compliance with the requirements for on-site open space and
                        recreational facilities. The City’s development regulations (zoning) should provide
                        for an incentives program that would offer benefits to developers in exchange for
                        the provision of community facilities. The City should also assess the public safety
                        features of the design of proposed development projects. All projects, including
                        public-sponsored projects, should be reviewed for consistency with the General
                        Plan as early as possible in order to minimize wasted effort on projects deemed not
                        to be in conformance.
                        8. Education Programs
                        The City should promote education programs that heighten awareness of important
                        local habitats and the need for their protection.
                        9. Fire Hazard Reduction Program
                        The City, in cooperation with the California Department of Forestry (CDF) and
                        East Bay Regional Park District, should review and update, when required, the Fire
                        Hazard Reduction Program that establishes standards for vegetation management
                        and provides guidelines for property owners located within the Very High Fire
                        Hazard Severity Zones (VHFHSZ) (Title 8, Section 8.30.010 El Cerrito Municipal
                        Code (See Figure 12)), including fuel reduction and creation of fuel breaks along
                        property lines and adjacent to structures.
                        10. Grant Funds
                        The City should continue to identify, evaluate, and, where appropriate, apply for
                        available grants. A variety of State and Federal programs grant local governments
                        funds for developing local park and recreation facilities. Grant funds also may be
                        available for creek restoration projects, especially given they provide a drainage
                        function. The City should seek funding opportunities, such as State grants for
                        seismic retrofitting, as well as foundation grants to complete an upgrade, expansion,
                        and seismic retrofit for the Public Safety Building. The City should determine
                        whether grant funds are available from federal or state sources to upgrade the waste
                        management system and recycling center, and implement street beautification
                        programs.
                        11. Hillside Natural Area Vegetation Management Plan
                        The City should continue to implement the Hillside Natural Area Vegetation
                        Management Plan and update the plan as required.

                                                                                     EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
12. Impact Fees
The City should initiate an impact fee study to help determine whether it would be
beneficial to establish impact fees to fund community buildings and other civic
facilities.
13. In-lieu Fees
The City should consider the adoption of in-lieu fees, consistent with the applicable
state laws, for funding parks and recreational facilities.
14. Intergovernmental Coordination
The City should continue to coordinate with the West Contra Costa Unified School
District, other cities, Contra Costa County, East Bay Regional Park District, and
other agencies on the provision of adequate park and recreation facilities to serve
the residents of El Cerrito. These agencies should cooperate in studies of matters
pertaining to open space and environmental resource protection. The City should
ensure that government agencies observe all requirements for referral of projects to
other agencies prior to approval. The City should continue to coordinate with
other jurisdictions and agencies to obtain the use of other additional community
facilities for its residents. Government Code Section 65401 authorizes the City
Council to obtain lists of all capital improvements planned by public agencies in the
City. These proposed capital improvements must be consistent with the General
Plan. As part of its annual review of the Capital Improvement Program, the City
should include a Section 65401 review, listing all capital improvement projects
proposed by other jurisdictions during the following year and making a finding
relative to the consistency of each project with the General Plan. As part of the
effort to maintain high-quality services and implement the General Plan, the City
should maintain an effective liaison with the districts and agencies that influence
public facilities and services.
15. Open Space Acquisition Priorities
The City should review potential open space and establish priorities for acquisition
by the City or by other agencies, or protection through other means. High priority
will be given to biologically sensitive and visually prominent lands that seem most at
risk from development. Conduct an inventory of unique natural areas, important
wildlife habitats, and areas suitable for nature study, particularly near schools.
16. Open Space Consolidation
Open space received through dedication that is adjacent to East Bay Regional Park
District property lands should be offered to the Park District.
17. Open Space Funding
The City should identify funding sources for acquisition and ongoing maintenance
for public open space lands.
August 30, 1999                                                             Public Facilities and Services 6-33
EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                        18. Open Space Preservation Program
                        The following means will be considered for preserving open space resources, in
                        order of priority: (1) private development review process; (2) public-private
                        partnerships; and lastly, (3) public funds. Possible means are described below.
                             Private Resources:
                             a. Require permanent dedication of open space areas with high habitat, visual,
                                 recreational or archaeological values as a condition of development. These
                                 lands should be owned and maintained by homeowner associations unless
                                 they are appropriate for use as trails or other public-access uses.
                             b. Use visual or public-access easements and building setbacks to protect open
                                 space resources while allowing development on private parcels.
                             c. Encourage development to be compact and clustered in order to protect
                                 areas with high open space values.
                             d. Encourage grants and donations of undeveloped property with high open-
                                 space values from private individuals or organizations.
                             e. Encourage private, non-profit, and other public agencies to acquire and
                                 maintain undeveloped land for open space preservation. These methods are
                                 preferred over the use of city funds for acquisition.
                             Public-Private Partnerships:
                             a. When parcels on planned trail corridors are developed, require the developer
                                 to construct the portion of the trail crossing the parcel as one of the
                                 conditions of development.
                             b. Work with organizations such as the Urban Creeks Council, Trust for Public
                                 Lands, East Bay Regional Park District, Nature Conservancy, Coastal
                                 Conservancy, and other cities and counties to perform creek restoration and
                                 other tasks related to open space.
                             Public (City) Funds:
                             a. Prioritize parcels with high habitat, visual, archaeological or recreational
                                 values for purchase by the City if funds become available.
                        19. Public Access Program
                        The City should identify which portions of open space areas can be made accessible
                        to the public and which portions should be off limits to protect the natural features
                        of the area.
                        20. Public Facilities Fee
                        The City should consider adopting a citywide public facilities impact fee ordinance,
                        under the requirements of the applicable laws, to fund new community and public
                        facilities, including public safety facilities, required to serve new residents and
                        employees in the City.

                                                                                    EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
21. Public/Private Partnerships
The City should encourage public/private partnerships with the community to
improve public safety, including neighborhood crime prevention programs, pubic
education, and development design to discourage crime. The City should continue
to reach out to its residents, landowners, businesses, and not-for-profit
organizations to educate them about the value of parks and recreational facilities and
enlist their assistance in providing and maintaining facilities, and assisting in
recreation programs. The City also should help to organize and publicize groups
that undertake cleanup and restoration events.
22. Riparian and Stream Restoration Program
The City should develop and implement a Riparian and Stream Restoration Program
that identifies areas and stream segments that should be restored and provides
policy guidance for such actions.
23. Scenic Easements
El Cerrito should encourage the granting of scenic easements on landforms and key
visual resources that could be subject to development.
24. Special Taxes
The City should analyze the advisability of holding a special election on adopting a
special tax – a parks and recreation facilities financing measure – to upgrade selected
park and recreation facilities. The City also should assess the feasibility of adopting
a special tax, or other financing mechanisms, to pay for the upgrade and seismic
retrofit of the Public Safety Building and other critical facilities. The City should
also explore funding opportunities, including voter approval for a special tax, and
other financing mechanisms to build a new City administrative office building as
part of a revitalized downtown area.
25. Traffic Impact Fee
The City should consider development of a citywide traffic impact fee and
accompanying ordinance, under the requirements of applicable laws, to fund
transportation improvements to mitigate the traffic impacts of new growth
development. The traffic impact fee would be in-lieu of the off-site mitigation
requirements, but would not replace the developer’s responsibility for frontage
improvements. The traffic impact fee may be used to fund roadway extensions,
intersection improvements, safety improvements, or improvements and amenities to
pedestrian, bicycle or transit facilities.

CHAPTER 7 RESOURCES AND
                                HAZARDS
The Resources and Hazards section of the General Plan covers four State mandated
elements: Open Space, Conservation, Safety and Noise. The subject matter of this
element is intertwined with the rest of the General Plan. For example, areas
designated for open space are also intended to minimize damage due to geologic
hazards, and trails plans that link local and regional open space areas at the same
time providing recreation and offering an alternative to driving.
Hazards policies address issues related to geologic and seismic risk, flooding,
hazardous materials and noise. The purpose is to identify and appraise hazards in
the community, which will establish a basis for the goals, policies and implementing
actions necessary to assure community safety. The noise portion of the element is
concerned with planning for land uses that are typically sensitive to noise impacts,
including residential development, residential neighborhood quality of life, nursing
homes, schools, wildlife sanctuaries, hospitals and treatment centers.
The element also contains policies for the preservation of open space and the
conservation of natural resources. The General Plan designates open space and sets
forth policies and programs defining ways in which open space will be used, water
and air quality will be enhanced, and natural resources will be protected and
managed.
NATURAL AND HISTORIC RESOURCES
A. Setting
Open Space
Open space is discussed primarily in Chapters 4 and 6, although it also serves an
important function in preserving natural resources. This is especially true of plant
and animal habitats, creeks, erosion control, and visual amenities. Open space
serving these functions is subject to the same level of protection as provided by the
policies and implementation measures in Chapter 6.
Wildlife
The scarcity of undeveloped land in the City has had a limiting effect on natural
areas for both vegetation and wildlife. Some forms of wildlife, such as deer, fox,
coyote, and raccoons, can be found in the hills of the City, especially next to the
large open areas of Wildcat Canyon. Wildlife also have been found elsewhere in the
August 30, 1999                                                              Resources and Hazards 7-1
EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     City. The natural habitat within the City itself is somewhat limited, although it
                     provides an important part of the character and quality of the community. Some
                     plant and animal species are designated as sensitive because of their overall rarity,
                     endangerment, restricted distribution, and/or unique habitat requirements.
                     Air Quality
                     Because ventilation is relatively good, and there is little transport of pollutants into
                     El Cerrito from other upwind urban areas, the pollution potential of El Cerrito is
                     relatively low compared to other parts of the San Francisco Bay Area. However,
                     during periods of light or calm winds, which typically occur in the fall and winter
                     months, El Cerrito and the entire Bay Area are subject to stagnation and poor air
                     quality.
                     Storm Runoff
                     The watershed within the city limits is fully urbanized, and relatively little additional
                     runoff is anticipated from new development. There are eight major watersheds that
                     drain through the City of El Cerrito. These watersheds generally drain from the
                     Berkeley Hills along the east border of El Cerrito westward towards the City of
                     Richmond and San Francisco Bay. Runoff from the hills generally drains into
                     intermittent drainageways. These waterways are steep, average six feet in width, and
                     have rocky to cobbly substrates incised into bedrock. Recent improvements to the
                     city’s storm drainage system have dramatically improved capacity of the system. El
                     Cerrito has also adopted management guidelines to comply with National Pollution
                     Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) requirements. NPDES is a federal
                     environmental protection program that regulates the discharge of contaminants to
                     surface waters.
                     Historic Resources
                     Prehistoric resources typically include chert or obsidian flakes, projectile points,
                     mortars and pestles, and dark, friable soil containing shell and bone, dietary debris,
                     heat-affected rock, or human burials. Prehistoric archaeological sites in Western
                     Contra Costa County are typically located near historical marsh margins, on terraces
                     along watercourses, and at the base of hills near watercourses. Common prehistoric
                     archaeological resources found at such sites include shell middens and bedrock
                     milling stations. The City of El Cerrito is situated to the east of the general zone
                     where shellmounds have been found. Further from the shoreline and upslope, the
                     likelihood of encountering a classic deposit diminishes. Less than five percent of the
                     city has been surveyed for prehistoric resources. There are five recorded prehistoric
                     archaeological sites within El Cerrito’s boundaries.
                     “Historic” resources typically include stone or adobe foundations or walls;
                     structures and remains with square nails; and refuse deposits (often found in old
                     wells and privies). The Office of Historic Preservation has also determined that
                     buildings and structures 45 years and older may be of historic value. There are only
                     a few identified historic properties in the city that are listed in the State Office of
                     Historic Preservation Historic Properties Directory, the Contra Costa County Historic Resources

B. Trends
Open space and natural resources are important to El Cerrito and reflect a variety of
important values: ecological, educational, aesthetic, economic and recreational.
These values are interwoven throughout the community in numerous ways so that
the preservation of these resources is very important to the well being of the City.
City policies have preserved open space and natural resource values in combination
with protection of public health and safety. Such actions include the designation of
the Hillside Natural Area and other open space areas, and preparation of the
Hillside Natural Area Vegetation Management Plan. (See Figure 12, Open Space
Plan.)
This portion of the General Plan is designed to accomplish two major objectives:
1. To identify and protect open space used for the preservation of natural
     resources and to protect the resources themselves for the benefit of present and
     future generations.
2. To encourage urban growth in those areas where the natural characteristics of
     the land are most suited to such development, and to protect the public from
     risks to life and property.
To accomplish these objectives, two types of policies are proposed––one type
proposes specific physical changes, or prescribes management policies for a distinct
physical area. The other type of policy applies to the entire area, and prescribes
management techniques for new development, makes recommendations to other
agencies, or suggests efforts to educate the public.

C. Goals and Policies
The Implementation Measures associated with each policy are described at the end
of this chapter.
Goal R1:     Protected natural resources (important habitat, ecological
             resources, key visual resources, ridges and ridgelines, creeks and
             streambanks, steeper slopes, vista points, and major features),
             and clean air and water.
Policies                                                  Implementation Measures
R1.1        Habitat Protection. Preserve                     • Hillside Natural Area

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     HAZARDS
                     A. Setting
                     The policies below address issues related to geologic and seismic risk, flooding,
                     hazardous materials and noise. The element covers two state mandated general plan
                     elements, safety and noise. The purpose of the element is to identify and appraise
                     hazards in the community that will establish a basis for the goals, policies and
                     implementing actions necessary to assure community safety. Other issues such as
                     disaster preparedness, fire and crime prevention will be addressed in more detail in
                     the Public Facilities and Services section of the General Plan.
                     El Cerrito lies on the southwest facing slopes of the Berkeley Hills, rising from the
                     Bay Plain to the top of the ridgeline (approximate elevation 900 feet). Several faults
                     run roughly parallel to the ridgeline, with an extensive portion of the Alquist-Priolo
                     fault zone mostly located in the City of El Cerrito. Potential health and safety
                     hazards due to earthquake, other geologic conditions, fire, noise and flooding exist
                     in El Cerrito. These conditions are summarized below.
                     Earthquake
                     There is a probability of roughly one in four of a large earthquake (magnitude 7 or
                     greater) occurring in the next thirty years along each of the two Hayward fault
                     segments, as well as the peninsula segment of the San Andreas Fault. The Working
                     Group on California Earthquake Probabilities (1990) has estimated that there is only
                     a 2 percent chance of a magnitude 8 earthquake occurring on the nearby segment of
                     the San Andreas Fault within the next 30 years.
                     Other Geologic Hazards
                     From a geologic and geotechnical standpoint, the primary concerns in El Cerrito
                     are: (1) slope stability; (2) earthquake ground shaking; (3) fault ground rupture; and
                     (4) liquefaction potential. According to the Tri-Cities Seismic Safety Study (Bishop
                     1973), virtually all of the upland areas of El Cerrito have a moderate to high
                     landslide risk. The highest risk for groundshaking is in the flatter areas, which have
                     shallow alluvium. Several small areas along Baxter and Cerrito creeks are identified
                     as having a high liquefaction potential.
                     Fire Hazards
                     El Cerrito’s intermix of urban housing and wildland areas increases the community’s
                     risk of loss from a devastating fire. The City’s Fire Hazard Reduction Program
                     addresses hazard reduction in the Very High Fire Hazard Severity zones of the city,
                     requiring that property owners take special precautions with their properties,
                     including vegetation management, to reduce the risk of fire. In addition, creation of
                     a buffer zone interface between developed areas and the East Bay Regional Park
                     District open space and City parks should occur to reduce the risk of fire.

                                                                                   EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
Areas Prone to Flooding
There have been a number of large storms in El Cerrito that have caused drainage
problems and flooding in the past. Recent completion of the first phase in the City’s
storm drain master plan program has addressed the highest priority sites and
significantly reduced localized flooding issues in the city. During the past year of
heavy rains, only three sites had drainage-related flooding problems. The only
portion of El Cerrito located in a FEMA Flood Insurance Zone is the area located
west of San Pablo Avenue and south of Central Avenue. Flooding is generally
caused by the relatively low ground elevations and high tides in this area, coupled
with hydraulic restrictions in the existing downstream channels located in Richmond
between El Cerrito and San Francisco Bay.
Noise
The major noise sources in the City of El Cerrito are vehicular and rail traffic. Noise
generated by vehicular traffic in El Cerrito is greatest along Interstate 80 and San
Pablo Avenue. In most cases there will not be significant increases in noise from
these sources. BART trains are a significant noise source in El Cerrito, but are
different in nature from vehicular noise because they are characterized by numerous
discrete, periodic events during train pass-bys. Studies indicate that after entering or
leaving the Del Norte BART Station, BART trains produce maximum noise levels
typically in the range of 72 to 76 dBA. Further away from the station, where BART
trains travel faster, maximum noise levels typically range from 75 to 80 dBA.
Residents also complain about BART noise where the tracks curve in the northern
end of the City.
Land uses that are most sensitive to external noise sources include schools and
libraries, hospitals and convalescent homes, churches and outdoor recreation areas.
Other sensitive uses are residential and public facilities located near transportation
links such as BART, San Pablo Avenue, or the Freeway.
B. Trends
Hazards – General
The intent of the General Plan is to reduce the potential for injury, damage, public
expense, and loss of life due to natural and man-made hazards. The concept of
public safety expressed in the General Plan is based on the following assumptions:
1. Hazards are an unavoidable aspect of life. Not every degree of risk or all
     hazards can be eliminated.
2. Public policy and action are appropriate to mitigate against hazards which: (a)
     have a high degree of risk to the general public or to a large part of the
     population; (b) may have relatively low risk but which would be considered
     disasters should the event occur; and (c) may not have a disaster potential but
     which are persistent safety problems with a history of occurring in the City.

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     The extent of the hazard depends on local conditions, since most hazards are
                     confined to a particular area or site. Various health and safety hazards should be
                     considered in planning the location, design, intensity, density and type of land uses
                     in a given area. Long-term costs to the City, such as maintenance, liability exposure
                     and emergency services, are potentially greater where high hazards exist.
                     The 1975 General Plan provided the framework and direction for development of
                     more detailed studies, policies, and programs, including designation of the Hillside
                     Natural Area and other open space areas; preparation of the Hillsides Natural Area
                     Vegetation Management Plan; preparation of the Storm Water Master Plan;
                     designation of Very High Fire Hazard Severity zones; and development of the City’s
                     Fire Hazard Reduction Program. The 1999 update reflects these plans and programs
                     as well as respond to other issues of community concern. In addition, Chapter 6,
                     Public Facilities and Services, contains policies and programs covering fire hazards.
                     It is important that coordination and review of resource and environmental hazard
                     protection implementing measures continue to occur in El Cerrito. (See Figure 13)
                     Noise
                     The noise portion of the General Plan is concerned with planning for land uses that
                     are typically sensitive to noise impacts, including residential development, residential
                     neighborhood quality of life, nursing homes, schools, wildlife sanctuaries, hospitals
                     and treatment centers. Noise is generally defined as unwanted sound. Whether a
                     sound is unwanted depends on when and where it occurs, what the listener is doing
                     when it occurs, characteristics of the sound (loudness, pitch and duration, speech or
                     music content, irregularity) and how intrusive it is above background sound levels.
                     Examples of potential noise generators in residential neighborhoods include, among
                     others, I-80, BART, retail center operations and the location of play areas (such as
                     school and park play areas). The Noise portion of the General Plan will establish
                     the basis for code enforcement and regulation through the proposed adoption of a
                     noise ordinance to control nuisances such as off-hour truck unloading and trash
                     pickup, barking dogs, loud music and vehicle noise.
                     The normally acceptable noise standards for new land uses are established in Table
                     7-1, Land Use Compatibility for Community Exterior Noise Environments. This
                     table defines the acceptable noise environment for the uses listed – it does not refer
                     to the noise generated by the uses listed.
                     Table 7-2 shows existing (1998) and projected (2020) noise levels for BART, I-80
                     and San Pablo Avenue. The projected increase in noise levels along other City
                     streets is projected to be less than 1 decibel (dB), which is less than noticeable. It
                     should be noted that the projected increase in traffic on I-80 will be offset by a
                     decrease in the average travel speed and noise levels are not projected to increase
                     over existing levels.

           Normally Acceptable
           Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that
           any buildings involved are of normal conventional construction,
           without any special noise insulation requirements.
           Conditionally Acceptable
           Specified land use may be permitted only after detailed analysis
           of the noise reduction requirements and needed noise insulation
           features included in the design.
           Unacceptable
           New construction or development should generally not be
           undertaken because mitigation is usually not feasible to comply
           with Noise Element policies.

                                                                               EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
IMPLEMENTATION
The following is a summary of the major tools available to the City for
implementation of the policies in this chapter, Resources and Hazards.
1. Air Quality Strategies
Implement trip reduction and energy conservation measures for jobs/housing
balance, Transportation Demand Management (TDM) and transit, as identified in
the Community Design and Development, and Housing Elements, and coordinate
with regional and state agencies and other West County jurisdictions in enhancing
air quality.
2. Annual Budget
The annual budget should provide adequate funds for community facilities,
infrastructure, and services. In particular, it should place a high priority on the
inspection and maintenance of recreational facilities, especially on ensuring the
safety of these facilities. Once the existing problems of deferred maintenance are
corrected, it should be avoided because it inevitably leads to higher costs.
3. Archaeological Resources
Where possible, archaeological sites or fragile historic sites will be placed within
open space areas as defined during the specific project review process.
4. BART Noise
Continue to work with-BART on noise reduction programs, placing special
emphasis on noise reduction adjacent to noise sensitive uses. (i.e., public library,
Fairmont School, Civic Center and residences within 200 feet of BART right-of-
way)
5. Building Code Update
Update the Building and other codes as necessary to address earthquake, fire and
other hazards and support programs for the identification, abatement or mitigation
of existing hazardous structures.
6. CEQA
The City should ensure that the CEQA review process adequately identifies impacts
of new development upon the natural environment.
7. City Council Resolution 96-103
The following objectives were adopted by City Council Resolution 96-103, and are
summarized below:
a. Create a strong relationship between the creek and adjacent land by integrating
     retail, housing and civic uses with the creek, and improving the creek as an
     amenity.
b. Create a continuous pedestrian/bicycle corridor along the creek, linking this
     segment to creek alignments to the west and east.
August 30, 1999                                                              Resources and Hazards 7-25
EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                     c.   Link a creekside pedestrian/bicycle corridor along Cerrito Creek to the Bay
                          Trail.
                     d. Provide opportunities for visual and physical linkages between Albany and El
                          Cerrito.
                     e. Create an open natural channel along its entire length within the Plaza area.
                     f. Restore the creek channel as a natural riparian corridor with habitat
                          enhancement.
                     g. Provide variety of uses and diversity of experiences along the creek alignment.
                     h. Extend the open creek channel to San Pablo Avenue and investigate the
                          potential to realign the creek north of the Wells Fargo building, and to make a
                          visible connection across San Pablo Avenue.
                     i. Provide for physical access by pedestrians to the creek channel.
                     8. Consultation on Fish and Wildlife Impacts
                     The City will continue to notify and consult with the California Department of Fish
                     and Game and the Army Corps of Engineers when development projects are
                     proposed in locations where there may be impacts to fish and wildlife and their
                     habitats.
                     9. Cooperation with Other Jurisdictions in Solving Storm Drainage
                          Problems
                     Work with other agencies, such as the City of Richmond and Contra Costa County,
                     to address downstream drainage problems. Such jurisdictions should be encouraged
                     to participate and help solve such drainage problems. In the event that Kensington
                     decides to install new storm drainage facilities, El Cerrito should review the plans to
                     insure that the proposed system will be compatible with the design and capacity of
                     El Cerrito’s system and to encourage contributions to any adjacent system changes
                     as a result of such plans.
                     10. Creek Ordinance
                     Consider adoption of a creek ordinance applicable city-wide to waterways to be
                     specified, to include, among other factors, such provisions as setbacks of
                     construction including buildings and paved areas; avoidance of culverting; standards
                     for waterway restoration; and principles of watershed management.
                     11. Design Objectives for Baxter Creek
                     A set of objectives should be adopted by the council for Baxter Creek, similar to
                     Resolution 96-103. Objectives might include:
                     a. Improve the natural channel characteristics.
                     b. Maintain and improve the riparian habitat.
                     c. Improve and maintain water quality in the creek channel.
                     d. Integrate the Baxter Creek corridor with the Ohlone Greenway and establish a
                          connection with the proposed Central Richmond Greenway.
                     e. Provide for physical access by pedestrians to the creek channel.

                                                                                 EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
f.   Establish a creek corridor through public ownership of a conservation easement
     or other interest in a portion of the property through which the creek flows.
g. Establish setbacks for buildings and other improvements, through special
     regulations or a general Citywide creek protection ordinance.
12. Design Guidelines
Design guidelines are very useful tools for ensuring that development is compatible
with the surrounding area and that it provides required design features. To the
extent possible, the guidelines should be specific; guidelines that are quantifiable
should be considered for incorporation into the development regulations.
13. Development Regulations (zoning)
The development regulations, primarily the zoning regulations, provide the
standards for development, prescribe allowable uses, contain specific incentive
provisions, and include other standards and procedures related to approval of
development projects.
14. Development Review
The development review process includes discretionary review by the Planning
Commission and the Design Review Board, based on consideration of General Plan
objectives and policies, and criteria established by the zoning and subdivision
ordinances and other city regulations and adopted guidelines. Most discretionary
actions are subject to the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA). The development review process also includes administrative review of
projects to verify compliance with Planning Commission and Design Review Board
requirements, as well as standards set by the City through adoption of building and
fire codes, engineering standards, and other regulations and ordinances.
15. Emergency Preparedness Planning
Continue to implement emergency preparedness plans in coordination with the
County Office of Emergency Services regarding the provision of emergency services
in the event of a large earthquake or other disaster. Continue to organize a
comprehensive grassroots emergency preparedness plan using volunteer to organize
neighborhood-level disaster response and preparation.
16. Environmental Education Programs
Establish public information/education programs to enhance public knowledge
about environmental protection and conservation measures.
17. Geologic, Fire, Flooding and Other Hazard Maps
Maintain detailed hazard maps for use in development review.
18. Geotechnical Review Procedures
Update City guidelines establishing geotechnical review procedures, including but
not limited to, the content of geologic feasibility reports and design level
geotechnical reports, and the credentials of the authors of such reports.
Considerations include:

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                              a.  Implement procedures and requirements of the state-established
                                  Alquist-Priolo zone.
                              b.  Establish procedures addressing the type(s) of investigation, minimum
                                  report guidelines, minimum standards, technical review of reports
                                  submitted to the City, and enforcement of recommendations contained
                                  in the reports and City policy.
                              c.  Define types of projects and areas within the planning area that trigger
                                  report requirements for engineering geologic and/or geotechnical (soil
                                  and foundation engineering) reports to address these concerns.
                              d.  Require engineering geologic reports: (a) for certain projects within a
                                  Fault Studies Zone; and (b) for certain projects in hillside and flatland
                                  areas and within 50 feet of creekbanks.
                              e.  Require geotechnical reports for: (a) additions imposing significant
                                  new loads on existing foundations; (b) projects involving significant
                                  grading, particularly where located on a slope (e.g. swimming pools,
                                  basements); (c) repair of foundation distress; (d) landslide repairs; and
                                  (e) repair of distressed retaining walls over 4 feet in height.
                              f.  Require the engineering geologist of record (where one is required on
                                  the project) to be an engineering geologist certified by the State of
                                  California.
                              g.  Require the geotechnical consultant of record to be a registered civil
                                  engineer who holds a valid authorization to use the title “soil engineer”
                                  as provided in Section 6736.1 of the State of California Business and
                                  Professions Code.
                              h.  Continually revise the existing database to indicate those sites with
                                  geologic/geotechnical reports on file.
                     19. Hazardous Materials Storage Tanks
                     A comprehensive investigation of hazardous materials storage tanks should be
                     undertaken for specific sites when development is proposed. The potential hazard
                     of any tanks or former tank sites found should then be evaluated using California
                     EPA and local regulatory guidelines, and remedied.
                     20. Hazardous Soils
                     Sites within El Cerrito that are contaminated with hazardous substances should be
                     remediated in compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal laws and
                     regulations. If it is not feasible to fully remediate soils, land uses may be restricted
                     to protect public health and safety.
                     21. Hazardous Waste Management
                     Work with Contra Costa County, other cities in the county and other jurisdictions
                     on implementing measures of the County Hazardous Waste Management Plan.
                     22. Hillside Natural Area Vegetation Management Plan
7-28 Resources and Hazards                                                                  August 30, 1999

                                                                                  EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
Implement the Hillside Natural Area Vegetation Management Plan in coordination
with fire reduction programs.
23. Hillside Ordinance
The City should examine its existing regulations regarding hillside development and
assess other hillside ordinances, such as the City of Richmond’s April 1997 Hillside
Ordinance, to ensure that environmental and safety issues are properly addressed.
24. Historic Preservation Ordinance
Consider adopting a Historic Preservation Ordinance following procedures
identified by the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) to protect historic
resources and to ensure that new buildings and remodeling of existing buildings are
compatible with City goals for preserving the City's historic resources and character.
The City should also examine financial assistance options for eligible historic
properties. The ordinance would:
     a. Establish standards for determining the historic value of potentially historic
         properties.
     b. Define historic areas where new development will be required to
         complement the character of the surrounding historic structures.
     c. Establish separate historic design guidelines that could be used to allow the
         adaptive re-use of historic buildings and facade improvements, and include
         guidelines and standards covering specific historical/architectural features,
         materials, colors, etc. for all new construction.
     d. Address Unreinforced Masonry Building safety.
     e. Establish exceptions from parking, lot coverage and setback requirements
         for historic buildings (through separate zoning amendment).
25. Historical Inventory and Designation
The City should initiate, or work with a local civic group to initiate, an inventory of
structures or sites that may have architectural, historical, archeological, or cultural
significance to the community. The City should then consider action to list the
most significant structures or sites on the California Register of Historical Resources
and the National Register of Historic Places.
26. Intergovernmental Coordination
The City should continue to coordinate with other cities, Contra Costa and Alameda
counties, and other agencies to ensure that environmental objectives are achieved.
27. Joint Watershed Goals Statement
Assure ongoing general cooperation in the furtherance of joint watershed goals as
adopted by the City of El Cerrito on September 5, 1995, and seek out opportunities
to jointly apply for grants and jointly undertake planning, construction, educational,
and watershed management projects which will be approved on a case-by-case basis
by the respective governing bodies. Joint Watershed Goals include:
          a. Restoring creeks by removing culverts, underground pipes, and
              obstructions to fish and animal migration, and putting creeks in
August 30, 1999                                                                Resources and Hazards 7-29

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                                    restored channels up in the sunshine where people and wildlife can
                                    enjoy them.
                               b. Restoring creek corridors as natural transportation routes with
                                    pedestrian and bicycle paths along creekside greenways; wherever
                                    possible, using creekside greenways to connect neighborhoods and
                                    commercial districts east of Interstate 80 freeway to the shoreline of
                                    San Francisco Bay and the San Francisco Bay Trail.
                               c. Restoring a healthy freshwater supply to creeks and the Bay by
                                    eliminating conditions that pollute rainwater as it flows overland to
                                    creeks, and eliminating conditions that prevent a healthy amount of
                                    rainwater from soaking into the ground and replenishing the
                                    underground water supplies that nourish creeks.
                               d. Instilling widespread public awareness of the value of developing
                                    infrastructure along lines that promote healthier watersheds and
                                    watershed-oriented open spaces where nature and community life can
                                    flourish.
                     28.      Noise Ordinance
                     Adopt a noise ordinance to regulate noise-generating activities.
                     29.      Noise Standards Review
                     Review development proposals to assure consistency with noise standards. The City
                     will require the following and other means, as appropriate, to mitigate noise impacts
                     on adjacent properties:
                                   a. Screen and control noise sources such as parking, outdoor activities
                                        and mechanical equipment.
                                   b. Increase setbacks for noise sources from adjacent dwellings.
                                   c. Wherever possible do not remove fences, walls or landscaping that
                                        serve as noise buffers, although design, safety and other impacts
                                        must be addressed.
                                   d. Use soundproofing materials and double glazed windows.
                                   e. Control hours of operation, including deliveries and trash pickup to
                                        minimize noise impacts.
                     The City will use the Future Noise Contours data to determine if additional noise
                     studies are needed for proposed development.
                     30. Open Space Preservation Program
                     See Implementation Section of Chapter 4.
                     31. Release of Hazardous Materials
                     Update emergency preparedness planning and education related to the release of
                     hazardous materials from refineries and chemical plants in West County to take into
                     account risk management plans of operators.

Establish priorities for riparian and stream restoration that include erosion control
measures, stream clean-up, improved capacity and reliability of the City’s storm
drain system, and revegetation plans. Coordinate creek preservation with CEQA
review, bicycle master plan, open space preservation actions, and grant funding.
33. State Noise Insulation Standards
Use the adopted Health and Safety Element as a guideline for compliance with the
State’s noise insulation standards by providing noise contour information around all
major sources in support of the sound transmission control standards (Chapter 2-
35, Part 2, Title 24, California Administrative Code).
34. Storm Drainage Facilities
Efforts should be made to provide funds for the improvement of the City’s storm
drainage facilities to meet the substantial cost of any such projects.
35. Transportation of Hazardous Materials
Work with Contra Costa County, other cities in the county and other jurisdictions in
establishing standards for the transportation of hazardous wastes through West
County and the City.
36. Tree Preservation Ordinance
Consider adoption of a tree preservation ordinance that will define types and size of
trees to be protected, and will include specific criteria, procedures and mitigation
when trees are proposed to be removed.
37. Unreinforced Masonry Buildings
Develop strategies for abatement of Unreinforced Masonry Buildings (URMB)
hazards consistent with Guidelines established by the California Seismic Safety
Commission, with provisions for coordination with historic preservation.
38. Water Quality Strategies
Implement habitat protection programs and evaluate proposed projects for potential
water quality impacts that may require sediment basins as part of grading activities,
grease/oil traps where concentrations of such pollutants are anticipated, or other
measures. In coordination with Contra Costa County, continue to implement
measures consistent with the City’s NPDES Stormwater Permit.

CHAPTER 8 PUTTING THE PLAN
                                  TO WORK
The true worth of a general plan is measured by how well it actually leads to
achievement of its goals and policies. The strategic approach presented in Chapter
2 is intended to provide a focus for the City’s implementation efforts. In addition,
each policy in the Plan is accompanied by at least one implementation measure.
These implementation measures are then summarized in a separate section
following each set of goals and policies.
This chapter provides additional information on how the Plan implements state law
and local policies, including how the plan can be maintained as an effective
management tool after it is adopted. This General Plan is only the first step, but a
critical one, in providing for the types of future development, facilities, and services
desired by the city.
A. Moving from State Law to Local Policies
Under California law, cities are required to adopt general plans that include seven
“elements” or topics: land use, circulation, housing, safety, open space,
conservation, and noise. At their discretion, cities may adopt additional elements,
such as economic development, community design, and parks and recreation.
This General Plan is organized into chapters, with several appendices containing
technical or explanatory materials. The state-mandated elements are incorporated
into the following chapters:
•    Chapter 4, Community Development and Design, addresses land use,
     community design, housing, and growth management. The section on land use
     contains the future land use plan map and a description of the land use
     categories used in the plan. This chapter fulfills the state-mandated requirement
     for a land use element. The optional community design section discusses design
     issues and identifies special design areas. The state-mandated housing element
     is not part of the 1998-99 update, but will be updated in 2000-01. The complete
     housing element, adopted in 1991, is included as Appendix A. The growth
     management section is in response to a county initiative (Measure C) that links
     growth and infrastructure.
•    Chapter 5, Transportation and Circulation, addresses the movement of people
     and materials by transit, automobiles and trucks, bicycles, and walking. This
     chapter fulfills the state-mandated requirement for a circulation element.
     Additional technical information on transportation is included in Appendix B.
•    Chapter 6, Public Facilities and Services, deals with three topics: parks and
     recreation, civic and community facilities, and public services and infrastructure.
August 30, 1999                                                                 Putting the Plan to Work 8-1

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                           These subjects are not mandated by state law but are included because of the
                           City’s intense interest in its parks and other recreation facilities, and because all
                           public facilities and services are related to land use policies contained in Chapter
                           4.
                      •    Chapter 7, Resources and Hazards, addresses natural and historic resources in
                           its first major section. The natural resources discussion includes open space,
                           wildlife, air quality, and storm runoff. The second major section addresses
                           hazards⎯geologic hazards, fires, flooding, and noise. Chapter 7 fulfills the
                           state-mandated requirements for open space, conservation, safety, and noise
                           elements.
                      B. Consistency Requirements
                      State law provides cities with a variety of techniques for implementing general plans.
                      It also requires that these implementation techniques be consistent with the general
                      plan. The most important techniques and their relationship to the general plan are
                      discussed below.
                      Zoning Ordinance
                      The zoning ordinance and zoning map are parcel-specific statements of how land
                      may be used and provide specific conditions that El Cerrito will impose, consistent
                      with the overall policy framework of the General Plan and land use map. As such,
                      zoning should not be confused with the General Plan or the land use map, which
                      are not precise or parcel-specific and, therefore, may not show detailed land use
                      distinctions nor, in all cases, reflect existing use of the land.
                      Government Code Section 65860 requires that a city’s zoning ordinance be
                      consistent with its general plan. Consistency means that various land uses
                      authorized by the zoning ordinance, and the distribution of these permitted land
                      uses, must serve to implement the goals and policies of the general plan. Specific
                      zoning ordinance districts must correspond with the land use designations and the
                      geographic extent of the designations presented on the land use map, even if they
                      vary from actual existing conditions.
                      Subdivision Ordinance
                      Government Code Section 66410 et seq. requires that local jurisdictions regulate and
                      control subdivision activity through adoption and use of a subdivision ordinance.
                      Section 66473.5 requires that a city shall not approve a proposed subdivision map
                      unless the subdivision, including its design and proposed land uses, is consistent
                      with the general plan. Similar to the consistency requirements of the zoning
                      ordinance and map, consistency may be found only when the proposed subdivision
                      is consistent with the goals, policies, and implementation programs included in the
                      general plan. The subdivision consistency requirement applies to subdivisions for
                      which parcel maps (minor subdivisions) are filed, as well as tentative and final maps.
8-2 Putting the Plan to Work                                                                   August 30, 1999

                                                                                    EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
Section 66474 specifically requires that a city shall deny approval of tentative and
final maps if it finds that the proposed map, its design, or the proposed
improvements are inconsistent with its general plan.
Capital Improvement Programs
Government Code 65401 requires the city council to obtain from city officials and
staff, and from special districts operating within the city limits, lists of all public
works projects recommended for study, design, or construction during each ensuing
year. The list of public works projects is then organized into a coordinated
program, called the capital improvement program (CIP). The CIP and its
component projects must be reviewed by the city, and inconsistent projects must be
deleted or modified to conform to the general plan.
Environmental Impact Review
The regulations implementing the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA),
California Administrative Code Section 14100 et seq., contain several references to
the relationship of environmental review, as prescribed by CEQA, and the general
plan. Section 15080 requires that the environmental review process be “combined
with the existing planning, review, and project approval process” used by the city.
Section 15125(b) requires environmental review to discuss any inconsistencies
between a proposed project and the general plan. Projects should be found to have
a significant adverse effect on the environment if they conflict “with adopted
environmental plans and goals of the community . . . .”
Redevelopment
The City of El Cerrito has established a Redevelopment Project Area along San
Pablo Avenue. State law (Health and Safety Code Sections 33302 and 33331)
requires that El Cerrito’s Redevelopment Plan be in conformance with the City’s
General Plan.
Other Consistency Requirements
State Housing Law (Health and Safety Code Sections 17910 et seq.) requires a city to
adopt regulations imposing substantially the same standards as those contained in
the various uniform industry codes. State law also imposes special standards, which
may be more stringent than the uniform industry codes (e.g., the Uniform Building
Code), designed to protect against certain types of hazards (fire, noise, earthquakes,
unstable soils) and achieve certain resource management goals (such as energy
conservation). El Cerrito may adopt regulations and standards that vary form those
mandated by state law, if justified by local conditions. If such variance is
appropriate, the General Plan can serve as the vehicle for documenting local
conditions and specifying the necessary regulatory response.
August 30, 1999                                                               Putting the Plan to Work 8-3

EL CERRITO GENERAL PLAN
                      C. Maintaining the General Plan
                      The traditional view of a general plan is that it is a more-or-less static document,
                      updated about every 20 years, with much more emphasis on maps than on policies.
                      This view is consistent with planning as practiced in many other countries where the
                      government has much more control over land use than in the United States. The
                      more contemporary view of general plans is that they are a management tool that
                      must be kept up to date if they are to provide useful guidance for decision making in
                      a rapidly changing economic environment.
                      In order to keep the plan up to date so that it is an effective management tool, the
                      following measures should be implemented.
                      1. The City staff should prepare an annual report on the status of achieving the
                           strategic action items listed in Chapter 2. This report should be brief and
                           contain the following information:
                           • Name of strategic action
                           • Status
                           • Current issues that need attention
                           • Recommended changes in plans, policies, or regulations.
                      This report should be prepared prior to the City Council’s annual goal setting
                      session.
                      2. The City staff should prepare an evaluation report every five years⎯the
                           evaluation report should address the following:
                           • The degree to which each goal has been successfully reached
                           • The effectiveness of each policy in reaching its goal or goals
                           • Problems and opportunities that were unanticipated when the plan or most
                              recent five year evaluation was developed
                           • Data that is out of date to the extent that it inhibits the successful
                              implementation of the General Plan
                           • Recommended changes in the General Plan and to other plans, policies, and
                              regulations.
                      3. The City staff should propose General Plan amendments as needed in order to
                           maintain the Plan as an effective management tool.
                      4. The contents of the General Plan, all General Plan amendments, the Existing
                           Conditions Report, and the Environmental Impact Report for this Plan must be
                           easily accessible. At a minimum, at least the General Plan should be on the
                           City’s website. As part of the amendment process, it is highly desirable to
                           replace superseded pages with revised pages in order to minimize confusion.
                      5. The General Plan should be used in the development of capital improvement
                           programs, annual budgets, and, as applicable, personnel reviews.

D. Amending the General Plan
The City or private individuals can initiate General Plan amendments. The state law
governing amendments is found beginning at Section 65350 of the Government
Code. The law provides that the Planning Commission must hold at least one
public hearing before approving a written recommendation for a Plan amendment.
The City Council must then hold at least one public hearing before approving an
amendment. The state law provides for the type of notice that must be given for
these hearing.
A General Plan amendment is subject to the provisions of the California
Environmental Quality Act and, therefore, may require an Environmental Impact
Report or other environmental documentation. Periodic review of the entire
General Plan is not required by state law but, as noted above, is highly
recommended. The state law does require a review of the Housing Element every
five years; these reviews normally will result in a Plan amendment.
