                                             1. I NTRODUCTION
Overview
The City of Brentwood General Plan (General Plan) identifies the community’s vision for
the future and provides a framework that will guide decisions on growth, development,
and conservation of open space and resources in a manner that is consistent with the
quality of life desired by the city's residents and businesses. The General Plan supersedes
and replaces the 2001 General Plan. The General Plan carries forward some of the major
goal and policy framework of the 2001 General Plan, but has been substantially updated to
address current local conditions, community priorities, and goals, and has been reorganized
to make the document more user-friendly and straightforward.
Scope and Content of the General Plan
State law requires the City to adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan for the
physical development of its planning area. The general plan must include land use,
circulation, housing, conservation, open space, noise, and safety elements, as specified in
Government Code Section 65302, to the extent that the issues identified by State law
exist in the City’s planning area. Additional elements that relate to the physical
development of the city may also be addressed in the general plan. The degree of
specificity and level of detail of the discussion of each general plan element need only
reflect local conditions and circumstances. The General Plan has been prepared consistent
with the requirements of State law and addresses the relevant items addressed in
Government Code Section 65300 et seq.
The General Plan includes the following elements:                                                 Two important

          Final General Plan.
The General Plan also includes an Implementation chapter that prioritizes the timing for
each separate action that is identified in the various elements.
Public Participation
The General Plan was developed with extensive opportunities for participation from
residents, businesses, local agencies, and other stakeholders. A series of four public
Visioning Workshops were held in November and December 2012 in order to identify
the community’s vision for the future, and to develop principles to guide the General Plan
Update. Additionally, City staff and the consultant team developed two online surveys to
gather additional information from the public related to the General Plan Update. The
online surveys were available through the General Plan Update website, and were

                 developed to pose similar questions to those posed at the visioning workshops, and to
                 gather additional details regarding City service levels, residential homeownership,
                 employment locations, and economic development priorities.
                 The 12-member General Plan Update Working Group, which consisted of members from
                 the City Council, Planning Commission, Parks and Recreation Commission, and the
                 community at-large, collaborated with City staff and the General Plan Update consultant
                 team throughout the development of the General Plan. The Working Group met
                 approximately 15 times between March 2013 and February 2014, to identify key issues
                 and challenges that Brentwood faces over the next 20-30 years, and to develop the
                 comprehensive set of goals, policies, and actions contained in the General Plan. Each
                 Working Group meeting was open to the public, and numerous members of the public
                 and other local interested agencies attended the meetings and provided detailed input to
                 the Working Group.
                 The City Council and Planning Commission held approximately 10 public workshops and
                 hearings to consider the goals and policies of the 2001 General Plan, review input from
                 the Visioning Workshops, receive information relevant to the specific topics addressed at
                 the Working Group meetings, and provide specific direction and guidance to staff and the
                 consultant team regarding how goals should be achieved and how to address current
                 issues.
                 	  
                                                   Guiding Principles
                      Through the General Plan Update process, the following set of distinct guiding
                      principles was identified:
                          •   Protect Brentwood's family-oriented environment, character, and sense
                              of community
                          •   Provide a range of high-quality housing options
                          •   Attract and retain businesses and industries that provide high-quality
                              and high-paying jobs so that residents can live and work in Brentwood
                          •   Preserve surrounding agricultural lands and the city's agricultural heritage
                          •   Expand retail shopping opportunities to provide better local services
                              and increased sales tax revenues
                          •   Continue to maintain and improve the road network and provide
                              increased transit opportunities
                          •   Maintain strong fiscal sustainability and continue to provide high-quality
                              services
  1-2                                                                           Brentwood General Plan

                                                                                                1. I NTRODUCTION
Applying the General Plan
The General Plan is intended for use by a broad range of persons, including:
     •    The City Council, Planning Commission, and Parks and Recreation Commission in
          decision-making activities;
     •    City staff in developing and implementing programs and projects;
     •    The development community in preparing development proposals; and
     •    Residents and businesses interested in the future development of Brentwood and
          understanding the community’s vision, goals, and priorities.
The General Plan applies to lands in the incorporated area of the City, to the extent
allowed by Federal and State law. Under State law, many actions, such as development
projects, specific plans, master plans, community plans, zoning, subdivisions, public agency
projects, and other decisions must be consistent with the General Plan. State law requires
that the City's ordinances regulating land use be consistent with the General Plan. The
Zoning Ordinance, individual project proposals, and other related plans and ordinances
must be consistent with the goals and policies in the General Plan.
Interpreting the General Plan
In reading the General Plan, one should infer that the goals, policies, and actions are limited
to the extent that it is financially feasible and appropriate for the City to carry them out
and to the extent legally permitted by Federal and State law. For example, policies and
actions which indicate that the City will “provide,” “support,” “ensure,” or otherwise
require or carry them out do not indicate an irreversible commitment of City funds or staff
resources to those activities, but rather, that the City will support them when the City
deems that it is financially feasible and appropriate to do so. In some cases, the City will
carry out various policies and actions by requiring development, infrastructure, and other
projects to be consistent with the policies and actions of the General Plan. In other cases,
the City may include General Plan items in the Capital Improvement Program, annual
budget, or other implementation mechanisms, as the City deems appropriate.
Organization of the General Plan Elements
Each element (i.e., chapter) of the General Plan is organized into a set of goals, policies,
and actions. Each goal is supported by a particular set of policies and actions to implement
and achieve that goal. Chapter 12 of the General Plan (Implementation) includes a
complete summary of each action that is identified in the various elements, accompanied
by the City department responsible for implementing the action and the timing of
implementation.
Amending the General Plan
Since goals and policies in the General Plan reflect a range of competing interests, the
decision-makers have broad discretion in interpreting the General Plan and its purposes,
and are allowed to weigh and balance the various goals and policies when applying them.
Recognizing the need for the General Plan to remain current and reflective of local issues
and policies, State law allows the City to periodically amend the General Plan to ensure
that it is consistent with the conditions, values, expectations, and needs of its residents,
businesses, and other stakeholders. The General Plan may be amended in accordance with
State law and only by action of the City Council, upon recommendation by the Planning
Commission, or by voter-approved initiative. While specific findings may be applied on a
    Brentwood General Plan                                                                                      1-3

1. I NTRODUCTION
                 project-by-project basis, at a minimum the following standard findings shall be made for each
                 proposed General Plan amendment:
                      1. The amendment is deemed to be in the public interest;
                      2. The amendment is consistent and/or compatible with the rest of the General Plan;
                      3. The potential impacts of the amendment have been assessed and have been
                           determined not to be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare; and
                      4. The amendment has been processed in accordance with the applicable provisions
                           of the California Government Code and the California Environmental Quality Act
                           (CEQA).
                 City-initiated amendments, as well as amendments requested by other public agencies, are
                 subject to the same basic process described above to ensure consistency and compatibility
                 with the General Plan. This includes appropriate environmental review, public notice, and
                 public hearings, leading to an official action by the City Council.
                 Annual Reporting
                 Given the long-term nature of the General Plan, it is critical to periodically evaluate its
                 effectiveness and to document the implementation status of the various policies and
                 actions that it contains. State law provides direction on how cities and counties can maintain
                 the General Plan as a useful policy guide. State law also requires the City to annually report
                 "the status of the plan and progress in its implementation" (California Government Code
                 Section 65400(b)) to the City Council.
                                                           Key Terms
                 Goal:           A description of the general desired result that the community
                                 seeks to create.
                 Policy:         A specific statement that guides decision-making as the City works
                                 to achieve the various goals and objectives. Once adopted, policies
                                 represent statements of City regulations.
                 Action:         An implementation measure, procedure, technique, or specific
                                 program to be undertaken by the City to help achieve a specified
                                 goal or implement an adopted policy. The City must take additional
                                 steps to implement each action in the General Plan. An action is
                                 something that can and will be completed.

                                               2. C IRCULATION
Overview
The Circulation Element provides the framework for decisions concerning the city’s multi-
modal transportation system, which includes roadway, transit, bicycle, pedestrian, and rail
modes of travel. The Circulation Element provides for coordination with the Contra
Costa Transportation Authority, which serves as the coordinating agency for
transportation funding for Contra Costa County.
State law (California Government Code Section 65302(b)) mandates that the Circulation
Element contain the general location and extent of existing and proposed major
thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, military airports and ports, and other public
utilities and facilities, to the extent these items exist in the planning area. As required by
California Government Code Section 65302(b), the Circulation Element is correlated
closely with the Land Use Element and is related to the Housing, Conservation & Open
Space, Noise, and Safety elements.
The Circulation Element reflects the City’s desire to provide for complete street, bicycle,
and pedestrian facilities. This element considers overall mobility, existing and desired land
uses, future street conditions, and mobility for non-automobile users, including safe routes
to schools.       This element establishes standards that guide development of the
transportation system through goals, policies, and actions.
Background information regarding circulation conditions in Brentwood is presented in
Chapter 2 of the General Plan Update Existing Conditions Report.

Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal CIR 1      Provide a transportation system that facilitates the efficient
                movement of people and goods within and through the city of
                Brentwood and promotes the use of alternatives to the single-
                occupant vehicle
Policy CIR 1-1:    Ensure that the City’s circulation network is maintained and improved
                   over time to support buildout of the General Plan in a manner that is
                   consistent with the General Plan Roadways Map.
Policy CIR 1-2:    Ensure that the City’s circulation network is a well-connected system of
                   streets, roads, highways, sidewalks, and paths that effectively
                   accommodates vehicular and non-vehicular traffic in a manner that
                   considers the context of surrounding land uses and the needs of all
                   roadway users.
Policy CIR 1-3:    When analyzing impacts to the circulation network created by new
                   development or roadway improvements, consider the needs of all
                   users, including those with disabilities, ensuring that pedestrians,
                   bicyclists, and transit riders are considered at an equal level to
                   automobile drivers.
Policy CIR 1-4:    Maintain the Multimodal Transportation Service Objective (MTSO)
                   standards set forth for designated regional transportation facilities that
                   pass through Brentwood, as identified in the East County Action Plan for
                   Routes of Regional Significance, produced by the TRANSPLAN
                   Committee and Contra Costa Transportation Authority (CCTA).
                   1. Following are the Routes of Regional Significance identified within
                       and surrounding Brentwood by the East County Action Plan for
                       Routes of Regional Significance.

                       j.    Vasco Road
                   2. Freeway MTSO – The Delay Index should not exceed 2.5 during
                       the peak hour. This applies to SR 4 Bypass freeway segments.
                   3. Signalized Suburban Arterial Routes – Intersection levels of service
                       should be maintained at LOS D or better.
                   4. Non-Signalized Rural Roads – Roadway levels of service should be
                       maintained at LOS D or better.

Policy CIR 1-5:  Maintain LOS D or better operation at intersections within Brentwood
                 that are not on designated Routes of Regional Significance, and LOS E
                 or better operation at intersections in the Downtown Specific Plan
                 area. At unsignalized intersections, levels of service shall be determined
                 for both controlled movements and for the overall intersection.

                 and/or if the “Peak Hour” signal warrant outlined in the California
                 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices remains unmet.                       Level of Service (LOS)
                                                                                                 is used to rank traffic
Policy CIR 1-6:  Intersections may be exempted from the LOS standards established in             operation on various
                 Policy CIR 1-5 in cases where the City Council finds that the                  types of facilities based
                 infrastructure improvements needed to maintain vehicle LOS (such as             on traffic volumes and
                 roadway or intersection widening) would be in conflict with goals of           roadway capacity using
                 improving multimodal circulation, or would lead to other potentially               a series of letter
                 adverse environmental impacts. For those locations where the City                designations ranging

Policy CIR 1-8:  Consider all transportation improvements as opportunities to improve
                 safety, access, and mobility for all roadway users.
Policy CIR 1-9:  Provide high quality regular maintenance for existing and future
                 transportation facilities including streets, sidewalks, and paths.
Policy CIR 1-10: Maximize the use of matching funding grant sources to provide ongoing
                 maintenance, operation, and management of the City’s circulation
                 network.
Policy CIR 1-11: Consider roundabouts in lieu of traffic signals where appropriate
                 conditions exist to maximize intersection efficiency, maintain
                 continuous but moderate traffic flow, reduce accident severity, and
                 enhance pedestrian and cyclist circulation.
Policy CIR 1-12: Maintain and improve critical transportation facilities for emergency
                 vehicle access and emergency evacuation needs.
Policy CIR 1-13: Maintain a transportation system, consistent with the City Truck Routes
                 Map, which provides truck mobility to serve Brentwood commerce,
                 and supports infrastructure improvements to separate regional goods
                 movement from local circulation.
Policy CIR 1-14: Work with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in
                 evaluating the potential to create additional grade separated roadway
                 crossings on the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) line through
                 Brentwood.

Overview
Natural resources, including open space lands, agricultural lands, waterways, hillsides, scenic
views, wildlife habitat, and historical resources form an important part of Brentwood’s
unique character and represent some of its greatest assets. The Conservation and Open
Space Element provides the framework to protect, maintain, and enhance Brentwood’s
natural resources. The Conservation and Open Space Element balances the overall vision
of the General Plan for preserving Brentwood’s high living standards, agricultural heritage,
and natural resources while simultaneously providing for economic development and
balanced growth.
State law requires the General Plan to address open space issues, including the recognition
of open space as a valuable resource for its own sake, the coordination of local policies
with State and regional policies, and the use of open space to preserve environmentally
sensitive natural areas and habitat. California Government Code Section 65560 defines
open space lands as being essentially unimproved and devoted to the preservation of
natural resources, managed production of resources, outdoor recreation, or public health
and safety.
As required by State law, the Conservation and Open Space Element addresses the
conservation and utilization of open space lands and natural resources, including natural
habitats, riparian corridors, special-status species, and soils/hillsides. The Conservation and
Open Space Element also addresses the topics of energy conservation, air quality, water
quality, and the preservation of cultural and historical resources.
Background information regarding conservation, natural resources, and open space
conditions in Brentwood is presented in Chapter 5 of the General Plan Update Existing
Conditions Report.

Overview
The Economic Development Element seeks to sustain and diversify the city’s economy,
recognizing the importance of supporting existing and local businesses while broadening and
expanding the employment base and economic opportunities within the city. Long-term fiscal
sustainability will be supported by economic growth from increasing the range of business,
commercial services, and high-quality jobs in the city. Providing a broader economic base is
intended to improve the city’s economic vitality while increasing access for residents to local
goods and services and local employment opportunities.
The Economic Development Element is consistent with the extensive planning efforts recently
undertaken through the Downtown Specific Plan and the Brentwood Boulevard Specific Plan to
strengthen the Downtown as the economic and cultural center of the city, and to provide
increased businesses and enhanced economic development opportunities along the Brentwood
Boulevard corridor. The Economic Development Element supports the city’s existing economic
base and encourages development of additional, complementary jobs-generating uses, particularly
along major regional roadways.
The primary comments related to economic development that were received during the General
Plan Update Visioning Workshops include: strengthen the local economy through creating
adequate high-paying jobs for Brentwood’s residents; encourage a more diverse base of
industries; attract emerging industries, including green, biotechnical, and medical technologies and
equipment; focus on business growth in areas that expand or complement the city’s agricultural
base; and address expanding commercial and retail options.
The Economic Development Element is not mandated by State law and is therefore considered
optional. Background information regarding economic development conditions in Brentwood is
presented in Chapter 5 of the General Plan Update Existing Conditions Report.

Overview
The Fiscal Sustainability Element presents goals, policies, and actions relating to the City's
long-term financial health and prosperity. The ability of the City to provide services such as
police protection, parks, recreation, code enforcement, planning, and public works is
dependent on the City collecting adequate revenues.
Brentwood's economic development and fiscal vitality are inter-dependent. A vital local
economy ensures that private investment is taking place in the community while
generating needed tax revenues to support public services and facilities. When local
government is adequately financed, it can in turn provide the infrastructure, planning, and
services essential for maintaining a high quality of life and environment where businesses
can prosper.
The Fiscal Sustainability Element is not mandated by State law and is therefore considered
to be optional. A description of existing fiscal conditions is provided in Chapter 1.4 of the
General Plan Update Existing Conditions Report and in Chapter 3.1 of the General Plan
Update Land Use Alternatives Report.
Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal FI 1          Maintain a balanced land use plan and a diversified, stable,
                   and self-sustaining revenue base in order to generate the

                   services
Policy FI 1-1:        Ensure that the City’s revenue base is not overly dependent on any
                      one land use designation or any single revenue source.
Policy FI 1-2:        Ensure a balanced land use plan that will provide for a broad revenue
                      base, including sales and property tax.
Policy FI 1-3:        New or expanded services should support the priorities reflected in
                      the General Plan.
Policy FI 1-4:        User fees should be used to recover the cost of services that benefit
                      specific segments of the community.
Policy FI 1-5:        Maintain competitive rates for City services and for fees charged for the
                      use of community resources.

                      the costs incurred by the City to provide infrastructure and public
                      services to such development.
Policy FI 1-7:        Recover the direct and indirect costs of providing services and facilities
                      through a combination of fees, exactions, and other methods based on
                      an evaluation of long-term economic benefits and in a manner
                      consistent with cost recovery goals established by the City Council.

                                    developer should be included in the Capital Improvement Program and
                                    the appropriate City fund.
                   Policy FI 1-9:   Develop and implement a residential growth management program
                                    that focuses on funding infrastructure which is directly linked to job

                   Policy FI 1-10:  Encourage new development in areas where the City has existing
                                    public service capacity that new development can utilize, while
                                    expanding the tax base.
                   Policy FI 1-11:  Encourage new development in areas where it has the potential to
                                    catalyze reinvestment and revitalization of existing development.
                   Actions in Support of Goal FI 1
                   Action FI 1a:    Annually review and adjust user fees to ensure that they reflect the full
                                    cost (or the percentage of full cost as approved by the City Council) of
                                    providing services.
                   Action FI 1b:    Require development projects to prepare a fiscal analysis of potential
                                    effects on the City’s revenue generation and cost of services, when the
                                    City Treasurer determines there is potential for significant negative fiscal
                                    impacts, and condition project approval upon establishment of revenue
                                    enhancement mechanisms if necessary to prevent adverse fiscal impacts.
                   Action FI 1c:    Regularly review the City’s Comprehensive Economic Development
                                    Strategy and the Land Use Element, using the City’s Fiscal Model to
                                    forecast potential development outcomes, to ensure that the strategy
                                    provides an adequate employment and revenue base.
                   Action FI 1d:    Consider annexation of targeted jobs-generating areas, reviewing and
                                    ensuring that any annexation provides a fiscal benefit to the City.
                   Action FI 1e:    Investigate and implement, where appropriate, new revenue sources,
                                    particularly those which will not add to the tax or fee burden of residents
                                    or businesses.
                   Action FI 1f:    Develop and implement a residential growth management program to
                                    ensure that jobs-related impacts created by new residential growth are
                                    addressed in the form of providing appropriate funding for infrastructure
                                    that is directly linked to job creation.
                   Action FI 1g:    Identify areas with existing public service capacity and prioritize for

Goal FI 2      Budget and make financial decisions over a 10-year planning
               horizon in order to ensure the long-range fiscal prosperity of
               Brentwood
Policy FI 2-1:   Adopt an operating budget that funds current year operating
                 expenditures with current year revenues. One-time revenues should
                 not be relied upon to fund recurring operating costs.
Policy FI 2-2:   Continue to use the General Fund Fiscal Model as part of the annual
                 budget process, with adjustments as necessary to address changing
                 conditions and priorities.
Policy FI 2-3:   Surplus fund balances (those in excess of minimum reserves established
                 in the City's formal reserve policies) may be used to increase reserves,
                 fund projects that are identified in the Capital Improvement Program,
                 including projects necessary to make high priority areas for future
                 employee-generating uses ready for development, and/or be carried
                 forward to fund future operating budgets to ensure fiscal stability.
                 Consider investment options for surplus, set-aside, and reserve funds
                 that will generate a return on investment in terms of future revenue
                 increases.
Policy FI 2-4:   Utilize the Pension/Other Post-Employment Benefits Obligation Fund
                 to offset rising pension and retiree medical costs in the short or
                 immediate term. Structural budget deficits beyond the scope or
                 capacity of the Pension/Other Post-Employment Benefits Obligation
                 Fund (i.e., budget shortfalls expected to extend beyond the two-year
                 budget horizon) should be corrected through adjustments in service
                 standards, use of new service delivery strategies, or other mechanisms
                 to bring long-term costs in line with anticipated ongoing revenues.
Policy FI 2-5:   Maintain and regularly review the targeted reserve levels to ensure that
                 the reserve set-aside goals and amounts are appropriate to cover
                 reasonably foreseeable emergencies and economic declines and to
                 determine whether alternative uses, such as funding for facilities and
                 services necessary to attract major business, would be appropriate for
                 surplus reserves or surplus funds.

Overview
Growth management is the use of a wide range of techniques to determine the amount,
type, and rate of development desired by the community and to channel that growth into
designated areas. A growth management system is commonly organized into a set of
goals, objectives, policies, and performance standards that guide the physical development
of a community.
Growth management systems promote a variety of environmental, social, and economic
goals, including balancing the service costs and revenues associated with development;
protecting environmental and aesthetic qualities; encouraging the efficient use of land,
water, and energy resources; preserving community identity; and protecting the economic
base of the community.
The Growth Management Element is part of the General Plan because the City wants to
ensure orderly and fiscally sustainable growth, while maintaining high levels of public
services and infrastructure, and because Contra Costa County voters approved a 0.5%
sales tax increase in November 1988, commonly known as “Measure C,” that includes
both Transportation Improvement and Growth Management Programs (GMP). The
overall goals of the Measure C program are:
•      To relieve congestion created by past development through road and transit
       improvements funded by the proceeds of the sales tax increase; and
•      To prevent future development decisions from resulting in the deterioration of
       public services and unacceptable traffic performance standards.
To be eligible for its share of revenue generated under Measure C, the City of Brentwood
must commit itself, as a matter of public policy, to carrying out the following objectives:
•      Manage congestion by adopting and applying traffic service standards for streets,
       roads, and Regional Routes; and
•      Adopt policies for fire protection, police, parks, water, flood control, and sanitary
       sewer service level standards that will be met as the city grows.
The City of Brentwood continues to demonstrate a commitment to growth management
while providing adequate levels of public services. This commitment is demonstrated
through adoption of the Growth Management Element, which conforms to Measure C
(Contra Costa Transportation Improvement and Growth Management Program) and
Proposition 111, a State measure that provides funding to local governments on the basis
of compliance with the Congestion Management Program (CMP).
In Contra Costa County, the CMP requirements have been incorporated into the Action
Plan for East Contra Costa County. Brentwood is participating in the preparation of the
Action Plan for East Contra Costa County along with the cities of Antioch and Pittsburg,
as well as Contra Costa County.
The key objective of the Action Plan is to maintain levels of service for roads and other
public facilities. Failure to meet established standards could result in a reduced level of
funding from Measure C and State sources.
  Brentwood General Plan                                                                     7-1

                In November 2004, voters in Contra Costa County extended the Measure C sales tax
                until 2034 through the passage of Measure J. While this new measure retained many of
                the components of the Measure C GMP, some changes were made, most notably the
                requirement for the adoption of an Urban Limit Line (ULL) for each jurisdiction.
                At its January 8, 2008 meeting, the City Council adopted the Contra Costa County
                Measure L Voter-Approved Urban Limit Line (Resolution No. 2008-3) as the City of
                Brentwood’s Urban Limit Line, which was approved by the majority of Brentwood voters
                in November 2006. This Urban Limit Line for Brentwood is hereby incorporated within
                the City’s Growth Management Element, and the configuration is as shown in the Land
                Use Element (Figure LU-3). Any changes to the ULL must be completed in accordance
                with City Council Resolution No. 2008-3 and consistent with the provisions of Measure J.
                As with Measure C, compliance with Measure J requires the City to continue to participate
                in the regional fee program (ECCRFFA & ECFA) and collect regional fees for
                improvements to regional routes (SR 4 Bypass and SR 4).
                The concept of growth management, including the provision of high quality public services
                and infrastructure, is addressed throughout the General Plan. For example, the Circulation
                Element includes numerous requirements to ensure that the roadway system in and
                around Brentwood will meet applicable level of service (LOS) standards, including LOS
                standards on Routes of Regional Significance identified by the Contra Costa
                Transportation Authority (CCTA). The Infrastructure Element includes provisions to
                ensure that future development projects pay their fair-share towards necessary
                infrastructure improvements, and do not result in adverse impacts to existing
                development. The Community Services and Facilities Element includes a wide range of
                policies and actions to ensure the provision of high quality public services, including police,
                fire, parks, and other governmental services.
                The Growth Management Element meets the requirements of Measure C and Measure J,
                and identifies the applicable General Plan policies and actions that would ensure
                compliance with local and regional growth management objectives.

                                                   9. L AND U SE
Overview
The Land Use Element provides for a development and resource conservation pattern
that preserves and protects the high-quality family-oriented neighborhoods throughout
Brentwood and the agricultural lands throughout the City’s Planning Area, while promoting
opportunities for economic development, high-quality local job growth, and fiscal
sustainability. The Land Use Map (Figure LU-1) depicts the City’s vision for how open
space, commercial, industrial, agricultural, residential, and other uses will occur in the city
limits and the surrounding areas.
State law requires the Land Use Element to address:
     •   Proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the
         land for housing, business, industry, open space, including agriculture, natural
         resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public buildings
         and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and other categories of
         public and private uses of land;
     •   Population density and building intensity; and
     •   Areas subject to flooding.
Areas subject to flooding are addressed in the Safety Element.
The Land Use Map (Figure LU-1) identifies the location of land uses by land use
designation for lands in the city limits as well as the overall Planning Area. Uses allowed in
each designation are described below under Policy LU 1-2.
The Land Use Element demonstrates the City’s commitment to providing for strong local
job growth and economic development opportunities, and retaining Brentwood’s high
quality of life by providing a range of housing types that promote a safe and family-
oriented living environment. Residential and commercial growth is focused within the city
limits, with higher density uses focused around major transportation corridors, particularly
State Route 4.
The vast majority of lands outside of the city limits are intended to remain as agricultural
lands. However, some lands immediately adjacent to the city limits, which may be suitable
for annexation in the future, are identified as Special Planning Areas, and include expanded
descriptions of suitable future land uses within these areas.
Density Calculation
For each of the residential designations identified under Policy LU 1-2, a density range is
provided, as reflected in each residential category. It is the intent of this General Plan to
require new development to meet the minimum density requirement. This will ensure
that the community of Brentwood has ample units to meet its housing needs.
The mid-point of the density range (i.e., mid-range) is the starting point for development
proposals in the six residential land use categories excluding the Very High Density
residential category. Land designated Very High Density residential is not subject to the
mid-range requirement. Densities above the mid-range in all other residential land use
categories can be achieved at the discretion of the City Council through the exercise of
transferable agricultural credits or if a significant amount of amenities are incorporated into
  Brentwood General Plan                                                                        9-1

9. L AND U SE
              a project, extensive off-site public improvements are installed, or other significant
              improvements of community-wide benefit are provided.
              Residential development proposals that provide at least 20% of its units affordable to
              lower income households, as defined by State law and the City's Housing Element, are
              exempt from the mid-range requirement and may develop at the high point of the density
              range, provided that an agreement is recorded with the City insuring affordability "over-
              time".
              In addition, senior, disabled, and multi-family housing projects which set aside 10-25% of
              the units for lower income households (as defined by the City's Housing Element) are
              permitted to develop up to 25% above the high point of the designated density range in
              accordance with the City's density bonus ordinance.
              Densities specified in the General Plan are expressed in units per gross acre. Gross
              acreage shall include land dedicated for any public use (including but not limited to streets,
              schools, parks, fire stations and detention basins). Land set aside for public facilities and for
              which reimbursement will be received is not to be included in density calculations (i.e.
              schools and detention basins). The extent to which facilities are provided will help
              determine the actual number of units per acre that will be allowed.
              Planning Boundaries
              There are four key boundary lines addressed by the General Plan. These include the city
              limits, the Sphere of Influence (SOI), the Urban Limit Line (ULL), and the Planning Area, as
              shown on Figure LU-3.
              City Limits:                        Includes the area within the City’s corporate boundary,
                                                  over which the City exercises land use authority and
                                                  provides public services.
              Sphere of Influence (SO I): The probable physical boundary and service area of the
                                                  City, as adopted by the Local Agency Formation
                                                  Commission (LAFCO).              The SOI includes both
                                                  incorporated and unincorporated areas within which
                                                  Brentwood will have the primary responsibility for the
                                                  provision of public facilities and services. Lands within the
                                                  SOI but outside existing city limits may be considered for
                                                  development after annexation. Until that time, the area
                                                  within the SOI is under the jurisdiction of Contra Costa
                                                  County and its General Plan; however, City policies will
                                                  influence the County’s considerations of development
                                                  proposals for lands within the SOI.
              Urban Limit Line (ULL):             A countywide growth management tool used to ensure
                                                  that each jurisdiction in the county regulates the
                                                  geographic extent of urban growth and has a plan for
                                                  future transportation improvements and urban services.
                                                  The establishment of an urban limit line is a requirement
                                                  of Measure J, which took effect on April 1, 2009.
                                                  Compliance with Measure J is necessary for local
                                                  jurisdictions to continue receiving their share of Local

                                                                                            9. L AND U SE
                                Transportation Maintenance and Improvement funds
                                generated by the Measure J transportation sales tax and
                                to be eligible for Contra Costa Transportation for Livable
                                Communities funds. All jurisdictions in the county
                                (including Brentwood) had the option of either adopting
                                the Measure L County voter-approved urban limit line or
                                their own local voter-approved urban limit line. In January
                                2008, the Brentwood City Council adopted a resolution
                                adopting the Measure L County voter-approved urban
                                limit line. The ULL is depicted on Figure LU-3.
Planning Area:                  For the purposes of the General Plan, the Planning Area
                                is defined as the area surrounding the city limits and SOI
                                that is included in the analysis and planning for the 20-
                                year horizon of the General Plan.
Background information regarding land use is presented in Chapter 1.1 of the General Plan

Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal LU 1        Establish a land use pattern in Brentwood that provides for a
                 diverse, self-sufficient community that offers a broad spectrum
                 of job opportunities, housing types, community facilities, and
                 commercial services
Policy LU 1-1:      Maintain a supply of developable commercial, business park, mixed-use,
                    and residential lands sufficient to meet desired growth and economic
                    needs over the planning period.
Policy LU 1-2:      Assign the following range of land use designations throughout the city
                    and the Planning Area, as shown on the Land Use Map (Figure LU-1):
           Residential Land Use Designations
           Ranchette Estate (RE) – The RE designation is intended to maintain and/or
           provide for large residential lots of one acre or more in size, where residents
           want the proximity and amenities of urban life and yet are able to enjoy some
           of the benefits of a more rural environment. This designation is intended to
           maintain some of the small town flavor and/or agricultural character of
           Brentwood's past. The maximum density for this designation is 1.0 unit per
           gross acre.
           Residential Very Low Density (R-VLD) - The R-VLD designation provides for fairly
           large lots for single family residences in an identifiable, suburban residential
           neighborhood, or cluster-style development designed with open space and
           other amenities. Neighborhoods with either development type will be part of
           the Brentwood urban area and be provided with urban public facilities and
           services. The permitted density range is 1.1 to 3.0 units per gross acre, with a
           mid-range of 2.0 units per gross acre.
           Residential Low Density (R-LD) - The R-LD designation is designed predominantly
           for single family detached houses, although higher density developments could
           be accommodated if offset with sufficient open space or other amenities in
           order to maintain the gross density within the indicated range. The permitted
           density range is 1.1 to 5.0 units per gross acre, with a mid-range of 3.0 units per
           gross acre.
           Residential Medium Density (R-MD) – The R-MD designation accommodates a
           variety of housing product types, including duplexes, triplexes, apartments,
           townhouses, and small lot single family detached. The permitted density range is
           5.1 to 11.0 units per gross acre, with a mid-range of 8.0 units per gross acre.
           Residential High Density (R-HD) – The R-HD designation provides for multi-
           family development in structures of two to three stories, with off-street parking
           and other requirements for higher density living. The level of amenities, the
           project location, and the unit types will affect the actual density achieved. The
           permitted density range is 11.1 to 20.0 units per gross acre, with a mid-range of
           15.5 units per gross acre.
           Residential Very High Density (R-VHD) – The R-VHD designation provides for
           multi-family development and is primarily intended for apartments and/or
  Brentwood General Plan                                                                                    9-5

              condominiums in mixed-use areas or areas that are in close proximity to
              services and facilities that serve very high density uses. This designation
              accommodates structures of two to three stories or greater, with off-street
              parking and other requirements suitable for pedestrian-oriented, work-live,
              and/or mixed-use neighborhoods. The level of amenities, the project location,
              and the unit types will affect the actual density achieved. The permitted density
              range is 20.1 to 30.0 units per gross acre (there is no applicable mid-range
              density for this designation).
              Commercial,         O ffice,    Mixed-Use,       and     Industrial    Land     Use
              Designations
              Regional Commercial (RC) – The RC designation includes large-scale retail stores
              and service uses to serve the general needs of the community and the region,
              primarily along the State Route 4 corridor on large development sites. This
              designation is intended for businesses that serve the needs of Brentwood
              residents as well as neighboring communities. Mixed uses allow for the
              development of large offices as a secondary use. Examples of uses include bulk
              retailers, large department stores, supermarkets, hardware stores, and offices.
              General Commercial (GC) – The GC designation allows for concentrations of a
              variety of mixed commercial uses and service type businesses to serve specific
              areas of the city and neighborhoods that are related to State Route 4 and some
              arterial intersections, on parcels generally ranging from one to 20 acres. Such
              uses do not lend themselves to being located in regional commercial centers,
              but are encouraged in orderly clusters in suitable locations proximate to State
              Route 4 and adjacent to major arterials. Depending upon the size of the
              development, a single major tenant (e.g. supermarket or small department
              store) or a single small tenant (e.g. convenience store) should provide the
              anchor. As a secondary use, independent small businesses (e.g. hair salons, shoe
              repair, offices, and restaurants) are also allowed.
              Business Park (BP) – The BP designation provides for integrated business and
              research parks, large individual corporate establishments, professional and
              administrative office centers, and light industrial complexes. Selected
              complementary commercial activities and limited residential uses may also be
              allowed. Examples of allowed uses in this designation include medical supply
              companies, research laboratories, printing companies, warehousing, auto
              services, equipment repair, wholesale home furnishings, light manufacturing,
              retail commercial services, restaurants, and wineries (including associated
              orchards, row crops, production facilities, packing and shipping facilities,
              amphitheater and related uses, and catering facilities). Multi-family housing units,
              senior apartments and living facilities, and institutional levels of congregate care
              are allowed at a density of 20.1 to 30.0 units per acre, where adjacent to
              existing or planned residential development and provided that residential uses
              do not exceed 20 percent of the acreage of any Business Park development.
              Mixed Use Pedestrian Transit (MUPT) – The MUPT designation identifies an area
              which, because of its strategic location, access, and visibility to SR 4, shall be
              developed predominately with jobs-generating and commercial uses. This
              designation is intended to provide high-quality jobs in office, professional,
              research and technology, and light industry sectors, and to allow commercial
              uses with a regional focus. This area is envisioned to be served by mass transit
              (i.e., eBART) or located at or near a destination point with a regular bus route.

                                                                                                9. L AND U SE
        Other uses may include integrated medium to very high density residential
        development and amenities, including services, restaurants, and recreation
        opportunities, in a pedestrian-friendly environment. Multi-family housing units
        will be allowed at a density of 5.1 to 30.0 units per acre, in accordance with the
        policy direction provided by Priority Area 1 (there is no applicable mid-range
        density for this designation).
        Professional Office (PO) – The PO designation is predominantly intended for
        development with a professional, institutional, or medical-dental orientation.
        The designation is not meant for office space that is ancillary to a major
        industrial operation. Typical uses in this designation might include medical, legal,
        and real estate offices.
        Industrial (I) – The I designation provides for industrial uses that tend to have
        some adverse impacts on the environment, including generating truck traffic,
        noise, odors, or smoke. Examples of allowed uses include concrete batch plants,
        trucking operations, and power generators.
        Specific Plan and Planned Development Land Use Designations
        Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) – The DSP designation provides for the current
        and future uses of the Downtown area of Brentwood, in accordance with the
        Downtown Specific Plan. Its purpose is to create a pedestrian-oriented,
        economically-viable town center. A variety of uses are allowed in this
        designation, including entertainment, retail, commercial, residential, civic, cultural,
        and transit in a compact, walkable, and unique setting that only the Downtown
        can offer. All new development occurring within the DSP designations required
        to adhere to the development standards and guidelines established in the
        Downtown Specific Plan.
        Brentwood Boulevard Specific Plan (BBSP) – The BBSP designation provides for
        the current and future uses along the Brentwood Boulevard corridor, in
        accordance with the Brentwood Boulevard Specific Plan. The BBSP designation
        accommodates a range of residential, commercial, office, mixed use, and other
        complementary uses that encourage the revitalization of the Brentwood
        Boulevard corridor within the Brentwood Boulevard Specific Plan area.
        Planned Development (PD) – The PD designation identifies areas where a master
        planned project has been approved and entitled, and site specific zoning has
        been established. The PD land use designation defaults to the zoning that is in
        place for the subject parcel.

              assembly facilities, golf courses and other privately owned recreation facilities,
              private schools, and day care centers.
              Park (P) – The P designation includes existing and future park and recreation
              facilities of varying size, function, and location to serve the entire community.
              Standards for park sites are described in greater detail in the Community
              Services and Facilities Element. The Land Use Map does not reflect all potential
              future park sites. Parks are an allowed land use in all residential, commercial,
              business park, mixed-use, and public and semi-public facility designations.
              School (SCH) – The SCH designation identifies the locations of existing and
              planned public schools, as well as administrative offices and other facilities that
              are owned and operated by the respective school district. The Land Use Map
              does not reflect all potential future school sites.
              Community College (CC) – The CC designation identifies the location of a future
              community college.
              Permanent Open Space (P-OS) – The P-OS designation identifies lands that are
              permanently protected from future urban development through the application
              of conservation easements or other formal mechanisms to ensure that open
              space uses are continued in perpetuity. Appropriate and typical uses include
              grazing land, regional and State parks, wildlife preserves, and habitat areas.
              Agricultural Conservation (AC) – The AC designation encompasses lands with
              continuing commercial agricultural potential. The intent of this designation is to
              retain primary agricultural use to the greatest extent possible. This is done by
              focusing public and private efforts to protect such land from the impacts and
              pressures of the nearby urban area as well as to enhance the income potential
              from agricultural use. In order to protect the Urban Limit Line, no annexations
              or urban-type development will be allowed in this area. Examples of allowed
              uses include orchards, row crops, nurseries, grazing lands, open space, packing
              and shipping facilities, wineries, bed and breakfast inns, u-pick stands, farm
              equipment repair and services, and parks.
              Urban Reserve (UR) – The UR designation serves as a placeholder for future
              urban development. The land designated as Urban Reserve is located beyond
              the existing Sphere of Influence (SOI) and outside the Urban Limit Line. Lands
              designated Urban Reserve shall not be extensively subdivided or developed
              until it is appropriate to develop the lands with urban levels of residential,
              commercial, parks and recreation, and public/semi-public uses. It is expected
              that more specific planning and feasibility studies will be required prior to the
              development of these areas. Development of these areas will require separate
              environmental review, General Plan amendments, Sphere of Influence
  9-8                                                               Brentwood General Plan

                                                                                          9. L AND U SE
        amendments, annexations, and other entitlements. In order to avoid "leapfrog"
        style development, provide for the logical extension of City services, and allow
        for appropriate planning of Brentwood, the Urban Reserve areas could only
        develop when:
             1. Urban development is occurring immediately adjacent to the Urban
                 Reserve parcel which intends to develop;
             2. Urban services (i.e., water, wastewater, storm drainage, utilities, and
                 roads) have been extended or are planned to be extended to the
                 majority of adjacent lands designated for urban uses; and
             3. The new development improves the jobs/housing balance or
                 maintains an approximately 1.5:1 jobs/housing balance, or there is
                 substantial justification why this ratio cannot be met. The City may
                 determine that the above findings are not required if the
                 development offers substantial amenities or benefits to the
                 community that are beyond current levels. Prior to the submittal of
                 an application for any entitlements within the Urban Reserve area, a
                 market feasibility study shall be prepared by an independent
                 consultant contracted by the City and paid for by the developer. The
                 results of this study shall be used by the City Council to determine if
                 it is appropriate for the property to develop.
        Special Planning Areas
        Special Planning Area (SPA) - Two Special Planning Areas are designated by the
       General Plan. These areas have been designated as Special Planning Areas for
       one or more of the following reasons:
             1. To facilitate comprehensive planning of large strategic areas utilizing
                 progressive planning techniques to ensure high quality development
                 and integrate development with the provision of infrastructure;
             2. They are located in strategic locations that will be impacted by land use
                 decisions not totally within the control of the City of Brentwood;
             3. A mix of land uses in the area is desirable and the City desires to
                 maintain the flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions; and
             4. Effective land use controls are needed to preserve the integrity of
                 existing adjacent development while enabling the property owners to
                 adjust to changing market conditions.
       Specific Plans or Planned Development Zoning will be required for the Special
       Planning Areas. This process is intended to:
             1. Facilitate high quality development;
             2. Allow for coordination of planning efforts between more than one
                 property owner;
             3. Allow for infrastructure cost sharing arrangements;

                   4. Provide developments which are more sensitive to the environment;
                        and
                   5. Provide special amenities such as golf courses, lakes, hillside open space,
                        park areas, horse staging areas, agricultural preserves, swimming pools,
                        civic centers, etc.
              SPA Planning Process
              Development within a Special Planning Area (SPA) shall occur in accordance
              with the following process:
                   1. The City shall adopt a specific plan, as defined by Sections 65450-
                        65457 of the California Government Code, or a Planned Development
                        zone district shall be applied with substantially the same contents as a
                        specific plan. This shall address the entire SPA except as noted in (2)
                        below;
                   2. Preparation of multiple specific plans or planned development zone
                        districts for a SPA may be allowed when the City finds that this would
                        be in the public interest due to ownership pattern, size of the SPA,
                        timing of development, or other similar factors. However, in no case
                        shall a specific plan or Planned Development zone district contain less
                        than 50 acres or represent less than 25% of the developable acreage of
                        a SPA; and
                   3. Once a specific plan or Planned Development zone district is adopted,
                        discretionary approvals (such as subdivision maps, rezoning, or design
                        review) may be granted by the City.
              SPA 1 -        SPA 1 is located immediately east of the city limits, north of
              Chestnut Street, south of Lone Tree Way, and west of Sellers Avenue. SPA 1
              is located outside of the existing Urban Limit Line (ULL). The primary land uses
              within SPA 1 should include Low and Very Low Density Residential, and limited
              areas of Business Park and General Commercial. Future development within
              SPA 1 should include adequate buffers and transition areas to avoid land use
              conflicts with agricultural lands to the east.
              SPA 2 -        SPA 2 is located to the west of the city limits, north of Balfour
              Road. SPA 2 is located outside of the existing Urban Limit Line (ULL). SPA 2
              should include a significant area of protected open space, with open space
              protection prioritized for hillsides, sensitive natural habitat, and areas of
              exceptional scenic beauty. Residential uses may include Ranchette Estate and
              Very Low Density Residential. An increase in the overall residential density
              within SPA 2 may be allowed in order to accommodate the development of
              age-restricted housing units. Limited areas of local-serving General Commercial
              may also be allowed within SPA 2.
              Priority Areas
              Priority Area (PA) – A Priority Area is an overlay designation that identifies an
              area of the city that warrants particular attention with respect to the land use
              mix, jobs/housing balance, and overall design and integration of future
              development projects. In addition to the parcel-specific land use designations
              assigned to all parcels within a Priority Area, a Priority Area overlay designation

                                                                                             9. L AND U SE
        establishes a set of overarching guidance policies that shall be used by the City
        to ensure quality and integrated development that assists in meeting the
        economic development goals of this General Plan. Development within a
        Priority Area shall be consistent with the underlying land use designations. One
        Priority Area is identified in this General Plan.
        PA-1 –        PA-1 is located in the northwest corner of the city, south of Lone
        Tree Way, west of Shady Willow Lane, generally north of Sand Creek, and east
        of Heidorn Ranch Road. PA-1 is located within the Brentwood city limits.
        State Route 4 traverses PA-1 from north to south and bisects the area nearly in
        half. PA-1 is depicted as an overlay on the Land Use Map (Figure LU-1). The
        policy guidance for PA-1 includes the following framework:
             1. PA-1 shall be predominantly developed with a mixture of uses that
                 generate jobs, including but not limited to regional commercial,
                 general commercial, professional office, business park, and light
                 industrial. Approximately 80% of the net developable acreage of
                 lands within PA-1 that are designated Mixed Use Pedestrian Transit
                 should be dedicated for these types of uses.
             2. The State Route 4 interchange at Lone Tree Way should be utilized
                 to provide an optimal mix of jobs-generating uses.
             3. Lands within PA-1 adjacent and in close proximity to SR 4 and the SR
                 4 interchange shall be reserved exclusively for jobs-generating and
                 commercial uses. Residential uses may be allowed adjacent to and in
                 close proximity to SR 4 if such residential uses are directly
                 incorporated into commercial and/or business park development
                 projects as vertical mixed-use residences (i.e., residential over retail or
                 office space).
             4. Land use plans for this area should contemplate a future transit facility
                 that could accommodate a future eBART station and/or park-and-
                 ride facility, but the land use plan should be valid and beneficial to the
                 City and the area if an eBART station does not materialize.
             5. Opportunities for mixed-use buildings, including flex live/work space,
                 transit-oriented development, and emerging business flex space
                 should be provided.
             6. Exclusive residential uses within PA-1 should not exceed 20% of the
                 net developable acreage of all MUPT parcels within the PA.
             7. Commercial, office, and business park projects within PA-1 are
                 encouraged to include and incorporate vertical mixed residential uses.
                 Commercial, office, and business park projects that incorporate
                 residential uses on the second and third stories shall not be counted
                 towards the 20% maximum residential allocation on MUPT parcels
                 within PA-1.
             8. Encourage a mix of land uses, including jobs-generating uses and
                 residential uses, to be distributed throughout PA-1, and discourage
                 large concentrations of residential-only uses.

              9. The development of a large-scale (i.e., 30-60 acre) regional
                  commercial development within PA-1 is strongly encouraged, and
                  should be considered as development applications within PA-1 are
                  received and processed.
              10. Residential uses within PA-1 should be designed to complement the
                  predominant jobs-generating and commercial land uses, and should
                  occur at the medium, high, and very high density levels. Densities
                  should generally increase and transition from the medium density
                  range in the south to the higher-density ranges in the northern area
                  of PA-1.
              11. Increases in residential densities within PA-1 may be granted by the
                  City if the developer or project applicant provides the City with
                  significant infrastructure improvements or other concessions that
                  provide a community benefit (i.e., school sites, park lands in excess of
                  minimum requirements, or utility infrastructure that exceeds the
                  demand of the proposed project).
              12. Residential density bonuses may be granted if commercial and/or
                  office/business park uses are provided on-site within a residential
                  development project.
              13. Planning for this PA shall include areas of open space, green space
                  connectivity, optimization and protection of creek corridors, an
                  integrated network of trails and open space connections, and
                  appropriate trails and circulation connectivity with areas surrounding
                  the PA. Residential development that results in isolated or stand-
                  alone neighborhoods from the rest of PA-1 or surrounding
                  Brentwood neighborhoods shall be discouraged.
              14. Planning for future development within PA-1 should include a
                  collaborative effort between the City and property owners within
                  PA-1 in order to craft a future development plan that provides for a
                  balanced mix of land uses, infrastructure, and public open space
                  within PA-1.

              Actions in Support of Goal LU 2
              Action LU 2a:    Utilize density transitions in order to protect the integrity of existing land
                               use patterns and minimize the impacts on existing uses and residents. It
                               shall be City policy:
                               1. To locate lower residential densities adjacent to open space, areas of
                                    agricultural use, and existing lower density residential areas;
                               2. To locate higher residential densities in proximity to services, transit,
                                    and/or employment activity centers;
                               3. To require buffer lots in new residential developments that abut or
                                    face existing large residential lots as follows:
                                    a.   lot sizes within new development shall be compatible with lot
                                         sizes in adjacent existing development;
                                    b.   proposed lots facing or abutting existing residential lots zoned
                                         Ranchette Estate (RE) or of one acre or more shall have a
                                         minimum area of 20,000 square feet;
                                    c.   proposed lots facing or abutting existing residential lot sizes of
                                         one-half acre but less than one acre shall have a minimum area
                                         of 10,000 square feet;
                                    d.   no more than two buffer lots shall abut an existing large lot;
                                    e.   the Zoning Ordinance shall be amended to include standards for
                                         the design of new two-story dwelling units on lots that serve as
                                         buffer areas adjacent to existing large residential lots; and
                                    f.   buffering shall include open space, trails, greenbelts, pasture
                                         land, or any other compatible use.
                               4. At the discretion of the Planning Commission during the tentative
                                    subdivision map review process, the density transition policy may be
                                    modified, following the adoption of specified findings, under one or
                                    more of the following circumstances:
                                    a.   When the adjacent property has a land use and/or zoning
                                         designation that would enable the future subdivision of the
                                         adjacent property into lots of a size similar to those planned in
                                         the proposed subdivision, even though the property owner has no
                                         present intentions to subdivide their property.
                                    b.   When the adjacent property is or will be separated by at least
                                         120 feet of right-of-way or a proposed arterial street that
                                         includes a 30 foot wide parkway.
                                    c.   When the adjacent property is separated by a natural or man-
                                         made barrier (i.e., a creek, streambed, river, drainage basin,
                                         canal, or similar passageway).
                               When there is a proposal to deviate from the density transition policy, the
                               developer shall make a good faith effort to acquire a letter from all

                 in favor of or in opposition to the modification in the density transition
                 policy.
                 Any Planning Commission approved exceptions to this policy shall
                 necessitate review and approval of the entire tentative subdivision map
                 by the City Council.
Action LU 2b:    Calculate residential densities by gross acre, as outlined in Policy LU 1-2
                 of this Land Use Element.
Action LU 2c:    Through the development review and permit process, screen development
                 proposals for land use compatibility, including conformance with existing
                 development or neighborhoods.
Action LU 2d:    Utilize the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance to provide for large lot
                 single-family residential development.
Action LU 2e:    Locate medium and high density residential development near activity
                 centers, employment centers, and major transportation corridors.
Action LU 2f:    Through the development review and permit process, ensure that
                 residential developments meet the minimum density requirement
                 stipulated on the Land Use Map in order to ensure that Brentwood has
                 an ample number of housing units to meet all of its housing needs.
Action LU 2g:    Collaborate and coordinate with the local school districts to assist in the
                 identification of suitable future school sites, and provide assistance
                 through land use and zoning actions to aid the school districts in the
                 procurement and entitlement of future school sites.
Goal LU 3      Provide for a diversified mix of strong retail centers, service
               commercial activities, manufacturing enterprises, and high-
               paying employment opportunities that contribute to
               Brentwood’s economic well-being
Policy LU 3-1:   Ensure that an adequate inventory of vacant industrial, commercial,
                 office, and business park land is designated, zoned, and maintained for
                 targeted employment-generating uses.
Policy LU 3-2:   Maintain the Downtown as the community’s focal point for local-
                 serving commercial, civic, and cultural uses.
Policy LU 3-3:   Support the continued development and intensification of employment
                 centers throughout all non-residential areas of the city.
Policy LU 3-4:   Preserve lands for economic development and employment
                 opportunities by requiring residential projects, except affordable
                 housing projects, in commercial or business park areas to be
                 incorporated into a larger commercial or mixed use project and to not
                 result in adverse economic or land use compatibility impacts.

              Policy LU 3-5:   Actively promote implementation of the Downtown Specific Plan and
                               Brentwood Boulevard Specific Plan, and periodically update these long-
                               range planning documents as necessary.
              Policy LU 3-6:   Establish inviting and attractive regional commercial centers that are
                               exceptionally well designed.
              Policy LU 3-7:   Encourage the location of high quality, professional office campuses,
                               business parks, and industrial parks along with related mixed-use
                               development, where appropriate within the city.
              Policy LU 3-8:   Strongly encourage rehabilitation and redevelopment of existing
                               shopping centers at those locations where a dominant retail use is still
                               likely to be viable. Encourage conversion to non-retail uses at those
                               locations with obsolete retail space, limited opportunity for future
                               viable retail uses, or both.
              Policy LU 3-9:   Ensure that all commercial and other non-residential development is
                               compatible with adjacent land uses, particularly residential uses.
              Policy LU 3-10:  Require adequate buffers and/or architectural consideration to protect
                               residential areas, developed or undeveloped, from intrusion of non-
                               residential activities that may degrade the quality of life in such
                               residential areas.
              Actions in Support of Goal LU 3
              Action LU 3a:    Retain and emphasize an intensification of retail, office, and
                               entertainment uses in the Downtown. Encourage office, civic, and cultural
                               uses to locate Downtown and emphasize the integration of these high-
                               activity uses.
              Action LU 3b:    Concentrate major office uses along State Route 4 near the Lone Tree
                               Way, Balfour Road, and Marsh Creek Road interchanges.
              Action LU 3c:    As part of the City’s development review process, continue to ensure that
                               commercial projects are designed to minimize conflicts between
                               commercial and residential uses. Review of commercial projects should
                               ensure that the following design concepts are avoided in projects that
                               abut residential areas:
                               1. Inappropriate building scale and/or siting on the lot;
                               2. Excessive noise due to long hours of operation or inappropriate
                                     location of accessory structures;
                               3. Excessive glare or excessive impacts from light sources onto adjacent
                                     properties; and
                               4. Unnecessary loss of community and environmental resources
                                     (archaeological, historical, ecological, recreational, etc.).

                                Area in the Brentwood General Plan (Fig LU-4). Agricultural uses within
                                this area should be flexible in order to maximize the economic vitality of
                                smaller agricultural parcels that may not be suitable for large-scale
                                commercial agricultural operations. Allowed uses should be agricultural in
                                nature and may include, but are not limited to, the following:
                                1. Visitor-serving uses that support and are incidental to agricultural

                               necessary to maintain noise standards. The City's preferred method of
                               attenuating adverse noise levels is to utilize a combination of frontage
                               roads, earth berming, and larger building setbacks along thoroughfares
                               in new subdivision design. When soundwalls must be constructed,
                               they should be designed in a meandering pattern and setback a

Overview	  
The Noise Element is a mandatory component of the General Plan. The overall purpose
of the Noise Element is to address major noise sources and to promote safe and
comfortable noise levels throughout Brentwood. The Noise Element contains goals,
policies, and actions that seek to reduce community exposure to excessive noise levels
through the establishment of noise level standards for a variety of land uses.
Noise is typically defined as unwanted sound that interferes with an individual’s ability to
perform a task or enjoy an activity. From a planning perspective, noise control focuses on
two primary concerns: (1) preventing the introduction of new noise-producing uses in
noise-sensitive areas; and (2) preventing the encroachment of noise-sensitive uses into
existing noise-producing areas. Noise in Brentwood is generated by a variety of sources,
including, but not limited to: vehicle traffic, including automobiles, trucks, and motorcycles;
restaurants/bars; industrial operations; and other businesses.
Background information regarding noise sources and noise conditions in Brentwood is
presented in Chapter 7 of the General Plan Update Existing Conditions Report.
Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal N 1           Preserve a pleasant noise environment and enhance the quality
                   of existing and future land uses by minimizing exposure to
                   harmful and excessive noise
Policy N 1-1:         Ensure the noise compatibility of existing and future development
                      when making land use planning decisions.
Policy N 1-2:         Require development and infrastructure projects to be consistent with
                      the Land Use Compatibility for Community Noise Environments
                      standards indicated in Table N-1 to ensure acceptable noise levels for
                      existing and future development.
Policy N 1-3:         Require new development to mitigate excessive noise through best
                      practices, including building location and orientation, building design
                      features, placement of noise-generating equipment away from sensitive
                      receptors, shielding of noise-generating equipment, placement of noise-
                      tolerant features between noise sources and sensitive receptors, and
                      use of noise-minimizing materials such as rubberized asphalt.
Policy N 1-4:         Require mixed-use projects to minimize noise exposure for indoor
                      areas of nearby residential areas through the use of noise attenuating
                      building materials, engineering techniques, and site design practices.
                      Site design practices may include locating mechanical equipment,
                      loading bays, parking lots, driveways, and trash enclosures away from
                      residential uses, and providing noise-attenuating screening features on-
                      site.

                     Policy N 1-8:  Support noise-­‐compatible land uses along existing and future roadways,
                                    including County, State, and Federal routes.
                     Policy N 1-9:  Local truck traffic, including loading and unloading, shall be limited to
                                    specific routes, times, and speeds appropriate to each zoning district.
                     Policy N 1-10: Work with Caltrans to ensure that adequate noise studies are
                                    prepared and alternative noise mitigation measures are considered in
                                    State transportation projects.
                     Policy N 1-11: Ensure that existing development is protected, to the greatest extent
                                    feasible, from noise impacts due to construction on adjacent or nearby
                                    properties.
                     Policy N 1-12: Work cooperatively with the Contra Costa County Airport Land Use

Policy N 1-13:   Control non-transportation related noise from site specific noise
                 sources to the standards shown in Table N-2.
Policy N 1-14:   Ensure that new development does not result in indoor noise levels
                 exceeding 45 dBA Ldn for residential uses.
Policy N 1-15:   Require construction activities to comply with standard best practices
                 (see Action N 1e).
Policy N 1-16:   Temporary special events including, but not limited to, festivals,
                 concerts, carnivals, rodeos, and other similar activities may be allowed
                 to exceed the noise standards established in this General Plan and the
                 standards established by Chapter 9.32 of the Brentwood Municipal
                 Code through issuance of a temporary use permit (see section
                 9.32.080 of the Brentwood Municipal Code).
Actions in Support of Goal N 1
Action N 1a:     Update Chapter 9.32 and Title 17 of the Brentwood Municipal Code to
                 ensure that the noise standards are consistent with this element, including
                 Tables N-1 and N-2, and to require new residential, mixed-use with a
                 residential component, and other noise-sensitive development to be
                 designed to minimize noise exposure to noise sensitive uses through
                 incorporation of site planning and architectural techniques.
Action N 1b:     Review new development projects for compliance with the noise
                 requirements established in this element, including the standards
                 established in Tables N-1 and N-2. Where necessary, require mitigation
                 measures to achieve the noise standards.
Action N 1c:     Require acoustical studies for all new discretionary projects, including
                 those related to development and transportation, which have the
                 potential to generate noise impacts which exceed the standards identified
                 in this element.        The studies shall include representative noise
                 measurements, estimates of existing and projected noise levels, and
                 mitigation measures necessary to ensure compliance with this element
                 and relevant noise standards in the Brentwood Municipal Code.
Action N 1d:     Coordinate with Caltrans, the cities of Antioch and Oakley, and Contra
                 Costa County, when necessary, to ensure that these agencies obtain City
                 concurrence prior to initiating any noise mitigation or other project
                 affecting Brentwood.
Action N 1e:     During the environmental review process, determine if proposed
                 construction will constitute a significant impact on nearby residents and, if
                 necessary, require mitigation measures in addition to the standard best
                 practice controls. Suggested best practices for control of construction
                 noise include:
                 1. Construction period shall be less than 12 months;
   Brentwood General Plan                                                                               10-3
10. N OISE
           2. Noise-generating construction activities, including truck traffic coming
               to and from the construction site for any purpose, shall be limited to
               between the hours of 7:00 am and 6:00 pm on weekdays, and
               between 8:00 am and 5:00 pm on Saturdays. No construction shall
               occur on Sundays or City holidays;
           3. All equipment driven by internal combustion engines shall be
               equipped with mufflers, which are in good condition and appropriate
               for the equipment;
           4. The construction contractor shall utilize “quiet” models of air
               compressors and other stationary noise sources where technology
               exists;
           5. At all times during project grading and construction, stationary noise-
               generating equipment shall be located as far as practicable from
               sensitive receptors and placed so that emitted noise is directed away
               from residences;
           6. Unnecessary idling of internal combustion engines shall be prohibited;
           7. Construction staging areas shall be established at locations that will
               create the greatest distance between the construction-related noise
               sources and noise-sensitive receptors nearest the project site during
               all project construction activities, to the extent feasible;
           8. The required construction-related noise mitigation plan shall also
               specify that haul truck deliveries are subject to the same hours
               specified for construction equipment;
           9. Neighbors located adjacent to the construction site shall be notified
               of the construction schedule in writing; and
           10. The construction contractor shall designate a “noise disturbance
               coordinator” who will be responsible for responding to any local
               complaints about construction noise. The disturbance coordinator
               shall be responsible for determining the cause of the noise complaint
               (e.g., starting too early, poor muffler, etc.) and instituting reasonable
               measures as warranted to correct the problem. A telephone number
               for the disturbance coordinator shall be conspicuously posted at the
               construction site.

Goal N 2       Protect the city’s economic base by preventing incompatible
               land uses from encroaching upon existing or planned noise-
               producing agriculture, industries, farmland, airports, and other
               sources
Policy N 2-1:     Recognizing that existing and future traffic noise along the State Route
                  4 corridor, major arterials within Brentwood, and noise from the UPRR
                  are areas of potential land use conflict for existing and future
                  development, reasonable use of this land will be allowed with an
                  exterior noise exposure level not exceeding 65 dB Ldn. New
                  development that includes noise-sensitive uses (i.e., residential) along
                  the State Route 4 corridor, major arterials, and the UPRR should
                  incorporate appropriate noise attenuation measures in order to
                  maintain interior noise levels of 45 dB Ldn or less. Application of this
                  noise standard is intended to provide for reasonable exterior noise
                  levels while discouraging the use of excessively high and/or unattractive
                  sound walls.
Policy N 2-2:     Recognizing that agricultural activities are important to Brentwood’s
                  economic base and that agricultural operations are characterized by
                  increased noise levels from the use of tractors, heavy equipment, crop
                  dusting, agricultural products processing, and other supporting
                  equipment and activities, new noise sensitive land uses that interface
                  with agricultural lands must acknowledge and accept these increased
                  noise levels as part of Brentwood’s rural heritage and lifestyle.
Actions in Support of Goal N 2
Action N 2a:      As a condition of project approval, require new development that
                  introduces sensitive noise receptors near agricultural lands or operations
                  to acknowledge and comply with Chapter 8.01 (Right to Farm) of the
                  Brentwood Municipal Code.

                                    New construction or development should generally not be undertaken because mitigation
                                    is usually not feasible to comply with noise element policies

Notes:
a)         The residential standards apply to all properties that are zoned for residential use.
The exterior noise level standard is to be applied at the property line of the receiving land use
or at a designated outdoor activity area (at the discretion of the Community Development
Director) of the new development. For mixed-use projects, the exterior noise level standard
may be waived (at the discretion of the Community Development Director) if the project does
not include a designated activity area and mitigation of property line noise is not practical.
These noise level standards do not apply to residential units established in conjunction with
industrial or commercial uses (e.g., caretaker dwellings). The City can impose standards that
are more restrictive than specified above based upon determination of existing low ambient
noise levels.
b)         Each of the noise levels specified above shall be lowered by 5 dBA for tonal noises
characterized by a whine, screech, or hum, noises consisting primarily of speech or music, or
recurring impulsive noises. In no case shall mitigation be required to a level that is less than
existing ambient noise levels, as determined through measurements conducted during the
same operational period as the subject noise source.
c)         In situations where the existing noise level exceeds the noise levels indicated in the
above table, any new noise source must include mitigation that reduces the noise level of the
noise source to the existing level plus 3 dB.
d)         Exterior noise exposure level not exceeding 65 dB Ldn is allowed along the State
Route 4 corridor, the Union Pacific Railroad corridor, and arterial roadways.

                                                    11. SAFETY
Overview
The Safety Element provides the framework to reduce risks associated with a range of
environmental and human-caused hazards that may pose a risk to life and property in
Brentwood. Inclusion of the Safety Element in the General Plan is required by State law.
While the city’s land, hillsides, and waterways are assets to the community, these features
can present risks due to flood, geologic, and seismic hazards. In addition, human-caused
risks, such as hazardous materials, can pose risks to community health and safety. Effective
planning to prepare for and mitigate the adverse effects of these risks can help ensure that
Brentwood maintains a high level of safety for its residents. The Safety Element includes
goals, policies, and actions to protect residents, businesses, visitors, and land uses from
hazards, and includes the following topics:
     •    Seismic and Geologic Hazards
     •    Flooding Hazards and Flood Protection
     •    Emergency Response and Disaster Preparedness
     •    Hazardous Materials
Background information regarding safety and hazards in Brentwood is presented in
Chapters 4 and 5.5 of the General Plan Update Existing Conditions Report.

Actions in Support of Goal SA 2
Action SA 2a:    Develop a Flooding and Drainage Master Plan that addresses the
                 following, at a minimum:
                 1. Storm water and drainage improvements for all areas of the city that
                      are needed to accommodate existing and planned growth;
                 2. Standards for on and off-site storm water and flooding improvements
                      to ensure no adverse impacts to adjacent or nearby properties;
                 3. Standard measures to be used by new development to address
                      localized flooding impacts;
                 4. Identification of areas for stream channel or flood control conveyance
                      system enlargement and/or stabilization;
                 5. Operation, maintenance, and funding of flood control and drainage
                      facilities; and
                 6. Opportunities for multipurpose flood control projects that incorporate
                      recreation, resource conservation, preservation of natural riparian
                      habitat, and scenic values of the city’s streams, creeks, and

                                        12. I MPLEMENTATION
For the General Plan to serve as an effective guide to achieving the City’s vision for its
future, it must be implemented and administered. The General Plan includes a number of
actions that provide direction for how the City will implement the goals and policies within
the body of the General Plan. In general, actions are spread throughout each of the
elements, appearing immediately after the corresponding goals and policies.
Government Code Section 65400(a)(1) requires the City’s planning agency (i.e., the
Community Development Department) to make recommendations to the City Council
that identify reasonable and practical means for implementation of the General Plan. The
Community Development Department is also required to provide an annual report to the
City Council, the State Office of Planning and Research (State Clearinghouse), and the
State Department of Housing and Community Development that includes the status of
the General Plan, the City’s progress in the implementation of the General Plan, and the
City’s progress in meeting its allocation of regional housing needs and removing
governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.
Table 12-1 (General Plan Implementation) is intended to serve as a tool for tracking
implementation of the General Plan and preparing the annual report.
Table 12-1 identifies the general timing for the implementation of each action, the City
department responsible for the action’s implementation, and the status of the action.
For each of the actions listed below, the letters “A,” “B,” or “C,” refer to a relative priority
for implementation. More specifically, the letter A implies that the action will be
implemented in the relatively short-term (most likely, 1 to 5 years). The letter B similarly
implies a somewhat longer-term implementation, approximately 5 to 10 years. An action
accompanied by the letter C indicates a longer-term implementation schedule, keeping in
mind that the planning horizon for this document is the year 2035. In other cases, the
reader may notice the use of the term "ongoing," which refers to actions already being
undertaken by the City or those that are expected to continue on either a periodic or
perpetual basis. The party or parties that are primarily responsible for implementing each
action, whether a specific City department or, in some cases, an outside agency, are also
indicated where applicable.
The implementation schedule includes some caveats. One is that many of these actions
will require both staff and financial resources to implement, thus making them difficult to
definitively schedule, given the annual nature of the budgetary process and changing
priorities over the years. Another is that it is often difficult to clearly state the duration of
tasks; therefore, estimated starting dates (priority levels) are presented for actions rather
than completion dates. Finally, in some instances, the selection of priority level (A, B, or C)
reflects the level of complexity and the level of effort required to implement an action
rather than the importance of the action itself.
