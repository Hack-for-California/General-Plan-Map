Loomis General Plan                                                                           Introduction
I. Introduction – Loomis and its Future
The Town of Loomis adopted its first General Plan in 1987. This General Plan is an update in response
to changes in the community and the region since the Town was incorporated in1984, and in the 14
years since the adoption of the first General Plan. Although a variety of amendments to the General
Plan have been adopted since 1987, this is the first comprehensive update.
The Town of Loomis
Loomis is a small, semi-rural community located in western Placer County in California’s agricultural
Central Valley. Incorporated in 1984, the Town is located within a fast-growing metropolitan region
approximately 25 miles northeast of the City of Sacramento, along Interstate 80. Loomis is in the
western portion of the Loomis Basin, an 80-square mile area of the Placer County foothills. Loomis
maintains a distinct small-town, semi-rural character through large residential lots with continuing
agricultural activities, rural roads and equestrian trails, a compact downtown “village” area, the
preservation of historic structures, and extensive open space areas.
Loomis is divided into two distinct areas by Interstate 80, traversing northeast through the center of
Town. The area north of I-80 contains all of the community’s existing retail, office and industrial
development, as well as higher density residential development, bounded by larger, semi-rural
residential lots. The area south of I-80 is almost exclusively rural and residential in character. The
Town’s corporate boundaries, the study/planning area for this General Plan, and the land use
designations of this General Plan are shown on Figure 3-1, the Land Use Diagram, page 27.
The revitalization and beautification of the downtown commercial area is underway. A Town Center
Master Plan was adopted in December 1992 as an element of the General Plan (see page 42). The plan
calls for a compact, pedestrian-oriented, commercial village, which includes the rehabilitation and reuse
of local historic structures. Additional retail and office development is located predominantly along
Taylor Road, the community’s major commercial corridor. The Taylor Road corridor is also the
location of some older industrial and automotive service uses that would be more appropriately located
elsewhere in the community.
The Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way parallels Taylor Road from Sierra College Boulevard to King
Road, and then follows Rippy Road to the northerly Town boundary. Industrial land uses are located in
the triangular area between Taylor Road and Swetzer Road in the northeast section of Town, some
directly adjacent to residential uses. A recently-developed shopping center anchored by the Raley’s
grocery store is located at the northeast corner of the Horseshoe Bar Road/I-80 interchange.
Most of the Town’s land area is occupied by large-lot residential/agricultural and single-family
residential development. Many local landowners maintain small-scale, “hobby” agricultural activities
on small ranches, including the raising of farm animals. Higher density residential development is
concentrated near the Taylor Road commercial corridor.
A number of creeks run through the Town, providing visual quality, wildlife habitat, drainage, and
recreational opportunities for the community. Multi-use (equestrian, bicycle and hiking) trails generally
follow the riparian corridors as they meander through rural residential neighborhoods.

Loomis General Plan                                                                               Introduction
An Appreciation of the Past
The first inhabitants of the Loomis Basin area were indigenous tribes living in small villages along the
creeks and streams. The Maidu Tribe of the Penutian Empire, the predominant tribe in the Basin,
subsisted primarily on acorns from the native oaks of the region. By 1825, trappers and hunters had
discovered the Basin while traveling down the river they called the “Rio de los Americanos,” now
known as the American River. Through the early part of the 1800s, the Basin was inhabited by only a
few lone pioneers.
After the discovery of gold in the Sierra Nevada foothills in 1849, prospectors swarmed into the area
and small mining camps sprang up. Between the gold rush and the organization of the County of Placer
in 1851, the Basin experienced an influx of miners, farmers and businessmen. By 1850, a busy mining
camp was established near the intersection of Horseshoe Bar Road and Secret Ravine. The community
called itself “Pine Grove,” and by 1860 had enough settlers to apply for a post office. After being told
that there was already an established town in Amador County named Pine Grove, the community named
its post office “Placer” in 1861. The first of many granite quarries began operation in the nearby areas of
Rocklin and Penryn in the same year.
The Central Pacific Railroad began constructing a railroad through the region about this time, and in
1864 it was extended through Placer County near Horseshoe Bar Road. The mining camp decided to
move its few buildings to Loomis’ present downtown site near the railroad tracks, and rename itself
“Pino.” However, because of its similarity to Reno, Nevada, mail, express and freight were often
misdirected or misrouted; and in 1890, the community decided to change its name to “Loomis.” The
name derived from Jim Loomis, one of the original pioneers. Jim served in all local public offices over
time, including railroad agent, express agent, postmaster, and saloon-keeper. He was not very
progressive and, it is said, kept the letters and mail matter in a cigar box on the end of the saloon bar for
residents to sort through themselves. As the story goes, when a United States inspector objected to this
method of handling a post office for the government, Jim picked up the cigar box, mail included, and
tossed it into the street!
Toward the end of the century, life in the small community began to change. A town lot sale was held;
roads were extended toward the American River and the ridge on the west, and the community began to
develop into a town. Stone quarries were opened near the railroad station, and local farmers began
planning fruit orchards. The completion of the Central Pacific Railroad over the Sierra Nevada in 1872
established an overland route for markets in the eastern states to receive fruit cultivated by Basin
farmers. By 1880, considerable acreage had been planted in fruit orchards and many of the early mining
ditches were used for irrigation water. The Loomis Fruit Growers Association was established in 1901
to provide fruit packing and transport services for local fruit ranchers. A group of progressive farmers
started the Bank of Loomis in 1915, and by the 1920s Loomis had become the second-largest fruit-
shipping station in the County, after Newcastle.
A large fire destroyed most of the downtown business core in 1915. By the early 1920s, almost every
destroyed building in Loomis had been rebuilt with brick, concrete or tile, including the Town’s bank,
veterinary stables, fruit-shipping warehouse, butcher shop and community churches. Outside of the
downtown core, large orchards of budded and grafted fruit stock still spanned the countryside.

Loomis General Plan                                                                         Introduction
Opportunities & Constraints
The General Plan update process has identified a number of opportunities and constraints that Loomis
must address in planning for future growth. Land use and circulation patterns are shown in Figure 3-1,
the Land Use Diagram (page 27). The qualities of the Town that are particularly valued by its residents
are listed below, as are various constraints that may affect the Town’s character and growth. The
following were derived from input provided by Town residents attending the General Plan Community
Workshop in June 1998, and from responses to the community preferences survey that was also
conducted in 1998.
                               Opportunities for the Town of Loomis
           ·  Small town atmosphere – quiet, peaceful, safe.
           ·  The desire of residents to maintain the Town’s unique character as a semi-
              rural community in a fast-growing metropolitan region.
           ·  Historic structures, hitching posts and nostalgia.
           ·  Community events and cultural activities, including live theater.
           ·  Friendly, family-oriented community – familiarity with neighbors.
           ·  Proximity to Sierra College.
           ·  Quaint, village-like, pedestrian-oriented downtown core.
           ·  Ample inventory of vacant and underutilized sites for new land uses.
           ·  Rural, agricultural community allowing farming, orchards, horses and
              livestock.
           ·  Large rural residential parcels, and few generic residential subdivisions.
           ·  Narrow, meandering country roads.
           ·  Good schools.
           ·  Accessability to freeway (I-80) and larger metropolitan areas.
           ·  Natural open spaces, trees, creeks and riparian corridors, providing habitat for
              wildlife.
                         Constraints and Issues facing the Town of Loomis
           ·  Development pressure for land use intensification and build-out.
           ·  Encroachment by adjacent urban communities.
           ·  Development pressure for generic suburban architecture.
           ·  Retail sales leakage from Town residents.
           ·  Urban design and land use issues in Town gateway areas.
           ·  Some downtown facades lack character and architectural interest.
           ·  Lack of unified design theme in downtown core.
           ·  Unfinished sidewalks and traffic congestion in downtown; incomplete work
              on providing ramps for the disabled.
           ·  Inadequate parking for downtown core businesses to serve residents and any
              expanded visitor-serving use
           ·  Traffic delays, emergency response delays, and noise created by the railroad.
           ·  Lack of street trees and landscaping in some commercial areas.
           ·  Some unattractive commercial signage, along I-80 and elsewhere.
           ·  Incomplete bicycle, equestrian and pedestrian lane/trail system.
           ·  Increasing commuter through-traffic on Sierra College Boulevard from

               may disrupt the tranquility and rural character of the Town, and otherwise
               affect the health, safety, and welfare of residents.
           ·   Lack of connector roadways within Town.
           ·   Uncertainty in revenue sources for Town services.
           ·   Poor condition of streets, poor roadway maintenance.
           ·   High traffic speeds, especially on rural residential roads.
           ·   Inadequate park and recreation facilities and programs, as well as community
               center.
           ·   Storm flooding and drainage problems, reduced opportunities for
               groundwater recharge.
           ·   Overcrowding at local schools, and inadequate school facilities.
           ·   Lack of an adequate recycling program.
Population Change
Because population growth affects all types of community change, estimates of future population growth
must be used as the basis for land use planning. The Sacramento Council of Governments developed
population, housing and employment projections for all jurisdictions within the six counties surrounding
Sacramento, including the cities in Placer County. The projections for Loomis are shown in Table 1.
While the projections estimate that Loomis will grow by approximately three percent annually through
the year 2020, employment is expected to grow by over eight percent annually. As with any population
projections, there is also the possibility that continuing rapid economic growth in the region could cause
even higher annual growth rates in Loomis.

Loomis General Plan                                                                             Introduction
The Future of Loomis
The community’s vision for the future of Loomis is based primarily on: 1) retaining the small town
aspects of its character through the revitalization of the downtown village and the expansion of family-
oriented community facilities; and 2) maintaining the rural aspects of its character by continuing the
pattern of progressively lower residential densities as distance increases from the downtown, thereby
preserving low-intensity agricultural uses and natural open spaces. Town residents value the
community’s distinct identity, featuring good public services and facilities, cultural activities, and
agricultural heritage. The community workshop held on June 6, 1998, identified the following
components as the participants’ vision for the community’s future.
·      The design and development of both residential and commercial parcels to reinforce the small
       town character, rather than tending toward the more generic urbanization found in adjacent
       communities.
·      The preservation of the remaining open space and rural character surrounding the community,
       ensuring distinction between adjacent urban communities and rural Loomis.
·      The preservation of agricultural activities, including the farming of orchards and raising of
       livestock.
·      The maintenance of primarily large lot, rural residential areas, but also providing some smaller
       parcels for young families and seniors.
·      The avoidance of gated residential communities.
·      The revitalization of the downtown core with a consistent design theme, pedestrian amenities
       (e.g. benches, crosswalks, shade trees), façade improvements, and reuse of historical structures.
·      The development of a pedestrian-oriented downtown, with small retail boutiques, restaurants and
       sidewalk cafés, and a Town center complex for government offices and community events.
·      The development of a “transportation center” at a renovated train station and plaza at Horseshoe
       Bar and Taylor Road in the downtown.
·      Acceleration of the rehabilitation and reuse of historical fruit sheds and older residences for retail
       and office space in the downtown core.
·      The expansion of parking facilities and improvement of circulation patterns in the downtown
       core.
·      The expansion of economic development and tourist activities in the downtown to increase Town
       revenues.
·      The expansion of local theater and arts activities.
·      The design of new commercial uses in “village” scale, focusing on the construction of historical
       façades, minimization of signage, and planting of street trees and landscaping.

·      The improvement of areas considered “gateways” to the community, particularly the design and
       facades of areas adjacent to the Raley’s shopping center.
·      The creation of sustainable Town policies, focusing equally on the consideration of
       environmental, social and economic impacts of development.
·      The preservation of meandering rural roads, and the reduction of traffic speeds in rural
       residential areas.
·      The development of an alternate through-road for commuter traffic from Rocklin to reduce
       through-traffic volumes on Town roadways.
·      The improvement of local street connections, better road maintenance and repair, and improved
       railroad grade crossings.
·      Increased street trees and landscaping throughout the community.
·      Cooperation with Placer County Transit to improve local and regional public transit services.
·      The use of landscaping and berms along I-80 to muffle noise, rather than sound walls.
·      The expansion of multi-use bicycle, equestrian and hiking trails throughout the community and
       surrounding open lands, and support of a trail from Loomis to Folsom Lake.
·      The expansion of on-street bicycle lanes and pedestrian sidewalks in non-residential areas.
·      The preservation of creek corridors, open space areas, natural features, and wildlife habitat,
       which in turn contributes to the retention of the rural community.
·      The expansion of parks and recreation facilities, including a downtown core park and bigger
       swimming pool.
·      The expansion of family-oriented community and recreation programs, housed within a multi-use
       community center.
·      The improvement of the local political process through better noticing of meetings and activities,
       and stronger implementation measures in the General Plan.
·      The expansion and modernization of local school facilities.
·      The creation of a Town of Loomis Police Department, rather than contracting with the County
       Sheriff’s Department.
·      The improvement of groundwater quality through the control of septic system leakage and well
       pollution.

Loomis General Plan                                                            The Role of the General Plan
II. The Role of the General Plan
This chapter reviews the legal requirements for the General Plan, its organization, and the relationship
of the local planning process in Loomis to the growth of the Sacramento region.
Legal Requirements for General Plans
Local planning is based on the concept of “police power,” granted to cities and counties by the
California Constitution. Police power is the authority to regulate the use of private property to promote
the health, safety and welfare of the general public. The activities of land use planning, zoning,
subdivision regulation, and the regulation of building and construction activities are all ways in which
communities exercise their police power.
California planning laws shape the exercise of local powers by requiring each city and county to prepare
and adopt a “comprehensive, long-term General Plan for the physical development of the county or
city.” (Government Code 65300). In some ways, the community’s General Plan functions as its
“constitution” for development, providing guidance for local decisions about community growth. A
General Plan should express the community’s goals for the future distribution and character of land uses
and development, both public and private.
California law (Government Code Section 65302) requires that the General Plan include a statement of
policies for each of the following topics or “elements:”
·       Land use, designating the general distribution and intensity of land uses, including housing,
        business, industry, open space, education, public buildings, and others.
·       Circulation, identifying the general location and nature of existing and proposed highways,
        arterial and collector roadways, transit terminals, and other transportation facilities.
·       Housing, assessing the current and projected housing needs of all segments of the community
        and identifying land to provide adequate housing to meet such needs.
·       Open Space, detailing techniques for preserving open space areas for natural resources, outdoor
        recreation, public health and safety, and agricultural activities.
·       Conservation, addressing the conservation and use of natural and cultural resources, including
        wetlands, forests, rivers, archeological remnants, and historic structures.
·       Noise, identifying and appraising the noise sources within the community and developing ways
        to mitigate such nuisances.
·       Safety, establishing policies to protect the community from risks associated with seismic,
        geologic, flood, and fire hazards.
A General Plan may include additional, optional topics as necessary to address all local issues relevant
to the physical development of the community. The individual elements may be consolidated and
reformatted as desired as long as all seven topical areas are addressed in the General Plan.

Loomis General Plan                                                             The Role of the General Plan
The plan should be comprehensive, both covering the local jurisdiction’s entire planning area and
addressing the broad range of issues facing the community, including physical, social, aesthetic and
economic concerns. The General Plan must also be internally consistent, with no policy conflicts
between any of the elements. Finally, the General Plan must be a long-term document, establishing
development policies to serve as the basis for day-to-day decision making within an approximate 20-
year time frame.
Use of the General Plan
The General Plan is intended to provide guidance in a wide variety of important decisions by the
Town’s elected and appointed officials, and its staff. California law requires that all provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance be consistent with the General Plan, and that no subdivision be approved unless it is
consistent with the General Plan. State law also requires that all municipal decisions on capital
improvements planning and budgeting be preceded by a review of their conformity with the General
Plan.
The goals, policies, and objectives of the General Plan will be used as criteria for evaluating the
appropriateness of proposed Zoning Ordinance amendments and rezonings, subdivisions, capital
improvement programs, and other Town decisions. The General Plan will also provide the basis for
other “implementing” actions by the Town, which will include the adoption of amendments to the
Town’s Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map to bring them into consistency with the General Plan, and
other specific actions that are described in the General Plan as “implementation measures.” Most of the
following chapters of the General Plan provide goals, policies, and implementation measures. The
Housing Element also provides “objectives.” The following explanation of goals, objectives, and
policies is based on information provided by the General Plan Guidelines published by the California
Governor’s Office of Planning and Research (OPR).
Goals are general statements of what the Town wants to accomplish, toward which the General Plan,
and its policies and implementation measures are directed. Goals are general expressions of community
values and, therefore, may be abstract in nature. Therefore, goals may not be quantifiable or time-
dependent.
Objectives take the general direction expressed in a related goal and specify how the goal will be
accomplished, both quantifiably, and within a specific time period. Objectives are found in this General
Plan only in the Housing Element, because they are particularly effective in describing exactly how the
community will respond to the housing mandates of State law, and the issues raised by the California
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), in that agency’s review of local Housing
Elements.
Policies are specific statements that guide decision making, which indicate the Town’s commitment to a
particular course of action. Some policies are written as “shalls”-- mandatory requirements that must be
complied with--and others are written as “shoulds,” which express the community’s preferences, and
signify “. . . a less rigid directive, to be honored in the absence of compelling or contravening
considerations.” (General Plan Guidelines, p.15)
Some of the policies of this General Plan also include standards. A standard is “A rule or measure
establishing a level of quality or quantity that must be complied with or satisfied. Standards define the
abstract terms of goals and policies with concrete specifications.” (General Plan Guidelines, p.16)

Loomis General Plan                                                            The Role of the General Plan
The goals, objectives, policies, standards, and implementation measures of the Town of Loomis General
Plan are collectively intended to assist the citizens of Loomis and their elected representatives in
evolving the form and character of the community over time, to more closely match the vision for the
community’s future expressed in Chapter I of this plan.
Organization & Content of the Loomis General Plan
The Loomis General Plan is in two parts: a Technical Background Report, and this policy document.
The background report presents detailed information on the environmental, social, and economic
characteristics of Loomis that are relevant to the Town’s future, and which provided the basis for
formulating General Plan policies. This policy document contains the “working” portions of the
General Plan, to guide Town decision-makers and staff when making decisions regarding proposals for
the development and use of public and private property, and the expenditure of Town funds on public
facilities, services, infrastructure and other improvements. This policy document is deliberately brief,
and should be used in conjunction with the background report when more detailed information about the
Town is needed.
This policy document is organized into the following sections:
·       Introduction – Loomis and its Future – includes a description of the Town of Loomis, a brief
        history of its settlement and development, the opportunities and constraints facing future
        development in the Town, and the community’s vision for it’s future.
·       The Role of the General Plan – a description of the legal requirements for a General Plan, the
        plan’s context within regional planning efforts, and the organization and content of the Town of
        Loomis General Plan.
The following five elements contain issues, goals and policies for all seven required topics and six
optional topics.
·       Community Development Element – includes Land Use (and the Land Use Diagram), the
        Downtown Plan, Community Design and Character, Parks and Recreation, and Economic
        Development.
·       Circulation Element – includes goals and policies related to the community’s circulation
        system, and the various transportation modes available to, or needed within the community.
·       Housing Element - this is the only element of the General Plan that must be reviewed by the
        State (the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)), and is subject to a
        specific update schedule established by State law. Therefore, the Housing Element has been
        reformatted to match the style of the other General Plan elements, but is not being updated at this
        time. Its update will follow the schedule required by the State.
·       Public Facilities and Services Element – includes public facility, services, and municipal fiscal
        policies.

Preparation of the Loomis General Plan
The fact that the Town of Loomis General Plan reflects the preferences of the community for its future
is a product of the extensive participation of Loomis citizens in its preparation. The public participation
program for the General Plan update has included several key components:
1.     An initial “visioning” workshop where approximately 100 Loomis residents met at Del Oro
       School on a Saturday morning to consider the future of the community, and participate in a series
       of group exercises to generate ideas, issues and concerns to be considered in the update process;
2.     A community preferences survey that was completed by 805 Loomis residents and business
       owners;
3.     Extensive work by a Council-appointed General Plan Steering Committee comprised of 10
       volunteer residents. The Committee met 36 times over 18 months with Town staff and the
       Town’s consultants to review the former General Plan, update its policies where appropriate, and
       formulate additional proposed policies and the draft Land Use Diagram;
4.     Public workshops for review of the draft plan prior to public hearings; and
5.     Eleven public hearings on the draft General Plan before the Town Planning Commission and over
       13 hearings before the Town Council.
Amendments to the General Plan
The California Government Code allows municipalities to amend their General Plans up to four times
per year, with no limitation on the number of individual changes that may occur within each of the four
times. However, given the substantial effort, thought, and care taken by the community in the
preparation of this comprehensive General Plan update, the Town intends to diligently carry out the plan
as adopted, and not frequently consider changes to its policies and property designations. Instead, the
Town intends that the General Plan undergo a thorough periodic review, including consideration of
changes to individual property designations, at least once every five years. The following policies apply
to the Town’s consideration of amendments proposed by private parties.
Policies on General Plan Amendments
1.     It is the policy of the Town to not consider subsequent individual property amendment requests
       outside of the periodic review of the entire plan, unless the proposed amendments clearly offer
       community-wide public benefits.
2.     Individual property General Plan amendments that are requested at times other than during a
       periodic review by the Town will be considered at a Council meeting prior to formal Town review
       (i.e., environmental determination, complete staff review with the preparation of a staff report and
       recommendation, and public hearings before the Commission and Council). The purpose of this
                                                    18

       initial review will be for the Council to determine whether the proposed amendment complies
       with Policy 1 above, and whether the Council wishes to initiate the processing of the amendment.
3.     If an individual property amendment request is approved by the Council for processing, the public
       notice for hearings before the Planning Commission and Town Council to consider the
       amendments will be mailed to all Town property owners, at the expense of the applicant.
Long-Term Growth
The provisions of this General Plan addressing growth and change are focused on the area within the
current corporate boundary of the Town, and do not provide for any expansion beyond that boundary.
This approach was followed for two reasons: the population and business growth projected for Loomis
over the term of this plan can be accommodated through the additional subdivision, residential and non-
residential development anticipated by this plan within the present incorporated area; and the Town’s
current Sphere of Influence established by the Placer County Local Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCO) is coterminous with the current Town boundary.
The Town’s Sphere of Influence is a key component of future growth decisions. California law
provides that a city may not annex property unless it is included within the municipality’s Sphere of
Influence. It is the responsibility of the Local Agency Formation Commission to establish a sphere for
each incorporated community and special district within its county, based on input from each. The
Sphere of Influence is intended to identify areas where a city definitively plans to annex property for
growth within a 10- to 20-year time frame, and where the city has (or will have) the capacity to provide
all necessary public services, infrastructure, and other public facilities as growth extends into the area of
the sphere.
Given the need to complete this General Plan update within a reasonable time, and the additional time
and effort that would be required for the analysis necessary to justify a change in the Town’s sphere to
the Local Agency Formation Commission, the Town has decided to explore the desirability of a Sphere
of Influence expansion through a separate study after the completion of this General Plan update.
Implementation Measures
1.     Within two years, or as soon as possible after the adoption of this General Plan, the Town will
       prepare a Sphere of Influence Study in compliance with LAFCO requirements, to evaluate areas
       surrounding the community that may be appropriate for annexation, and will amend the General
       Plan to provide land use designations, and policies for public facilities, services, and infrastructure
       as necessary to reflect the Town’s new Sphere of Influence and desired growth pattern.

Regional Coordination
As a community grows within its larger region, local changes have a greater potential over time to affect
other communities and the region as a whole. Therefore, each jurisdiction carries a responsibility to
coordinate its General Plan with regional planning efforts. The General Plan must be coordinated with
other local government agencies to ensure consistent planning decisions, as well as the attainment of
regional circulation, environmental and housing goals. The General Plan must also coordinate with
special districts providing public services to community residents to ensure the effective and efficient
provision of such services based on similar development and population projections. The regional
agencies whose planning policies may affect the Town of Loomis are shown in Table 2, and in Figure 2-
1.
Among the many separate tasks required to complete this General Plan were the review of the General
Plans of neighboring jurisdictions, particularly including the City of Rocklin, and Placer County. The
Town of Loomis is committed to coordinating and working with the other jurisdictions in the region to
address the many planning issues that cross political boundaries to affect cities, citizens, infrastructure,
and environmental resources.

III. Land Use and Community Development
Land Use
The Town of Loomis is characterized by a village-style core containing a historical, small-scale
downtown, surrounded by medium-density housing and some light industry, with much lower density
rural residential areas beyond. The land use goals and policies of the General Plan are all oriented
toward maintaining this historical arrangement of land uses, because the Town recognizes the
importance of the land use pattern in determining community character. Higher-intensity uses are
intended to be concentrated adjacent to the downtown, along Taylor Road, and adjacent to Interstate 80
(I-80), with the land uses in surrounding areas becoming progressively less intense (and with lower
residential densities) as the distance from the “core” increases. This arrangement of land uses within the
Town is known in Loomis as the “core concept.”
This section on land use describes how the General Plan divides Loomis into areas designated for
different types of land use, reviews the areas where the land use designations have been changed from
the 1987 General Plan, and lists the Town’s goals and policies for each type of land use.
A.       Land Use Designations
Given that the Land Use Element is intended to designate the general distribution and intensity of land
uses, including housing, business, industry, open space, education, public buildings, and others, the
Land Use Diagram (Figure 3-1) divides Loomis into a series of residential and non-residential land use
designations. These different land use designations identify the locations in the Town where specific
types of land uses may occur. While the land use designations are implemented (carried out on a day-to-
day basis) by the specific rules provided for each zoning district in the Zoning Ordinance, the General
Plan provides the overall parameters of density and intensity, and a description of the general types of
land uses appropriate in each designation. The land use designations used in this General Plan are
derived from those in the Town’s 1987 General Plan, as amended, and the 1992 Town Center Master
Plan, with some changes.
The following descriptions of land use designations use the terms “density” and “intensity.” Density
refers to the number of residential units normally allowed per gross acre of land (prior to dedications for
streets and other improvements). The density range listed for each land use designation is its “base
density.” On any particular property, the maximum base density may be exceeded if a proposed
development receives the density bonus required by State law for affordable housing projects, or if the
property qualifies for, and is developed with a second unit (see the General Plan policies for second
residential units on page 36).
The “intensity” of a land use is expressed in two ways – the type of land use itself, and building mass–
both of which are described broadly in the description of each land use designation. Both are also
regulated specifically by the Town’s Zoning Ordinance. The types of land uses allowed in each
designation are described in general terms, because the Zoning Ordinance is intended to provide detailed
lists of the specific allowable land uses within the general categories provided here. In all cases where
this discussion speaks of the primary land uses that are appropriate in each designation, it is expected
that the Zoning Ordinance may also allow additional land uses that are related to the primary uses and
compatible with them.

Loomis General Plan                                                     Community Development - Land Use
Residential Designations
       Residential Agricultural. Almost 2,500 acres of the nearly 4,300 acres in Loomis are
       designated Residential Agricultural, in two primary areas: the western-most portions of the
       Town, north of I-80, and approximately 80 percent of the land area in the Town south of I-80.
       This land use designation is key in maintaining the rural character of Loomis, and is appropriate
       for agricultural uses such as orchards, nurseries and vineyards, cattle grazing, and very low
       density residential uses. Proposed development and agricultural uses should maintain existing
       natural vegetation and topography to the maximum extent feasible.
       The maximum density in this designation is 4.6 acres per dwelling unit, and 4.6 acres is also the
       minimum parcel size for proposed subdivisions. Building heights are limited to two stories or 35
       feet, and structural development shall not exceed 20 percent of lot coverage. (The Zoning
       Ordinance may provide for greater coverage on existing legal nonconforming parcels that are
       significantly smaller than the 4.6-acre minimum.)
       Residential Estate. Approximately 475 acres are designated in the Residential Estate land use
       designation, located in four separate areas: at the northeastern edge of Town; along both sides of
       Bankhead Road from just north of I-80 to north of Saunders Avenue; south of Brace Road and
       southeasterly of I-80; and immediately northeast of the intersection of Barton and Rocklin Roads.
        Like the Rural Agricultural land use designation, appropriate land uses include agricultural uses
       such as orchards and vineyards, cattle grazing, and very low density residential uses. Proposed
       development and agricultural uses should maintain existing natural vegetation and topography to
       the maximum extent feasible.
       The maximum density in this designation is 2.3 acres per dwelling unit, and 2.3 acres is also the
       minimum parcel size for proposed subdivisions. Building heights are limited to two stories or 35
       feet, and structural development shall not exceed 20 percent of lot coverage. (The Zoning
       Ordinance may provide for greater coverage on existing legal nonconforming parcels that are
       significantly smaller than the 2.3-acre minimum.)
       Rural Residential. The Rural Residential designation comprises approximately 278 acres, and
       is located in five areas: along King Road around its intersection with Bankhead; in a larger area
       along Saunders Road northwesterly of the railroad right-of-way; in a small area on the south side
       of Brace Road a short distance east of I-80; the St. Francis Woods subdivision south of Rocklin
       Road at the western Town Boundary; and at the north central area of the Town along Humphrey
       Road. Agricultural uses are also appropriate on these parcels, although the keeping of large
       animals should occur only on parcels of one acre or larger. As in the other lowest-density
       residential designations, proposed development and agricultural uses should maintain existing
       natural vegetation and topography to the maximum extent feasible.
       Residential uses are limited to a maximum density of one dwelling unit per acre, and one acre is
       also the minimum parcel size for proposed subdivisions. Building heights are limited to two
       stories or 35 feet, and structural development shall not exceed 20 percent of lot coverage.
                                                   24
                                                                                               July 2001
Loomis General Plan                                                     Community Development - Land Use
       Residential - Low Density. This land use designation is applied to 12 acres in two areas: an
       existing, built-out single-family neighborhood along Mareta Lane, and to several larger parcels
       on the north side of King Road between Taylor Road and I-80. This designation is intended for
       single-family homes, and related, compatible uses.
       Residential uses are limited to a maximum density of one dwelling unit per one-half acre, and
       one-half acre is also the minimum parcel size for proposed subdivisions. Building heights are
       limited to two stories or 35 feet, and structural development shall not exceed 40 percent of lot
       coverage.
       Residential - Medium Density. This single-family residential land use designation is applied to
       approximately 330 acres, including: the Sunrise Loomis neighborhood and adjacent areas on the
       west side of Humphrey Road and south of King Road; two areas on the north and south sides of
       King Road between Taylor Road and I-80; and an area on the north and south sides of Brace
       Road between Sierra College Boulevard and I-80.
       This land use designation may accommodate residential use at densities ranging from two to six
       dwelling units per acre, with the appropriate minimum parcel size for proposed subdivisions
       determined by the Zoning Ordinance. Building heights are limited to two stories or 30 feet, and
       structural development shall not exceed 50 percent of lot coverage.
       Residential - Medium-High Density. These residential areas encompass approximately 94
       acres in two locations adjacent to the downtown core, and are intended to accommodate smaller
       lot single-family residential development, and lower density multi-family development including
       duplexes.
       This land use designation may accommodate residential use at densities ranging from six to 10
       dwelling units per acre, with the appropriate minimum parcel size for proposed subdivisions
       determined by the Zoning Ordinance. Building heights are limited to two stories or 30 feet, and
       structural development shall not exceed 60 percent of lot coverage.
       Residential - High Density. This multi-family residential designation is applied to a single area
       on the south side of Brace Road, east of Sierra College Boulevard. Residential use may be
       approved at densities ranging from 10 to 15 dwelling units per acre, with the appropriate
       minimum parcel size for proposed subdivisions determined by the Zoning Ordinance. Building
       heights are limited to two stories or 30 feet, and structural development shall not exceed 60
       percent of lot coverage.
Commercial and Other Designations
       Office and Professional. The Office and Professional designation encompasses approximately
       24 acres in three locations: on the south side of King Road west of Swetzer Rd.; on the north side
       of King Road east of Taylor Road; and on the north and south sides of King Road at I-80. This
       designation is intended for general business offices, professional and medical offices. Real estate
       and financial offices, and other similar uses may also be allowed. Residential uses may be
       allowed as part of mixed use structures. Building heights are generally limited to two stories or
       30 feet, and structural development shall not exceed 35 percent of lot coverage. The density of
       residential uses in mixed use projects may range from two-to-10 dwellings per acre.
                                                    25

Loomis General Plan                                                       Community Development - Land Use
       General Commercial. This designation is intended mainly for retail and service commercial
       uses located outside of the downtown core, that primarily serve local residents and businesses.
       Areas within this land use designation may also accommodate residential uses as part of mixed-
       use structures or site development, where provided by the policies for specific areas beginning on
       page 39 (Section G. of this Land Use Element). The areas within this land use designation are
       located along Taylor Road, on Sierra College Boulevard extending from I-80 to Taylor Road, and
       along I-80 from Horseshoe Bar Road to King Road. Building heights are limited to two stories or
       35 feet, and structural development shall not exceed a lot coverage of 50 percent. The density of
       residential uses may range from two-to-10 dwellings per acre, where allowed by the policies for
       specific areas.
       Town Center Commercial. This designation is applied to approximately 39 acres along Taylor
       and Horseshoe Bar Roads to the area identified as the “Downtown Core” by the Loomis Town
       Center Master Plan prepared in 1992. According to the master plan, “The Downtown Core
       describes an area where a variety of higher intensity uses are encouraged . . .” “Commercial uses
       along Taylor Road within the Downtown Core should evolve into specialty retail shopping
       district that will serve both residents and visitors. The Core should capitalize on its historic
       character, its existing fresh produce activities, its potential commuter rail stop, and its proximity
       to large numbers of residents and employees.” The Town Center Commercial designation is
       intended to accommodate a mixture of land uses, with primarily retail commercial and office uses
       on the ground floors of commercial structures, and residential units allowed on second or third
       floors. The density of these mixed-use residential units should not exceed 15 dwelling units per
       acre. Building heights are limited to three stories or 35 feet. Site coverage may range from 35
       percent to a maximum of 100 percent, and the allowable floor area ratio (FAR) may range from
       0.35 to 1.60, with a FAR greater than 0.50 allowed only where parking is approved by the Town
       to be either in parking structures that do not detract from the intended pedestrian orientation of
       the Downtown Core, or in public parking lots or other approved off-site locations.
       Tourist/Destination Commercial. This is one of three new land use designations developed for
       this General Plan update, and it is applied to approximately 117 contiguous acres in multiple
       ownerships along the southeasterly side of I-80 from Brace Road on the southwest to the Town
       boundary on the northeast, and bounded by Secret Ravine on the southeast. This land use
       designation is intended to accommodate a mixture of office/business park, retail commercial,
       lodging, conference center and other traveler-serving uses, local-serving entertainment uses, and
       residential uses as part of mixed-use structures.
       Building heights are limited to three stories, not to exceed 45 feet, provided that any height over
       35 feet shall require Fire Department approval. Within this area, site coverage may range from
       35 percent to a maximum of 50 percent. The density of residential uses within mixed-use
       projects may range from two to 10 dwellings per acre.
       Business Park. This is also a new land use designation developed for this General Plan update,
       and it is applied to approximately 35 acres in single ownership along the northerly edge of the
       Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way, northeasterly of Sierra College Boulevard. This site will
       eventually be bounded along its southeasterly edge by the extension of Swetzer Road to Sierra
       College Boulevard. The property along the extension of Swetzer Road is also subject to special
       policies which define its development potential, and provide standards for the design of potential
       development projects. These policies can be found on page 39.

Loomis General Plan                                                     Community Development - Land Use
       As applied to specific properties by this General Plan and as may be applied to additional
       properties through later amendments, this land use designation is intended for “headquarters”
       office-type and high technology uses in campus-like settings (buildings of similar or compatible
       architecture with shared circulation and parking, with substantial setbacks from streets and other
       property boundaries) with extensive landscaping throughout. Building heights are limited to two
       stories or 30 feet. Within this area, site coverage may range from 35 percent to a maximum of 50
       percent.
       Limited Industrial. This is another new land use designation developed for this General Plan
       update, and is applied to approximately 36 acres along the west side of Swetzer Road north of
       King Road. The purpose of the designation is to provide locations for light industrial uses that
       can operate near residential uses without adversely affecting residents. Appropriate light
       industrial uses will:
       ·      Have no outdoor activity or storage areas adjacent to residential uses, other than employee
              and client/customer parking, and screened storage areas with no noise-producing activities;
       ·      Locate no loading or delivery areas adjacent to residential uses; and
       ·      Operate only during normal weekday business hours unless site planning provides for
              buffer areas adjacent to residential uses.
       Most of the parcels within this designation are presently either built-out, or occupied by storage
       yards. This designation is intended to provide for the evolution of the area over time, to
       industrial uses that are more compatible with the adjacent residential area.
       Building heights are limited to two stories up to 30 feet, except that one story or 25 feet is
       required within 100 feet of an adjacent residential zoning district. Site coverage may range from
       35 percent for office-type uses to a maximum of 40 percent for warehouse-type uses.
       Light Industry. The Light Industry land use designation is applied to approximately 110 acres
       along both sides of Rippy Road, from King Road to the north Town boundary. This designation
       is intended for the manufacturing, production, storage, or sale of consumer goods and services,
       and for heavy commercial uses that involve outdoor activity or storage areas. Research and
       development offices, start-up businesses, warehouses, manufacturing plants, and other similar
       types of uses and supporting uses may be allowed. This designation is not intended for heavy
       industrial uses, such as chemical plants. Building heights are limited to two stories or 35 feet,
       and site coverage shall not exceed 50 percent
       Public-Quasi Public. The Public-Quasi Public land use designation is applied to properties
       owned by the Town and other public agencies (including school districts), which include a range
       of uses such as libraries, parks, schools, fire stations, emergency medical service facilities, etc.
       Building heights are limited to two stories or 30 feet, and site coverage may range from 35
       percent to a maximum of 50 percent.

B.     Areas of Land Use Change
After lengthy review of the land use pattern proposed for Loomis by the 1987 General Plan and 1992
Town Center Master Plan, and the various goals for the future of the Town in this and other portions of
the General Plan, the General Plan Steering Committee, Planning Commission, Town staff, and the
Town’s consultants recommended several changes to the land use designations of the 1987 General
Plan. The following changes have been enacted by the Town Council as part of this General Plan
update, are shown on Figure 3-2, and are also incorporated into the Land Use Diagram (Figure 3-1).
       Changes in residential density. Residential density has been increased in six areas. Four of the
       six involved changing the land use designation from Residential-Agricultural (4.6 acres per
       dwelling unit) to Residential Estate (2.3 acres per dwelling unit). These areas are:
       ·     North of King Road on both sides of Barker Road;
       ·     On both sides of Bankhead/Barker Road and extending south from King Road to the Town
             boundary;
       ·     Southeast of I-80 from Secret Ravine creek to approximately 500 feet south of Brace Road;
             and
       ·     Northwest of the intersection of Rocklin and Barton Roads.
       Two additional areas have been changed to increase residential density:
       ·     A parcel on the south side of Taylor Road at the northeast Town boundary has been
             changed from Residential Estate (2.3 acres per dwelling unit) to Residential Medium
             Density (2 to 6 dwelling units per acre); and
       ·     A parcel on the west side of Humphrey Road between the north Town boundary and King
             Road, immediately south of the new elementary school site.
       Residential density has been decreased from Residential - Medium High Density (6 to 8 dwelling
       units per acre) to Residential - Medium Density (2 to 6 units per acre) on a triangular parcel
       abutting I-80 between Horseshoe Bar Road and King Road, and south of the end of Day Avenue.
       The residential designation and density limitations have also been changed in the subdivision on
       Mareta Lane (from Rural Residential, one acre per unit, to Residential Low Density, one-half
       acre per unit). However, this change simply recognizes the existing density of the built-out
       subdivision, and creates no additional opportunity for subdivision.
       Residential to commercial. The following areas have been changed from residential to
       commercial.
       ·     Two parcels along the southerly side of Taylor Road northeasterly of Sierra College
             Boulevard have been changed from residential designations to General Commercial.
       ·     A parcel at the northwest corner of King Road and I-80 has been changed from Residential
             Estate to Office and Professional.
       ·     A parcel near the northeasterly Town boundary on the southerly side of Taylor Road has
             been changed from Residential Estate to General Commercial.
       ·     A 35-acre parcel along the north edge of the railroad right-of-way northeast of Sierra
             College Boulevard has been changed from Residential Estate to Business Park.
                                                   31
                                                                                              July 2001

Loomis General Plan                                                       Community Development - Land Use
       ·      Several parcels encompassing approximately 117 acres have been changed from the former
              General Plan’s Residential Rural Estate designation to the new Tourist/Destination
              Commercial designation.
       Modifications to commercial designations. Commercial land use designations have been
       changed in five locations. The Shopping Center designation of the former General Plan has been
       changed to General Commercial at the southeast corner of Brace Road and Sierra College
       Boulevard, and on Horseshoe Bar Road and I-80 (the Raley’s center). The Office/Professional
       designation at the northeast corner of Brace Road (extending north to Taylor) has also been
       changed to General Commercial. These changes and the elimination of the Shopping Center
       designation are intended to provide for greater flexibility in the range of retail and office uses that
       may be allowed in these locations.
       The property on the south side of King Road at I-80 has been changed from Neighborhood
       Commercial to Office/Professional, and the Neighborhood Commercial designation of the former
       General Plan has been eliminated. The Neighborhood Commercial designation was applied only
       to the single site, and the desire of the Town to reinforce the core concept and not provide for
       commercial uses outside of the core have made the designation unnecessary. The General
       Commercial designation also provides greater flexibility in the range of possible land uses.
       The property abutting the Raley’s center at its north edge has been changed from the Planned
       Development designation of the former General Plan to General Commercial, and the Planned
       Development designation has been eliminated. Like the Neighborhood Commercial designation,
       Planned Development was applied to a single site. It was intended to ensure that proposed
       development would include a mixture of uses, with new, higher-density residential uses
       providing a buffer between the commercial development adjacent to I-80 and the existing single-
       family residential areas to the north. This General Plan has retained those objectives through
       specific policy language that has been applied to the site.
       Finally, property on the south side of King Road west of Webb has been changed from General
       Commercial to Office/Professional, to reflect both existing approved development and the
       desired future land uses.
       Other changes. A new Limited Industrial designation has been included in this General Plan,
       and property on the west side of Swetzer Road north of King Road has been changed from Light
       Industry to Limited Industrial. This is intended to provide for a transition over time to industrial
       uses that will be more compatible with the residential area to the west than the existing industrial
       uses.

C.     Land Use Issues and Goals
Issues
·      Increased urbanization in adjacent communities is threatening to encroach upon the open space
       and agricultural areas in and surrounding Loomis.
·      Loomis should support the expansion of bicycle, equestrian and hiking trail systems both within
       and surrounding the Town of Loomis.
·      Development pressures suggest that Loomis consider rezoning some of its
       agricultural/residential land to increase land and infrastructure efficiency. However, residents
       have expressed their preference for the retention of large lot, rural residential parcels.
·      Size restrictions need to be placed on secondary residential units allowed on agricultural and
       rural residential lots in Loomis.
·      Newer single and multi-family residential projects lack design, architecture and scale
       appropriate for the small, rural Town of Loomis.
·      Loomis is feeling development pressure for intensification of land uses and build-out of
       underutilized parcels from surrounding urbanization.
·      Sierra College Boulevard is an important regional circulation route, and may be appropriate for
       more intensive land uses. However, Town residents have indicated strong support for
       concentration of more intensive land uses in the traditional downtown core area.
·      The lack of street trees and landscaping in some commercial areas detracts from the Town’s
       aesthetic quality.
·      Residents find some of the Town’s existing commercial signage undesirable, particularly along
       I-80.
·      Residents frequently shop outside of Town limits due to limited retail product availability in
       Loomis, thereby creating significant retail sales leakage.
·      Many residents work outside of Town limits due to limited employment opportunities in Loomis.
·      The increased public services and facilities desired by existing Town residents are dependant on
       property and sales tax revenues, which would increase with additional development of
       commercial and industrial uses.
·      Residents of Loomis would like to accelerate the redevelopment of the downtown.
Goals
1.     To preserve, maintain, and enhance creeks and riparian areas for both their aesthetic and wildlife
       habitat values.
2.     To protect groundwater and surface water quality.

3.     To protect oak woodlands and significant stands of native trees.
4.     To protect major landscape features within Loomis, including significant topography and rock
       outcroppings, open meadows and grazing areas.
5.     To maintain the rural character of Loomis in new residential developments by emphasizing rural
       character, quality, and livability in their design, and the provision of necessary services and
       facilities.
6.     To focus more intensive land uses near the downtown and freeway interchange, while
       maintaining the predominantly agricultural/rural character of Loomis outside the core area.
7.     To attract new development and land uses that provide jobs to Town residents, provided that
       those uses are consistent with the Town’s character.
8.     To designate adequate land to accommodate new commercial and industrial development that is
       consistent with the Town’s character.
9.     To improve the Town’s commercial base to increase municipal revenues, and provide a wider
       range of goods and services for local residents, in addition to encouraging some commercial uses
       near the freeway and in the downtown that can attract or serve patrons from outside the
       community.
D.     Agricultural and Open Space Land Use Policies
1.     Loomis shall allow property owners the "right-to-farm" their parcels through the protection and
       operation of agricultural land uses.
2.     Equestrian activities shall be protected by considering the effect that future density and design of
       residential development has in enhancing or inhibiting these activities.
3.     Loomis shall use zoning designations to protect properties used for agricultural operations from
       encroachment by urban development.
4.     Loomis shall provide for the use of the Williamson Act agricultural preserve program to allow
       land owners the property tax advantages of a long-term commitment to agricultural use.
E.     Residential Land Use Policies
General Policies
The following policies apply to all residential designations and land uses. The following section on page
36 provides policies regarding some specific residential land uses.
1.     Loomis shall maintain a balance between residential building density and the capacity of the
       circulation system, schools, fire and police services, and other public service facilities.
                                                    36
                                                                                                  July 2001

Loomis General Plan                                                    Community Development - Land Use
2.     New residential development shall be required to bear the full financial burden for new public
       service capital improvements required to serve the residents of the development, through impact
       fees, environmental mitigation fees, and other appropriate measures.
3.     New development should not create undue demand on schools, roads, or adversely affect the
       quality of life in adjoining neighborhoods.
4.     Loomis shall encourage the revitalization and rehabilitation of deteriorating residential areas
       throughout the Town.
5.     Loomis shall require the design of future residential projects to emphasize character, quality,
       livability, and the provision of all necessary services and facilities to insure their permanent
       attractiveness.
6.     The Town may approve the clustering of development, with no increase in net density, on sites
       where clustering is feasible, and necessary to protect sensitive natural features (such as creeks,
       native trees, rock outcrops) and avoid potentially hazardous areas (such as steep slopes, flood
       zones, and unstable soils). The Zoning Ordinance shall provide a Planned Development (PD)
       procedure that may be used in these cases. The option of clustering is offered by the Town as a
       means of preserving environmental and scenic resources, and shall not be used as a method for
       achieving the maximum density allowed by the General Plan. The priority for rural residential
       subdivision design must be the preservation of environmental resources and rural character.
7.     When subdivision is proposed within an existing residential neighborhood, and the General Plan
       and/or Zoning Ordinance allow new parcels smaller than those existing around the parcel(s) to be
       divided, the proposed parcels should be increased in size consistent with the nearby residential
       lots fronting upon the same street.
8.     Town approval of parcels proposed in any new subdivision will be based on all appropriate
       environmental and compatibility factors, and all applicable Town policies and regulations.
       Therefore, the maximum densities provided by the General Plan and the minimum parcel sizes of
       the Zoning Ordinance may be decreased (in the case of density) or increased (in the case of parcel
       size) through the subdivision review and approval process as determined by the Town to be
       necessary. The Town does not guarantee that any individual project will be able to achieve the
       maximum densities as designated in the General Plan, or the minimum parcel sizes provided by
       the Zoning Ordinance.
8.     Loomis shall promote the full utilization of land already committed to urban development before
       utilities and public services are extended to areas without existing urban infrastructure.
9.     Outside of the core area, Loomis shall promote a rural residential environment consisting
       primarily of single family homes.
10.    Loomis shall encourage the provision of adequate housing opportunities for people on fixed or
       limited incomes, with emphasis on senior citizen housing.
11.    Multi-family residential areas shall be designed to be compatible with nearby single family
       residential neighborhoods in terms of height and massing, and overall design. Multi-family
       residential development shall not be permitted on arterials serving as entryways to the Town
       unless substantial setbacks and landscaping are provided.

12.    Proposed development shall be planned and designed to preserve and enhance significant natural
       features (e.g. creeks, wetlands, native trees, rock outcrops, wildlife habitat), and retain the
       existing topography, to the greatest extent practical.
13.    Loomis shall evaluate all new residential subdivisions and other significant development
       proposals for consistency with the Town'    s design standards, with the objectives of maintaining a
       small, neighborly, rural community, reflective of the Town'   s heritage. Proposed projects that are
       inconsistent with the Town'    s design guidelines shall be denied, or be revised to be consistent.
14.    Loomis shall encourage the retention and enhancement of natural vegetation along major
       roadways in new developments as a tool for mitigating noise impacts and providing scenic open
       spaces.
15.    New residential development near the freeway shall consider alternative noise mitigation
       measures and avoid the construction of artificial freeway sound walls.
16.    Loomis shall prohibit the development of gated residential communities.
17.    Loomis will monitor the rate and type of residential development within the Town in relation to
       commercial and industrial revenue-producing development, and may enact measures to ensure
       balance between residential and non-residential development so that excessive residential growth
       does not adversely affect Town finances.
18.    All new development in Loomis shall conform to the land use map, land use categories and
       development intensities set forth in this General Plan.
Policies for Specific Residential Land Use Issues

       State law, and past Town policies and regulations have provided the possibility for residential
       parcels of sufficient size to be developed with a second residential unit in addition to the primary
       dwelling normally allowed. This possibility raises important land use policy issues for the Town,
       because an uncontrolled proliferation of second units could change the single-family residential
       character of neighborhoods and rural residential areas, and increase traffic on roads that were
       planned in anticipation of lower densities. Inappropriately designed and sited second units in the
       rural areas of the Town can also disrupt neighbors’ privacy, and impair the rural character of
       those areas. Therefore, second residential units may be approved through the process required by
       the Zoning Ordinance, subject to the following standards.
       a.     Minimum site area. Outside of the Downtown area identified in Figure 3-3 (page 42)
              second units may be placed only on parcels of 20,000 square feet or larger. Within the
              Downtown, second units may be allowed as provided by the Zoning Ordinance.
       b.     Floor area limitations. Second units shall not exceed the following maximum floor area
              requirements, except as provided by (1) and (2) after the table.

Loomis General Plan                                                               Community Development - Land Use
                         Site area                                    Maximum floor area
                         20,000 sf to 40,000 sf                               640 sf
                         40,001 sf to 9.2 acres                             1,200 sf
                         9.2 acres or larger                              No maximum
               (1)     A parcel that qualifies for a second unit and is of sufficient size to be subdivided in
                       compliance with the applicable land use category may have a second unit with no floor area
                       limitation, provided that both units are located to meet the setback requirements that would
                       apply to primary dwellings on the future parcels.
               (2)     A site that would qualify for a second unit, with an existing dwelling of 1,400 square feet or
                       less (not including a garage) as of the effective date of this General Plan, may be developed
                       with one additional dwelling, with no restriction on the floor area of the new unit.
       c.      Location of second unit. On a parcel that cannot be subdivided, the second unit shall be placed no
               closer to a primary dwelling on a neighboring parcel than to the primary dwelling on the same
               parcel.
       Clustered Residential Development
       Clustered residential development (sometimes also referred to as “planned residential development”) is a
       site planning tool that concentrates allowable residential development in one portion of a site to avoid
       problems that may be encountered if the development were spread over the entire property. In general, the
       Town intends that residential development occur in strict compliance with the minimum parcel size
       requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, which are derived from the density ranges provided for each
       residential land use category by this General Plan.
       Under limited circumstances, however, specific site characteristics of access, scenic rural character,
       slopes, soil stability, environmental resources, infrastructure, or other similar factors may be sufficiently
       sensitive or constraining to warrant a different approach to subdivision than provided by the normal
       minimum parcel size requirements. In these cases, the Town may allow development to be clustered in
       restricted areas of the site, on parcels smaller than normally allowed by the applicable zoning district, in
       return for permanently maintaining the more sensitive areas in an undeveloped state, and provided that the
       total residential density does not exceed that allowed for the applicable land use category by this General
       Plan.
       The Town’s detailed standards for clustered development will be provided by the Zoning Ordinance.
       Those standards shall provide:
       ·       Thresholds for minimum site area for clustered projects and individual clustered parcels;
       ·       Site layout and design standards for clustered projects;
       ·       Requirements for permanent open space and conservation areas within clustered projects where
               appropriate, together with provisions for their long-term ownership and maintenance; and
       ·       Procedures for clustered development review and approval.
F.     Commercial and Industrial Land Use Policies
1.     Loomis shall retain and renew existing commercial land uses and designate sufficient new commercial
       areas to meet future Town needs, where appropriate. Community development opportunities shall also be
       considered in terms of community need for increased sales tax revenues, and to balance with residential
       developments.

Loomis General Plan                                                            Community Development - Land Use
2.     Downtown Loomis shall be developed and maintained as a focal point for personal shopping and services
       within the community, through continued implementation of the policies and regulations originally
       developed in the Town Center Master Plan, which are now in various portions of this General Plan and
       the Zoning Ordinance.
3.     Loomis shall promote the redevelopment of the railroad right-of-way areas to celebrate and enhance the
       heritage of the Town.
4.     Commercial development shall be subject to design criteria which visually integrate commercial
       development into the architectural heritage of the Town. Projects found inconsistent with Loomis'distinct
       character shall be denied or revised.
5.     New commercial development shall preserve and integrate existing natural features (e.g. creeks, native
       trees, rock outcrops) and topography into project landscaping.
6.     Loomis shall require landscaping throughout off-street parking lots to mitigate the adverse visual impact
       of large paved areas and provide shading to assist in energy conservation within adjacent buildings.
7.     Circulation patterns within and around new commercial development shall be designed to avoid diverting
       traffic through existing residential neighborhoods, where feasible.
8.     New industrial development shall be allowed only if impacts associated with noise, odor and visual
       intrusion into surrounding uses can be mitigated to acceptable levels.
9.     Loomis shall not allow new industrial uses that will adversely impact either the environment or
       surrounding land uses.
10.    Commercial land uses shall be discouraged away from the Town’s core area, except when property is
       demonstrably unsuitable for residential use because of proximity to noise sources such as major arterials
       or railroad lines.
G.     Policies for Specific Areas
The policies of this section amplify the general policies provided above for the various land use designations,
focusing on specific areas of Loomis where future development will raise special concerns. The numbering of the
following sections corresponds to the numbers shown on the Land Use Diagram that identify each Special Policy
Area.
1.     Business Park designation along the railroad, northeast of Sierra College Boulevard and Taylor
       Road. This site shall be developed as a business park, subject to the following policies:
       a.      Business park development shall require access from Sierra College Boulevard, with no access to
               the site through the residentially-designated areas to the north and west.
       b.      The site shall be planned to provide a self-contained, campus-like character (i.e., buildings of
               similar or compatible architecture with shared circulation and parking, with substantial setbacks
               from streets and other property boundaries) with extensive landscaping throughout.
       c.      Proposed development shall be separated from the north and west property lines by a buffer of
               dense landscaping at least 50 feet in width. Development adjacent to the buffer shall be limited to
               low-profile, one-story structures. Parking areas shall be separated from the buffer by buildings.
               No outdoor storage or business activity areas shall be allowed, except for outdoor sitting, eating
               and recreation areas for employees.
                                                        40
                                                                                                        July 2001

Loomis General Plan                                                             Community Development - Land Use
2.     General Commercial and Office/Professional designations north of the Raley’s Center, and at I-80
       and King Road. The planning of proposed development on these currently vacant properties should be
       carefully coordinated and integrated to ensure adequate access and circulation between Horseshoe Bar
       Road and King Road. Proposed development shall comply with the following standards.
       a.     The riparian corridors extending through this area shall be protected consistent with the policies in
              the Conservation of Resources chapter of this General Plan.
       b.     Proposed development shall be planned to provide a gradual transition of intensity between
              development adjacent to I-80 and existing commercial, and the neighboring residential areas, to
              minimize the potential for land use conflicts with residential uses, and problems for residents. The
              west General Commercial site should be developed with a mixture of land uses consisting of three
              tiers: general commercial and/or office uses should be located adjacent to the Raley’s center; low
              profile office structures should be placed in a second tier after the commercial uses; and medium-
              to medium-high density residential should be located adjacent to the existing residential areas to the
              north of this site. Any residential uses on the Office/Professional site (the parcel at I-80 and King
              Road) should be developed with shared driveways to minimize access points on the new extension
              of Boyington Road. (See the Circulation Element regarding the Boyington Road extension (page
              81), and Figure 4-3 (page 85). The location/alignment of this extension will be determined at the
              time subdivision or other development of the presently vacant properties is proposed.).
3.     Residential Estate designation northwest of Rocklin and Barton Roads. The planning of proposed
       subdivision and development in this Residential Estate designation is encouraged to be coordinated among
       the different property ownerships. Proposed subdivisions shall be designed to provide parcels with a
       minimum of 4.6 acres along the Barton and Rocklin Road frontages, and a minimum of 2.3 acres when
       located away from Barton and Rocklin Roads. To the extent feasible, building sites should be set back
       from Rocklin Road and Barton Road to retain native vegetation and terrain features, and preserve the
       present appearance as a rural road corridor. Access to new parcels is to be provided by new roads from
       Barton Road and Rocklin Road, with no individual driveway access to Rocklin Road.
4.     General Commercial Designation on Taylor Road northeast of Sierra College Boulevard. These
       parcels should be developed with commercial uses along the Taylor Road frontage, with office uses or
       multi-family residential behind the commercial, to buffer the adjacent single-family residential uses from
       the noise, glare, and activities associated with commercial uses.
5.     Commercial Development south of Interstate 80. The area on the land use diagram designated
       Tourist/Destination Commercial along the southerly side of Interstate 80 presents the community with
       significant opportunities in terms of potential revenue-producing commercial development. It also
       presents significant concerns relative to the sensitive environmental resources of Secret Ravine, the
       Town’s image along I-80, and potential impacts on adjacent residential areas.
       Property owners seeking to develop within this designation shall obtain Town approval of a conditional
       use permit, development agreement, development and design standards, or some combination thereof, as
       determined by the Town Council depending upon the size, type, and complexity of the proposed
       development. The following issues shall be addressed: details of proposed land uses, densities and
       building intensities, site planning and other general development standards, design guidelines, site access,
       internal and external circulation, infrastructure and utilities, and project and parcel phasing, to the extent
       that phasing is known by the property owner, or owners in the case of multiple properties participating in a
       project proposal. The Town’s goals for the Tourist/Destination Commercial land use designation are for
       proposed development to:
       a.     Create an identity, appearance, and mix of land uses that provide for the integrated development of
              all parcels and that will be attractive to both travelers and Town residents. The arrangement of uses
              on the overall site should be allowed to emphasize the creation of a destination or significant

Loomis General Plan                                                            Community Development - Land Use
                stopover for travelers, provide enhanced shopping and entertainment opportunities for Town
                residents, and tie into the historic downtown area to support the economic viability of the
                downtown.
        b.      Provide traveler-oriented commercial uses that are accessed primarily by automobiles and
                concentrated near the Horseshoe Bar Road interchange. Uses on the site shall then transition to
                more locally-oriented commercial and office uses, laid out to provide a pedestrian orientation.
        c.      Provide primary access to commercial development from Horseshoe Bar Road, with limited,
                secondary access on Brace Road. Commercial uses shall not front on Brace Road and shall be set
                back and/or buffered from Brace Road to maintain the rural residential character of the roadway
                corridor.
        d.      Provide a design and appearance that will reinforce the rural character of Loomis by: integrating
                existing natural features, including significant trees and rock outcrops; building design that
                emphasizes low-profile structures, local native materials, and the local historic architectural
                vernacular, and site development incorporating appropriate vegetation, preferably native, that can
                act as a buffer and screen, as well as add to the ambiance of the development.
        e.      Provide for the long-term protection, preservation, and sustainability of the Secret Ravine riparian
                corridor, and its aquatic and terrestrial habitats.
6.      Residential Medium-Density site on the west side of Humphrey Road immediately south of the H.
        Powers Clark School. The allowable density of two to six dwelling units per acre shall be distributed on
        the site with lower density on the edges of the parcel. An application for the proposed subdivision of the
        property shall demonstrate special attention to potential flooding and drainage issues, and any proposed
        project shall be designed to create no greater volume of storm water runoff to downstream properties after
        development.
H.      Other Policies
1.      The boundaries of proposed land use designations should be coincident with existing property boundaries,
        to the extent possible. One possible exception may be when the frontage of a large lot along a major
        arterial would be inappropriate for residential uses, while much of the remainder could be suited for
        residential use.
I.      Land Use Implementation Measures
In order to implement the above land use policies of this General Plan, the Town will do the following:
1.      Amend the Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map consistent with this General Plan.
2.      Adopt “right-to-farm” provisions within the Zoning Ordinance.
3.      Amend the Zoning Ordinance to provide requirements for the development of commercially-zoned parcels
        adjacent to residential zoning that require commercial development to buffer residential uses from the
        noise, night lighting, and other impacts of commercial uses.
4.      Within three years of the adoption of this General Plan (by June 2004), the Town will re-evaluate the
        residential land use designations on Sierra College Boulevard between King Road and Interstate 80 to
        determine if reclassification to commercial would be appropriate. This study will consider existing and
        projected traffic volumes on Sierra College Boulevard, potentially appropriate commercial designations,
        types of commercial uses that may be used to buffer residential development from Sierra College
        Boulevard traffic impacts, the desirability of frontage roads, noise and air quality impacts.

Downtown Plan
In 1992, the Town Council adopted the Loomis Town Center Master Plan as part of the General Plan. The
purpose of the plan was to determine “. . . how new development and land uses can occur in the central portion of
Loomis, while maintaining its traditional small town character and encouraging its economic vitality.” (Town
Center Master Plan, page i) This General Plan update, together with the adoption of the design guidelines
referenced in the following section, and the updating of the Town’s Zoning Ordinance consistent with this General
Plan, replace the Town Center Master Plan as a formal General Plan element, reducing the number of documents
that must be reviewed in depth before a complete understanding of the Town’s expectations for development can
be understood. The Town Center Master Plan will then remain available as a resource document which provided
the basis for the Town’s relevant General Plan goals and policies, zoning regulations, and design guidelines.

·       Residents of Loomis would like to encourage the redevelopment of the downtown.
·       The downtown core lacks a consistent design theme and the appearance of a number of the buildings
        could be improved.
Goals
The goals of the Town of Loomis for its town center are to:
1.      Maintain the small town character of Loomis;
2.      Promote the economic stability of the Town;
3.      Provide goods and services for residents;
4.      Revitalize Taylor Road;
5.      Protect Loomis’ natural resources;
6.      Create a civic center;
7.      Provide a range of employment and housing opportunities;
8.      Develop and maintain Downtown Loomis as a focal point for shopping and services; and
9.      Redevelop the railroad rights-of-way to enhance Loomis’ historic image.
Policies
1.      Until the adoption of Zoning Ordinance provisions and design guidelines to implement the Town Center
        Master Plan, proposed development and new land uses within the Town Center Commercial, General
        Commercial, Residential Medium Density, Residential Medium High Density, and Residential High
        Density land use designations south of King Road and northwesterly of I-80 shall be consistent with the
        Town Center Master Plan. Proposed development and new land uses shall be consistent with the Town’s
        Zoning Ordinance provisions and design guidelines that implement the provisions of the Town Center
        Master Plan, after the Zoning Ordinance provisions and design guidelines are adopted by the Town.
Implementation Measures
1.      Amend the Zoning Ordinance to include appropriate development standards consistent with the standards
        in the Town Center Master Plan for building intensity, building height, setbacks, signs, and other
        development features.
2.      Prepare and adopt design guidelines for the areas covered by the Town Center Master Plan consistent with
        the development guidelines provided in the Town Center Master Plan.
Community Design and Character
This section provides goals, policies, and design guidelines to help retain and enhance the unique character of both
the urbanized and predominantly rural areas of Loomis. These provisions also encourage urban development that
is pedestrian-oriented, compact in form, diverse and attractive in appearance. These approaches to design are
intended to conserve and enhance the natural and aesthetic resources of the Town, improve the Town’s

Loomis General Plan                                                  Community Development - Design and Character
opportunities to maintain the type of healthier economy enjoyed by attractive communities, and allow
development that conserves natural resources and encourages community-building among residents.
Background
The Town of Loomis includes a variety of visually pleasing landscapes. Despite continuing growth, the wooded
hills, grasslands, and agricultural areas surrounding the more urbanized core still retain a predominantly open,
rural feeling. Loomis is still viewed as a pleasant small town, with commercial areas of pedestrian scale, and an
historic architectural heritage.
The Town’s visual character is widely appreciated by residents and visitors, and its importance has been
highlighted elsewhere in this General Plan as a result of community preferences expressed throughout the process
of General Plan preparation. However, recent growth and development have raised more community design issues
than ever before, in part because of the significant growth pressures facing the region, and the type of development
projects that have been proposed in the Town.
Even though court decisions on the rights of communities to manage the planning and appearance of development
have found that aesthetic regulation is appropriate, the adoption of design standards may be controversial.
Everyone knows that each of us is free to form our own opinions about what is "good" design. And any sort of
community agreement about preferred styles of building architecture, color, or materials can be difficult, if not
impossible to achieve. Even if most residents could agree on these issues, the result of a community forcing rigid
uniformity in project design can produce development as unappealing as where design issues are given no public
attention at all.
On the other hand, communities which express no public policy about site planning and building design risk
development having a location, scale or appearance that is disruptive instead of beneficial. Unless the community
clearly describes its design expectations, insensitive development can eliminate the pedestrian scale of a business
district, the historic character of an older residential neighborhood, or the appearance of a natural feature such as a
ridgeline that, before the prominent new building, only presented a view of trees against the sky. Each of those
consequences of absent or unclear community design policy can provoke public dismay, and the residents'
comment, "How could that have happened?"
The public policy dilemma is that good design is hard to describe and harder to mandate; but having no design
standards can result in the loss of the special qualities that a community wants to preserve. Therefore, the intent of
this section and of the separate design guidelines documents it anticipates, is to provide policies and guidelines
that focus attention on the aspects of site planning and building design that can enhance or damage Town
character. The separate design guidelines will then offer examples of how new development can be designed to be
beneficial rather than detrimental, without mandating specific architectural styles or other single solutions.
Issues
The Town of Loomis would like to retain the character of a friendly small town in a rural setting. The growth
pressures of the Sacramento region and the ongoing suburbanization in surrounding communities threaten this
character. These circumstances raise the following issues.
·        The character of recent non-residential development in Loomis has tended toward generic suburban
         architectural styles. Some residents feel that existing development regulations and design guidelines are
         not creating and maintaining the desired rural and historical community character.
·        Some gateway areas to the Town contain inappropriate design and types of non-residential land uses.
         The Town would like its gateway areas to reflect its distinct, rural character.
·        The downtown core lacks a consistent design theme and a number of the buildings have undesirable
         facade and design elements.

Loomis General Plan                                                Community Development - Design and Character
Goals
1.      To ensure new development is designed to encourage neighborliness, a sense of belonging to the
        community, and community pride.
2.      To maintain the distinct identity and small town neighborly character of Loomis through the appropriate
        design of new development, and by the preservation of open space and natural resources.
Policies
1.      The design of development should respect the key natural resources and existing quality development on
        each site, including ecological systems, vegetative communities, major trees, water courses, land forms,
        archaeological resources, and historically and architecturally important structures. Proposed project
        designs should identify and conserve special areas of high ecological sensitivity throughout the Town.
        Examples of resources to preserve include riparian corridors, wetlands, and oak woodlands.
2.      Loomis shall require the design of future residential projects to emphasize character, quality, livability,
        and the provision of all necessary services and facilities to insure their permanent attractiveness.
3.      Each development project should be designed to be consistent with the unique local context of Loomis.
        a.     Design projects to fit their context in terms of building form, siting and massing.
        b.     Design projects to be consistent with a site' s natural features and surroundings.
4.      Design each project at a human scale consistent with surrounding natural and built features.
        a.     Project design should give special attention to scale in all parts of a project, including grading,
               massing, site design and building detailing.
        b.     Project design should follow the rules of good proportion, where the mass of the building is
               balanced and the parts relate well to one another.
5.      Design projects to minimize the need to use automobiles for transportation.
        a.     Emphasize pedestrian and bicycle circulation in all projects.
        b.     Give individual attention to each mode of transportation with potential to serve a project and the
               Town, including pedestrian, bicycle, transit, rail, and automobile.
        c.     Plan for trail systems, where appropriate to connect areas of development with natural and
               recreational resources.
6.      Encourage an active, varied, and concentrated urban life within commercial areas.
        a.     Create and maintain pedestrian oriented centers of development within commercial areas that
               contain mixtures of retail, other employment, and other uses.
        b.     Create clustered and mixed use projects within the Downtown Core centers that combine
               residential, retail, office and other uses.
7.      Respect and preserve natural resources within rural areas.
        a.     Design buildings to blend into the landscape.

Loomis General Plan                                               Community Development - Design and Character
       b.     Emphasize native vegetation and natural forms in site design and project landscaping.
8.     Commercial development shall be subject to design criteria which visually integrate commercial
       development into the architectural heritage of the Town. Projects found inconsistent with Loomis'distinct
       character shall be denied or revised.
9.     New lighting (including lighted signage) that is part of residential, commercial, industrial or recreational
       development shall be oriented away from sensitive uses, and shielded to the extent possible to minimize
       spillover light and glare. Lighting plans shall be required for all proposed commercial and industrial
       development prior to issuance of building permits.
Implementation Measures
The Town should provide for the preparation of detailed design guidelines for multi-family residential,
commercial, and industrial and other nonresidential development types, to expand on the general policies provided
above, and provide developers with clear expressions of community preferences for project design, without
mandating single architectural styles.

Loomis General Plan                                                  Community Development - Parks and Recreation
Parks and Recreation
A.       Park and Recreation Facilities
The Town of Loomis owns and operates one park site. The Town also contributes funds to the Loomis Unified
School District to provide recreational improvements to their facilities. Although schools limit the use of their
facilities, they represent a significant source for meeting recreational needs for Loomis residents. Placer County
operates the Loomis Basin Regional Park on the northeast border of the Town which is regularly used by Loomis
residents. In addition, Sierra Community College has recreational facilities available for limited use by non-
students. Bikeways, hiking and equestrian trails also provide recreational opportunities for residents. Figure 3-4
identifies the locations of park and recreation facilities in Loomis. An inventory of park and recreational facilities
in and nearby Loomis that are frequented by Town residents is provided in Table 3-2.
The parks and recreation needs assessment prepared and adopted by the Town indicated that the appropriate parks
standard to apply to Loomis is five acres of park area per 1,000 population. Existing park and recreation facilities
are generally located in the north area of the Town (above I-80). Therefore, the needs assessment identified future
recreation needs based on the town population and demographics as a whole, and on the two major north/south
planning areas. The results of the needs assessment indicate a current (1998) park land need for the north
planning area of 21 acres, and a future (2005) need for 28 acres. The south planning area, which does not
currently have any existing park facilities, is projected to need nine acres of park land by the year 2005. Park
needs are further defined as needing approximately 7.9 acres of active park land and 30 acres of passive/open
space acreage. The parks and recreation land and facility needs represent minimum, versus maximum needs. In
addition, the Town does not currently have a multi-use community center available to provide recreation
opportunities, group meeting facilities, etc.
B.       Bikeways and Trails
Bikeways and trails are another means to meet the recreational needs of Town residents. The Town of Loomis has
designated several bikeways and trails within the community, which are also part of the Placer County Bikeway
System and Trails Master Plan. Currently, one bikeway has been developed in Loomis along King Road, and
portions of Taylor Road. The County has designated four additional bikeways within Loomis, which remain
unimproved.
As noted above, Antelope Creek and Secret Ravine provide opportunities for open space corridors potentially
providing hiking and equestrian trails. The creeks provide connections between the north and south areas of town,
and to areas south of Loomis. The County has designated Secret Ravine as a Class 1 bicycle corridor in the
regional bicycle transportation plan. The corridor is planned to extend from Loomis Basin Regional Park, west to
the City of Roseville. This bikeway has not yet been improved. Secret Ravine has also been designated as an
hiking and equestrian trail in the Loomis Basin Horsemen’s Association Trails Master Plan and in other County
planning documents. While no bikeways or trails have been designated along Antelope Creek, it is an important
open space resource providing flood protection and significant riparian habitat value, and is also used as an
informal hiking trail.
More detailed information on bikeways can be found in the Circulation Element, on pages 69 and 83.

Policies
1.     The Town will pursue all available funding mechanisms to provide a multi-use community
       center.
2.     The Town will work toward providing additional park and recreation facilities to meet the needs
       of Loomis residents as the Town’s population increases.
3.     Loomis shall adopt Town park and recreational standards to guide and promote the development
       of recreational open space, in addition to working with Placer County in the provision of public
       recreation facilities.

Loomis General Plan                                          Community Development - Economic Development
Economic Development
The economic development element defines goals for economic growth in the community and the
policies that will facilitate the nature of growth desired by the Town. Four primary goals are identified,
and specific policies required to implement each goal are presented. A program to implement the
economic development element and to periodically evaluate progress is also described.
A.      Purpose
The intent of this element is to assist in maintaining and expanding a strong, diversified, and balanced
sales tax and property tax base throughout the entire community and to maintain and create new, high-
wage, clean-industry employment opportunities.
The overriding principle behind the above purpose is to maintain and enhance the quality of life in
Loomis. It is acknowledged that the economic potential of Loomis can only be realized with the
cooperation of both the public and private sectors. Among other things, the Town must have a good
school system, offer cultural and recreational activities, and operate an efficient and effective
government. Therefore, this element includes strategies to work with the public and private sectors to
improve the quality of life, which will allow the Town to be economically competitive.
B.      Goals and Policies
Goals
The economic development element centers around the following four primary goals:
1.      To encourage and assist existing industries and businesses to remain and expand in Loomis,
        helping them to be economically viable contributors to the community.
2.      To recruit new industries and businesses, thereby creating new jobs for Loomis residents.
3.      To preserve and enrich the historic character of the downtown by implementing a revitalization
        plan to beautify the downtown area, transition unutilized or underutilized land into economically
        productive developments, and restore historic sites to full utility.
4.      To develop tourism in Loomis by attracting, developing, and expanding special events and public
        and private recreational facilities and programs, and by capitalizing on the historical character of
        the Town.
Business Retention and Expansion
The retention and expansion of existing firms are key to maintaining a stable employment and tax base
and, ultimately, to attracting new business. A retention and expansion program is a systematic approach
to gathering information from the local business sector, and then using the information as a tool to
identify and address immediate problems and to develop local programs and policies that promote a
diversified local economy.
Retention and expansion also involves providing links or direct access to a variety of public and private
services such as training and financing. The program also provides a ready-made early warning system
                                                     54
                                                                                                  July 2001
Loomis General Plan                                         Community Development - Economic Development
to prevent impending company relocation. A strong retention and expansion program keeps the Town,
Loomis Basin Chamber of Commerce, and businesses in touch and communicating on a regular and
systematic basis.
Major economic development tools that the Town can use include industrial development bonds, tax
increment financing for specific projects in redevelopment areas, job training assistance, information
dissemination, advertising and promotion, and top quality customer service from Town staff.
One of the side benefits of business retention is that commercial and industrial attraction efforts are
enhanced through the increased success of existing businesses. Also, positive working relationships are
developed between the public and private sector, creating a welcome, can-do perception of the Town.
Potential target industries and business sectors will also emerge, and new business opportunities will
become a natural outgrowth of a successful retention and expansion program.
       Business Retention Policies
       The following policies are designed to achieve the goal of business retention.
       1.     Conduct periodic commercial/industrial surveys. In addition to gathering basic
              industry statistics (e.g., business sector, number of employees), surveys should obtain
              information on the needs of existing businesses to remain profitable and enable them to
              expand.
       2.     Act as ombudsman. Businesses recognize the value of having an internal advocate and
              link within the Town that can cross department lines to bring appropriate action to bear on
              problem solving or to take advantage of an opportunity for expansion, retention, or
              attraction of other business. This can be a powerful economic development tool.
       3.     Locate financing sources and linkages. This is recommended to encourage more lending
              and financing opportunities in the community.
       4.     Link small business to assistance training and counseling. The Town and Chamber
              have a definite and important role to play by encouraging development of assistance
              programs available to local small business, including use of the Greater Sacramento Area
              Small Business Development Center.
       5.     Provide information and referral services. This is one of the fundamental activities of
              economic development. Increased requests for information and the number of contacts are
              one of the manifestations of a successful program. The more businesses learn about the
              economic development interest of the Town, the greater their response and desire will be to
              work with the Town and benefit from the program services. To the extent that the Town
              can assist a company by providing an answer to a question or solution to a problem, the
              program strengthens the individual company and contributes to the health of the general
              business environment.
       6.     Host seminars and workshops. This activity will promote economic development to
              brokers, tenants, and companies on a regular basis. This activity can also be used as a
              marketing tool to kick off an economic development strategic plan to the community.

Loomis General Plan                                         Community Development - Economic Development
        7.     Create an economic development training and awareness program. Training is
               proposed to develop awareness about economic development among Town staff to enable
               them to recognize and act on economic development opportunities.
        8.     Maintain regular direct communication with business. The Town Council, Chamber
               of Commerce, Economic Development Commission, downtown or other business
               associations, and Town staff should make regular contact with Loomis area businesses.
               This could be done by direct mail, phone/fax, e-mail, and personal visits. The intent of
               this communication is to let the businesses of the community understand that their
               presence in Loomis is appreciated and to extend an invitation to assist the business with
               problems they may encounter.
Business Attraction and Formation
Business attraction and formation is considered a higher risk economic development tool than a retention
and expansion program. This is because the time needed to complete an attraction project tends to be
several years and because there are relatively few major facilities to attract at any particular time.
Perception of a community as a competitive site location is built on several factors, such as: the
reputation of the Town among its existing companies; differential economic factors such as cost of land,
permit and other fees, and tax rates; ease of doing business; availability of suitable sites; and available
financing. The attraction program works best and is most successful as part of a total economic
development effort and not as the sole focus.
The use of targeted attraction techniques represents an opportunity for Loomis based on its
demographics, local economy, and economic activity going on around it. Also, disposable income inside
the community, and outside the community, presents development opportunities to recapture the sales
that are lost to retail centers in adjacent communities.
        Business Attraction and Formation Policies
        Specific policies to address this goal include the following:
        1.     Identify attraction targets. To prepare an effective attraction program, it is first
               necessary to identify companies that are a natural fit with Loomis. It is also necessary to
               find out which companies are searching or growing to target resources where there is the
               greatest likelihood of a successful match. This involves matching the Town’s strengths
               with growth companies most needing the type of location offered by Loomis.
        2.     Create and follow site location leads and prepare proposals. Specific proposals should
               be prepared using Town information packets with specific demographic, economic, and
               site information that will encourage a company to select Loomis as the location for their
               company. Leads or referrals can be made by Town staff, the Chamber of Commerce, the
               Economic Development Commission, existing businesses, new businesses, commercial
               brokers and developers, the Placer County Economic Development Office, and others.
        3.     Work closely with commercial brokers and developers. Establishing a solid
               communication network among brokers and developers results in growing familiarity and
               improved perceptions of Town permit and planning services, exchanges of information
               about sites available for new companies, and opportunity to respond to unique
               development timing requirements with a unique Town process. The Town’s reputation as
                                                    56
                                                                                                  July 2001

Loomis General Plan                                         Community Development - Economic Development
               a serious player in business attraction is made by the perceptions, accurate or not, of
               company managers, brokers, and developers. Close communication results in problem
               solving and cooperative working relationships.
        4.     Work closely with Placer County and other regional and state economic development
               agencies. This activity includes providing frequent updates on Town opportunities for
               companies, and meeting to discuss strategy for attraction of specific companies with
               regional and other economic development agencies. This is an important part of marketing
               the Town. The more familiar other economic development agencies are with Loomis, the
               better the Town will be represented outside of its own initiatives.
        5.     Implement a joint business/Town advertising program. There is an opportunity to
               leverage the Town’s dollars by advertising Loomis jointly with private industry. Loomis
               could take advantage of the achievements of Loomis area companies by using them in
               marketing and promotion of the Town and also highlighting the company location in
               industry advertisements. Also, the large gas, electric, phone, and cable companies have
               economic development departments that co-sponsor trade show space and marketing
               materials.
        6.     Investigate how the Town can create business incubator opportunities. Business
               incubators provide opportunities for start-up companies in an atmosphere where
               centralized services, counseling, and space are provided at rates lower than individualized
               services. The Town could potentially obtain grant and loan financing to help develop a
               facility for a business incubator program.
        7.     Support Emerging Technologies Institute (ETI) of Northern California. ETI is a non-
               profit, public benefit California corporation dedicated to the long term objective of
               improving the quality of life in the Sacramento Valley region. To accomplish this goal, the
               institute promotes creation of new and higher-paying jobs in technologically sophisticated
               industries. The objective is to acquire new industries that rely less on real estate,
               government, and the military as primary employers to the region.
        8.     Develop a Town marketing program. Marketing of the Town as a business site location
               is presently being done in a very limited way. Successful business attraction marketing
               requires that the Town establish a presence at appropriate trade shows and builds a
               network among company real estate and facilities managers through participation in their
               professional organizations. This participation can be achieved in conjunction with regional
               and state economic development agencies.
Downtown Focus
There is an obvious need for aesthetic and economic revitalization of the Town’s downtown area.
Currently, there is a lack of a viable downtown economy, with a number of vacant buildings and other
buildings in need of structural and aesthetic rehabilitation; however, the downtown also contains many
historical structures and attractive public buildings. Several privately-owned downtown buildings and
related structures have been restored and plans exist to begin the restoration process. Continuing
development and private revitalization of the downtown should emphasize the historic character of the
downtown architecture and the fruit shed heritage and ambiance. Tree-lined streets with shaded
sidewalks that are conducive to promoting pedestrian use should be provided. A retail, dining, and
entertainment area that is only a few blocks would create a core area easily accessible by walking.
                                                     57
                                                                                                 July 2001

Loomis General Plan                                          Community Development - Economic Development
Interest in the downtown area remains very local and development opportunities are not well known
among out-of-town brokers, developers, and potential tenants. These represent unrealized opportunities
for expanded retail sales and employment growth. The previously adopted Town Center Master Plan is
envisioned as an impetus to economic development in Loomis. Activities should include promoting the
area by providing information and plans to potential investors and property owners, locating available
financing, and finding solutions to remove impediments to development.
        Downtown Focus Policies
        The following policies relate to downtown revitalization:
        1.    Market the downtown. The Town must work with developers and property owners to
              encourage development, upgrades, and improvements in order to attract new businesses
              and investment in the downtown. Loans for facade upgrades, seismic safety, and other
              improvements could be secured. Polices identified above that relate to business retention
              and attraction can be applied specifically to the downtown area.
        2.    Complete a downtown identity program. Continuing work on a downtown identity
              program that preserves the historic character of the Town should include specific actions
              such as landscaping, lighting, paving, and gateway improvements, and a downtown
              signage program.
        3.    Create project financing sources. The Town could work with funding providers to
              create a downtown banking consortium that will commit financing and counseling on how
              to obtain further financing for buildings, expansion, equipment, and cash flow
              management.
        4.    Preserve historic buildings. The Town could establish a program for historic building
              restoration and preservation in accordance with a specific plan for the downtown area.
Tourism
Tourism should be developed as another way to strengthen the Town’s economy. Creation and
enhancement of cultural, entertainment, and recreational activities and facilities in Loomis will attract
the tourist and, therefore, positively affect sales tax revenue. Activities and special events by various
special interest, cultural, and ethnic groups should be encouraged to create a regional draw of individuals
to the community. Promotion of the Town’s historic character and attractions, and the installation of
music and art in public places, should be encouraged to attract tourists. Also, the Town could capitalize
on it’s freeway visibility and access to lure travelers between the San Francisco Bay Area and the Tahoe
Region into its shops, restaurants, entertainment complexes, and lodging facilities.
        Tourism Policies
        Tourism policies include the following:
        1.    Create promotional materials. The town could develop a promotional brochure
              describing Town points of interest, restaurants, specialty shops, and annual special events.
                                                     58
                                                                                                  July 2001

Loomis General Plan                                           Community Development - Economic Development
       2.     Support local museums, art, and cultural events. Growth in tourism can be encouraged
              by supporting the programs and events of historic places of interest and entertainment
              throughout the community. This can be accomplished through support from the Town and
              the Chamber, and by coordinating events/exhibits with additional interest groups such as
              the Loomis Basin Historical Society.
       3.     Create and increase support of local special events. Support existing special events in
              Town, develop related events that coincide with current events, and create new events that
              emphasize the historic character of the Town.
       4.     Capitalize on the freeway location. The town could promote development of retail,
              office, entertainment, travel, and other facilities that capitalize on the freeway visibility and
              access to Loomis.
C.     Implementation and Monitoring Measures
The following programs are recommended to achieve the major goals and implement the supporting
policies:
Statistics and Data
1.     Collect and analyze economic and demographic data provided through Town surveys as well as
       the Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG), Sacramento Area Commerce and
       Trade Organization (SACTO), Placer County Economic Development Office, various state
       departments, the census bureau and other federal departments, and other sources. Information
       needs to be readily available to brokers, developers, market consultants, and site locators to
       promote Loomis economic development.
2.     Track employment trends with information available through the Employment Development
       Department for use in site location proposals and for information and referral by the Town.
3.     Track Loomis business inventory, statistics, and markets through surveys, a business license
       program, or other means.
Marketing and Promotion
4.     Develop a marketing plan because none of the economic development programs will work
       effectively without considerable promotion of the Town’s goals, strategies, and location as a
       desirable community. Program advertising and marketing will require professional assistance
       from an outside consultant or public relations firm to create such a plan. Once a plan is created,
       implementation will require a coordinated and combined effort of the Town, the Chamber,
       Economic Development Commission, and others.
5.     Create an economic development identity symbol, theme, and logo, which will also require
       professional assistance. Having professional presentation of information with a recognizable
       coordinated look demonstrates that the Town takes itself and its program seriously. Start by
       using existing themes (“Welcome to Loomis, a Friendly Old Fashioned Rural Community” and
       “A Small Town is Like a Big Family”) or working off those themes.
                                                    59
                                                                                                     July 2001

Loomis General Plan                                         Community Development - Economic Development
6.     Create marketing materials, including videos, brochures, fact sheets, maps, Internet web sites,
       and other appropriate tools. Information is needed on transportation, labor market, housing,
       education, recreation, cultural facilities and events, and other topics. Data is also needed on
       specific available sites for development, a description of the permitting process, and a list of
       existing businesses in Loomis, surrounding cities, and Placer County. A profile of the Town
       Council and staff needs to be developed to emphasize the stability of local government and the
       Town’s can-do attitude.
7.     Promote the high-end, up-scale, large-lot type of housing that is somewhat unique to Loomis to
       attract the executive decision-maker to the area.
Town Staff and Processes
8.     Review Town and County regulatory processes that affect business retention, expansion, and
       attraction. This should be done with the objective to determine how to best provide assistance to
       businesses in processing development approvals, expansion plans, and other land use issues.
9.     Create a staff training program to identify and act on economic development opportunities. The
       impression made by each contact with a Town employee can be far-reaching, and virtually every
       Town department touches and affects economic development. Because attitudes and perceptions
       about the Town are formed from the moment a business comes in contact with any Town
       employee, program, or regulation, a training program to alert Town staff to economic
       development issues is necessary to maintain a Town-wide awareness and consistent message.
10.    A high priority for the Town and an integral part of Town orientation and routine training
       programs should be customer service training. Customer service training is a natural complement
       to economic development training in order to create awareness and a problem solving, can do
       attitude among Town employees.
11.    Create special development teams for fast reaction to unique opportunities. A team drawing from
       all Town disciplines/departments can be established to review plans and provide an expedited
       process when unique circumstances warrant.
12.    Streamline the permitting process to reduce both the costs and the time required to go through the
       process. Streamlining the permitting process embraces all of the strategic goals, including better
       communication, improved customer service, commitment by employees, and staying competitive.
        Streamlining does not necessarily mean relaxing requirements or reducing fees; it does mean
       making it easier for the customer to understand and, therefore, easier to complete.
13.    Create an economic development internship program whereby interns from Sacramento State
       University, UC Davis, Sierra College, and other local colleges can help the Town implement
       economic development programs.
Land Use
13.    Maintain a supply of “ready-to-go” commercial and industrial sites in appropriate sizes,
       configurations, and locations. Establish flexible zoning guidelines and appropriately zoned areas
       prior to receipt of development applications.
                                                    60

Loomis General Plan                                         Community Development - Economic Development
14.    Ensure compatibility with land use designations and proposed uses. For example, uses that help
       to create a destination and stopover environment, including shopping and entertainment
       opportunities, should be the focus for commercial development south of I-80. These types of
       uses in this area must also complement, and even promote, the economic viability of the
       downtown. As another example, uses that would thrive in and encourage further development of
       a self-contained, campus-like character to the business park area designated along the railroad
       northeast of Sierra College Blvd and Taylor Road.
15.    Focus on substantial sales tax generators that would co-exist with existing retail, rather than
       small, unrelated, independent office-type structures. Also, focus on attracting industrial users
       with point-of-sale operations.
Other
16.    Assist local merchants and business organizations interested in forming business improvement
       districts and help them promote a definable identity for specific commercial areas through
       coordinated signage, landscaping, and entry/identity symbols.
17.    Institute a monitoring program that tracks specific initiatives and outcomes, business contacts and
       follow-up requirements, land use data and development status, retail sales and sales tax targets
       (including sales tax revenues as a percentage of total Town revenues), and other criteria to
       measure the success of the economic development element.
18.    Evaluate the benefits of establishing a redevelopment project area and agency to provide
       additional funding to accomplish economic development in selected areas.

IV. Circulation
A.     Introduction
Purpose
This chapter constitutes the circulation element of the General Plan. Information is presented regarding
near-term and long-term circulation conditions, with and without implementation of the General Plan.
This chapter also presents goals and policies related to circulation, and it defines a preferred
transportation system that reflects the Town’s financial resources and broader goals.
Circulation System Development
The preferred circulation system was developed in three major steps:
·      Analysis of Existing Conditions and Future Baseline Conditions – extensive data was collected,
       and calculations prepared, to summarize the condition of the existing transportation system and
       evaluate future conditions under this General Plan (i.e., future baseline conditions) without
       physical improvements.
·      Formulation of Transportation Goals & Policies – the General Plan committee selected service
       level policies and improvement standards to address existing and future transportation needs.
·      Preferred Transportation System - the preferred land use plan was evaluated in combination with
       the goals and policies to identify a preferred transportation system (including costs and phasing).
B.     Existing Conditions
This section provides an assessment of the existing transportation system (based upon 1998 data).
Roadway System
The following are descriptions of the major roadways serving the Town of Loomis:
Taylor Road - is a major arterial from Eureka Road in Roseville paralleling Interstate 80 (I-80) through
Rocklin, Loomis, Penryn, and Newcastle, and terminating at State Route 193 (SR 193) near Auburn.
Taylor Road has one lane in each direction within Loomis.
Horseshoe Bar Road - is an east-west arterial from Taylor Road to Folsom Lake in unincorporated
Placer County. Horseshoe Bar Road has one lane in each direction.
King Road - is an east-west arterial from Del Mar Avenue across I-80 to beyond Folsom-Auburn Road.
King Road has one lane in each direction.
Sierra College Boulevard - is a major arterial from SR 193, south through Loomis, Rocklin, and
Roseville, and into Sacramento County, where it becomes Hazel Avenue. Sierra College Boulevard has
one lane in each direction from SR 193 to south of I-80.
                                                    63
                                                                                                 July 2001

Loomis General Plan                                                                           Circulation
Barton Road - is a north-south arterial from Brace Road into Granite Bay in unincorporated Placer
County. Barton Road has one lane in each direction.
Brace Road - is an east-west arterial from Sierra College Boulevard across I-80 to Horseshoe Bar Road.
Brace Road has one lane in each direction.
Swetzer Road - is a two-lane collector street from King Road to beyond the Town Limits.
Table 4-1 summarizes the existing number of travel lanes, posted speed limit, travel lane and shoulder
widths, and pavement condition of these roadways.
Posted speed limits range from 25 miles per hour on roadways with fronting residences such as
Bankhead Road to 55 miles per hour on limited-access major arterials such as Sierra College Boulevard.
 Pavement condition was rated as good, fair, or poor depending on the frequency of potholes, cracks, and
pavement overlays. The Town’s Pavement Management Plan identified $2.9 million in improvements
needed on existing roads in 2000.
Traffic counts were conducted by Fehr & Peers Associates in June, 1998 where necessary to
complement the 1996 and 1997 count data from the Shadowbrook EIR and the Downtown Loomis
Parking and Circulation Study. The segments of Taylor Road and Horseshoe Bar Road near the
downtown area and Sierra College Boulevard near Taylor Road carry the greatest volumes of traffic
(between 9,000 and 14,000 vehicles per day). Traffic volumes on King Road, Swetzer Road, Webb
Street, Barton Road, Laird Road, and Brace Road range from approximately 1,000 to 5,000 vehicles per
day. Table 4-2 summarizes the daily volume-to-capacity ratio for each roadway (based on capacities
used by the City of Sacramento and Sacramento County).
Figure 4-1 displays AM and PM peak hour turning movement volumes, lane configurations, and traffic
control devices at key intersections within the Town of Loomis. Traffic counts were conducted by Fehr
& Peers Associates where necessary in June, 1998 to complement the 1996 and 1997 counts from the
Shadowbrook EIR and the Downtown Loomis Parking and Circulation Study. As shown, traffic signals
are located on Taylor Road at Sierra College Boulevard, Horseshoe Bar Road, and King Road. Traffic
signals are also located at the I-80/Sierra College Boulevard eastbound and westbound ramps
intersections and at the I-80/Horseshoe Bar Road westbound ramps intersection. The remaining study
intersections are stop-controlled on the side-street approach.

Peak hour intersection operations were evaluated by computing the level of service (LOS) at each
intersection. Level of service is a term that describes the operating performance of an intersection or
roadway, and is reported on a scale from A to F, with A representing the best performance and F
representing the worst. Table 4-3 relates the operational characteristics associated with service level
category.

Intersections were analyzed using the methodology contained in the Highway Capacity Manual - Special
Report 209 (Transportation Research Board, 1994). This methodology determines the level of service
by computing the average delay per vehicle and comparing the results to the thresholds shown in Table
4-3. Table 4-4 shows the existing AM and PM peak hour levels of service at each intersection.

Table 4-4 shows that each intersection currently operates at LOS C or better during the AM and PM
peak hours with the exception of the Taylor Road/King Road intersection, which operates at LOS D
during the AM peak hour. Field observations indicate that this intersection actually operates at LOS E
or F during the peak 30 minutes in the morning when school is in session. To avoid this congested
intersection, many motorists use Webb Street to travel between northwest Loomis and the downtown
area.
Although the Taylor Road/Horseshoe Bar Road intersection operates at LOS C or better during each
peak hour, field observations indicated significant queuing of northbound right-turn vehicles (queues
extended beyond Laird Street), eastbound through vehicles, and westbound left-turn vehicles (queues
exceeded the available turn lane storage).
Sierra College Boulevard, Taylor Road, and Horseshoe Bar Road (north of I-80) carry the greatest
volume of truck traffic in Loomis. Traffic counts conducted in September 1997 revealed that the
segments of Taylor Road and Horseshoe Bar Road through the downtown area carried about 400 to 450
trucks (three or more axles) per day. This represents between two and four percent of all traffic on these
roadways. With the exception of Sierra College Boulevard, none of the roadways within Loomis are
posted as truck routes. King Road has “Not a Truck Route” signs, while Brace Road has signs
indicating truck weight restrictions.

The presence of the Union Pacific Railroad tracks limits access between northwest Loomis and the
downtown area. At-grade crossings are currently provided at King Road, Webb Street, and Sierra
College Boulevard. Union Pacific Railroad representatives and the Loomis Fire Protection District are
concerned about the close spacing (about 1,000 feet) of the railroad crossings at Webb Street and King
Road. Given that trains frequently exceed 1,000 feet in length, it is possible that a slow moving or
stopped train could simultaneously block the Webb Street and King Road at-grade crossings. The
primary connections between southeast Loomis and the downtown area (i.e., across I-80) are Horseshoe
Bar Road and Brace Road. These two roads have narrow travel lanes and little or no paved shoulders,
which limits travel speeds for emergency vehicles.
Bus Service
Public bus service is provided to the Loomis area by Placer County Transit. The Loomis-Penryn Shuttle
interconnects Loomis, Penryn, Lincoln, and Sierra College in Rocklin. This route has stops within
Loomis at Taylor Road/King Road, Flag Stop (at Stahr Liquor Store), Del Oro High School, and Raleys.
  Service is provided between 6:30 AM and 4:15 PM, Monday through Friday, with four stops per day.
Loomis is also served by the Auburn-Roseville Express Shuttle, which runs from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM
Monday through Friday, and 10:00 AM to 6 PM on Saturday. This service operates with one-hour
headways (the time between bus pick-ups/drop-offs).
Bicycle/Pedestrian System
The existing bicycle system consists of a series of Class I (off-street trails) and Class II (on-street lanes
with guide signs and pavement marking) bike lanes on major arterials. A Class I bike trail exists on the
south side of Taylor Road between King Road and Del Oro High School. A short portion of King Road
east of Bankhead Road also features a Class I bike trail. Class II bike lanes are provided on the
following roadways:
·       Sierra College Boulevard (both sides) between Granite Drive and Del Mar Avenue;
·       Taylor Road (both sides) between Sierra College Boulevard and Oak Street;
·       Taylor Road (south side) between Oak Street and Webb Street; and
·       King Road between Sierra College Boulevard and I-80.
Pedestrian facilities are located sporadically throughout the Loomis area. Sidewalks are provided on
sections of Sierra College Boulevard, King Road, Taylor Road, Horseshoe Bar Road, and Swetzer Road,
generally in locations where development has occurred. Crosswalks are provided at the four signalized
intersections in Loomis and at numerous other unsignalized locations throughout the Town.
Rail Service
Existing train traffic through Loomis uses two tracks: westbound traffic uses the tracks adjacent to
Taylor Road, while eastbound traffic uses the tracks near Sierra College Boulevard. Switching
improvements may be made in the Loomis area so that passenger rail service will use the Taylor Road
tracks for both directions of travel. The historic train station at the terminus of Horseshoe Bar Road is a
possible location for future passenger service.
The existing Capitol Corridor train service provides four trains per day in each direction between
Sacramento and San Jose. Two trains per day extend east from Sacramento with stops in Roseville,
Rocklin, Auburn, and Colfax. In the near future, passenger rail service may be expanded to include
Loomis and Newcastle.

                                        excessive by many for pedestrian/bicycle safety.
 Taylor Road east of the downtown       Poor pavement condition and narrow travel lanes and shoulders results in

 Intersections
 Taylor Road/Horseshoe Bar Road         Significant delays occur on three of the four approaches due to heavy
 Intersection                           traffic volumes and inefficient signal timing.
 Taylor Road/King Road Intersection     Significant delays occur in the morning when school is in session.
                                        Insufficient turn lane storage contributes to delays.
 Sierra College Boulevard/Brace Road    Lack of left-turn bays on Sierra College Boulevard and a traffic signal

C.      Future Conditions
This section provides an assessment of future transportation conditions assuming build-out of this
General Plan land uses and Year 2020 development in the surrounding region. This “future baseline“
condition establishes the need for the improvements identified in the subsequent sections.
Planned Transportation Improvements and Land Use Growth
Future (2020) baseline conditions assume buildout of this General Plan and projected development in
surrounding communities through 2020. It also assumes the following transportation improvements (as
listed in the 1996 Draft Placer County Regional Transportation Plan):
·       Widen Sierra College Boulevard to six lanes immediately north of I-80, and to four lanes north
               of Taylor Road;
·       Reconstruct the I-80/Sierra College Boulevard interchange;
·       Widen I-80 from a six-lane to an eight-lane freeway east and west of Horseshoe Bar Road;
·       Install bicycle lanes on Taylor Road from Midas Avenue (in Rocklin) to Sierra College
               Boulevard and from King Road to the Loomis Town Limits; and
·       Attempt to provide passenger rail service in Loomis.
The City of Rocklin 2020 traffic model, which covers the entire Sacramento region, was utilized to
obtain future traffic forecasts because this model contains more zonal and roadway network detail than
the other available models (SACMET, PCTPA models). The future land uses within Loomis were
modified to reflect buildout of this General Plan.
Future Travel Forecasts
Figure 4-2 shows the average daily travel demands for Year 2020 conditions. Sierra College Boulevard
is projected to carry between 17,100 vehicles per day south of King Road to 40,500 vehicles per day
near the southern Town limits. This is an approximate three-fold increase over existing traffic that is
primarily attributable to new developments, such as Twelve Bridges, Whitney Oaks, and Clover Valley
Lakes planned in the surrounding communities. Traffic volumes on Taylor Road will range from about
11,500 vehicles per day near the north Town limits to about 18,200 vehicles per day through the
downtown area. Traffic volumes on King Road, Swetzer Road, Webb Street, Barton Road, Laird Road,
and Brace Road are expected to range from 2,500 to 11,400 vehicles per day.
Table 4-6 summarizes the daily volume-to-capacity ratio for the major roadways assuming no physical
improvements. This table shows that projected volumes will exceed the capacity on the segments of
Taylor Road, Sierra College Boulevard, and Horseshoe Bar Road if these roads are not improved.

  Bicycle Facilities in General       Bicycle facilities are sparse throughout the Town, and increased population
                                      and popularity of bicycle travel will create the need for additional facilities.

D.      Issues, Goals, Policies, and Implementation Measures
The policies presented here cover a broad range of topic areas and were derived, in part, from existing
policies currently in place in Loomis and other nearby jurisdictions. The General Plan Steering
Committee provided direction on the content of the policies covering the following topics:
        Level of service,
        Roadway improvement standards,
        Sidewalks,
        Bicycle routes,
        Transit service,
        Neighborhood environment, and
        Roadway system funding.
Level of Service
Issue: Growth in traffic volumes from development approved within, and adjacent to, the Town will
cause increased congestion and need for roadway improvements, depending upon the chosen service
level standard.
Goal: To strive for service levels that reflect a balance between mobility, cost-effectiveness, and
financial resources.
        Level of Service policy: In order to minimize congestion, maintain Level of Service C on all
        roads and intersections within the Town of Loomis. Level of Service D may be allowed in
        conjunction with development approved within the Town as an exception to this standard, at the
        intersections of King and Taylor, Horseshoe Bar Road and Taylor, Horseshoe Bar Road and I-80,
        Sierra College and Brace Road, and Webb and Taylor, when:
        1.     The deficiency is substantially caused by “through” traffic, which neither begins nor ends
               in Loomis, and is primarily generated by non-residents; or
        2.     The deficiency will be temporary (less than three years), and a fully-funded plan is in place
               to provide the improvements needed to remedy the substandard condition.
        Mitigation of impacts from unincorporated area projects. Notwithstanding any other
        General Plan policy or provisions, in the event that significant adverse impacts will result from
        the construction of large developments on the Town’s perimeter, the Town shall make every
        reasonable effort to have the developers adequately mitigate the adverse impacts.

Roadway Improvement Standards
Issue: Many roadway improvements will be needed during the life of the General Plan and design
standards are needed to ensure consistency and quality.
Goal: To develop standards that protect public safety and provide mobility for all forms of
transportation.
       Roadway improvement policy: Roadway improvements within the Town of Loomis shall
       conform to the roadway classification system and improvement standards specified in the current
       version of the Town of Loomis Design & Improvement Standards after their adoption.
       Policy on character of roadway improvements: The design of Downtown roadway and
       streetscape improvements will continue to maintain the “small town downtown” character.
Implementation measure: The Town will develop and adopt road and street improvement and design
standards as funding permits.
Bicycle Facilities
Issue: Bicycle facilities are limited in Loomis. Provisions to increase bicycle use will provide
recreational and mobility benefits to residents and reduce vehicular traffic.
Goal: To implement additional bicycle facilities that result in increased bicycle usage.
       Bicycle Facility Policies
       1.     The Town shall promote bicycle travel, as appropriate, and shall pursue all available
              sources of funding for the development and improvement of bicycle facilities.
       2.     Bicycle facilities shall be provided in compliance with the Placer County Bikeways Master
              Plan (Placer County Transportation Commission, 1988) or subsequent amended versions
              of that document, as well as on other appropriate routes at the discretion of the Town
              Council.
Transit Service
Issue: Transit service is limited within the Town, providing little incentive for its use and limited
options for transit-dependent persons.
Goal: To devote resources for the promotion of transit service that are appropriate for its size and
financial resources using comparable cities as a benchmark.
       Transit Service Policies
       1.     The Town will promote and support a safe, efficient, and coordinated public transit system
              that meets residents’ needs, reduces congestion, improves the environment, and helps
              provide a viable non-automotive means of transportation in and through the Town of
              Loomis.

Loomis General Plan                                                                            Circulation
        2.    The Town should work with Placer County Transit and other transit providers to plan and
              implement public transportation services within the Town that are timely, cost-effective,
              and responsive to growth patterns and transit demand.
              a.     Transit routes should conform to plans established by Placer County Transit, and
                     should generally coincide with major destinations for employment and shopping, the
                     location of major institutions, concentrations of multifamily housing, and other land
                     uses likely to attract public transit ridership.
              b.     Bus routes should follow major roads with service to residential neighborhoods via
                     collector streets.
              c.     Bus stops should be located in conformance with the applicable policies of Placer
                     County Transit.
        3.    The Town should consider the transit needs of senior, disabled, minority, low-income, and
              transit-dependent persons in making decisions regarding transit services and in compliance
              with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
        4.    The Town should support efforts to provide demand-responsive service (“paratransit”) and
              other transportation services for those unable to use conventional transit.
Neighborhood Environment
Issue: Increased development within, and adjacent to the Town, creates possibility for traffic intrusion
into residential neighborhoods.
Goal: To take actions to minimize cut-thru traffic and manage speeds on residential streets.
        Neighborhood Environment Policies:
        1.    The Town shall create and maintain a street system which protects residential
              neighborhoods from unnecessary levels of traffic, while providing for logical traffic
              circulation.
        2.    The Town shall design streets and approve development in such a manner as to prevent
              and eliminate high traffic flows and parking problems within residential neighborhoods.
        3.    The Town shall promote the development of a circulation system that preserves the historic
              nature and character of neighborhoods and districts, and reinforces neighborhood identity
              and integrity.
        4.    New local streets shall be designed to promote the interconnection of residential
              neighborhoods while simultaneously discouraging through-traffic within residential
              neighborhoods.
        5.    The Town of Loomis shall establish and maintain a procedure through which local
              residents can receive assistance in managing and reducing traffic flows through their
              residential neighborhoods. Such assistance could be technical, the provision of equipment
              (such as signs) and the labor needed to install such equipment, or the provision of
                                                      81
                                                                                                 July 2001

Loomis General Plan                                                                            Circulation
             enhanced police traffic enforcement in neighborhoods. The Town could also participate in
             modifying the existing street system to reduce or eliminate through traffic intrusion into
             residential neighborhoods. Such modifications could include installation of speed humps,
             traffic diverters, traffic circles, or a variety of other techniques. Based on the identified
             need and available financing, priorities will be established and an appropriate level of
             resources (including staff time, equipment, and physical improvements) will be committed
             by the Town.
       6.    If recommended by the Town Engineer after review, and if determined to be feasible, the
             Town should pursue the construction of a pedestrian bridge over Sierra College Boulevard
             to address safety impacts. The precise location of the crossing would be determined after
             further review.
Roadway System Funding
Issue: Transportation improvements are expensive and the Town has very limited financial resources.
Goal: To leverage the Town’s resources with outside funding sources (developer fees, state funds,
federal funds, etc.).
       Roadway System Funding Policies
       1.    The Town shall aggressively pursue state and federal funding to implement the primary
             elements of the Town’s Circulation Plan.
       2.    The Town shall require proposed new development projects to analyze their contribution
             to increased vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle traffic and to implement the roadway
             improvements necessary to address their impact.
       3.    The Town shall assess fees on new development sufficient to cover the fair share portion
             of development’s cumulative impacts on the local and regional transportation system. The
             cost of all on-site roadways within new development projects is the responsibility of the
             developer.
       4.    Prior to acceptance of new local streets by the Town, provisions shall be made for the
             ongoing maintenance of those facilities. Such provisions could include the establishment
             of a maintenance district covering the specific roadways identified, or assumption of all
             maintenance responsibilities by the pertinent homeowners association or other approved
             organization.

Roadway Maintenance
Issue: Financial constraints can lead to improper maintenance, which reduces the quality and longevity
of facilities.
Goal: To create a pavement management system that provides timely and accurate information about
how to use maintenance resources.
        Roadway Maintenance Policies
        1.     The Town shall assure that the transportation system continues to provide safe, efficient,
               and convenient access to its residents.
        2.     The Town shall provide dependable and adequate resources to maintain and repair the
               existing system of roads and bridges, according to priorities established on an annual basis.
        3.     The Town shall work with the Placer County Transportation Planning Agency (PCTPA) to
               ensure that the PCTPA’s Regional Transportation Plan is coordinated with the Town’s
               Capital Improvement Plan. This coordination will allow access to Federal and State funds,
               where possible, for road maintenance and improvements.

E.     Transportation System Improvements
This section presents capital improvements to the transportation system for the Town of Loomis. The
preferred system will need to be phased as the needs occur and the funding is available, as the proposed
circulation improvements are intended to support build-out conditions.
Roadway Network
Improvements to the roadway network are intended to address several future problems:
·      Insufficient capacity at several locations to support build-out of the Town and growth in the
       surrounding communities;
·      Excess “through” traffic and trucks along Taylor Road through the downtown;
·      A desire to create a more pedestrian-friendly environment in downtown; and
·      Safety issues related to vehicular traffic.
Downtown-Related Improvements
A focused study was conducted by the Town of Loomis in 1997 (Downtown Loomis Parking and
Circulation Study, Fehr & Peers Associates) to address parking and circulation conditions along Taylor
Road and a portion of Horseshoe Bar Road. This study evaluated several alternatives that were intended
to reduce traffic congestion, improve truck circulation, enhance pedestrian/bicycle circulation and safety,
and improve parking.
The 1997 downtown study used a combination of engineering analysis and public input to identify a
preferred circulation system. The public input consisted of:
·      a Technical Advisory Committee that provided general guidance;
·      extensive public opinion surveys;
·      two public workshops; and
·      a joint workshop of the Economic Development Commission, Planning Commission, and Town
       Council.
The primary elements of the preferred circulation system from the 1997 study are as follows:
       Swetzer Road Extension (Figure 4-3) – is the construction of a two-lane roadway from King
       Road to Sierra College Boulevard immediately north of the Union Pacific Railroad tracks. This
       improvement would be largely within the railroad right-of-way in an area that cannot be
       developed with buildings due to its proximity to the tracks.
       Boyington Road Extension (Figure 4-3) – is the construction of a two-lane freeway frontage
       road from King Road to Horseshoe Bar Road north of the Raley’s Shopping Center, with a short
       extension to connect with Walnut Street. The structural improvements will include two traffic
       lanes, bike lanes on both sides, and parkway strip landscaping and sidewalks on both sides,
       within a 70-foot wide right-of-way. The location/alignment of this extension will be determined
       at the time subdivision or other development of the presently vacant properties is proposed.
                                                    84
                                                                                                 July 2001

Loomis General Plan                                                                              Circulation
        Miscellaneous Core Improvements (Figure 4-4) – consists of a series of localized
        improvements on Taylor Road that are designed to improve local circulation and parking. Some
        of the key elements include:
        ·      visual gateways on Taylor Road that all serve a traffic calming function;
        ·      modifications to the Horseshoe Bar/Taylor intersection to provide an “uninterrupted” right-
               turn from Horseshoe Bar Road to Taylor Road;
        ·      a one-way circulation system to/from the new train depot with on-street parking, bus
               turnout, and drop-off facility;
        ·      a pedestrian/local traffic only facility adjacent to the fruit sheds (between Walnut Street
               and Horseshoe Bar Road);
        ·      continuous bike lane on Taylor Road throughout the downtown; and
        ·      new traffic signals on Taylor road at Webb Street, Walnut Avenue, and Circle Drive.
Other Improvements
Figure 4-5 shows other improvements anticipated to be needed at build-out of this General Plan. Most
of the improvements are safety and/or operational related (such as providing paved shoulders, turning
lanes, or signals). However, some roads will need additional through lanes for capacity:
·       Sierra College Boulevard – 4 lanes north of Bankhead Road and 6 lanes south of Bankhead.
·       Horseshoe Bar Road – 4 lanes from Boyington Road Extension to the southern edge of
        commercial development. The Horseshoe Bar Road/I-80 interchange will also undergo
        improvement, with the specific details (number of lanes, ramp configurations, etc.) determined by
        a future Project Study Report.
·       Rocklin Road – 4 lanes from Sierra College Boulevard to Barton Road, and 2 lanes from Barton
        Road to the east, possibly connecting with Laird Road along an alignment north of existing
        Rocklin Road. The exact alignment will be determined at a future date.
King Road should be improved to provide turning lanes at major cross-streets. The portion of
Horseshoe Bar Road between Taylor and the Boyington Road Extension should also be improved to
provide a continuous turn lane along with curb, gutter, and sidewalk. Taylor Road (east of King Road)
should be improved to provide turning lanes at major cross-streets and curb, gutter, and sidewalk.
The Sierra College Boulevard interchange will need to be widened and improved.
Some widening of the Taylor Road/King Road intersection will likely be needed depending upon the
enrollment and operation of the adjacent Loomis Grammar School and Del Oro High School. Brace
Road, Barton Road, and Bankhead Road will all warrant upgrades that provide for standard lane widths
and paved shoulders.
Several intersections will likely warrant signalization and/or turning lanes. Figure 4-5 identifies some of
the more likely locations, but the identified locations are neither definitive nor exhaustive.
The Town may consider an interchange at King Road and Interstate 80 in the future.
Residents have been concerned about “through” traffic on Del Mar Avenue and the incentives for
additional through traffic will increase as travel times increase on Sierra College Boulevard and Taylor
Road. In response, the Town will evaluate the potential for the closure of Del Mar Avenue within one
month of the adoption of this updated General Plan.

Bicycle/Pedestrian Facilities
The following are the recommended bicycle facility improvements (Figure 4-6) to complement or
upgrade the existing system:
·       Provide westbound on-street bike lane (Class II) on Taylor Road from King Road to Oak Street
        to match existing eastbound facility;
·       Provide on-street (Class II) facilities on Taylor Road (from King Road to eastern Town Limits
        and Sierra College Boulevard to western Town Limits), Sierra College Boulevard (within entire
        Town Limits), Rocklin Road (within entire Town Limits), Horseshoe Bar Road (from the
        Tourist/Destination Commercial designation south of I-80 to the Boyington Road extension); and
·       Provide on-street (Class III) facilities on Bankhead Road (King to Sierra College), Saunders
        Avenue (Bankhead to eastern limit), South Walnut/Stone Road, Brace Road, and Laird Road. In
        most cases, these facilities will consist of paved shoulders and appropriate signage.
Sidewalks should be made continuous along Taylor Road, Sierra College Boulevard, King Road, and
Horseshoe Bar Road. The policy section of the Circulation Element provides a description of the
Town’s policy regarding sidewalks on new roadways.
Transit Service
Only one capital improvement is planned with respect to transit; namely, the revitalization of the rail
station near Horseshoe Bar Road and Taylor Road. Improvements to the platform, station, circulation,
and parking facilities are desirable. Figure 4-4A shows the conceptual circulation system. While
passenger rail service is not imminent, this facility will become a future “hub” of transit service (both
rail and bus) in Loomis.
Table 4-8 summarizes the probable timing and estimated cost for transportation-related capital
improvements.

Introduction
Overview of the Housing Element
The information in this Chapter excerpts the key policy information from the 1993 update of the
Housing Element of the General Plan for the Town of Loomis. The California Government Code
(Sections 65580 and following) requires that each City and County review and update its Housing
Element according to an update schedule established by the California State Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD).
The purpose of the Housing Element is to analyze housing needs for all income levels and housing types
and provide a detailed plan to create housing opportunities. The goals of the Plan are based on the
Regional Housing Allocation Plan for the Sierra Planning Organizations, and on local policies, which
contribute to the development of safe and adequate housing for the existing and future residents of the
Town of Loomis.
Organization and Content of the Housing Element
The format of the Housing Element closely follows the Housing Element Guidelines published by the
State of California, Department of Housing and Community Development. The basic requirements of a
Housing Element are addressed and organized into the following major areas:
·      A review and performance evaluation of the most recent 1987 Housing Element. In this section,
       the previously adopted housing goals will be reviewed along with an evaluation of progress in
       meeting goals.
·      An assessment of housing needs based on demographic data for the area, including an assessment
       of specialized housing needs to address special populations such as the homeless.
·      An inventory of land resources including vacant land, zoning and actions to increase housing
       supply.
·      A discussion of constraints and barriers to the development of new housing opportunities.
·      A discussion of efforts and possibilities to make housing more energy efficient.
·      A statement of housing goals including quantitative goals based on the Regional Housing
       Allocation Plan.
·      A brief discussion of possibilities for low and moderate income housing funds generated by
       Redevelopment Agencies pursuant to the Community Redevelopment Act. The Town of Loomis
       does not currently have an adopted redevelopment area.
·      A brief discussion of strategies to preserve existing assisted housing, including conversions or
       "opt outs". Currently, the Town of Loomis has no existing assisted housing that is threatened.
                                                   98
                                                                                              July 2001

Loomis General Plan                                                                               Housing
·       Housing policies and recommendations to be adopted and pursued as part of the Housing
        Element Update.
·       An implementation program and schedule.
All the above components except for the Housing Element policies, and implementation program and
schedule can be found in the Background Report. The policies, implementation programs and schedule
follow.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
State Planning Law requires that all elements of the General Plan be internally consistent to avoid policy
conflicts. The recommendations of this Housing Element are consistent with and support the adopted
General Plan.
This Housing Element is also consistent with the Regional Housing Allocation Plan for the region and
also reflects the appropriate research and conclusions of the recently prepared Placer County Housing
Element.
Housing Element Goals, Policies, and Programs
This section describes the proposed goals, policies and programs which the Town of Loomis will
endorse and pursue to implement the Regional Housing Assistance Plan Goals. To the extent possible,
the goals, policies and programs mirror many of the policies of the Placer County Housing Element in
order to ensure regional consistency and to allow for coordination of resources and approaches. In
addition, housing goals and objectives by program are quantified.
The Regional Housing Allocation Plan sets numeric goals by income type for each jurisdiction to seek to
achieve. In the Housing Element the housing needs, resources and opportunities for the Town of
Loomis have been considered. Programs are suggested in these policies which support the numeric
goals and respond to the needs identified by the Town of Loomis. In general, the Town of Loomis has
relatively high household sizes and relatively high proportion of family housing need. An additional
trend is a substantial increase in single parent households with children. A second emerging trend is the
need for senior housing based on the increase in senior households over the last decade. Based on these
findings, it is recommended that the Town of Loomis pursue both additional family housing for all
income levels and senior housing.
For very low income and low income households financial subsidies will be required. Since Federal and
State housing assistance changes over time, recommendations are made based on current types of
programs available. Certainly if future programs become available, the policies support exploration of
these programs.
For very low and low income family housing, a combination of rehabilitation and new construction
program is recommended. New construction programs which could serve very low and low income
family housing needs include: Self-help housing, manufactured housing, townhouses or duplexes and
second units. As noted through-out the Element, to meet very low income needs, State and Federal
assistance will be required.

Similarly, for senior housing a combination of rehabilitation and construction program is recommended.
 New construction programs include second homes or carriage units, and new townhouse or apartment
development.

A.1.3 The Town will continue to implement the permit assistance program for residential projects
       including pre-application meetings, flexibility in lot size as allowed under the new zoning
       ordinance amendments, and streamlining of second residential unit approval process.
       Responsible Entity:     Town Planner
       Timeframe:              1994
       Desired Result:         Approval of the proposed amendments to the Zoning Ordinance to
                               streamline the processing of Second Residential Units and
                               implementation of the recently adopted amendments which allow small
                               lot subdivisions.
A.1.4 The Town Planner and Planning Commission will establish a procedure for giving highest
       priority in the review process to low income housing projects.
       Responsible Entity:     Town Planner and Planning Commission

       allow detached secondary units when such units are located above a garage or similar accessory
       building on lots less than 1.0 acre where appropriate services are available and the impacts on
       neighborhood character are not significant. The ordinance will provide specific guidance as to
       the circumstances in which detached second units are acceptable. The Town will identify
       existing "illegal" second homes through the Housing Conditions Survey and consider a
       "grandfather" clause or legal nonconforming use provision to preserve these units.

Loomis General Plan                                                    Public Services, Facilities, and Finance
VI. Public Services, Facilities, and Finance
Public services include administrative services (Town government administration, permitting,
inspection, etc.), road maintenance, police and fire protection, emergency medical service and
ambulance, school, libraries, water supply, sewage collection, treatment and disposal, drainage and flood
control, and solid waste collection and disposal. Road maintenance issues are addressed in the
Circulation Element, and park facility and recreation program issues are addressed in the Parks and
Recreation Element.
As noted in Section 5 of the General Plan Update Technical Background Report, municipal services are
provided Loomis residents by a variety of separate agencies, with only administrative services and road
maintenance being provided by the Town itself. The Town contracts with the Placer County Sheriff’s
Department for law enforcement services. Fire protection and emergency medical services are provided
by the Loomis Fire Protection District, Penryn Fire District, South Placer Fire District, and/or the
California Department of Forestry, depending on the location of a fire within the Town. The school
facilities serving Loomis residents are provided by the Placer Union High School District, and Loomis
Union School District. The Loomis Branch Library is part of the Auburn-Placer County Library system.
  The areas of the Town where a public water system is available are served by the Placer County Water
Agency (the areas not served presently rely on private, on-site wells). Sewage collection, treatment and
disposal services are provided by the South Placer Municipal Utility District in areas of the Town where
the facilities have been installed; residents in other areas rely upon on-site sewage disposal systems.
Drainage facilities within the Town are maintained by the Town itself, and the Placer County Flood
Control and Water Conservation District is responsible for developing flood control management
strategies within the County. Solid waste management services are provided by the Auburn Placer
Disposal Service to households that choose to subscribe to the service; and the Western Placer Waste
Management Authority provides the Western Regional Sanitary Landfill (WRSL) disposal site.
Public Services Issues
·       Many non-residential and rural residential lots on the periphery of the Town use septic systems
        and well water. Increasing development under these conditions may degrade ground water
        quality.
·       Some of the Town’s public school facilities are over permanent capacity and in need of
        modernization efforts.
Goals
1.      To achieve and maintain high levels of public services and facilities for Loomis residents, when
        appropriate through coordination with outside service agencies.
2.      To assist local school districts as feasible in providing adequate educational facilities for Loomis
        students, and cooperate in developing joint community and recreational uses.

Loomis General Plan                                                    Public Services, Facilities, and Finance
Policies
1.     Loomis will work toward achieving and maintaining acceptable levels of municipal services,
       including public safety, roadway maintenance, and administrative services. Loomis will
       cooperate with regional public service agencies to attain adequate service levels for water
       distribution, sewerage services, flood management, and solid waste collection.
2.     Non-residential and higher density residential development shall not be expanded into areas
       lacking public services infrastructure until existing vacant land with these services within the
       Town limits is utilized, or proposed development ensures the extension of necessary
       infrastructure through actual construction or payment of fees.
3.     Loomis shall work with the school districts (Placer Union High School District and Loomis
       Union School District) in reviewing district land use decisions involving the provision of
       adequate educational facilities for Loomis students.
4.     Proposed development shall be connected to public water supply and sewage disposal systems as
       follows:
       a.    Any dwelling unit proposed within 300 feet of existing community water supply or sewage
             disposal service shall be connected to that service prior to occupancy, except where the
             Town Manager determines that connection is infeasible because of elevation differences or
             insufficient line capacity. The 300-foot distance shall be measured from the property line of
             the subject parcel that is nearest to the existing water supply or sewage disposal service.
       b.    All development proposed in nonresidential land use designations shall be connected to the
             community water supply and sewage disposal systems prior to occupancy.
       c.    Residential subdivisions proposing parcels of 2.2 acres or less shall be connected to the
             community water supply and sewage disposal systems prior to occupancy.
5.     Loomis shall continue to work with the Town’s solid waste collector (Auburn Placer Disposal
       Service) in improving the recycling program within the Town.
6.     The Town should support source reduction and recycling efforts through the use of recycled
       products in all Town departments, whenever economically and technically feasible.
7.     If in the future adequate landfill space cannot be found to meet the Town’s needs, no new
       development shall be approved until such time as adequate landfill space is identified.
8.     New construction and reconstruction/restoration shall consider energy conservation in the
       selection of building materials, building orientation, and landscaping.
9.     The Town shall identify the potential for energy conservation measures for the use of renewable
       energy sources and alternatives to fossil fuels.
10.    The Town shall actively participate in the energy conservation programs of the local, state, and
       federal agencies.
11.    The Town shall consider the use of alternative energy sources for all public facilities.

Loomis General Plan                                                    Public Services, Facilities, and Finance
Local Finance Issues
·      The increased levels of public and community services desired by community residents are
       dependant on property and sales tax revenues, the Town’s primary sources of discretionary
       General Fund revenues.
·      Certain types of proposed development may not generate sufficient municipal revenues (e.g.,
       property taxes, sales taxes, transient occupancy tax, etc.) to pay for the cost of the public services
       the development may require.
·      The fact that Loomis is served by several special districts and agencies that assess their own
       taxes and fees aside from the Town, means that all agencies providing public facilities and
       services within the Town compete, to some extent, for key revenues.
Goals
To maintain a fiscally healthy municipality, with new development contributing adequately to maintain
current levels of service.
Policies
1.     New development shall be required to contribute toward the maintenance of existing levels of
       public services and facilities--through fees, dedications, or other appropriate means.
2.     Loomis shall explicitly consider the fiscal impacts on the Town when making decisions about
       changes to municipal services or capital facilities that would likely result in increased Town staff
       levels. The Town Council shall make findings that these impacts were considered and that
       funding to support increased staff levels appears reasonably available in such cases.
3.     A fiscal impact analysis shall be required for proposed General Plan amendments.
4.     Loomis shall support the development of new commercial and industrial activities to increase the
       Town’s discretionary revenues (which provides funds for capital projects and improved
       municipal services), provided that the new land uses are consistent with the Town’s distinct, rural
       character.
Implementation Measures
Within one year of the adoption of this General Plan or as soon as possible, the Town will conduct a
study of its fees in relation to the costs to the Town of providing the services for which the fees are
charged, and will update its fees as determined by the Council to be appropriate.

Loomis General Plan                                                               Conservation of Resources
VII. Conservation of Resources
The residents of Loomis enjoy an attractive natural setting of gently rolling hills, oak woodlands, and
other tree and meadow areas. This setting provides most of the Town’s open space resources, as well as
a wide variety of other natural resources, including stream corridors, other wetlands, and wildlife habitat.
  The Town core also contains a number of historical buildings. These resources are described in detail
in Sections 3 (Natural Resources) and 4 (Open Space, Recreation, and Cultural Resources) of the
General Plan Background Report.
The Town’s open space resources include a limited number of park sites (see the Parks and Recreation
Element, page 50), but mostly manifest themselves as the expansive, low density areas in the Residential
Agricultural, Residential Estate and, to a lesser extent, the Rural Residential land use designations.
Within these areas, residential land uses are visually subordinate to the open feeling and character of the
semi-rural countryside. The goals and policies of this General Plan related to open space appear in the
following section, in the Land Use Element (beginning on page 33), and Parks and Recreation Element
(page 50).
Natural Resources and Open Space
Issues
·       Identifying ways to preserve open space areas and views is important in retaining the
        community’s rural atmosphere.
·       Loomis needs to strengthen Town requirements for protecting stream corridors and riparian
        habitat for wildlife and plant species, groundwater supplies, visual qualities, and recreational
        opportunities.
·       Development pressures suggest that Loomis consider rezoning some of its
        agricultural/residential land to increase land and infrastructure efficiency. However, residents
        have expressed their preference for the retention of large lot, rural residential parcels.
Goals
1.      To protect areas rich in wildlife of a fragile ecological nature, including areas of rare or
        endangered species and riparian areas, from land development impacts.
2.      To preserve, maintain, and enhance creeks and riparian areas for their aesthetic, wildlife habitat,
        and recreational values.
3.      To help protect groundwater and air quality within the Sacramento region.
4.      To protect major open space areas and natural features within the Town, including significant
        topography and rock outcroppings, oak woodlands and significant specimens of native trees.

                                                                                                  July 2001

Loomis General Plan                                                               Conservation of Resources
Policies
1.     Air quality. Loomis will contribute toward the attainment of State and Federal air quality
       standards in the Sacramento Valley Air Basin through the following, and other feasible measures.
       a.   Site preparation and development activities shall incorporate effective measures to minimize
            dust emissions and the emissions of pollutants by motorized construction equipment and
            vehicles.
       b.   During the review of development plans, the Town should require that project proponents
            conduct their own air quality analysis to determine air quality impacts and potential
            mitigation measures.
       c.   Local employers should be encouraged to consider flextime as a means of reducing peak
            morning and afternoon trips.
       d.   Recognizing that trees and other vegetation can provide a biological means of reducing air
            contaminants, existing trees should be retained and incorporated into project design
            wherever feasible. The additional planting of a large number of trees along roadways and in
            parking areas shall be encouraged.
       e.   The Town shall require carbon monoxide modeling for development projects that, in
            combination with regionally cumulative traffic increases, would result in a total of 800 or
            more trips at an affected intersection or cause the level of service to drop to D or lower at
            the intersection.
       f.   The Town shall support the Placer County Air Pollution Control District in its efforts to
            develop a feasible program to meet emission reduction requirements during the
            environmental review of all development proposals whose emissions exceed applicable
            significance thresholds.
       g.   The Town shall encourage that large residential projects be phased or timed to be
            coordinated with development that provides primary wage-earner jobs.
       h.   If an initial air quality screening indicates that emissions of any pollutant could exceed 10
            pounds per day, the Town shall require such development projects to submit an air quality
            analysis to Placer County APCD for review. Based on the analysis, the Town may require
            appropriate mitigation measures consistent with the latest version of the AQAP or other
            regional thresholds of significance adopted for the air basin.
       i.   New development shall pay its fair share of the cost to provide alternative transportation
            systems, including bikeways, pedestrian paths, and bus stop facilities.
       j.   The Town shall require that new developments dedicate land sufficient for park-and-ride
            lots, when the location is appropriate for such facilities.
                                                    115
                                                                                                  July 2001
Loomis General Plan                                                                Conservation of Resources
2.     Biotic resources evaluation. Prior to approval of discretionary development permits involving
       parcels near significant ecological resource areas, the Town shall require, as part of the
       environmental review process, a biotic resources evaluation by a qualified biologist. The
       biologist shall follow accepted protocols for surveys (if needed) and subsequent procedures that
       may be necessary to complete the evaluation. “Significant Ecological Areas” shall include, but
       not be limited to:
       ·     Wetland areas;
       ·     Stream environment zones;
       ·     Suitable habitat for rare, threatened or endangered species, and species of concern;
       ·     Large areas of non-fragmented habitat, including oak woodlands and riparian habitat;
       ·     Potential wildlife movement corridors; and
       ·     Important spawning areas for anadramous fish.
3.     Grading. The Town shall discourage grading activities during the rainy season, unless
       adequately mitigated, to avoid sedimentation of creeks and damage to riparian areas.
       a.    Prior to approval of discretionary development permits involving parcels near significant
             ecological resource areas, project applicants shall demonstrate that upland grading activities
             will not contribute to the direct cumulative degradation of stream quality.
       b.    The Town will limit development on slopes with a gradient in excess of 30 percent or in
             areas of sensitive or highly utilized habitat, through appropriate zoning standards and
             individual development project review.
4.     Hazardous materials. The Town shall require that industrial and commercial uses that store or
       use hazardous materials provide a buffer zone sufficient to protect public safety, including the
       safety of nearby wildlife.
5.     Native tree protection. Individual heritage trees and significant stands of heritage trees shall be
       preserved. Healthy heritage trees shall be removed or significantly trimmed only when necessary
       because of safety concerns, conflicts with utility lines and other infrastructure, the need for
       thinning to maintain a healthy stand of trees, or where there is no feasible alternative to removal.
       Proposed development shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to preserve individual
       heritage trees and significant stands of heritage trees, and provide for the protection of root zones
       and the continuing health of the trees. When trees are removed, they shall be replaced in
       sufficient numbers to maintain the volume of the Town’s overall tree canopy over a 20-year
       period. Tree removal within stream corridors is also subject to the above policy on stream
       corridor protection.
6.     Stream corridor protection. The streams of Loomis are among the most significant and
       valuable of the Town’s natural resources. Development adjacent to streams shall be designed,
       constructed, and maintained to avoid adverse impacts on riparian vegetation, stream bank
       stability, and stream water quality to the maximum extent feasible. These policies shall apply to
       all watercourses shown as blue lines on the most recent United States Geological Survey (USGS)
       7.5-minute topographic quadrangle maps applicable to the Town. See also the policies for
       wetland protection below.

                                                                                                   July 2001

Loomis General Plan                                                              Conservation of Resources
       a.   Proposed structures and grading shall be set back the greater of: 100 feet from the outermost
            extent of riparian vegetation as defined in the Zoning Ordinance, or outside of the 100-year
            flood plain. Lesser setbacks may be approved where site-specific studies of biology and
            hydrology, prepared by qualified professionals approved by the Town, demonstrate that a
            lesser setback will provide equal protection for stream resources. Development shall be set
            back from ephemeral or intermittent streams a minimum of 50 feet, to the extent of riparian
            vegetation, or to the 100-year floodplain, whichever is greatest.
       b.   Land uses and development within the setback areas required by this policy shall be limited
            to: the grazing of livestock at half or less of the animal densities allowed by the Zoning
            Ordinance; open wire fencing to confine livestock; bridges; public utilities and
            infrastructure; and other uses allowed by the applicable zoning district as permitted or
            conditional uses, with conditional use permit approval.
       c.   The following activities are prohibited within stream corridor setbacks: filling or dumping;
            the disposal of agricultural wastes; channelization or dams; the use of pesticides that may be
            carried into stream waters; grading, or the removal of natural vegetation within the required
            setback area, except with grading permit approval. This is not intended to prevent the
            reasonable maintenance of natural vegetation to improve plant health and habitat value.
       d.   The Town shall require that development projects proposing to encroach into a creek
            corridor or creek/wetland setback to do one or more of the following, in descending order of
            desirability:
            ·     Avoid the disturbance of riparian vegetation;
            ·     Replace riparian vegetation (on-site, in-kind);
            ·     Restore another section of creek (in-kind); and/or
            ·     Pay a mitigation fee for restoration elsewhere (e.g., wetland mitigation banking
                  program).
       e.   The Town shall require that newly-created parcels include adequate space outside of
            wetland and riparian setback areas to ensure that property owners will not place
            improvements within areas that require protection.
       f.   Proposed development shall include surface water drainage facilities that are designed,
            constructed, and maintained to ensure that the increased runoff caused by development does
            not contribute to the erosion of stream banks, or introduce pollutants into watercourses.
       g.   The Town shall encourage the use of natural stormwater drainage systems to preserve and
            enhance existing natural features. The Town shall promote flood control efforts that
            maintain natural conditions within riparian areas.
       h.   Where creek or wetland protection is required or proposed, the Town shall require public
            and private development to:
            ·     Preserve creek corridors and setbacks through easements or dedications. Parcel lines
                  or easements shall be located to optimize resource protection;
            ·     Designate easement or dedication areas as open space;
            ·     Protect creek corridors and their habitat value by: 1) providing adequate setbacks; 2)
                  maintaining creek corridors in their natural state; 3) employing restoration techniques,
                                                   117
                                                                                                 July 2001

Loomis General Plan                                                              Conservation of Resources
                  where necessary and appropriate; 4) using riparian vegetation within creek corridors;
                  5) prohibit the planting of invasive, non-native plants within creek setbacks; and 6)
                  avoiding tree removal within creek corridors.
            ·     Use techniques that ensure development will not cause or worsen natural hazards near
                  creeks, and will include erosion and sediment control practices such as: 1) turbidity
                  screens (to minimize erosion and siltation); and 2) temporary vegetation sufficient to
                  stabilize disturbed areas.
7.     Water quality. The Town will contribute toward the maintenance of high quality in the local
       surface and groundwater resources through the following, and other feasible measures.
       a.   Proposed development shall incorporate measures to minimize soil erosion, and stream and
            drainage way sedimentation during construction, and over the life of each project.
       b.   The Town will periodically review its ordinances requiring erosion and sediment control,
            and will update them when necessary to ensure their continuing effectiveness.
       c.   Proposed development shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to prevent the
            discharge of untreated effluent into local streams to the maximum extent feasible, including
            the introduction of contaminants such as pesticides, fertilizers, and petroleum products and
            other contaminants carried by urban runoff.
8.     Wetlands. The following policies apply to properties with wetland areas. Additional applicable
       policies may be found under “stream corridor protection,” above.
       a.   The environmental review of development on sites with wetlands shall include a wetlands
            delineation, and the formulation of appropriate mitigation measures. The Town shall
            support the “no net loss” policy for wetland areas regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of
            Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the California Department of Fish and
            Game. Coordination with these agencies at all levels of project review shall continue to
            ensure that appropriate mitigation measures and the concerns of these agencies are
            adequately addressed.
       b.   The Town shall require new development to mitigate wetland loss in both regulated and
            non-regulated wetlands to achieve “no net loss” through any combination of the following,
            in descending order of desirability:
            (1) Avoidance of riparian habitat;
            (2) Where avoidance is not feasible, minimization of impacts on the resource;
            (3) Compensation, including use of a mitigation banking program that provides the
                  opportunity to mitigate impacts to rare, threatened, and endangered species and/or the
                  habitat which supports these species in wetland and riparian areas, that are encouraged
                  to be located within the Town; or
            (4) Replacement of a degraded or destroyed wetland at a ratio of from 1:1 to 4:1, based on
                  the biotic value of the wetland, as determined by the required environmental analysis.
                  The review authority may reduce the replacement ratio as an incentive, where

                  replacement wetlands are proposed to be located within or in close proximity to the
                  Town.
            The Town shall cooperate with regulating agencies to ensure that concerns are adequately
            addressed.
       c.   The Town will require project-by-project review of sites where vernal pools exist, to assess
            threatened and endangered pool plant species and identify appropriate mitigation measures.
       d.   The Town will require the preservation of native riparian and wetland areas as open space
            to the maximum extent feasible, using fee title or conservation easement acquisition, land
            conservancy participation, and/or other measures as appropriate.
9.     Interagency coordination. Loomis will work cooperatively with state, regional, and local
       agencies in protecting natural resources.
Implementation Measures
1.     Amend the Zoning Ordinance to provide development standards that will implement the above
       policies.
2.     The Town shall prepare and adopt a Tree Protection Ordinance that expands the current Heritage
       Tree Ordinance. The new ordinance should identify specific species of trees to be protected and
       preserved, criteria and permit requirements for tree removal, requirements for the replacement of
       removed trees and maintenance of the Town’s overall tree canopy, and requirements for the
       protection of retained trees during development project construction, and their long-term
       maintenance.

Cultural Resources
Issues
·      A number of historical structures, primarily in the downtown area, have potential for adaptive
       reuse and enhancing the Town’s rural, small town image.
Goals
1.     To preserve and where appropriate replicate historic areas, such as the Downtown district and
       fruit sheds, that contribute to Loomis’ distinct character.
2.     To encourage cultural facilities and events in Town, such as live theater and music programs.
Policies
1.     Loomis shall encourage the reuse and revitalization of historic buildings. Whenever possible,
       flexibility in development standards allowed by the Historic Building Code shall be offered to
       developers working with historic properties.
2.     The demolition of buildings deemed by the Town to be historically or aesthetically valuable shall
       be prohibited in cases where alternatives for reuse are found to be feasible.
3.     Loomis shall support the expansion and development of cultural facilities and programs, as a
       draw for visitors and residents to the downtown core.
4.     When feasible, and on public property, Loomis shall prohibit recreational activities that could
       damage or destroy archaeological sites in areas where archaeological sites have been identified.
5.     As part of the environmental review process, the Town shall review all development proposals
       for their potential to disturb cultural resources. In areas where cultural resources are known to
       occur, give special consideration to development of facilities that enhance the operation,
       enjoyment, and maintenance of these areas.

VIII. Public Health and Safety
Purpose and Authority
The Public Health and Safety Element has been prepared in compliance with the legislative requirements
for the mandatory Safety and Noise elements of the General Plan. The Safety Element became a
mandatory part of the General Plan in 1975 when the State Legislature adopted SB 271 (Chapter 1104).
  The initial legislation focused on the adoption of policies relating to fire safety, flooding, and geologic
hazards. In 1984 the State revised the Legislation (AB 2038; Chapter 1009) expanding the list of safety
element issues and combining the Safety Element and Seismic Safety Element into a single document.
The focus of the Safety Element is to adopt policies that will “. . . reduce death, injuries, property
damage, and the economic and social dislocation resulting from natural hazards.”
This element also addresses noise issues. Government Code Section 65302(f), requires that a Noise
Element be prepared as part of a community’s General Plan to identify and appraise noise problems in
the community. The Government Code includes the following requirements for noise elements:
·       The element shall recognize the guidelines established by the Office of Noise Control in the State
        Department of Health Services and shall analyze and quantify to the extent practicable, as
        determined by the legislative body, current and projected noise levels for roads, railroads and
        other vehicular sources. It shall also evaluate stationary noise sources, including those associated
        with industrial and commercial operations.
·       Noise contours shall be shown and stated in terms of community noise equivalent level (CNEL)
        or day-night average level (Ldn). The noise contours shall be used as a guide for establishing a
        pattern of land uses in the land use element that minimizes the exposure of community residents
        to excessive noise.
This element is designed to provide the input necessary to assist the Town of Loomis in achieving
balanced planning decisions. It recognizes the importance of the public safety, and the need to integrate
safety concerns, including noise concerns, with other local issues.
Safety
This portion of the element addresses the major safety issues of concern in Loomis, including seismic
and geologic hazards, flooding, fire hazard, and hazardous materials. Goals and policies addressing
these issues follow the description of each. Detailed background information on the issues addressed in
this Safety Element can be found in Section 7 of the Technical Background Report.
Critical facilities are those that must remain operational after an emergency event, in order for the
community to respond effectively. Examples of critical facilities include hospitals, fire stations,
electrical power plants, and community facilities. Schools are often important staging and evacuation
areas. There are relatively few critical facilities in Loomis; the nearest hospitals, for example, are in
Roseville and Auburn. Figure 8-1 shows the location of critical facilities in Loomis.

A.      Seismic and Geologic Hazards
The information in this section provides a preliminary indication of the degree of potential risk
associated with various seismic and geologic hazards. This assessment should be used as a general
guide to indicate when further study may be needed. It should not be used as the sole basis for project
approval or denial.
Regional Faulting
The major fault systems in the region tend to occur along the interface between differing geologic
materials. The nearest major fault system near Loomis is the Foothills Fault System, which traverses
Amador, El Dorado, and Placer counties in a path more than 350 kilometers long and several kilometers
wide. Two segments of this system are relatively close to Loomis: the segment of the Bear Mountain
Fault Zone (Spenceville Fault) between Folsom and Auburn, and the Melones Fault Zone, about 15
miles to the east.
No active faults are known to exist in Placer County, and no Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zones are
designated in the County. The nearest known active fault that has been mapped is the Dunnigan Hills
Fault, well to the northwest of the Town across the Central Valley. However, investigations performed
for the proposed Auburn Dam indicate that the Foothill Fault System may be undergoing reactivation in
the vicinity of Folsom Lake and may be capable of producing a magnitude 6.5 Richter Scale event
(Woodward-Clyde Associates; Tierra Engineering). In 1975, a magnitude 5.7 earthquake was recorded
on the Cleveland Hills Fault within the Foothill Fault System near Oroville, in a region thought at the
time to be relatively free of seismic events of this severity. Consequently, even though the Bear
Mountain and Melones faults have not ruptured in the past 200 years, they are considered potentially
active. The last seismic event recorded in the area with a magnitude of 4.0 or greater was in 1908, with
an epicenter between Auburn and Folsom, possibly associated with the Bear Mountain Fault.
Within the planning area, an inactive inferred fault was mapped across the area’s southern boundary
(Livingston, 1974). The potential for seismic events originating from this fault is considered low.
Seismic Hazards
The underlying geologic foundation of the region is a relatively unbroken granitic batholith that extends
along the Sierra Nevada. During seismic events, this material tends to react as a uniform block, which
has the effect of reducing ground movement, acceleration, and the likelihood of ground rupture.
Consequently, the California Division of Mines and Geology (CDMG) classifies the region as a low
severity earthquake area. Typical seismic hazards include surface rupture, groundshaking, and various
types of ground failure. The potential for these hazards to exist in the planning area is described below.
·       Surface rupture. Surface rupture during earthquakes is typically limited to those areas
        immediately adjacent to the fault on which the event is occurring. Because the planning area
        contains no active faults, the likelihood of surface rupture in the area is considered low.
·       Groundshaking. The most serious direct earthquake hazard is the damage or collapse of
        buildings caused by groundshaking, which, in addition to property damage, can cause injury or
        death.
        Groundshaking is the vibration that radiates from the epicenter of an earthquake. The severity of
        groundshaking and its potential to cause damage to buildings is determined by several factors:
                                                    124
                                                                                                    July 2001

Loomis General Plan                                                 Public Health and Safety - Seismic and Geologic Hazards
         ·       The nature of the underlying soil and geology;
         ·                      The location of the epicenter of the earthquake;
         ·                      The duration and character of the ground motion;
         ·                      The structural characteristics of a building; and
         ·                      The quality of workmanship and materials used in buildings.
         Groundshaking is the primary seismic concern for Loomis. Portions of Loomis are located on
         alluvial deposits, which can increase the potential for groundshaking damage. As earthquake
         waves pass from more dense rock to less dense alluvial material, they tend to reduce velocity, but
         increase in amplitude. Ground motion lasts longer on loose, water-saturated materials than on
         solid rock. As a result, structures located on these types of materials may suffer greater damage.
         “Poor ground” can be a greater hazard for structures than close proximity to the fault or the
         earthquake’s epicenter. Figure 7-2 in the General Plan Update Technical Background Report
         shows the geology of the area. The potential for groundshaking may be considered highest on
         the alluvial deposits along the creeks and ravines in the northern portion of Loomis.
         Groundshaking is described in terms of ground acceleration of gravity or through the use of the
         Modified Mercalli Scale, which is a more descriptive method involving 12 levels of intensity
         denoted by Roman numerals (Table 8-1). Modified Mercalli intensities range from I (not felt), to
         XII (total damage). Based on information from the California Division of Mines and Geology
         (Robert H. Sydnor, Senior Engineering Geologist, RG 3267, CHG 6, CEG 968, CPG 4496), the
         maximum probable groundshaking within the planning area that would be expected is VI on the
         Modified Mercalli Scale. Typical structural damage from groundshaking of this magnitude
         would be minimal if dwellings are constructed in compliance with applicable Uniform Building
         Code (UBC) requirements. The typical effects of such groundshaking could include cracked
         chimneys, moved furniture, and broken glassware inside structures. However, historic records
         suggest a low probability of these maximum events occurring in Loomis.

         Older buildings constructed before building codes were in effect are most likely to suffer damage
         in an earthquake. Many of Loomis’ buildings are one or two stories high, and of wood frame
         construction, which is considered relatively resistant to earthquake damage. However, buildings
                                                                 125

       made of unreinforced masonry are highly susceptible to damage from severe groundshaking.
       Several unreinforced masonry structures currently exist in Loomis, particularly in the downtown
       area. Some buildings include brick facades, which are highly susceptible to damage (and falling)
       in the event of an earthquake.
·      Ground failure. In addition to structural damage caused by groundshaking, there are other
       ground effects caused by such shaking. These ground failure effects include liquefaction,
       subsidence, lurch cracking, and lateral spreading. The potential for these hazards to occur in
       Loomis is discussed below.
·      Liquefaction. Liquefaction in soils and sediments can occur during earthquake events, when
       material is temporarily transformed from a solid to a liquid (gelatinous) by increases in interpore
       pressure. Earthquake-induced liquefaction most often occurs in low-lying areas with soils
       composed of unconsolidated, saturated, clay-free sands and silts, but can also occur in dry,
       granular soils or saturated soils with some clay content. Liquefaction also occurs in areas
       overlain by unconsolidated fill, particularly artificial fill.
       The presence of several unconsolidated and saturated soils throughout the area indicates a
       moderate liquefaction potential, particularly on the alluvial soils found along the low-lying
       ravines and creeks (see Figure 8-2).
·      Subsidence. Subsidence is the compaction of soils and alluvium caused by groundshaking. It
       occurs irregularly and is largely a function of the underlying soils. Depending on the event, the
       amount of compaction can vary from a few inches to several feet. In Loomis, the potential for
       subsidence is greatest in areas underlain by alluvium or other soft water-saturated soils.
       However, no significant subsidence problems have been identified in the planning area.
·      Lurch cracking and lateral spreading. Lurch cracking refers to fractures, cracks and fissures
       produced by groundshaking, and may occur far from an earthquake’s epicenter. Lateral
       spreading is the horizontal movement of soil toward an open face of a stream bank or the side of
       a levee. Steep-sided artificial fill embankments are most susceptible to damage. The potential
       for these hazards is greatest on steep-sided alluvial soils where the groundwater table is high. In
       Loomis, this would include areas adjacent to Antelope Creek, Secret Ravine, and Sucker Ravine.
Other Geologic Hazards
·      Landslides. Landslides may be triggered by oversaturated soils (after heavy rains) or by
       earthquakes. Landslide potential is highest in steeply-sloped areas, particularly those areas
       underlain with saturated and unconsolidated soil. The steepest slopes in Loomis are those west
       of Antelope Creek, just west of Sierra College Boulevard. Some slopes exceed 30% in this area.
        However, the underlying geology of the area is generally mehrten volcanics and granite, solid
       foundation materials not highly susceptible to landslides. The southeasternmost portion of the
       planning area also exhibits locally steep slopes (15-25% slopes are common). Again, the
       underlying materials are typically stable volcanics or granite, and landslide potential would be
       minimized to some extent. Most other portions of Loomis are relatively level or gently sloping,
       and thus not highly susceptible to landslides.
·      Erosion. Soils in the planning area, some of which are on steep slopes and are loosely textured,
       generally exhibit moderate erosion potential, particularly when exposed on embankment faces
       and slopes. The effects of erosion range from nuisance problems, such as increased siltation in
                                                   126
                                                                                                     July 2001

        storm drains, to extreme cases where watercourses are downcut and gullies develop that can
        eventually undermine adjacent structures or vegetation.
·       Seiche. Seiches are earthquake-generated waves within enclosed or restricted bodies of water.
        However, because no sizable lakes or reservoirs are present in the planning area, there are no
        seiche hazards in the Town of Loomis.
B.      Flood Hazards
Effects of Flooding
Flooding can cause widespread damage to affected areas. Buildings and vehicles can be damaged or
destroyed, while smaller objects can be buried in flood-deposited sediments. Floods can also cause
drowning or isolation of people or animals. In addition, floodwaters can break utility lines, interrupting
services and potentially affecting health and safety, particularly in the case of broken sewer or gas lines.
The secondary effects of flooding are due to standing water, which can result in crop damage, septic tank
failure, and water well contamination. Standing water can also damage roads, foundations, and
electrical circuits.
FEMA 100-Year Flood Hazard
Flooding has historically been a relatively minor hazard in the Loomis area, primarily due to its
relatively elevated location within the Dry Creek watershed. The lower portions of the Dry Creek
watershed have historically been hit hard by flooding, particularly in the Roseville area (where
tributaries of Dry Creek converge) and in the flatlands in the Rio Linda area.
The National Flood Insurance Study of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) produced
the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for the Town in 1998. The map identifies special flood hazard
areas in the community, focusing on areas that could be inundated in the event of a 100-year flood.
(Statistically, a 100-year flood has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year, and has a 24% chance of
occurring during the period of a typical 30-year mortgage.) The map shows the locations of 100-year
and 500-year flood plains in the community, which are generally along Secret Ravine, Antelope Creek,
Sucker Ravine, and their tributaries. Figure 8-2 shows the FEMA 100-year flood zone in the
community.
Local Flooding Concerns
Inadequately-sized culverts and bridges can create impediments to the passage of high water flow in
streams and gullies. Undersized infrastructure typically result in short-term back-ups behind the culvert
or bridge, with pooling water in such areas, in effect, an unintended detention basin. Areas of potential
concern in Loomis could include culverts under Interstate 80; the Horseshoe Bar Road crossing over
Secret Ravine; the railroad and Taylor Road crossing of Sucker Ravine; and various crossings of
Antelope Creek and its tributaries, at King Road, Sierra College Boulevard, and Del Mar Road. Various
culverts and storm drains throughout the Town are also subject to potential flooding in the event that
they become clogged with debris during heavy rains.
The Town of Loomis Specific Plan EIR identifies drainage problems associated with the culvert under
the southbound freeway ramp of Interstate 80 into a poorly maintained swale near South Walnut Street.
Other similar deficiencies are likely elsewhere, though none have been specifically identified in the
                                                   127
                                                                                                    July 2001

Loomis General Plan                                                 Public Health and Safety - Flood Hazards
available literature. During the heavy rain season of 1995, localized flooding was experienced on some
low-lying properties near Secret Ravine and Antelope Creek, causing floor damage in some cases. In
general, flooding occurred because of downstream blockages within flood channels or culverts.
Flood maintenance is an ongoing problem throughout Placer County. In Loomis, many of the major
drainages are located on private property, and the Town generally does not have access to conduct
maintenance operations to keep channels clear of debris. There is no clear responsibility regarding
maintenance of drainages on private property (Town or property owners), though newer developments
are required to include easements to facilitate maintenance. Nevertheless, this does not address existing
deficiencies, which are experienced throughout the community.
Dam Inundation
Loomis is not in the dam inundation area for any major stream or river in the region. There are no dams
or reservoirs (except small local detention facilities) upstream of Loomis on any tributary of Antelope
Creek or Secret Ravine. Loomis is not subject to potential damage from dam inundation.

C.      Wildland and Urban Fire Hazard
Loomis faces two types of fire hazards that threaten lives and property: urban and wildland fires.
Wildland fires may also result in the loss of natural vegetation, loss of agricultural crops, and soil
erosion. The threat posed by each type of fire hazard is described below.
Wildland Fires
The outbreak and spread of wildland fires within the planning area is a potential danger, particularly
during the dry summer and fall months. The buildup of understory brush, which under natural
conditions would be periodically burned off, provides fuel to result in larger more intensive fires.
Various factors contribute to the intensity and spread of wildland fires: humidity, wind speed and
direction, vegetation type, the amount of vegetation (fuel), and topography. Most wildland fires are the
result of arson or simple carelessness.
The topography, climate, and vegetation of Loomis area are conducive to the spread of wildland fires. It
contains extensive grasslands and oak woodlands in rolling terrain. The area is subject to hot, dry
summers, with frequent wind gusts. Fortunately, prolonged summer heat spells often induce the delta
breeze, a moist, cooling wind that temporarily reduces the high fire hazard condition common during
that time of year.
Although small grass fires are common in the planning area, they have historically been limited in size
by prompt emergency response. No major wildland fires that threatened lives and property have been
recorded in the Loomis area in recent years.
Urban Fires
Urban fires are primarily those associated with structures and the activities in and around them. Most
urban fires are caused by human activity. Over the years, development standards have become more
stringent to reduce the frequency and severity of such events. Building codes now require fire walls for
adjacent structures. Local ordinances often prohibit the use of fire-prone materials, such as shake-
shingle roofs. Electrical standards have also changed to reduce fire risk inside structures. Smoke
detectors are now commonly required.
Urban fire hazards are greatest in areas containing older buildings that do not meet current building
codes. Loomis contains many such structures, even though the Town requires that such buildings be
brought up to code when made aware of such buildings. Many older homes (and barns) in the rural
portions of the community still have substandard electrical fixtures and do not otherwise meet code.
Utility facilities also present a potential urban fire hazard. Earthquakes or floods may rupture buried gas
lines, while high winds or accidents could cause overhead electric lines to break. Either condition could
result in a fire. Catastrophic earthquakes could cause widespread urban fires, as multiple gas and
electrical lines could be broken or disrupted. However, the potential for earthquakes of this magnitude
striking Loomis is low (see Section 8.2.2, Seismic Hazards).
Once an urban fire starts, fast emergency response is critical to ensure that the fire does not spread.
Urban fires by their nature occur in areas with a high density of human occupation and property. The
threat to life and property is high.

                                                                                                     July 2001
Loomis General Plan                                            Public Health and Safety - Hazardous Materials
While Loomis has had urban fires, most have been small and easily contained. No catastrophic fires
have been recorded in recent history, particularly since emergency response and building codes have
been improved.
D.       Hazardous Materials
Hazardous materials are defined as those that are a potential threat to human health, having the capacity
to cause serious illness or death. This section discusses the types of hazardous materials typically found
in the planning area.
Household Products
By far the most common hazardous materials are those found or used in the home. Waste oil is a
common hazardous material that is often improperly disposed of and can contaminate surface water
through runoff. Other household hazardous wastes (used paint, pesticides, cleaning products and other
chemicals) are common and often improperly stored in garages and homes throughout the community.
Because of their prevalence and proximity to residents, household products constitute the most pervasive
health hazard facing residents of the community.
Mine Tailings
Historic mining operations often left dredge tailings, or discarded rock and material, either near the mine
site in the case of dredge or hardrock mining, or washed downstream as a result of upstream hydraulic
mining. Dredge mining was common in the 19th century along the creeks in the Loomis area, and dredge
tailings can still be found. Hydraulic operations have scarred hillsides in Loomis, one notable example
being on the proposed Loomis Hills Estates development site, where a 60-foot high, 1,000-foot long cliff
provides evidence of such operations (Town of Loomis, Sherwood Park Draft EIR (Loomis Hills),
1998).
Mine tailings can be contaminated with mercury or cyanide, both of which are used in the process of
gold refining. However, most gold was not refined in the immediate Loomis area and the potential for
such contamination in dredge materials is considered low.
Agricultural Pesticide Use
Loomis includes many agricultural operations. Orchards in particular are often sprayed with various
pesticides, which can contaminate the soils. Denuded vegetation can suggest evidence for soil
contamination. Potential contaminants can include DDT, lead and arsenic. In such areas, it is prudent to
conduct soil testing (and conducting soil clean-up steps, if necessary) before allowing more intensive
development.
Asbestos
Asbestos is a highly crumbly material often found in older buildings, typically used as insulation in walls
or ceilings. It was formerly popular as an insulating material because it had the desirable characteristic
of being fire resistant. However, it can pose a health risk when very small particles become airborne.
These dust-like particles can be easily inhaled, where their microscopically sharp structures can puncture
tiny air sacs in the lungs, resulting in long-term health problems.
                                                    131
                                                                                                   July 2001
Loomis General Plan                                 Public Health and Safety - Goals, Policies, Implementation
Loomis contains many older structures with the potential to contain asbestos. Pre-1979 construction
often included asbestos and it should be assumed that the demolition of older structures in the Town may
present this hazard. Proper asbestos abatement and disposal procedures should be undertaken whenever
the demolition of older structures is considered.
Hazardous Materials Transport
The Union Pacific Railroad and Interstate 80 are major transcontinental transportation routes that pass
through Loomis. Trains and trucks commonly carry a variety of hazardous materials, including gasoline
and various crude oil derivatives, and other chemicals known to cause human health problems. When
properly contained, these materials present no hazard to the community. But in the event of an accident
or derailment, such materials may be released, either in liquid or gas form. In the case of some
chemicals (such as chlorine), highly toxic fumes may be carried far from the accident site.
Although standard accident and hazardous materials recovery procedures are enforced by the state and
followed by private transportation companies, the Town of Loomis is at relatively high risk because of
its location along interstate rail and highway corridors.
Hazardous Waste Management Plan
Counties are required by state law to prepare hazardous waste management plans. Placer County’s plan
addresses the treatment, storage and disposal of such materials. The primary goal of the plan is to
protect public health by promoting the safe use and disposal of hazardous waste. To accomplish this, the
plan provides for the reduction of hazardous waste through source reduction, recycling, and on-site
handling and treatment methods. Public education and community involvement are key features for
achieving this goal.

·       The rural nature of the community and presence of large open space parcels increases the
        Town’s risk of wildland and fire hazards at the urban edge.
·       A number of properties along local creeks have been flooded during winter storms, despite flood
        preventative measures.
·       Potential for hazardous material spills.
Goals
1.      To reduce risks associated with natural and man-made hazards through compliance with State
        and Federal safety programs.
2.      To reduce the risks associated with wildland and urban edge fires in the Town’s rural areas.
3.      To reduce the potential for and damage resulting from storm flooding hazards within the
        community.
4.      To reduce the risks associated with potential seismic activity, including groundshaking,
        liquefaction, and landslides.

Policies
1.     Loomis shall enforce building codes and other Town ordinances having an effect upon fire
       hazards and fire protection. The Town shall maintain adequate street widths and turning radii to
       accommodate fire protection equipment. New development shall ensure adequate water pressure
       and volume for fire fighting.
2.     Engineering analysis of new development proposals shall be required in areas with possible soil
       instability, flooding, earthquake faults, or other hazards, and prohibit development in high danger
       areas.
3.     Loomis shall comply with Placer County'     s Emergency Response Plan, as well as revise the Town
       Emergency Plan to address Town-specific issues.
4.     No new structures or additions to existing structures shall be permitted in areas identified by the
       federal Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) or the Town Engineer as being subject to
       innundation in a 100-year or more frequent flood event. Exceptions may be granted for public
       facilities and utilities. New development shall also be prohibited in the future 100-year flood
       zone, based on buildout conditions as determined by FEMA and FIRM maps. Development will
       be required to adhere to Placer County Flood Control District policies and the Dry Creek
       Watershed Control Plan.
5.     New development near stream channels shall be designed so that reduced stream capacity, stream
       bank erosion, or adverse impacts on habitat values are avoided.
6.     Further channelization and/or banking of creeks or streams within the planning area shall be
       discouraged, unless no other alternative is available to minimize flood risk. Setbacks from flood
       sources shall be the preferred method of avoiding impacts.
7.     Site-specific recommendations of the Town’s Drainage Master Plan, upon completion, shall be
       applied to individual development projects as appropriate.
8.     Loomis shall cooperate with Federal, State, and local authorities to ensure that loss due to seismic
       activity and other natural and man-made disasters is minimized.
9.     Loomis shall encourage compliance with State requirements for unreinforced masonry buildings
       and seismic safety.
10.    Loomis shall continue to train and equip Town personnel to cope with emergency disaster
       situations, including hazardous material incidents.
11.    A Street Address Ordinance shall be adopted to assist effective emergency response by requiring
       adequate street address identification.
12.    Application materials for residential subdivisions proposed within or near oak woodlands shall
       include Wildland fire protection plans showing how vegetation clearance will be maintained
       around structures while preserving oak trees.
13.    Town policies concerning the use, storage and transportation of hazardous materials, and
       regarding underground or above ground storage tanks, should reflect the Placer County
                                                    133

       Environmental Health Division and the State Regional Water Quality Control Board policies and
       requirements.
14.    As individual developments are proposed, the Environmental Health specialist responsible for the
       project will review lists of hazardous materials provided by the applicant as part of the project
       description to determine consistency with the State Health and Safety Code. A site visit may be
       necessary to determine compatibility to surrounding areas. Whether the hazardous material
       impacts of a project are significant shall be decided on a case-by-case basis and depends on:
       ·       Individual or cumulative physical hazard of material or materials.
       ·       Amounts of materials onsite, either in use or storage.
       ·       Proximity of hazardous materials to populated areas and compatibility of materials with
               neighboring facilities.
       ·       Federal, State, and local laws, and ordinances, governing storage and use of hazardous
               materials.
       ·       Potential for spill or release.
       ·       Proximity of hazardous materials to receiving waters or other significant environmental
               resource.
15.    The storage, handling and disposal of potentially hazardous waste must be in conformance with
       the requirements set forth in California Administrative Code, Title 22, Division 4, Ch. 30, and
       California Health and Safety Code, Division 20, Chapter 6.5.
Implementation Measures

       years.
2.     The Town shall identify and inventory its unreinforced masonry buildings.
3.     The Town shall implement a program of retrofitting existing unreinforced masonry buildings.
       The program shall include:
       ·       Requirements for upgrading unreinforced masonry buildings.
       ·       Incorporation of concepts and provisions of the State Code for historic buildings, to
               provide additional flexibility for preservation of historic buildings while protecting them
               from significant earthquake damage.
       ·       A time schedule for enforcement with all upgrading completed during that time.
       ·       Signs shall be posted and maintained on unreinforced masonry buildings to warn residents
               of the potential hazard.
4.     Appropriate means of economic relief for commercial buildings that are constructed of
       unreinforced masonry, shall also be considered, such as: preservation of non-conforming zoning
       rights for in-kind replacement of commercial buildings, and community redevelopment programs
       for the coordinated upgrading of seismic, economic, and general design characteristics of affected
       commercial areas.
5.     The highest and most current professional standards for seismic design shall be used in the
       design of Critical, Sensitive and High-Occupancy Facilities, so that the seismic design of the
       facilities will not become substandard within a few years.

       channels on an annual basis to minimize upstream flooding potential.
15.    A program to require the installation of fire sprinklers in new and existing structures should be
       considered.
16.    An equitable cost recovery program should be designed and implemented to reimburse the Town
       for emergency response and investigation.
17.    A fire safety plan shall be required of all new businesses and multi-family occupancies.
18.    The Town Engineer shall establish procedures for processing projects which involve the use,

        residential structures or residential yards, schools, active parks, or recreational facilities are to be
        built within the utility corridor right-of-way. In addition, the following setback guidelines
        adopted by the California Department of Health Services shall be adhered to: 100 feet from 100-
        110 kV lines; 150 feet from 220-230 kV lines; and 250 feet from 345 kV lines.
Noise
The Noise Element Guidelines provided by the California Governor’s Office of Planning and Research
require that major noise sources be identified and quantified through the preparation of generalized noise
contours for current and projected conditions. Significant noise sources in the Loomis area include
traffic and railroad operations. Industrial operations are an additional, but less intrusive, noise source in
Loomis, except to those residents located near the few such operations. There are no airports in the area
that could be a source of noise.
A.      Overview of Noise and Sound Measurement
Noise is usually defined as "unwanted sound." It consists of any sound that may produce physiological
or psychological damage and/or interfere with communication, work, rest, recreation, and sleep.
Sound intensity is measured in units called decibels (dB). When this basic unit is adjusted to correct for
the relative frequency response of the human ear, the resulting unit is the "A-weighted" decibel (dBA).
A-weighting de-emphasizes low frequencies to better correlate with the response of the human ear to
sound. The zero on the dBA scale is based on the lowest sound level that the healthy, unimpaired
human ear can detect. Unlike linear units (inches or pounds), the decibel scale is logarithmic. When
measured on this scale, therefore, sound intensity increases or decreases exponentially with each decibel
of change. While 10 decibels is 10 times more intense than one decibel, 20 decibels is 100 times more
intense and 30 decibels is 1,000 times more intense. The decibel scale increases as the square of the
change in sound pressure energy. A sound as soft as human breathing is about 10 times greater than
zero decibels. The decibel system of measuring sound provides us with a simplified relationship between
the physical intensity of sound and its perceived loudness to the human ear.

                                                                                                      July 2001

Loomis General Plan                                                            Public Health and Safety - Noise
Because of the physical characteristics associated with noise transmission and reception, a doubling of
noise energy normally results in about a three dBA increase in noise levels while a 10 dBA increase in
noise level is generally required to perceive a doubling of noise. A one to two dBA change in ambient
noise levels generally is not audible even to sensitive receptors.
Sound levels corresponding to typical noise sources are provided in Table 8-2. The decibel level of a
sound decreases exponentially as the distance from the source of that sound increases. For a single point
source, sound level decays approximately six decibels for each doubling of distance from the source.
Noise originating from a linear, or "line" source, such as a traffic or rail corridor, will typically decrease
by about three decibels for each doubling of distance, provided the surrounding environment is "hard"
(free from "soft," sound-absorbing objects such as vegetation). Noise from a line source in an
environment that is relatively flat and well-vegetated will decrease by about 4.5 decibels for each
doubling of distance.
The time of day when a sound is emitted is an important factor in determining whether or not it is
considered a nuisance. Sounds that may be barely noticeable at midday may be seriously disruptive at
midnight. A number of measurement scales that attempt to account for this time factor have been
developed. Two of the more commonly used scales of this type are the Community Noise Equivalent
Level (CNEL) and the day-night sound level (Ldn). The Ldn, which was developed by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, is a 24-hour average sound level in which a 10 dBA penalty is added
to any sounds occurring between the hours of 10:00 p.m and 7:00 a.m. The CNEL scale, which is used
in California Airport Noise Regulations, is similar except that an additional 5 dBA penalty is added for
the evening hours from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.

B.      Noise Compatibility Standards
State and Federal Standards
The California Department of Health, Office of Noise Control, has established noise compatibility
guidelines for various land uses (Table 8-4). The compatibility table illustrates the range of community
noise exposure in terms of what is considered “normally acceptable,” “conditionally acceptable,”
“normally unacceptable,” and “clearly unacceptable.” For the most sensitive uses, such as single family
residences, 60 dBA Ldn is recommended as the maximum normally acceptable level for outdoor areas
around the structure, which is the level below which no special sound attenuation measures are required.
  These guidelines are recommended by the State to assist communities in determining whether or not
noise poses a conflict with land development.
The following are other pertinent federal and state noise guidelines:
·       Article 4 of the California Administrative Code (California Noise Insulation Standards, Title 25,
        Chapter 1) requires noise insulation in new hotels, motels, apartment houses, and dwellings other
        than single-family detached housing to provide an annual average noise level of no more than 45
        dBA CNEL. When such structures are located within a 60 dBA CNEL (or greater) noise
        contour, an acoustical analysis is required to assure that interior levels do not exceed the 45 dBA
        CNEL annual threshold.
·       The Federal Housing Administration establishes a 65 dBA Ldn standard for outdoor activity
        areas adjoining residential dwellings, and a 45 dBA Ldn standard for the interior of single family
        residences. If exterior levels are between the 65 dBA Ldn standard and 75 dBA Ldn, acoustical
        analysis is required to insure that the interior standard is met. Residential development is
        unacceptable where exterior noise levels exceed 75 dBA Ldn.
Local Standards
Loomis’ exterior standard for noise sensitive structures under the General Plan update is 65 dBA Ldn,
with an interior standard of 45 dBA Ldn. Table 8-3 illustrates these standards for various noise sensitive
land uses, which are more stringent than the FHA standards described above. The standards shown in
Table 8-3 are most appropriately applied to land uses adjacent to continuous noise sources, such as
roadway traffic noise. However, standards based on 24-hour weighting are not adequate to address
certain noise sources, particularly industrial noise sources, which occur infrequently but at potentially
higher intensity.
For this reason, the General Plan update includes standards to address noise events of a shorter duration,
particularly in rural residential areas that are otherwise normally quiet. These standards, based on State
recommendations and shown in Figure 8-4, apply to land uses within close proximity to land uses or
other activities that can produce high noise levels of a shorter duration. These could include certain
industrial activities, and kennel facilities.

C.         Existing Noise Sources and Sound Levels
Noise modeling techniques and measurements were used to develop generalized Ldn or Leq noise
contours in the planning area for existing conditions. This method uses source-specific data including
traffic mixture, speed limits and traffic volumes, all of which were obtained from either Caltrans, or Fehr
& Peers Associates. The modeling methods used here follow recommendations by the State Office of
Noise Control. Noise contours along roadways were modeled using the Federal Highway
Administration'      s Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model (FHWA-RD-77-108, 1978), with California
vehicle noise emission levels (CALVENO) developed by Caltrans.
The resulting noise contours (Figure 8-5) are based on average annual conditions. Local topography and
intervening structures at specific locations would alter the contours, which should be considered
generalizations. Table 8-5 shows the model results for the distance to the 60, 65 and 70 dBA Ldn
contours associated with traffic on major roads traversing the Town.
                                                               141

Table 8-6 serves as a guide when applying traffic noise exposure contour information to areas with
varying topography. The table is used by adding the correction factor to the predicted noise level for a
given location. The factors included in this table present conservative (worst-case) results, and complex
situations should be evaluated by an acoustical consultant when the potential for a significant noise
impact exists.
·       Roadways. Roadway traffic is the primary source of noise in the Loomis community. Interstate
        80 carries by far the most traffic through the area, and is consequently the major noise
        contributor. The 60 dBA Ldn contour from I-80 ranges from 1,650 to 1,750 feet from centerline.
         However, this distance is likely much less than modeled, because of topographic attenuation (see
        Table 8-6) and intervening buildings.
        Taylor Road and Sierra College Boulevard are the only other roadways that carry sufficient traffic
        to produce audible noise at a significant distance. The 60 dBA Ldn contour for these roads
        typically ranges from 200 to 400 feet, and less where there are intervening structures. Horseshoe
        Bar Road, King Road and Rocklin Road carry moderate traffic (4,000-5,000 ADT), but not
        enough to produce far-reaching noise contours. The noise model predicts that the 60 dBA Ldn
        contour would be less than 100 feet from the center of those roadways. Figure 8-5 and Table 8-5
        provide more detailed information.

         Field measurements were taken adjacent to each of the roadways shown in Table 8-5 as a means
         of verifying the modeled noise levels. (1) These 20-minute samples were taken at distances
         varying from 50 to 100 feet from the roadway centerlines where possible, during a typical
         weekday non-peak afternoon period. In general, there was some variation from the FHWA
         model, but typically less than 10 percent (see model runs in attached appendix). This variation
         can be accounted for by several factors, including the duration of field samples, the time of day
         that measurements were taken, and the day of the week of sampling. Other variables that might
         have affected field measurements include the weather, which could affect the expected traffic
         volumes. In general, the field measurements verified the predicted noise levels along community
         roadways.
·        Rail Traffic. The Union Pacific Railroad operates two rail lines through the Town. The
         westbound rail line parallels Taylor Road, and cuts through the center of the community. The
         eastbound line travels northward, along the western edge of the planning area, about 1.5 miles
         west of downtown Loomis.
         Noise measurements were conducted on both lines to determine the contribution of freight and
         passenger rail operations to the noise environment. The goal of the noise measurements was to
         determine the typical sound exposure levels (SEL), accounting for travel speed, warning horns,
         locomotive noise, and other factors contributing to noise generation. The average SEL for the
         four observed freight trains was 108.7 dB at a distance of 100 feet from the track centerline; for
         the two passenger trains, the average SEL was 94 dB. Measurements were taken for trains
1 Existing noise conditions were measured through noise monitoring using an ANSI Type II sound
level meter (Larson Davis 720). Sound levels were recorded on November 9, 1999 along the
roadways shown in Table 8-5. Noise monitoring at rail and industrial facilities was conducted with
the same equipment.

         moving in both directions, and taken near roadway crossings (Boulder Ridge Road, west of Del
         Mar Avenue; and Webb Street, south of King Road) where train whistles were blown.
         According to Union Pacific officials, the number of trains traveling through Loomis fluctuates,
         but typically includes 8 to 14 trains per day (Union Pacific, 2000). This number is consistent
         with a 1996 Surface Transportation Board ruling that limits the number of trains passing through
         Reno, Nevada, to 15 as a condition of the recent Union Pacific/Southern Pacific merger (Mike
         Furtney, Union Pacific, 1998). For the purpose of this analysis, the worst case (14 trains) is
         assumed, evenly distributed between east and westbound freight. The analysis also assumes that
         each train is pulled by an average of 3 to 4 engines, and carries an average of about 100 cars.
         About half the trains traverse the community at night, with whistles blown at all at-grade
         crossings. The average train speed is estimated to be about 50 miles per hour.
         Amtrak operates two eastbound and two westbound passenger trains daily that pass through
         Loomis. All four passenger trains pass through the Town during the day or early evening.
         To determine the distance to noise contours, it is necessary to calculate the Ldn for typical rail
         operations. This is accomplished by using the recorded SEL values and the known number of
         trains. The Ldn may be calculated as follows:
                                     Ldn = SEL + 10logN – 49.4 dB, where:
         SEL is the mean SEL of the event, N is the sum of the number of day and evening trains per day
         plus 10 times the number of nighttime (10pm to 7 am) trains per day, and 49.4 is ten times the
         logarithm of the number of seconds per day. Based on this information, the calculated noise
         contour distances from each rail line are shown in Table 8-7. These contours are depicted
         graphically in Figure 8-5. It should be noted that nearly all of the rail noise is a result of freight
         traffic. The amount of noise contributed by passenger trains is considered negligible.

·        Stationary Noise Sources. Industrial and commercial operations can be significant sources of
         noise, depending on the type and hours of operation. Stationary noise sources of concern
         typically include generators, pumps, air compressors, outdoor speakers, motors, heavy equipment
         and similar machinery. These are usually often associated with trucking companies, tire shops,
         auto mechanic shops, metal shops, shopping centers, drive-up windows, car washes, loading
         docks, gravel operations, athletic fields, and electric generating stations.

       Industrial Operations. In Loomis, loading docks are the most commonly cited stationary noise
       nuisance. Brown-Buntin Associates estimated that typical loading dock operations generate a
       noise level of 60 dB Leq at a distance of 50 feet for a busy one-hour period (ESA, Turtle Island
       Draft EIR, 1996). This noise level includes tractor-trailer truck traffic arriving, departing and
       idling.
       Many facilities of this type exist in Loomis, particularly within heavy commercial or industrial
       areas west of Taylor Road, particularly north of King Road. Areas where residential uses abut
       industrial uses are particularly susceptible to loading dock noise. The most prominent examples
       of this in Loomis include the homes along Kathy Way, which are located just west of an
       extensive industrial area, and homes near Brace Road, between Interstate 80 and Sierra College
       Boulevard.
       A 1999 acoustical study for a proposed industrial facility at the corner of Swetzer Road and
       Jetton Lane concluded that the primary sources of noise would be loading operations and
       associated truck traffic (Western Planning and Engineering, 1999). Such operations (usually
       about 20 minutes in duration, occurring infrequently throughout the day) would produce an Leq
       of 50 dBA within 150 feet of the operations. Noise resulting from operations within such a
       facility would have a lesser impact on neighboring areas.
       It should be noted that noise at individual facilities can vary greatly depending on the nature of
       the facility. It is not possible to characterize all facilities based on what is experienced at a few
       locations. Unlike roadway noise, which is a continuous noise source that can be accurately
       modeled, it is not possible to develop meaningful noise contours that could provide useful
       planning tools in the context of a Noise Element. Instead, it is more appropriate to identify areas
       where such facilities either currently exist or are likely to in the future. Generally speaking, these
       areas include land designated for industrial uses, typically near residential areas. The standards
       shown in Table 8-4 (which address short-term noise events) should be used to determine the
       compatibility between individual facilities and nearby homes. Please refer to Figure 8-5 for the
       location of where such standards are most appropriately employed.
       Noise Monitoring. Additional noise monitoring was conducted in February 2000 at several
       locations near other industrial facilities in the community, including the lumber manufacturing
       plant along Taylor Road and at several locations along Swetzer Road. Noise monitoring was
       conducted as far as possible from the roadways themselves, owing to the limitations of the site.
       Typically, monitoring stations were from 50 to 150 feet from the nearest roadways. In general,
       ambient roadway noise dominated the measurements, particularly for locations along Taylor
       Road, particularly near Interstate 80. Swetzer Road carries substantially less traffic than either
       Taylor Road or Interstate 80, and thus noise reading along that roadway provide a generally better
       reflection of adjacent industrial activities. However, a Union Pacific rail line runs parallel to
       Swetzer Road. Although no trains passed during noise sampling, it is reasonable to conclude that
       passing trains would dominate the noise environment at this location.
       In general, the results of noise monitoring at industrial locations were inconclusive. Truck
       activity associated with industrial operations appeared to be the greatest contributing factor to the
       noise environment. Ambient noise levels of 50 to 55 dBA Leq were recorded at all locations
       along Swetzer Road. Along Taylor Road, ambient noise levels were typically 60-65 dBA Leq.
       The variation can in part be accounted for local conditions, the varying proximity of monitoring
       locations to roadways, and activities on the sites. No unusual noise sources were noted or

       recorded during monitoring activities. Truck activities at each site, including braking and horn
       noises, appeared to be the primary contributors to the onsite noise environment.
       It should be noted that the Town cannot reasonably model or characterize all industrial facilities
       in the community within the context of the Noise Element. There is too much variation from site
       to site to provide a meaningful analysis of this issue. Instead, the Noise Element provides the
       direction for the locations where detailed acoustical studies should be conducted (see Figure 8-5).
        The following paragraphs present the results of other noise studies at industrial facilities,
       intended in part to corroborate the information presented for facilities in Loomis.
       Corroborative Studies. In other detailed studies conducted for industrial facilities near major
       roadways, the results have been similar. For example, continuous noise sampling was conducted
       over a two-day period for a 1999 study of an equipment rental yard near U.S. 101 in Ventura
       County (Quinn Noise Study, Rincon Consultants, 1999). That study found that the ambient
       hourly Leq was relatively stable during the daytime hours of 6:00 am to 7:00 pm, ranging from
       65.3 to 67.1 dBA. Sound levels gradually dropped during the evening hours from a high of 64.6
       dBA during the 7:00 pm hour to 63.2 in the 9:00 pm hour, and continued to drop during the
       nighttime hours to a low of 57.0 dBA during the 3:00 am hour. This is similar to what might be
       experienced within several hundred feet of Interstate 80 in Loomis.
       The noise generation of concern at most industrial facilities is the loading of and pass-by through
       of heavy equipment delivery trucks. In the Quinn study, measurements of a typical heavy-duty
       truck that would be used as a delivery vehicle showed the sound level during idling was 70.3
       dBA at 25 feet from the centerline of the source, dropping to about 58 dBA at 100 feet from the
       source. This is less than the ambient background noise levels at the Quinn site location, which
       suggests roadway noise was a greater concern than industrial noise. That study presents a similar
       condition to what might be expected at industrial facilities near Taylor Road or Interstate 80.
       Other Stationary Noise Sources. Several other facilities in the community may also present
       stationary noise. Such facilities include dog kennels, commercial operations, high school football
       games, and other public gathering involving music or loudspeakers. A 1999 acoustical study for
       a proposed dog kennel at 3994 Del Mar Avenue found barking dogs at that facility would
       produce a noise level of about 51.5 dB at the nearest residence (a distance of about 400 feet).
       Based on the standards shown in Table 8-4, dog barking at this location was found to exceed the
       50 dB standard, and mitigation was recommended (1-5 minute duration, with a 5 dB penalty for
       the repetitive quality of the barking).
       Other dog kennels in the community would likely have similar noise characteristics. However,
       because of flexibility in land use controls, it is impossible to predict where other kennels may
       locate in the future. Thus, it is impossible to produce meaningful noise contours for this activity.
       High school football games and other activities (such as band practice) are occasionally staged at
       the Del Oro High School football stadium. The most adverse noise impacts are experienced
       during the fall months because of football season. Because events generally occur in the evening,
       between 7:00 pm and midnight, and attract large crowds, the impacts from this type of event are
       expected to be significant. Noise could be generated during these events from multiple sources at
       varying degrees throughout the season and throughout the duration of each event. Examples of
       these sources include crowd participation, music being played by the band, air horns and the
       announcement of the event over the loud speaker.

       To estimate the noise impacts of a stadium in the area, a noise survey was conducted by Brown-
       Buntin and Associates, in 1988 and 1992, at three high school stadiums in Bakersfield. The
       measurements were taken at a distance of 400 feet from the center of the stadium. Table 8-8
       shows the average noise levels from the three Bakersfield stadiums at the reference distance of
       400 feet. All of the stadiums had playing fields at the same elevation as the surrounding ground
       with bleachers. An assumption that there is a 6 dB reduction for every doubling of distance from
       a point source of noise was made and this information was interpreted to establish the noise
       contour lines for the stadium. Based on this data, Table 8-9 shows the estimated noise contours
       around the stadium. In general, only residential areas within 537 feet of the stadium experience
       noise levels that exceed the Town’s 60 dBA Ldn standard.

·      Sensitive Receptors. Noise exposure goals for various types of land uses reflect the varying
       noise sensitivities associated with those uses. Residences, hospitals, schools, guest lodging,
       libraries, churches and parks are most sensitive to noise intrusion and therefore have more
       stringent noise exposure targets than manufacturing or agricultural uses that are not subject to
       such impacts as sleep disturbance.
       The relative sensitivity of various land uses is illustrated in the state’s noise compatibility
       guidelines, shown previously in Figure 8-4.
       Community Noise Survey. Appendix A of the Guidelines For the Preparation and Content of
       the Noise Element of the General Plan requests that a community noise survey be included as
       part of the element. The Guidelines do not specify the form of the survey. Typically, when a
       “survey” is included in a Noise Element, it generally means that the existing noise environment
       of the community has been characterized in broad terms. Sample noise measurements for the
       various noise sources affecting a community also help fulfill the intent of the community noise
       survey. In this Noise Element, noise measurements have been conducted for road, rail and
       stationary noise sources as discussed in previous portions of this element.

        In addition, a Noise Element can contain a brief record of recent complaints or known noise
        nuisances that affect the community. In general, the primary noise issues cited by the community
        in workshops for the General Plan update are Interstate 80 and the rail lines (see the Background
        Technical Report). Industrial and other stationary noise sources have historically been cited by
        community members, typically through occasional complaints to the Town. As a recent example,
        an acoustical analysis was performed for a proposed expansion of a dog kennel (All Pets
        Boarding Kennels) on Del Mar Avenue, in part because of community concerns. Other
        acoustical analyses for various facilities have been performed for similar reasons. Industrial
        facilities that have been noted by various members of the community as potential noise concerns
        include the Pool Diggers Excavation Company (3348 Swetzer Court) and the proposed
        PrePlastics facility at the corner of Swetzer Road and Jetton Lane. In general, the industrial
        facilities along the Swetzer Road area have been noted as a potential noise source by the
        community. Similarly, some of the older industrial facilities along Taylor Road, including the
        lumber manufacturing plant along that roadway, have been noted as community concerns.
D.      Future Noise Levels
Future noise levels in the community are based on an anticipated increase of traffic and rail operations,
as well as industrial noise or nuisance noise that may result from land development in the community.
Traffic increases may be predicted based on cumulative buildout of the Town and surrounding
communities. Please refer to the Circulation Element for this information. Increases in rail operations
are based on communication with rail officials at Union Pacific and Amtrak. Future industrial-related
noise would be more difficult to predict, because not all industrial uses produce substantial noise. In
some cases, non-industrial uses could produce nuisance noise that could affect nearby noise-sensitive
uses, typically homes. The likely noise levels from each noise source is discussed below.
·       Roadways. Continued land development in Loomis and neighboring communities will result in
        traffic increases on major roadways. Such increases will result in increased noise levels on area
        roadways. As is currently the case, Interstate 80 would be by far the greatest contributor to
        overall roadway noise in the community. However, much of this increase may be attributed to
        future development outside the community, especially in the cases of Interstate 80 and Sierra
        College Boulevard. Assuming no barrier attenuation, areas within about 0.4 miles of the freeway
        would be subject to noise levels in excess of 60 dBA Ldn without mitigation. Areas within about
        0.2 miles of Sierra College Boulevard would also be subject to noise levels that exceed the
        adopted standard. Table 8-10 and Figure 8-5 show projected noise levels and contours within the
        Town, based on projected buildout under the Land Use Element.
·       Rail traffic. The Union Pacific Railroad currently has no plans for expanding its existing
        facilities. However, the number of rail operations is likely to increase. Based on recent input
        from Union Pacific officials, by 2020 the number of daily train operations are anticipated to
        increase from the current 8 to 14 trains to as many as 14 to 24. About 5 to 8 of these trains
        (roughly one-third) would operate during nighttime hours (10pm to 7am). This analysis assumes
        the worst case, that is 24 trains, with 8 at night, or 12 trains (4 at night) in each direction. The
        composition of future trains would be similar to what currently exists, about 3 to 4 engines with
        an average of 100 freight cars. Because the composition of freight trains would remain similar to
        existing trains, measured SEL for existing trains can be used to estimate future noise levels along
        rail lines.
        Amtrak has not indicated any expanded service plans for this rail corridor. However, to account
        for a possible expansion of passenger train service, this analysis assumes that two additional
                                                     148

       trains may use the rail line, one of which could operate at night. This would bring the total
       number of operations to six trains (three in each direction), five of which would pass through the
       Town during the day or early evening.

       Based on the methodology to calculate existing rail noise, the calculated future noise contour
       distances from each rail line are shown in Table 8-11. These contours are depicted graphically in
       Figure 8-5. It should be noted that nearly all of the rail noise will be a result of freight traffic.
       The noise contributed by passenger trains is considered negligible.
       It should also be noted that a substantial noise increase is not anticipated, even though the
       number of future operations is expected to increase substantially. This is because the number of
       nighttime operations is not expected to increase significantly over existing numbers. Nighttime
       operations are heavily weighted in the calculation of rail noise levels.

·      Stationary Noise Sources. Future stationary noise sources in the community are likely to be
       similar to those that already exist. The updated General Plan would likely accommodate
       additional industrial or commercial activities that could result in an increase in stationary source
       noise activity. However, it is impossible to predict the magnitude and specific location of
       potential noise conflicts associated with future development. Instead, the Noise Element can only
       note where future noise conflicts may occur, based on the proposed Land Use diagram. Such
       areas are highlighted on Figure 8-5, and are briefly listed below:
        1.     Residential/Industrial interface, between Swetzer Road and Arcadia Avenue;
        2.     Residential/Commercial/Industrial interface along Taylor Road, north of King Road;
        3.     Residential/Commercial interface south of Laird Street and David Avenue, north of I-80;
        4.     Residential/Commercial interface near Sierra College Boulevard, north of Taylor; and
        5.     Residential/Commercial interface along Brace Road and Secret Ravine Creek.
       These areas are likely to experience noise conflicts as development occurs. Other localized areas
       of potential noise conflict may also exist, if there are non-conforming industrial uses near
       residential development. Development in all such areas, particularly those listed above, is subject
       to compliance with noise standards shown in both Tables 8-3 and 8-4, which address average
       daily noise levels and noise events of a shorter duration.
       It is not possible to project future stationary source noise levels associated with new development
       in these areas. Unlike roadway noise, which is a continuous noise source that can be accurately
       modeled, it is not possible to develop meaningful noise contours that could provide useful
       planning tools in the context of a Noise Element.

E.     Issues, Goals, Policies, and Implementation Measures
Issues
·      Increased volumes of local and commuter traffic on Town arterial roadways and rail corridors
       create noise impacting residential frontage properties.
Goals
1.     To protect Town residents and workers from the harmful and annoying effects of noise.
2.     To mitigate the effects of noise created by roadway traffic and non-residential land uses while
       discouraging the construction of sound walls.
3.     To maintain and where possible enhance the quiet, rural ambiance of the Town.
4.     To minimize the noise effect of railroad operations on residential uses and other sensitive land
       uses.
Policies
1.     New commercial and industrial development in the Town shall be sited and designed to minimize
       the potential for harmful or annoying noise to create conflict with existing land uses.
2.     Loomis shall encourage the mitigation of noise impacts in all new developments as necessary to
       maintain the quiet, rural ambiance of the Town.
3.     An acoustical analysis shall be required for new residential structures located within the projected
       noise contour of 65 dBA Ldn, showing that the structures have been designed to limit intruding
       noise in interior rooms to an annual level of 45 dBA Ldn.
4.     Individual noise exposure analysis shall be required for proposed development projects as part of
       the environmental review process, to ensure that the Town'   s noise standards are meet. The use of
       mitigation measures (noise buffers, sound insulation) may be required to reduce noise impacts to
       acceptable levels.
5.     Loomis shall discourage the construction of sound walls to mitigate noise impacts, unless it is the
       only feasible alternative. New sensitive noise receptors shall not be permitted if the only feasible
       mitigation for noise impacts is a sound wall.
6.     Where noise mitigation is necessary, the following order of preference among options shall be
       considered: distance from the noise source; muffling of the noise source; design and orientation
       of the receptor; landscaped berms; landscaped berms in combination with walls.
7.     Use the land use/noise compatibility matrix shown on Figure 8-4 to determine the appropriate
       ness of land uses relative to roadway noise.
8.     Work with Caltrans to install mitigation elements along freeways and highways adjacent to
       existing residential subdivisions or noise-sensitive uses to reduce noise impacts.

9.     Provide for alternative transportation modes such as bicycle paths and pedestrian walkways to
       minimize the number of automobile trips.
10.    Require that new equipment and vehicles purchased by the Town comply with noise performance
       standards consistent with the best available noise reduction technology.
11.    Work with public transit agencies to ensure that the buses, vans, and other vehicles used do not
       generate excessive noise levels.
12.    Consider the use of rubberized asphalt paving material for future road paving and re-paving.
       Studies have indicated that such paving material can result in a 3 to 5 dBA reduction in noise.
13.    Consider the use of traffic calming devices to reduce traffic noise in residential areas, when
       supported by the residential community in question.
14.    Work with the Union Pacific Railroad to properly maintain lines and establish operational
       restrictions during the early morning and late evening hours to reduce impacts in residential areas
       and other noise sensitive areas.
15.    Require that automobile and truck access to industrial and commercial properties adjacent to
       residential areas be located at the maximum practical distance from the residential area.
16.    Require that when no other feasible location for industrial or commercial use parking exists other
       than adjacent to residential uses, the parking shall be buffered from the residential uses by
       barriers.
17.    Limit the use of leaf blowers, motorized lawn mowers, parking lot sweepers, or other high-noise
       equipment on commercial properties if their activity will result in noise which adversely affects
       residential areas.
18.    Require that the hours of truck deliveries to industrial and commercial properties adjacent to
       residential uses be limited to daytime hours unless there is no feasible alternative or there are
       overriding transportation benefits by scheduling deliveries at night.
19.    Require that construction activities adjacent to residential units be limited as necessary to prevent
       adverse noise impacts.
20.    Future industrial or commercial development in areas determined to be near noise-sensitive land
       uses shall be subject to an acoustical analysis to determine the potential for stationary source
       noise impacts to neighboring land uses.
Implementation Measures
1.     Establish exterior land use noise compatibility standards in the Zoning Ordinance for all new
       development based on the guidelines shown on Figure 8-4 and Table 8-3 of this Element.
2.     Incorporate in the Zoning Ordinance requirements that limit maximum interior levels to 45 dBA
       Ldn in all new residential construction.
                                                  154

3.     For new development within the generalized 65 dBA Ldn noise contour as shown in Figure 8-5
       of this Element, project applicants shall fund site-specific noise studies to mitigate project
       impacts. The determination of whether a project site is within the 65 dBA Ldn contour is the
       responsibility of the Planning Department. The required noise analysis shall:
       a.     Include field measurements by a qualified environmental scientist/acoustical engineer to
              determine a more precise location of existing and projected future noise levels (based on
              traffic projections included in the Circulation Element or as accepted by the Town); and
       b.     Identify and commit to measures to mitigate noise impacts (by siting of structure outside of
              high noise levels, insulation, attenuation, walls or buffers, landscape, or other acceptable
              techniques) if within the 65 dBA contour.
4.     When development is subject to high noise levels requiring mitigation, the following measures
       shall be considered and preference shall be given where feasible in the following order:
       a.     Site layout, including setbacks, open space separation and shielding of noise sensitive uses
              with non-noise-sensitive uses.
       b.     Acoustical treatment of buildings.
       c.     Structural measures: construction of earthen berms and/or wood or concrete barriers.
5.     Incorporate into the Zoning Ordinance standards that protect inhabitants from impacts of exterior
       noise, prevent the transference of interior noise to the outside, prevent transference of noise
       between residential units and individual businesses in multi-tenant buildings, and prevent
       transference of noise between commercial and residential uses in mixed structures. Standards for
       insulation, windows, building materials, walls and roofs shall be included.
6.     Include in the Zoning Ordinance standards and requirements for parking structures and lots to
       prevent noise effects on-site and on adjacent noise sensitive uses. These could include the use of
       buffers containing landscape and/or sound walls, use of sound absorbing materials to minimize
       sound amplification and transmission, enclosure of the façade of parking structures facing a
       residence, limitation of the hours of operation of surrounding surface parking lots, and other
       appropriate techniques.
7.     The Town shall review development proposals according to their potential noise impacts on
       abutting uses and impacts by abutting uses in accordance with the standards and requirements
       stipulated by this Element and incorporated into the Zoning Ordinance.
8.     The Town shall consider the use of temporary noise barriers, limited hours of operation, limiting
       times of year for construction near schools to reduce construction-related noise.
9.     The Town shall review the street layout of proposed residential subdivisions with the objective of
       reducing traffic volumes and through trips as a means to reduce noise levels. The use of road
       dips, diagonal parking, one-way streets, and other traffic controls and traffic calming devices
       shall be considered to reduce vehicular travel and speed, provided that engineering and safety
       standards are met. If determined to be feasible, rubberized asphalt paving material may be
       required for new roads.
10.    Speed limits are legally set in accordance with the prevailing speed of traffic based on
       engineering studies. However, when feasible, consistent and necessary, the reduction of speed
       limits on arterials should be used to decrease ambient noise levels.

11.    The Town shall evaluate the noise impacts of vehicles on adjacent residential properties as a part
       of the development and environmental review process for all commercial and manufacturing
       uses. Where vehicles would have the potential to create noise exceeding 60 dBA Ldn at an
       adjacent noise sensitive use, the inclusion of noise mitigation techniques such as the use of sound
       wall or enclosure of delivery areas shall be required.
12.    To reduce noise associated with truck traffic, the Town shall implement the following noise
       reduction strategies:
       a.     The Town and Caltrans should consider limitations on hours of operation and other truck
              operations that could be limited to reduce noise impacts.
       b.     The Town should encourage the use of established designated truck routes that avoid
              residential areas and confine truck traffic to major thoroughfares. Designated truck routes
              must be followed.
       c.     The Town shall post designated areas and times to prohibit the use of jake brakes along
              established truck routes adjacent to sensitive uses.
13.    Support the efforts of the California Department of Transportation and local transportation
       agencies in developing noise reduction measures for Interstate 80, including sound barrier walls,
       if no feasible alternatives exist.
14.    Maintain a data file documenting existing and future noise conditions, using the contour map
       contained in this Plan. As noise assessments are conducted for proposed projects or other noise
       studies are performed, the data base shall be updated. The noise data shall be updated entirely at
       least once every five years.
15.    Work with railroad operators to determine when noise controls may be necessary due to the
       adjacency of railroad lines to residential uses.
16.    The Town shall enforce the State Noise Insulation Standards (California Code of Regulations,
       Title 24) and Chapter 35 of the Uniform Building Code (UBC).
17.    Future industrial or commercial development in areas determined to be near noise-sensitive land
       uses, as shown in Figure 8-4, shall be subject to an acoustical analysis at the discretion of the
       Planning Director, to determine the potential for stationary source noise impacts to neighboring
       land uses.
18.    Where noise-sensitive land uses are proposed in areas exposed to existing or projected noise
       levels in excessive of the standards contained in Tables 8-3 and 8-4. The Town shall require an
       acoustical analysis as part of the environmental review process so that noise mitigation may be
       included in the project design. At the discretion of the Planning Director, the requirement for an
       acoustical analysis may be waived if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
       a.     The development is for less than five single-family dwellings or less than 10,000 square
              feet of total gross floor area for office buildings, churches, or meeting halls;
       b.     The noise source in question consists of a single roadway or railroad for which up-to-date
              noise exposure information is available. An acoustical analysis will be required if the
              noise source is a stationary noise source, or if there are multiple noise sources that could
              affect the project;
                                                     156

       c.    The projected future noise exposure at the exterior of proposed buildings or outdoor
             activity areas does not exceed 65 dBA Ldn;
       d.    The topography of the area is essentially flat; and
       e.    Effective noise mitigation, as determined by the Planning Director, is incorporated into the
             project design. Such measures can include, but are not limited to, the use of building
             setbacks, building orientation, noise barriers. If closed windows are required for
             compliance with interior noise level standards, air conditioning or a mechanical ventilation
             system will be required.
19.    The Town shall develop standards for acceptable nuisance noise levels for both day and night.

Consistent. Free from variation or contradiction. Programs in the General Plan are to be consistent, not contradictory
or preferential. State law requires consistency between a General Plan and implementation measures such as the
zoning ordinance.
Core Concept. The land use planning concept that represents the Town of Loomis, where higher-intensity uses are
concentrated within and adjacent to the downtown, along Taylor Road, and adjacent to Interstate 80 (I-80), with the
land uses in surrounding areas becoming progressively less intense (and with lower residential densities) as the distance

noise is actually ten times more intense.
Dedication. The turning over by an owner or developer of private land for public use, and the acceptance of land for
such use by the governmental agency having jurisdiction over the public function for which it will be used. Dedications
for roads, parks, school sites, or other public uses often are made conditions for approval of a development by a city or
county.
Dedication, In lieu of. Cash payments that may be required of an owner or developer as a substitute for a dedication of
land, usually calculated in dollars per lot, and referred to as in lieu fees or in lieu contributions.
Density, Residential. The number of permanent residential dwelling units per acre of land. Densities specified in the
General Plan may be expressed in units per gross acre or per net developable acre. (See "Acres, Gross," and

Density, Control of. A limitation on the occupancy of land. Density can be controlled through zoning in the following
ways: use restrictions, minimum lot-size requirements, floor area ratios, land use-intensity ratios, setback and yard
requirements, minimum house-size requirements, ratios comparing number and types of housing units to land area,
limits on units per acre, and other means. Allowable density often serves as the major distinction between residential
districts.
Density, Employment. A measure of the number of employed persons per specific area (for example, employees/acre).
Density Transfer. A way of retaining open space by concentrating densities usually in compact areas adjacent to
existing urbanization and utilities while leaving unchanged historic, sensitive, or hazardous areas. In some
jurisdictions, for example, developers can buy development rights of properties targeted for public open space and
transfer the additional density to the base number of units permitted in the zone in which they propose to develop.
Design Review; Design Control. The comprehensive evaluation of a development and its impact on neighboring
properties and the community as a whole, from the standpoint of site and landscape design, architecture, materials,
colors, lighting, and signs, in accordance with a set of adopted criteria and standards. "Design Control" requires that
certain specific things be done and that other things not be done. Design Control language is most often found within a
zoning ordinance. "Design Review" usually refers to a system set up outside of the zoning ordinance, whereby projects
are reviewed against certain standards and criteria by a specially established design review board or committee. (See
"Architectural Control.")
Destination Retail. Retail businesses that generate a special purpose trip and that do not necessarily benefit from a
high-volume pedestrian location.

physical building space for use primarily by others, and in which the preparation of the land or the creation of the
building space is in itself a business and is not incidental to another business or activity.
Development. The physical extension and/or construction of urban land uses. Development activities include:
subdivision of land; construction or alteration of structures, roads, utilities, and other facilities; installation of septic
systems; grading; deposit of refuse, debris, or fill materials; and clearing of natural vegetative cover (with the exception
of agricultural activities). Routine repair and maintenance activities are exempted.
Development Fee. (See "Impact Fee.")
Development Rights. The right to develop land by a land owner who maintains fee-simple ownership over the land or
by a party other than the owner who has obtained the rights to develop. Such rights usually are expressed in terms of
density allowed under existing zoning. For example, one development right may equal one unit of housing or may
equal a specific number of square feet of gross floor area in one or more specified zone districts. (See "Interest, Fee"
and "Interest, Less-than-fee," and "Development Rights, Transfer of [TDR].")
Development Rights, Transfer of (TDR). Also known as "Transfer of Development Credits," a program that can
relocate potential development from areas where proposed land use or environmental impacts are considered
undesirable (the "donor" site) to another ("receiver") site chosen on the basis of its ability to accommodate additional
units of development beyond that for which it was zoned, with minimal environmental, social, and aesthetic impacts.
(See "Development Rights.")
Discourage. To advise or persuade to refrain from.

Discretionary Decision. As used in CEQA, an action taken by a governmental agency that calls for the exercise of
judgment in deciding whether to approve and/or how to carry out a project.
Diversity. Differences among otherwise similar elements that give them unique forms and qualities. E.g., housing
diversity can be achieved by differences in unit size, tenure, or cost.
Duplex. A detached building under single ownership that is designed for occupation as the residence of two families
living independently of each other.
Dwelling Unit. A room or group of rooms (including sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation facilities, but not more
than one kitchen), which constitutes an independent housekeeping unit, occupied or intended for occupancy by one
household on a long-term basis.
Easement. Usually the right to use property owned by another for specific purposes or to gain access to another
property. For example, utility companies often have easements on the private property of individuals to be able to
install and maintain utility facilities.
Easement, Conservation. A tool for acquiring open space with less than full-fee purchase, whereby a public agency
buys only certain specific rights from the land owner. These may be positive rights (providing the public with the
opportunity to hunt, fish, hike, or ride over the land), or they may be restrictive rights (limiting the uses to which the
land owner may devote the land in the future.)
Easement, Scenic. A tool that allows a public agency to use an owner'   s land for scenic enhancement, such as roadside
landscaping or vista preservation.
Ecology. The interrelationship of living things to one another and their environment; the study of such
interrelationships.
Economic Base. Economic Base theory essentially holds that the structure of the economy is made up of two broad
classes of productive effort basic activities that produce and distribute goods and services for export to firms and
individuals outside a defined localized economic area, and nonbasic activities whose goods and services are consumed
at home within the boundaries of the local economic area. Viewed another way, basic activity exports goods and
services and brings new dollars into the area; non-basic activity recirculates dollars within the area. This distinction
holds that the reason for the growth of a particular region is its capacity to provide the means of payment for raw
materials, food, and services that the region cannot produce itself and also support the nonbasic activities that are
principally local in productive scope and market area. (See "Industry, Basic" and "Industry, Non-basic.")
Ecosystem. An interacting system formed by a biotic community and its physical environment.
Emergency Shelter. A facility that provides immediate and short-term housing and supplemental services for the
homeless. Shelters come in many sizes, but an optimum size is considered to be 20 to 40 beds. Supplemental services
may include food, counseling, and access to other social programs. (See "Homeless" and "Transitional Housing.")
Eminent Domain. The right of a public entity to acquire private property for public use by condemnation, and the
payment of just compensation.
Emission Standard. The maximum amount of pollutant legally permitted to be discharged from a single source, either
mobile or stationary.
Encourage. To stimulate or foster a particular condition through direct or indirect action by the private sector or
government agencies.
Endangered Species. A species of animal or plant is considered to be endangered when its prospects for survival and
reproduction are in immediate jeopardy from one or more causes.
Enhance. To improve existing conditions by increasing the quantity or quality of beneficial uses or features.

Floor Area Ratio (FAR). The gross floor area permitted on a site divided by the total net area of the site, expressed in
decimals to one or two places. For example, on a site with 10,000 net sq. ft. of land area, a Floor Area Ratio of 1.0 will
allow a maximum of 10,000 gross sq. ft. of building floor area to be built. On the same site, an FAR of 1.5 would
allow 15,000 sq. ft. of floor area; an FAR of 2.0 would allow 20,000 sq. ft.; and an FAR of 0.5 would allow only 5,000
sq. ft. Also commonly used in zoning, FARs typically are applied on a parcel-by-parcel basis as opposed to an average
FAR for an entire land use or zoning district.

Home Occupation. A commercial activity conducted solely by the occupants of a particular dwelling unit in a manner
incidental to residential occupancy.
Homeless. Persons and families who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. Includes those staying in
temporary or emergency shelters or who are accommodated with friends or others with the understanding that shelter is
being provided as a last resort. California Housing Element law, Section 65583(c)(1) requires all cities and counties to
address the housing needs of the homeless. (See "Emergency Shelter" and "Transitional Housing.")
Hotel. A facility in which guest rooms or suites are offered to the general public for lodging with or without meals and
for compensation, and where no provision is made for cooking in any individual guest room or suite. (See "Motel.")
Household. All those persons--related or unrelated--who occupy a single housing unit. (See "Family.")
Householder. The head of a household.
Households, Number of. The count of all year-round housing units occupied by one or more persons. The concept of
household is important because the formation of new households generates the demand for housing. Each new
household formed creates the need for one additional housing unit or requires that one existing housing unit be shared
by two households. Thus, household formation can continue to take place even without an increase in population,
thereby increasing the demand for housing.

manage other forms of affordable housing.
Housing Element. One of the seven State-mandated elements of a local General Plan, it assesses the existing and
projected housing needs of all economic segments of the community, identifies potential sites adequate to provide the
amount and kind of housing needed, and contains adopted goals, policies, and implementation programs for the
preservation, improvement, and development of housing. Under State law, Housing Elements must be updated every
five years.
Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of (HUD). A cabinet-level department of the federal government

wetlands are defined as "those areas meeting certain criteria for hydrology, vegetation, and soils."
Wildlife Refuge. An area maintained in a natural state for the preservation of both animal and plant life.
Williamson Act. Known formally as the California Land Conservation Act of 1965, it was designed as an incentive to
retain prime agricultural land and open space in agricultural use, thereby slowing its conversion to urban and suburban
development. The program entails a 10-year contract between the City or County and an owner of land whereby the
land is taxed on the basis of its agricultural use rather than the market value. The land becomes subject to certain
enforceable restrictions, and certain conditions need to be met prior to approval of an agreement.
