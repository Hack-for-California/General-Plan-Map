MOBILITY ELEMENT
The  current  City  of  Santee  General  Plan  2020  was  adopted  in  2003  by  Resolution  63‐2003  to 
guide development through the year 2020.  This document serves as an update to the General 
Plan’s Circulation Element, intended to provide a vision and framework for the development of 
the  City’s  transportation  network  through  the  year  2035,  while  assuming  full  buildout  of  the 
current General Plan land uses. The purpose of the Circulation Element is to identify policies and 
programs to promote the effective use of transportation facilities to efficiently and safely move 
people and goods throughout the City.  
 
This  update  describes  existing  transportation  systems  in  Santee  and  establishes  a  plan  for  a 
multi‐modal  transportation  system.  Multi‐modal  transportation  refers  to  the  many  different 
modes of travel including vehicular, pedestrian, bicycle, and transit.  This Element is intended to 
provide  for  a  balanced  mobility  system  that  will  support  travel  demands  associated  with  land 
uses in the Land Use Element while maintaining a high quality of life for the residents of Santee 
and all roadway users.  As a result, this element will be referred to as the Mobility Element this 
point forward.  
 
1.0 Statutory Requirements
The  Mobility  Element  is  required  by  state  law.  As  specified  in  Government  Code  Section 
65302(b),  the  Mobility  Element  must  define  location  and  extent  of  existing  and  proposed 
transportation  facilities  and  services,  all  correlated  with  the  Land  Use  Element  of  the  General 
Plan. The State of California is in the midst of a radical transformation that will forever change 
transportation planning, and more importantly, how generations to come travel across the state. 
 
In the mid‐2000’s, AB 32 introduced mandatory GHG emission reduction requirements; followed 
by  the  Complete  Streets  Act  in  2008,  requiring  cities  and  counties  to  plan  multi‐modal 
transportation networks that accommodate all travel modes and users.   
 
  AB 1358 – Complete Streets Act 
  Commencing  January  1,  2011,  the  Mobility  Element  of  local  agencies  must  plan  for  a 
  balanced, multimodal transportation network that meets the needs of all users of all streets, 
  roads  and  highways,  defined  to  include  bicyclists,  children,  persons  with  disabilities, 
  motorists,  movers  of  commercial  goods,  pedestrians,  users  of  public  transportation,  and 
                                                                                                                     
 
In  2014,  Caltrans  formally  endorsed  the  National  Association  of  City  Transportation  Officials’ 
(NACTO) guidelines, which include innovative bicycle facilities and pedestrian walkways, as part 
of  an  effort  to  provide  flexibility  in  potential  active  travel  infrastructure  and  to  increase  the 
sustainability  of  California’s  transportation  system.    These  changes  reflect  a  continued  shift  in 
California’s  transportation‐related  institutional  foundation  that  promises  to  create  healthier, 
cleaner, lower‐resource consuming, and better connected communities.

                                                                                                     City of Santee 
                                                                                                  Mobility Element 

 
                                                                                                                
 
In  2014,  SANDAG  adopted  the  Regional  Complete Streets Policy,  as  a  means  to  encourage  the 
development of a regional transportation system that is safe, useful and attractive for motorists, 
pedestrians,  bicyclists,  transit  users,  and  freight  movement.    This  policy  complements  the 
existing regional planning framework based on smart growth and sustainability, and provides a 
regional level response to the State’s adoption of AB 1358. 
In September of 2013, Governor Jerry Brown signed SB 743, making several changes to California 
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) procedures for projects located in areas targeted for transit‐
oriented  development.  SB  743  allows  for  an  exemption  from  CEQA  for  projects  that  meet  the 
following four requirements:  
 
      a residential, employment center, or mixed‐use project;  
      located within a transit priority area;  
      consistent  with  a  specific  plan  for  which  an  environmental  impact  report  was  certified; 
        and  
      consistent  with  an  adopted  sustainable  communities  strategy  or  alternative  planning 
        strategy.  
 
Additionally,  a  project’s  aesthetic  and  parking  impacts  will  no  longer  be  considered  significant 
impacts if the project is located on an infill site within a transit priority area.  Recognizing that 
vehicular  Level  of  Service  (LOS)  often  results  in  roadway  improvements  that  benefit  vehicular 
travel at the expense of other modes, SB 743 also directs the Governor’s Office of Planning (OPR) 
and  Research  to  amend  the  CEQA  guidelines  to  provide  an  alternative  to  vehicular  Level  of 
Service (LOS) for evaluating transportation impacts. The intent of SB 743 is to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions from vehicles by encouraging smart growth and infill development. 
 
These initiatives reflect a growing recognition of the need to develop a balanced mobility system 
that offers more alternatives to driving coupled with a land use plan that supports multi‐modal 
transportation options. OPR is developing CEQA Guidelines Implementing Senate Bill 743. 
 
2.0 Major Accomplishments Since Adoption of the General
        Plan

3.0 Introduction
The City of Santee's mobility system plays a major role in shaping the future form and character 
of the City by connecting various land uses, such as commercial, industrial, housing, recreational 
and  public  uses.  The  purpose  of  the  transportation  system  is  to  provide  a  safe,  efficient  and 
serviceable  circulation  network  that  ensures  the  movement  of  people  and  goods  meets  the 
transportation needs of all sectors of the City.  
 
Santee’s  mobility  network  is  comprised  of  diverse  elements,  including  roadway  and  freeway 
systems,  public  transit  including  bus  and  light  rail,  and  bicycle  and  pedestrian  infrastructure.  
Each transportation mode and supporting facilities play a critical role in serving the current and 
future needs of Santee residents, employees, and visitors. 
 
This Mobility Element provides a summary of the existing physical and operational conditions of 
the mobility system (Section 4.0) and identifies a set of mode‐specific needs to be addressed by 
future improvements (Section 5.0).  A goal for the future of transportation in Santee is defined in 
Section  6.0,  along  with  objectives  and  policies,  intended  to  help  achieve  the  goal  and  address 
community  needs  and  support  the  recommended  improvements  by  providing  the  necessary 
                                                     Page 3 
                                                                                                  City of Santee 
                                                                                               Mobility Element 

 
                                                                                                                
legislative  backing.    Finally,  this  Mobility  Element  concludes  with  an  implementation  plan  in 
Section  7.0  which  identifies  potential  funding  sources,  maintenance  considerations,  and 
mechanisms to help usher the recommendations from the planning stage into application. 
 
Relationship  to  Other  Elements  –  The  Mobility  Element  must  be  closely  coordinated  with  the 
Land Use, Community Design, Noise, Scenic Highways, and Housing Elements because mobility 
planning and city planning efforts are closely related. Freeways, arterials and collectors must be 
capable of meeting future traffic demands. 
 
Thought also needs to be given to how the mobility system will look, since the appearance of the 
mobility  system  not  only  affects  the  efficiency  of  traffic  circulation,  but  also  contributes  to 
definition of the image of the City to residents and visitors. 
 
Mobility  planning  should  provide  for  safe  and  efficient  movement,  while  discouraging 
unnecessary traffic movement and noise in residential neighborhoods. This can be accomplished 
by  effectively  designing  traffic  routes  according  to  their  functions,  while  maintaining  design 
sensitivity to surrounding land uses. 
 
In  addition,  mobility  planning  for  the  local  community  must  be  integrated  into  regional 
transportation  planning  efforts  to  address  energy  conservation,  noise,  existing  and  alternative 
modes of transportation and other environmental effects on a regional level. 
 
4.0 Existing Conditions
The movement of people and goods within an urban environment can be categorized into two 
basic  elements:  the  mode  used  for  travel,  and  the  mobility  system  that  accommodates  such 
mode.  In  Santee,  the  mobility  system  takes  the  form  of  a  hierarchy  of  streets  and  pathways 
ranging  from  freeways  to  pedestrian  walkways  over  which  people  and  goods  move  between 
communities and within the community. 
 
This  Existing  Conditions  section  summarizes  the  physical  conditions  of  the  existing  mobility 
system.    The  discussion  includes  an  overview  of  existing  conditions  for  Streets  and  Freeway 
System, mass transit, carpooling, bicycle circulation, airports, and pedestrian circulation.  The key 
terms and methodologies utilized for conducting these analyses are presented in the Technical 
Report  provided  in  Appendix  A.    The  conclusions  drawn  from  this  analysis  were  utilized  to 
support a decision making process for formulating network recommendations.  
 
4.1      Streets and Freeway System
The roadway network in Santee is comprised of regional facilities, such as SR‐52, SR‐67, and SR‐
125,  as  well  as  numerous  arterials  and  local  streets.    North‐south  travel  through  Santee  is 
primarily  provided  by  Magnolia  Avenue  and  Cuyamaca  Street,  as  well  as  SR‐67  and  SR‐125.  
While  east‐west  travel  is  provided  for  mainly  by  Mast  Boulevard,  Mission  Gorge  Road,  and 
Prospect  Avenue,  as  well  as  SR‐52.  Overall,  the  City's  circulation  system  is  operating  at 
                                                      Page 4 
                                                                                                 City of Santee 
                                                                                               Mobility Element 

 
                                                                                                                  
acceptable  levels  throughout  the  day,  although  a  few  intersections  in  the  vicinity  of  SR‐52 
interchanges  do  experience  congestion  during  peak  hours.  This  is  largely  due  to  traffic  queues 
backed up from SR‐52 onto surface streets. 
 
The  completion  of  SR‐52  between  SR‐125  and  SR‐67  in  2011  has  helped  tremendously  with 
alleviating traffic on the surface streets in Santee, especially along Mission Gorge Road with daily 
traffic volumes decreasing in the range of 10,000 to 15,000 ADT.  However, this extension along 
with the termination of SR‐125 at SR‐52 result in significant traffic congestion on SR‐52 during 
the commute hours.  The most recent San Diego Forward: The Regional Plan, adopted in October 
2015, indicates two improvement projects which could reduce peak hour congestion along this 
corridor.  These improvements include widening of SR‐52 between Mast Boulevard and SR‐125 
from 4 general purpose lanes to 6 by 2035, and constructing two managed lanes between I‐15 
and SR‐125 by 2050.  Until such improvements are in place, the current congestion will likely to 
remain.

Light Rail Trolley (LRT) 
The City of Santee is served by the Green Line Trolley (Route 530), with one (1) station located at 
the Santee Transit Center. 
 
Green Line is the third line to be constructed in the San Diego Trolley system.  It runs between 
the  Santee  Transit  Center  and  the  12th  and  Imperial  Avenue  Transit  Center  in  Downtown  San

4.3      Bicycling
Bicycle  facilities  are  an  integral  component  of  any  transportation  system.    Adequate  bicycle 
facilities  encourage  active  transportation,  enhance  recreational  opportunities,  and  help  attract 
visitors.  Bikeways  not  only  provide  local  opportunities  for  cyclists,  but  also  offer  regional 
connections.   
 
Table  4.1  presents  the  four  bicycle  classifications  recognized  in  California,  while  Figure  4‐4 
displays the existing bicycle facilities in Santee. 
 
As shown in Figure 4‐3, a combination of Class I, II, and III bicycle facilities create the backbone of 
Santee’s  bicycle  network.    Bicycle  facilities  along  Mast  Boulevard,  Carlton  Oaks  Drive,  Mission 
Gorge Road, and Woodside Avenue provide east‐west connections, while facilities along Carlton 
Hills Boulevard, Cuyamaca Street, and North Magnolia Avenue provide north‐south connections.

  exclusive  use  of  bicycles  and  pedestrians  with 
  crossflows  by  motor  vehicles  minimized.  Bike  paths 
  can  provide  connections  where  roadways  are  non‐
  existent  or  unable  to  support  bicycle  travel.    The 
  minimum  paved  width  for  a  two‐way  bike  path  is  8 
  feet  and  5  feet  for  a  one‐way  bike  path,  with  a 
  minimum  2  foot  wide  graded  area  adjacent  to  the 
  pavement. 
                                                                                                            
  Class II Bikeway (Bike Lane) – Provides a striped lane 
  designated  for  the  exclusive  or  semi‐exclusive  use  of 
  bicycles  with  through  travel  by  motor  vehicles  or 
  pedestrians  prohibited,  but  with  pedestrian  and 
  motor  vehicle  crossflows  permitted.  The  minimum 
  bike  lane  width  where  parking  stalls  are  marked  is  5 
  feet. 
                                                                                                            
  Class  III  Bikeway  (Bike  Route)  –  Provides  shared  use 
  of  traffic  lanes  with  cyclists  and  motor  vehicles, 
  identified  by  signage  and  street  markings  such  as 
  “sharrows”.    Bike  routes  are  best  suited  for  low‐
  speed,  low‐volume  roadways  with  an  outside  lane 
  width of 14 feet or wider. 
                                                                                                            
  Class  IV  Bikeway  (Cycle  Track)  –  Also  referred  to  as 
  separated  bikeways,  cycle  tracks  provide  a  right‐of‐
  way  designated  exclusively  for  bicycle  travel  within 
  the  roadway  and  physically  protected  from  vehicular 
  traffic.    Types  of  separation  include,  but  are  not 
  limited  to,  grade  separation,  flexible  posts,  or  on‐
  street parking.

                                                                                                City of Santee 
                                                                                              Mobility Element 


 
                                                                                                              
 
4.4     Pedestrian Environment
Walkability is an important mobility and quality of life 
consideration for communities.  The degree to which 
people  walk  for  transportation  and  recreation  is 
influenced  by  the  comfort,  safety,  and  convenience.  
Comfort is influenced by traffic volumes, travel speed, 
separation  from  traffic,  topography,  the  presence  of 
sidewalks and improved paths, and climate.  Safety is 
influenced  by  the  speed  and  volume  of  conflicting 
vehicular traffic, street widths, traffic control, number 
of  conflict  points,  and  infrastructure  design.  
Convenience is influenced by distance and directness 
of  travel.    As  connectivity  increases,  travel  distance 
decreases and route option increases for pedestrians. 
 
As funds have become available, the City has installed 
sidewalks  and  pedestrian  ramps  where  they  were 
missing.  The  City  continues  to  pursue  grant  funding 
to improve pedestrian facilities.  
 
Newer streets in the City, particularly within the 
Town Center area as well as along Mission Gorge 
Road,  have  sidewalks  which  are  separated  from  the 
street and designed along landscaped corridors. These designs provide a more pleasant and safe 
pedestrian  experience  and  encourage  pedestrian  travel.  The  City’s  current  policy  is  to  provide 
non‐contiguous sidewalks on all new and widened streets of collector classification or larger. 
 
Within  the  Town  Center  area,  the  Town  Center  Specific  Plan  identifies  a  network  of 
interconnected  bike  and  pathways  linking  activity  centers  within  the  Town  Center,  as  well  as 
linking the Town Center with the bike and pedestrian trail system in the rest of the City.  
 
Pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, curb ramps, and other amenities such as street trees for 
shading  and  pedestrian  scale  lighting.    Figure  4‐5  displays  roadway  segments  with  existing 
sidewalks.    As  shown,  the  northern  portion  of  Santee  is  very  well‐connected  by  sidewalks.  
Sidewalks are less prevalent in the older, southern areas.  
 
                                    
                                                     Page 18 
                                                                                               City of Santee 
                                                                                            Mobility Element 


 
                                                                                                                 
4.5      Transportation Demand Management
 The City does not currently have a Transportation Demand Management (TDM) program. There 
are programs implemented in the region that benefits Santee residents.  
 
Typical TDM strategies include promotion of the following: 
        Transit                        Teleworking                    Alternative Work Schedule 
        Bicycling                      Carpooling                     Car‐Sharing 
        Walking                        Vanpooling                     Mixed‐Use Development 
 
TDM  measures  improve  transportation  system  efficiency  by  helping  to  reduce  vehicle  during 
peak periods of demand. 
 
According to the American Community Survey (ACS), 8.7% of the City of Santee residents carpool 
to work, slightly below the San Diego County average of 10.2%. 
 
The  San  Diego  Association  of  Governments  (SANDAG)  has  an  established  program  (iCommute) 
that  serves  as  the  administrator  of  regional  TDM  programs.  iCommute  provides  the  following 
services: 
        RideMatcher – resources for finding carpool partners or available vanpool seats; 
        SchoolPool – a program that enrolls schools to encourage parents to carpool; 
        Transit Information –  provides a linkage to transit service provider web pages; 
        Bicycle Information – provides a link to SANDAG’s Regional Bikeway Master Plan, which 
         has been updated to show bicycle paths, lanes and routes in the region; and 
        Guaranteed Ride Home – a program that allows vanpool riders affordable rides home to 
         deal with emergency meetings or illness. 
 
In addition to the iCommute program, Caltrans owns and/or maintains several park‐and‐ride lots 
in the region that are used to promote carpool activity.  There is a park‐and‐ride facility located 
at Mission Gorge Road and Big Rock Road.   
4.6      Airports and Goods Movement
Airports 
The  San  Diego  International  Airport  (Lindbergh  Field),  located  west  of  the  City  of  Santee,  and 
Gillespie Field, directly adjacent to the southern City boundary, both provide aviation services to 
the  City  of Santee.   Lindbergh  Field  is  the  largest  commercial airport  within  the  County  of  San 
Diego  and  provides  complete  commercial  airline  service.    Gillespie  Field  is  a  general  aviation 
airport  used  primarily  for  business  and  recreational  purposes.   It  does  not  function  as  a  major 
transportation mode for residents of Santee.

                                                                                               Mobility Element 

 
                                                                                                              
Goods Movement 
The efficient movement of goods is essential for meeting basic consumer demands and requires 
interaction  among  various  modes  of  travel.  The  San  Diego  region  is  supported  by  intermodal 
goods movement infrastructures consisting of roadways, railways, maritime facilities, and airport 
facilities. The City of Santee is located in close  proximity to several regionally significant goods 
movement  facilities,  including  Lindbergh  Field,  maritime  facilities,  coastal  and  inland  freight 
railways, and several regional freeways.  
 
The  following  sections  describe  the  various  goods  movement  facilities  within  the  study 
communities by facility type. 
 
Trucking 
Most  goods  in  the  San  Diego  region  are  transported  via  trucks  along  highways  and  roadways. 
Truck access to the City of Santee is provided by major freeways, including specifically SR‐52, SR‐
67 and SR‐125.  Within the City of Santee, there are specific “Truck Routes,” which are displayed 
in Figure 4‐6.   
 
Air Freight 
In addition to the transport of freight on roadways, cargo may also move through Santee via air 
freight transport companies such as FedEx, DHL Express and UPS.  The San Diego International 
Airport,  also  known  as  Lindbergh  Field,  serves  as  the  primary  regional  airport  for  freight 
transported  via  air.    These  and  other  movers  of  freight  may  receive  and  distribute  cargo  via 
maritime operations, rail, or trucks.  
 
Rail 
Two companies operate freight rail service within San Diego County.    The Burlington  Northern 
Santa  Fe  Railway  Company  (BNSF)  operates  along  the  same  right‐of‐way  as  Amtrak  and  the 
Coaster  passenger  services.    BNSF  transports  freight  to  points  north  and  east  of  San  Diego 
County,  such  as  Los  Angeles  and  Arizona.    According  to  the  LOSSAN  Corridor  Strategic 
Assessment,  January  2010  freight  rail  frequencies  within  this  corridor  are  expected  to  double 
(from 4 trains a day to 8) over the next 20 years. 
 
The San Diego and Imperial Valley Railroad (SDIY) also operates short‐haul freight service in San 
Diego  County.    This  service  provides  an  important  connection  between  BNSF  and  freight  rail 
service  in  Mexico.    The  railroad’s  main  commodities  are  petroleum  products,  agricultural 
products,  and  wood  pulp.    The  SDIY  hauled  around  6,500  carloads  in  2008.    The  SDIY  carried 
almost 6,000 cars in 2010. 
 
Maritime 
There are currently no port cargo facilities located within the City of Santee, although cargo is 
transported near the study area, via the modes summarized above, to and from the port cargo 
facilities  located  at  10th  Avenue  Marine  Terminal  (18  miles  away)  and  at  the  National  City 
Marine Terminal (19 miles away).

                                                                                               City of Santee 
                                                                                             Mobility Element 


 
                                                                                                               
                                                        
5.0 Needs
Transportation  needs  can  be  characterized  as  areas  of  high  demand  and  high  deficiency.    This 
section presents a summary of the regional and local needs identified through technical analyses 
performed in support of this Mobility Element. 
 
5.1     Regional Needs
Santee is one of 18 local jurisdictions, with the County of San Diego, that comprise the regional 
Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) and Regional Transportation Planning Agency (RTPA) 
referred  to  as  the  San  Diego  Association  of  Governments  (SANDAG).    SANDAG  serves  as  the 
forum  for  regional  decision‐making  and  planning  throughout  the  San  Diego  region.    In  2015, 
SANDAG adopted the San Diego Forward: the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), to serve as a 
guide  for  future  development  of  the  regional  transportation  network  through  the  year  2050.  
The 2050 RTP envisions the future transportation system as one that addresses the following key 
goals: 
       Supports  a  prosperous  economy;  promotes  a  healthy  and  safe  environment,  including 
        climate change protection; and provides a higher quality of life for all San Diego County 
        residents. 
       Better  links  to  jobs,  homes,  and  major  activity  centers  by  enabling  more  people  to  use 
        transit and to walk and bike; efficiently transports goods; and provides fast, convenient, 
        and effective transportation options for all people. 
 
Additionally, Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32) was signed into law in 2006, requiring California to reduce 
statewide  greenhouse  gas  emissions.      Much  responsibility  was  shifted  to  MPOs,  such  as 
SANDAG, which were called upon to prepare a Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS) outlining 
how the region will meet its goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  SANDAG’s RTP and 
SCS outline the following regional needs: 
       Integrate land uses, housing, and transportation planning to create communities that are 
        more sustainable, walkable, transit‐oriented, and compact. 
       Focus  housing  and  job  growth  in  urbanized  areas  where  there  is  existing  and  planned 
        transportation infrastructure. 
       Protect sensitive habitat and open space. 
       Invest  in  a  transportation  network  that  provides  residents  and  workers  with 
        transportation options that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
5.2     Local Needs
The two most critical transportation needs identified in Santee’s General Plan 2020 have been 
addressed.  SR‐52 is now connected to SR‐67, and SR‐125 now extends from SR‐52 to Interstate‐
                                                    Page 23 
                                                                                                City of Santee 
                                                                                              Mobility Element 

 
                                                                                                                
8.    One  of  the  greatest  transportation  needs  currently  impacting  Santee  is  related  to  the  high 
vehicular demand placed on accessing SR‐52 at Mast Boulevard. 
 
During  the  AM  peak  commute  hours,  the  SR‐52  WB  On‐Ramp  at  Mast  Boulevard  experiences 
excessive queuing times, due to a chokepoint created by two ramp lanes merging into a single 
lane  on  the  WB  On‐Ramp.    Field  observations  concluded  westbound  queuing  along  Mast 
Boulevard extends from the ramp intersection to West Hills High School, located approximately 
3,600 feet to the east.  Additionally, Caltrans recently completed a report acknowledging that SR‐
52 operates at a LOS of “C” to “F” with the worst congestion between I‐15 and Mast Boulevard. 
 
These observations and key findings prompted the City of Santee to initiate the SR‐52 Corridor 
Study in 2015.  The Study serves to identify and analyze alternatives for improved freeway access 
and  operation,  and  to  find  solutions  that  help  alleviate  congestion  on  SR‐52  and  surrounding 
areas.  
 
Extensions  of  major  City  streets  will  need  to  be  considered  as  northern  Santee  develops, 
including Fanita Parkway, Magnolia Avenue and Cuyamaca Street. 
 
5.3      Active Transportation Modes
Additional community needs are related to bicycle and pedestrian mobility, including buildout of 
the San Diego River Trail and the planned bicycle facilities identified in the City of Santee Bicycle 
Master Plan (2009). 
 
Upon completion, the San Diego River Trail will connect from Lakeside in the east to the City of 
San Diego in the west through a network of  Class I bikeways intended for pedestrian and bicycle 
use.  Portions of the River Trail are complete within the Santee River Park, however, they are not 
contiguous and do not connect to the greater network. 
 
The  planned  bicycle  system  will  increase  the  total  bicycle  network  mileage  in  Santee  from 
approximately 33.8 existing miles to 45.6 miles upon full buildout.  Many of the highest priority 
segments  identified  in  the  Bicycle  Master  Plan  have  been  implemented  or  are  currently  being 
constructed, including segments of the River Trail. 
 
Pedestrian  travel  is  provided  through  a  network  of  sidewalks,  pedestrian  pathways,  trails,  and 
multi‐use  paths.    Some  older  residential  neighborhoods  were  developed  without  sidewalks  to 
separate  pedestrian  and  vehicular  travel,  however,  the  City  has  retrofitted  many  of  these 
residential roadways with sidewalks and ADA accessible ramps to improve pedestrian safety and 
comfort.    Pedestrians  are  generously  accommodated  throughout  the  commercial  core  by 
landscaped,  meandering  sidewalks  that  serve  to  further  separate  pedestrians  from  vehicles, 
increasing  safety  and  comfort.    It  is  of  added  importance  to  provide  enhanced  pedestrian 
facilities throughout this area due to the convergence of public bus and light rail transportation 
options.

                                                                                              Mobility Element 

 
                                                                                                                 
The  multi‐use  trails  throughout  the  City  increase  pedestrian  and  bicycle  connectivity  and 
overcome potential barriers to active transportation.  The multi‐use path extending south from 
Mission Gorge Road, along the riverbed just west of Carlton Hills Boulevard, provides a safe and 
comfortable  option  for  bicyclists  and  pedestrians  to  cross  SR‐52.    Additional  trails  providing 
access from the residential communities north of the San Diego River to the commercial uses on 
the south side will greatly reduce pedestrian travel distance and time.

         metering. 
 
         Policy 10.6: The City supports the connection of Caltrans traffic signals on City streets to 
         the City’s interconnected traffic signal system to maintain traffic flow. 
 
7.0 Implementation
This  section  presents  the  circulation  plan  for  the  City  of  Santee,  including  buildout  of  the 
Mobility Element roadway classifications, designated multi‐modal corridors, and planned bicycle 
facilities.  Additionally,  a  discussion  regarding  the  Mobility  Element’s  relationship  to  the  City’s 
Capital  Improvement  Program  and  Maintenance  Program  is  provided,  as  well  as  a  discussion 
about Design Review and Project Processing. 
 
7.1      Circulation Plan
Streets and Freeway System 
This  section  provides  a  description,  cross‐section  and  list  of  designated  Mobility  Element 
roadways within the City of Santee.  The classifications are intended to assist in understanding 
the buildout design configuration and right‐of‐way needs for each circulation network segment.  
A  guiding  strategy  for  streets  system  planning  was  to  provide  a  mobility  network  that 
accommodates all modes and users and to avoid extensive road widening wherever possible.   
 
A  number  of  proposed  network  changes  such  as  lane  reductions  along  Mission  Gorge  Road, 
Prospect  Avenue,  Town  Center  Parkway,  Riverview  Parkway,  and  Olive  Lane  will  provide  much 
needed  bicycle  connectivity  to  promote  and  encourage  for  travel  mode  shifts  in  Santee.    This 
would also potentially reduce City’s vehicle miles of travel (VMT) and greenhouse gas emissions, 
and helps transform Santee into a more sustainable community. 
 
With this Mobility Element, the City is clarifying and expanding the roadway classification system 
and Table 7.1 displays the City’s revised roadway classifications and standards.

The following cross-sections display the typical sections (features, dimensions, etc.) for each
classification. Cross-sections are intended to demonstrate general feasibility of proposed
network buildout, however, actual improvements will require additional engineering studies and
design work and shall be to the satisfaction of the City Engineer.
Prime Arterial
Prime Arterial are six lanes or larger divided roadways with raised, landscaped medians to
control turning movements that cross other arterials at grade with signalized intersections.
Prime Arterials also have an increased landscaped parkway width between the right-of-way and
curb.
Notes:
     1.   Class II bike lanes currently exist along Mission Gorge Road, between SR-52 Ramps and Fanita Drive, and
          these bike lanes will remain under the Preferred Plan.
     2.   Parkways (for non-contiguous sidewalks) and/or wider sidewalks may be required where necessary on Prime
          Arterial facilities.
     3.   Town Center Specific Plan or Mission Gorge Road Design Standards apply where applicable.

Parkway 
Parkway  are  roadways  requiring  unique  design  applications  where  standard  designs  cannot  be 
utilized  because  of  steep  terrain,  right‐of‐way  constraints,  special  development  needs  and/or 
other  special  conditions.  Due  to  significant  variation  among  parkway  cross‐sections,  a  typical 
cross‐section is not provided.  The following Mobility Element roadways have been designated as 
Parkway:  
       Cottonwood Avenue*, between Street “A” and Riverview Parkway; 
       Fanita Parkway*, between northern terminus and Mast Boulevard; 
       Magnolia Avenue*, between Cuyamaca Street and Princess Joann Road; 
       Park Center Drive, between Mast Boulevard and Street “A”; 
       Riverview Parkway, between Mission Gorge Road and Magnolia Avenue; 
       Street “A”*, between Park Center Drive and Magnolia Avenue; 
       Town Center Parkway*, between Mission Gorge Road and Riverview Parkway. 
 
*  The  Mobility  Element  identifies  general  and  approximate  locations  for  future  routes  to  be 
dedicated  and  constructed  pursuant  to  development.  Precise  alignment  and  design  of  these 
routes will require in depth study at the time that future development occurs. 
 
Multi‐Modal Corridors 
To  support  AB  1358  (the  Complete  Streets  Act) and  create  a  vibrant  town  center,  a  system  of 
multi‐modal  corridors  was  developed  in  the  town  center  area  with  mixed  land  uses  and  a 
regionally significant transit center to encourage walking, biking and riding transit. The following 
roadway  segments  were  designated  to  be  Multi‐Modal  Corridors  since  they  provides 
connectivity between the town center / transit center and the surrounding residential land uses: 
 
      Prospect Avenue, between Olive Lane and Magnolia Avenue;

Regional Facilities 
Regional transportation facilities such as SR‐125, SR‐67 and SR‐52 serve an important role for the 
City  of  Santee’s  mobility  system  and  must  therefore  be  given  consideration  when  developing 
future  networks  and  performing  various  analyses.    The  most  recent  San  Diego  Forward:  The 
Regional  Plan,  adopted  in  October  2015,  indicates  two  improvement  projects  which  could 
reduce peak hour congestion along this corridor.  These improvements include widening of SR‐
52  between  Mast  Boulevard  and  SR‐125  from  4  general  purpose  lanes  to  6  by  2035,  and 
constructing two managed lanes between I‐15 and SR‐125 by 2050.

Public Transit 
The  San  Diego  Association  of  Government’s  San  Diego  Forward:  The  Regional  Plan  Revenue 
Constrained scenario anticipates the following transit improvements in Santee: 
 
     Local  Buses  –  Local  bus  service  frequencies  will  be  improved  to  15‐minute  headways 
        along key corridors (all urban routes) by the year 2020, with further improvements to 10‐
        minute (all day) frequency by 2035; 
       BRT  Route  90  ‐  A  new  BRT  service  connecting  between  the  Santee/El  Cajon  Transit 
        Centers to downtown (via SR‐94) will be established by year 2035; 
       BRT Route 870 – Peak hour service frequencies will improve to 10‐minute headways by 
        year 2050; and  
       Green  Line  Trolley  Service  –  Off‐Peak  hour  service  headways  will  improve  from  30 
        minutes to 7.5 minutes (all day) frequency by year 2050. 
 
Cycling 
The planned bicycle network was largely based on recommendations contained in City of Santee 
Bicycle Master Plan (2009), with the following additions: 
 
     Mission  Gorge  Road  between  Riverview  Parkway  and  Magnolia  Avenue  –  The  2009 
        Bicycle Master Plan recommends that Class II bike lanes be implemented on this segment 
        of  the  roadway.  The  planned  bicycle  network  recommends  that  this  section  of  Mission 
        Gorge  Road  be  reduced  from  six  lanes  to  four  lanes  and  provide  buffered  Class  II  bike 
        lanes on either side of the roadway. 
       Magnolia Avenue between Mast Boulevard and Mission Gorge Road – The 2009 Bicycle 
        Master Plan recommends Class II bike lanes along this section of Magnolia Avenue.  The 
        planned  bicycle  network  recommends  a  higher  quality  bicycle  facility  (Class  IV  Cycle 
        Tracks)  along  this  section  where  there  is  available  pavement  width.    There  are  several 
        schools located within close proximity of this corridor and enhanced facilities will provide 
        a  safer  and  more  comfortable  route  to  help  encourage  students  to  ride  their  bikes  to 
        school. 
       Fanita  Ranch  Development  Specific  Plan  Area  –  The  2009  Bicycle  Master  Plan  included 
        several  trails  and  in  road  bicycle  facilities  that  were  included  in  the  2007  Fanita  Ranch 
        Development  Plan.    Since  the  adoption  of  the  Bicycle  Master  Plan  in  2009,  a  new 
        planning  effort  for  the  Fanita  Ranch  development  has  begun  leaving  the  2007  plan 
        invalid.    Therefore,  the  recommended  bicycle  facilities  located  within  the  Fanita  Ranch 
        Development Specific Plan Area have been removed from the Preferred Plan.  Safe and 
        well  connected  bicycle  facilities  in  this  area  should  be  planned  as  part  of  the  revised 
        Fanita Ranch Master Plan.

Pedestrian Environment 
The following pedestrian improvements are currently included in the City’s CIP program and the 
City will continue the effort to improve pedestrian environment: 
 
     Cottonwood Avenue ‐ Widen as needed and install missing sections of curb, gutter and 
        sidewalk  on  Cottonwood  Avenue  between  Mission  Gorge  Road  and  Prospect  Avenue. 
        Also provide street lighting and relocate drainage inlets. 
       Graves  Avenue  ‐  Improvements  include  curb,  gutter  and  drainage  facilities  will  be 
        installed  to  control  water  runoff.  Sidewalks  and  bike  lanes  will  be  installed  to  improve 
        pedestrian and cycling safety. 
       Olive Lane ‐ Install missing curb, gutter and sidewalks along Olive Lane. 
       Pedestrian  Master  Plan  ‐  Develop  a  citywide  master  plan  for  pedestrian  facilities  and 
        identify deficiencies for improvements. 
       Riverwalk  Drive  Pedestrian  Crossing  ‐  Install  an  enhanced  pedestrian  crossing  on 
        Riverwalk Drive. 
       Safe  Route  to  School  Improvements  ‐  Implement  improvements  identified  by  the 
        Citywide Safe Route to School Plan, such as sidewalks, curb and gutter, pedestrian ramps, 
        crosswalks, signage and other improvements to provide a safer walkable path. 
       Citywide Sidewalk program ‐ Install missing segments of sidewalks on circulation element 
        streets,  including  the  addition  of  pedestrian  ramps,  driveways  and  utility  conflict 
        relocations. 
       Sidewalks  Prospect  Avenue  West  ‐  Design  and  construct  sidewalk  improvements  on 
        Prospect  Avenue  from  Fanita  Drive  to  Mesa  Road.  These  improvements  include 
        sidewalks, curb and gutter, pedestrian ramps and minor drainage improvements in order 
        to  provide  a  walkable  path  within  the  existing  right‐of‐way,  with  minimal  impact  to 
        residents.

7.2       Performance Monitoring
It  is  important  for  the  City  to  track  trends  over  time  in  order  to  understand  how  the  mobility 
system is performing.  Table 7.2 displays proposed mobility system factors that the City should 
monitor  on  a  regular  basis,  or  as  resources  allow,  in  order  to  understand  progress  toward 
achieving a balanced and healthy mobility system.

   7.3      Funding Opportunities
   One  of  the  significant  barriers  public  agencies  encounter  when  attempting  to  implement 
   mobility infrastructure is lack of funding.  This section provides potential funding sources for City 
   staff to consider with implementing future mobility improvements.  Table 7.3 presents a sample 
   of available sources to consider exploring, organized by federal, state, and regional sources.

   7.4      Capital Improvements Program
   The  Capital  Improvement  Program  (CIP)  serves  as  a  5‐year  planning  tool  for  the  City’s 
   infrastructural  and  capital  needs.    The  program  also  helps  coordinate  the  scheduling  and 
   financing of projects.  Once adopted, the CIP is continually monitored to ensure funding sources 
   are available as projected and is revised bi‐annually in response to continually evolving priorities 
   and economic conditions.  The CIP should reflect the goals and policies identified in the Mobility 
   Element, while taking into account projected future growth. 
    
   The basic purpose of the Capital Improvement Program is to provide the City with a long‐range 
   program  for  major  capital  construction  projects.  Future  goals  for  the  Capital  Improvement 
   Program  need  to  contemplate  infrastructure  needs  and  anticipated  revenue  sources.  The 
   development  of  a  long  term  Capital  Improvements  Program  should  take  into  account  various 
   planning  studies,  such  as  the  Town  Center  Specific  Plan,  the  Citywide  Pavement  Management 
   Program,  the  Mobility  Element,  and  the  City’s  General  Plan.  Transportation  improvements, 
   including  street,  bicycle  and  pedestrian  facilities  should  be  studied  in  conjunction  with  other 
   major proposed capital outlays. Major efforts should be directed towards the development of a 
   phasing program for capital circulation expenditures, taking into account the projected growth 
   rates, and the location of future growth as outlined by the Land Use and Housing Elements of 
   the General Plan. 
    
   In general, the development of a transportation facility will ultimately depend upon: 
    
                                                          Page 46 
                                                                                                             City of Santee 
                                                                                                           Mobility Element 

 
                                                                                                                 
    1. The need for the facility at a particular point in time related to projected traffic volumes 
        and service levels, and  
    2. The ability to pay and the level of deferred expenditure over time. 
 
Following is a recommended list of high priority circulation needs for the Capital Improvement 
Program: 
         
    1. Development of new bike and pedestrian trails along the San Diego River corridor. 
    2. Extension  of  Cuyamaca  Street,  Fanita  Parkway  and  Magnolia  Avenue  northward  as 
        development in northern Santee occurs. 
    3. Construction of future streets within the Town Center.  
     
To finance the aforementioned capital expenditures the City of Santee should: 
     
    1. Investigate alternative State and Federal transportation funding programs, and 
    2. Ensure that all new development be required to bear its fair share of the cost for future 
        circulation improvements. Significant contributions for many of the programmed Capital 
        Improvement  projects  may  be  conditioned  upon  private  developers  as  development 
        requirements. 
 
Other development requirements pertaining to the dedication of, or funding of, transportation 
improvements as outlined within the Subdivision Map Act include: 
 
    1. Street Dedication per Government Code 66475; and 
    2. Dedication  for  Local  Transit  Facilities  including  bus  turnouts,  benches,  and  shelters  per 
        Government Code 66475.2; and 
    3. Fees  for  major  thoroughfares  per  Government  Code  66484.  The  City  has  an  ordinance 
        which  requires  the  payment  of  a  fee  as  a  condition  of  approval  for  the  purposes  of 
        defraying the costs of City‐wide transportation improvements. 
 
7.5     Maintenance Program
Maintaining  and  rehabilitating  public  infrastructure  and  facilities  is  critical  to  preserving  City 
investments.  The City’s Capital Improvement Program allocates funding for major maintenance 
projects,  while  the  City’s  Maintenance  Program  provides  for  additional  maintenance  services.  
Funding  for  these  projects  comes  from  a  variety  of  sources,  such  as  gas  tax  subventions, 
TransNet funds, and the City’s General Fund. 
 
Maintenance and rehabilitation of the existing circulation system and safety improvements are 
generally  considered  the  most  important  priority  for  funding.  Examples  of  improvements 
included  in  the  City’s  Maintenance  Program  are  street  pavement,  curb,  gutter,  and  sidewalk 
improvements,  storm  drains,  signs,  traffic  signals,  landscaping,  and  lighting.  In  any  given  year, 
the City has a backlog of maintenance needs. Each year the City has to balance the maintenance 
needs with necessary Capital Improvement needs. 
                                                    Page 47 
                                                                                                  City of Santee 
                                                                                               Mobility Element 

 
                                                                                                                
 
The City needs to project what its maintenance needs will be for the future. The two most crucial 
maintenance needs currently are pavement maintenance and the replacement of deteriorating 
corrugated metal storm drain pipes installed before the City was incorporated. The City needs to 
continually  monitor  and  document  the  condition  of  all  public  facilities  so  that  long‐term 
maintenance  needs  are  known  and  funded.  This  will  provide  for  the  most  efficient  use  of  City 
funds. 
 
7.6     Design Review and Project Processing
An important consideration that should be integrated into the design of the circulation system is 
the  establishment  of  unified  and  enhanced  streetscapes  and  corridor  design  features.  As 
discussed  within  the  Community  Enhancement  Element,  the  implementation  of  these  features 
would  create  a  network  of  comprehensive  roadways,  which  would  increase  the  ease  of  traffic 
movement and improve public safety within the City. Design features that could be utilized for 
these  purposes  include  landscaped  medians,  adequate  street  signage,  street  furniture,  and 
lighting.  Features  that  improve  the  safety,  clearly  communicate  proper  use  (such  as  street 
crossings), and add to the visual aesthetics of the City should be considered.   
 
The  primary  function  of  street  medians  is  to  improve  traffic  safety  limiting  conflicting  traffic 
movements. Closely related to this is the use of medians to unify and improve the appearance of 
the streetscape by providing landscaping and enriched paving. During the design review of street 
medians, the following should be considered: 
 
        1) Provision of landscaping to enhance the appearance of the streetscape. 
        2) Ensuring that median plantings consist of a mixture of drought tolerant trees, shrubs 
             and groundcover watered by an efficient, water conserving irrigation system. 
        3) Provision of enriched median paving such as stamped concrete or pavers.  
        4) Compliance with accepted standards of traffic safety. 
        5) Maintenance costs. 
 
All proposed transportation projects will be reviewed during the Environmental Review process 
in order to determine if the necessary mitigation is provided for identified significant impacts. In 
association with this review, the City should encourage the consideration of project alternatives 
that could satisfy the mobility needs, while reducing the significance of these impacts.

Santee, as adopted by the MTS Board September 2017, that differ from the service
routes shown on pages 11-14 of the Mobility Element and that are anticipated to go into
effect in the first quarter of 2018.
                                       COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT ELEMENT
9.       COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT ELEMENT
The purpose of the Community
Enhancement Element is to address the
interrelationships of citizens and the built
environment in terms of scale, design,
sense of community and well being.
Furthermore, it is concerned with the
essential functions of livability and
quality of life within the community. In
terms of identity, the Element provides a
mechanism to define and strengthen
Santee's identity for residents and
visitors alike.
The City of Santee enjoys a beautiful natural setting and, since incorporation, the City has been
committed to design excellence so that development will complement the community’s
environment. Although the emphasis over the past twenty years has been to ensure a higher
quality of building design and site design on undeveloped properties, this commitment extends to
the quality of life for the existing community as well. As such, the Community Enhancement
Element also seeks to outline ample opportunities for citizens to engage in positive community
activities, and to facilitate their ability to take ownership of their neighborhood and community.
The Element identifies opportunities to enhance the character and livability of Santee and
provides guidelines to achieve such aims. It is the intention of this Element that a private/public
dialogue be established whereby creative and innovative design solutions and revitalization
programs are realized within the City.
1.0      Statutory Requirements
Section 65302 of the California Planning and Zoning Laws requires each General Plan in the
State to contain seven mandatory elements. The Community Enhancement Element is a
permissive element adopted by the City to address overall community design and community
character issues. Although permissive, it is as equally binding as a mandatory element once
adopted by the City.
2.0      Accomplishments since Adoption of the General Plan
Since the adoption of the City’s first General Plan in August of 1984, the City has implemented
many of the objectives in support of its goal to “integrate the natural and man made
environments of Santee to achieve a pleasing, distinctive and well-organized community.”
Accomplishments include:
                                                                       Santee General Plan

COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT ELEMENT
 Implementation of innovative, balanced site planning that considers topography,
   compatibility with adjacent land uses, pedestrian connectivity and motorized circulation.
   Examples include the mixed-use Mission Creek development that includes pedestrian
   connections to both adjacent schools and commercial developments across the San Diego
   River.
 Implementation of a Code Compliance Program in 1984 that has successfully acted to
   enhance dilapidated and visually negative elements in the community. Between 1996 and
   2002, 526 non-operational vehicles were removed from the community and an average of
   850 property owners are notified annually to abate weed growth.
 Renovation of numerous commercial centers throughout the City and application of design
   standards for new commercial structures that incorporate the adopted Mission Gorge Road
   Design Standards.
 The establishment of Town Center as the focal point and activity center of the City through
   adoption and implementation of the Town Center Specific Plan including development of the
   Home Depot shopping center, Costco, WalMart, the Promenade, the Mission Creek mixed-
   use development, Santee Trolley Square, the San Remo subdivision and the Town Center
   Community Park.

   corridors. In addition, twelve (12) off-site (i.e. billboard) signs have been removed
   throughout the community to date.
 Implementation of streetscape design standards that includes landscaping, consolidation of
   driveways, and combination sidewalk and bicycle paths within Town Center as well as along
   Mission Gorge Road, Magnolia Avenue and Mast Boulevard.
 Since 1988, approximately 168 housing units, including mobile homes, have been
   rehabilitated for lower income households.
 The City has sponsored tree planting and tree giveaway projects throughout the community
   resulting in several thousand new trees being planted in existing neighborhoods and at local
   schools.
 Incorporation of water features in new development throughout Town Center in order to
   complement and reinforce the San Diego River as a design element.

    and stone in City gateway signs, Town Center sidewalks, and building elevations (City Hall,
    Santee Trolley Square).
 The City is preparing a Multiple Species Conservation Plan Subarea Plan that balances
    development needs with habitat conservation and will ultimately protect one-fourth of the
    City as permanent open space.
 The City is implementing a multi-faceted plan called SANTEE ROCS (Santee Recreation,
    Open Space and Conservation System) that brings together several independent but related
    efforts to create a City-side system of open space, parks and trails.
3.0      Introduction
Prior to the City’s incorporation in 1980, development in Santee was lightly regulated, and there
was little emphasis on community design, sense of place, or application of site planning
principles that promoted efficient, or attractive developments. The County’s ordinance was
absent design criteria, establishing primarily land use designations / zone classifications that did
not address design or performance compatibility, environmental design or architectural
distinction.
To address these deficiencies, the City of Santee adopted its first General Plan, and established a
Development Review process for new development and redevelopment projects in 1984. A year
later, the City’s first Zoning Ordinance was adopted. These accomplishments laid the
groundwork for the adoption of the Town Center Specific Plan in 1986 and the Mission Gorge
Road Design Standards in 1987. Over the years, implementation of the design criteria in these
                                                                    Santee General Plan

COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT ELEMENT
plans and ordinances has protected the City’s visual assets and resulted in new development that
is architecturally distinctive, functional and attractive
Relationship to other Elements - The Community Enhancement Element is required to be
internally consistent with the other General Plan Elements. For example, goals, policies and
objectives within the Community Enhancement must be compatible with housing programs that
seek to preserve older but affordable housing stock in neighborhoods (Housing Element), with
programs that improve motorized and non-motorized forms of transportation (Circulation
Element), with programs that address the establishment of trails, parks and open space
(Conservation and Recreation Elements), and with the Land Use Element which specifies the
location, type and amount of housing, commercial services, industrial uses, public facilities and
parks and open space that collectively shape the City.
The quality of place and the enjoyment of the built and non-built environments are fundamental
to the Community Enhancement Element. These fundamentals are common to the Conservation
Element, the Open Space Element, the Recreation Element and the Trails Element. Combined,
the City has adopted a plan that brings together several independent but related efforts to create a
comprehensive, City-wide system of open space, parks and trails which balances and entwines
the built and non-built environments referred to as Santee Recreation, Open Space and
Conservation Plan (SANTEE ROCS). Additional information on this plan is contained in other
elements of the General Plan.
4.0      Existing Conditions
Over the past twenty years Santee has transitioned from its rural heritage to an urbanized city.
Today some areas have fully urbanized while peripheral areas still offer a rural setting.
Commercial buildings and homes are lower-profile, typically two stories or less. Neighborhood
stability and cohesiveness are apparent in the mature landscaping, and well-kept homes
throughout the City. The City has a wealth of physical features that are opportunities for
establishment of a strong community identity:
     San Diego River and other waterway corridors
     Undeveloped hillsides and ridgelines
     Town Center
     Santee Lakes and Mission Trails Regional Parks
     San Diego Trolley
Demographically, while still somewhat homogenous, Santee’s population has changed over a
ten-year period to become more ethnically diverse. In 2000 the City had 52,975 people.
Roughly 86% of the population is Caucasian, Hispanic or Latino (10%), Black or African
American (1.5%) and Asian (2.5%). Approximately 37 percent of the population is under the age
of 24, another 47 percent is between the ages of 25 and 54, and those between the ages of 55 to
85 years comprises roughly 16 percent. The median age is 35 years.

4.1     Human Relations
The City’s residents constitutes a valuable resource. Making the most of this resource requires the
full participation of citizens from all cultural backgrounds in all the City’s economic, educational
and social endeavors toward community enhancement and quality of life. As evident in Santee, the
population of East County is composed of an increasingly diverse population of people of various
ethnic, racial and religious groups. In May 2001 the City established a Human Relations Advisory
Board to consult with, and provide advice and assistance to the Mayor, City Council and City
                                                 Manager on methods of assuring and protecting the
                                                 rights of all residents of the City to equal economic,
                                                 political and educational opportunity, to equal
                                                 accommodations in all business establishments
                                                 within the City, and to equal service and protection
                                                 by public agencies. Continued use of this Board, or a
                                                 similar strategy in the future, would further the
                                                 philosophy and goal of fostering positive human
                                                 relations in the community. Efforts include, but are
                                                 not limited to the provision of a forum for public
                                                 input, conducting special studies of discrimination,
                                                 developing a program for crisis intervention,
providing referrals to existing agencies assisting individuals and the preparation and distribution of
educational and informational materials.
Other agencies such as the Heartland Human Relations and Fair Housing Association provide
human relations services to City residents. In addition, there are active groups at both Santana and
West Hills High Schools aimed at reducing discrimination and promoting tolerance and diversity
within the schools and community. A Human Relations Advisory Board, or similar group, would
partner with schools and law enforcement to resolve discrimination issues.
4.2     Man Made Features
Housing - As of January of 2001, there were
approximately 18,475 dwelling units in the City and
a population of 53,693. Newer tract housing
(single-family detached) is predominant north of the
San Diego River. These homes are typically
located on standard subdivision 6,000 square foot or
greater lots with improvements typical of urban
development (curb and gutter, sidewalks,
underground utilities, storm drains, etc.).
Multiple-family units (apartments, townhomes and condominiums) are located predominately
along the City’s major roads such as Mission Gorge Road, Carlton Hills Boulevard and
Magnolia Avenue. As is the case with the City’s single family housing stock, the more recent
multiple family residential developments feature more coordinated site planning and greater
amenities.
                                                                      Santee General Plan

COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT ELEMENT
Mobile homes comprise twelve percent (12%) of the housing stock in Santee (Census 2000).
The City’s mobilehome stock is located for the most part south of Mission Gorge Road, within
self- contained mobile home parks. The City has not added any new mobilehome parks since the
adoption of the original General Plan in 1984.
Siting and Design - The internal organization of Santee's older residential areas is not distinctive
and clear delineation of neighborhoods and districts is not often apparent. This has been
attributed to the rapid housing expansion that started in the mid-1950's. Strong demand led to
the construction of single-family detached tract housing developments which were built not as an
extension of historical settlement patterns but as an economical response to housing market
forces. Consequently, residential district boundaries are defined by physical barriers that exist in
the City such as State Routes 67, 52 and 125, major roads, the San Diego River, Forester Creek,
Santee Lakes, and steep topography.
Mobile homes are very distinct elements of
the residential development within Santee.
They are located in self-contained mobile
home parks that function as "micro-
neighborhoods."           Perimeter      design
treatments typically include landscaping and
block walls. The site layout is typically a
grid system of internal roads.          Design
treatment success is varied among the mobile
home parks.       Some provide community
recreational facilities, adequate street
setbacks and distinctive landscaping and
others do not.
Condition - The older housing stock in the south/central part of the City exhibits the highest
concentration of units in need of upgrading (1999 Citywide Housing Condition windshield
survey). Mobile home parks as a group are well maintained (Condition Survey of Mobile Home
Parks, dated 17, 2001, conducted by Katz Hollis), although some are now quite old.
Curbside appeal is an indicator of the level of stewardship in a neighborhood. Negative features
that affect this “appeal” include inoperable vehicles, dilapidated fences and walls, front yard
encroachments of temporary structures such shade awnings/canopies and weed growth on vacant
lots and parkways. Additionally, slopes adjacent to streets may be neglected behind privacy
fences. Slopes with public exposure, such as the north side of Mast Boulevard, can be difficult
to access and maintain. The City has proactively planted and maintained trees along some of
these areas located along very visible major roads.
Commerce - Commercial land uses in Santee function as activity centers for residents and
visitors. Since these areas are highly visible along major streets, they play an important role in
image and identity. The City’s primary commercial node is Town Center, the City’s 706-acre

master-planned city center. Virtually all the significant commercial and office land inventory is
located within Town Center.
Large tracts of vacant land in the Town Center have been developed as a retail “power center”,
anchored by big box retailers such as WalMart, Costco, and Home Depot. Santee Trolley Square
added over 440,000 square feet of commercial space to the inventory in 2002-03, offering
general merchandise and other comparison goods shopping and restaurants. This retailing
nucleus benefits other retailers in the area. These developments differ from the City’s older
commercial areas in that they exhibit coordinated site designs, including reciprocal access and
parking, consistent, high quality architecture and a high level of amenities such as water
fountains, plazas and enriched building materials. As an example, an amphitheater with an
interactive fountain at the terminus of the Trolley line serves as a focal gathering place in the
Trolley Square development.
The City’s principal east-west commercial thoroughfare is Mission Gorge Road, which is
characterized in large part by older, independently developed commercial properties and retail
                                                stores on single sites where there is no anchor
                                                tenant.    The principal north-south commercial
                                                street is Cuyamaca Street, characterized by
                                                independently developed commercial lots offering
                                                single destination services (banking, automobile,
                                                medical services) and products. Destinations are
                                                primarily vehicle-dependent, although Santee
                                                Trolley Square includes a significant mass transit,
                                                pedestrian and bicycle component to offer
                                                alternatives to automobile use. The trolley track
                                                and red trolleys are distinctive features of this street
                                                south of Mission Gorge Road.
Over time, Santee businesses have evolved from predominantly independent “mom & pop”
stores to corporate outlets within the strip commercial developments along Mission Gorge Road
(Vons, Petco, Henrys, Pep Boys, etc). Neighborhood commercial areas still retain some
individual-owned businesses anchored by convenience markets/gas stations.
The neighborhood commercial nodes throughout the City provide convenience goods and
personal services that meet the daily needs of the immediate neighborhood. Santee's
neighborhood shopping centers are located at major intersections along Mast Boulevard,
Magnolia Avenue and Carlton Hills Boulevard. The neighborhood shopping center is typically
either a freestanding entity (Santana Village, Carlton Oaks Plaza) or a combination of separate
convenience uses.
Siting and Design - In general, the City’s commercial centers have reasonably attractive
architecture and site features and many have been renovated to incorporate unifying architectural
themes, signage and landscaped features. Only a few of the City’s older centers fall short of
                                                                    Santee General Plan

creating a positive image because of uncoordinated or dated architectural design, inadequate
landscaping and lack of sign control.
Strip commercial outlets, sited on lots of varying depths, exhibit a wide range of site planning
characteristics with regard to setbacks, architecture, landscaping, signage and access. As a group,
these commercial uses do little to promote a recognizable image and visual continuity along
Mission Gorge Road, Woodside Avenue and Cuyamaca Street This type of commercial
development is typical of the City’s older commercial areas.
The City adopted the Town Center Specific Plan in October of 1986, which established design
standards for site planning, public area site improvements, gateway identification, pedestrian and
bike paths, street furniture, and signs. Consequently and deliberately, Town Center has
established a commercial identity, consistent with the Town Center Specific Plan, that sets the
standard for new development. Recurring architectural elements and site features include stucco,
terracotta roof tiles, tile accents, decorative railings, water features, shaded seating areas and
pedestrian promenades. Additionally, reciprocal access, public seating areas and pedestrian
linkages between shopping, residential and recreational uses have been established.
Recognizing the prominence of Mission Gorge
Road and its role in establishing an image for
Santee, in March of 1987, the City adopted the
Mission Gorge Road Design Standards to
establish specific design guidelines for this local
scenic road. Existing architectural elements
formed the basis for the creation of architectural
themes for the various segments of the street.
Additionally, standards were established for
reciprocal access, streetscape landscaping,
signage,     and      pedestrian     and    bicycle
improvements. Over the past 15 years, the
Mission Gorge Road Standards have promoted
innovative site design and infused architectural interest on a street that was devoid of distinction
Condition - The older commercial centers located Mission Gorge Road between Magnolia
Avenue and Carlton Hills Boulevard are experiencing rehabilitation and renovation, with
attendant enhancement in landscaping, signage, pedestrian and vehicular access and architecture.
Comprehensive sign programs for these centers have successfully reduced sign clutter and
improved signage design.
Streetscape landscaping, in commercial developments constructed after incorporation, are well
maintained and contribute to a positive image. Much of the streetscape landscaping in the City’s
commercial core is maintained through Landscape Maintenance Districts. These publicly-
operated districts ensure a consistent level of maintenance on the most highly visible landscaped
areas.

                                               Industry - Santee’s industrial uses are well
                                               established along the Woodside Avenue / State
                                               Route 67 and Prospect Avenue corridors. The City’s
                                               industrial development is characterized primarily by
                                               warehousing, light manufacturing, assembly, and
                                               distribution uses.   Along the Prospect Avenue
                                               corridor between Magnolia Avenue and Cuyamaca
                                               Street, industrial uses are intermixed with
                                               commercial      and   nonconforming       residential
                                               development. In the Woodside Avenue / State Route
corridors, recent industrial development has occurred in comprehensively planned industrial
parks. There are three master planned industrial parks in Santee: Wheatlands, Maderalado
(adjacent to Wheatlands) and the Prospect Business parks.
Siting and Design - The Prospect Avenue industrial area
offers a wide variety of building styles, lot configurations
and site features east of Cuyamaca Street, and more
cohesive development in an industrial park setting west
of Cuyamaca Street. The Woodside Avenue/State Route
67 area exhibits a more consistent planned industrial park
concept where building styles, access and landscape
treatments act as unifying elements.
Condition - Many of the industrial uses on Prospect
Avenue east of Cuyamaca Street were established before
incorporation. Uses include contractor storage yards, automobile repair and sales, a Department
of Transportation Maintenance Facility and vacant parcels within the Gillespie Field Runway
Protection Zone.
Age of industrial structures is the key factor regarding present condition and appearance. The
Prospect Avenue industrial corridor is characterized by a mixture of older smaller individually
owned businesses and more recent industrial developments. The relatively recent construction of
comprehensively planned industrial park development in the Woodside and west Prospect
Avenue areas shows consistently well maintained industrial uses.
Trafficways / Streetscapes - Circulation Pattern - Mission Gorge Road establishes the basic
primary east-west framework for organization and visual identity for the City and influenced the
initial development areas in the City south of the San Diego River. Other major east-west streets
include Mast Boulevard and Prospect Avenue. The major north-south streets that cross the San
Diego River are Cuyamaca Street, Magnolia Avenue, Carlton Hills Boulevard and West Hills
Parkway.
Route 67 trends north-south along the eastern portion of the City establishing a very strong
visual and physical barrier between the Rattlesnake Mountain area and the rest of the City. The
extension of State Route 52 from Fanita Drive eastward to State Route 67 will extend the
                                                                   Santee General Plan

regional east-west connection through the City, with freeway connections to local city streets at
Mast Boulevard, Mission Gorge Road, Fanita Drive, Cuyamaca Street and Magnolia Avenue.
Direct freeway to freeway ramp connections to SR125 and SR67 are planned. State Route 125
enters the City from the south and runs parallel to Fanita Drive, terminating at Mission Gorge
Road.
Scale - Mission Gorge Road is a wide traffic corridor providing three lanes of service in each
direction. Magnolia Avenue and Cuyamaca Street also provide regional connections to the south
in addition to serving local, in-city traffic. The remaining major roads and collectors in Santee
carry local traffic within and between neighborhoods. As a result, their scale is local and not
regional in nature.
State Routes 67 and 125 have peripheral locations in the City. State Route 52 currently
terminates at the west end of the City. The extension of State Route 52 through the remainder of
the city will have a significant visual effect.
Siting and Design - State Routes 67 and 125 exhibit grade separations, with minimal interface
with local streets. The design of State Route 52 that will extend from Fanita Drive to State
Route 67 includes ramps for local street interface, and will be elevated from SR125 east to its
terminus at SR67. It will introduce ramps, retaining walls, bridge overpasses and slopes through
                                                   the southern part of the City. This alignment
                                                   will not only introduce a significant visual
                                                   barrier, it will also represent a physical barrier
                                                   between those areas of the City north and south
                                                   of the freeway.
                                                   Mission Gorge Road traverses the City at grade.
                                                   It is a wide corridor with landscaped medians
                                                   from its west entry to Fanita Drive, and between
                                                   Town Center Parkway and Civic Center Drive.
                                                   Streetscape features such as landscaping, street
                                                   furniture, thematic signage and enriched paving
                                                   have been added to significant stretches of this
                                                   corridor as opportunities have arisen.
Landscaped streetscapes and pedestrian improvements have established a pedestrian friendly
feeling for much of Mission Gorge Road. The older areas of Mission Gorge do not feature an
inviting, pedestrian scale.
Class 1 bikeways are designated along portions of Mission Gorge Road, Town Center Parkway,
Cuyamaca Street and Civic Center Drive. Given the large traffic volumes and narrow cross-
section on Mission Gorge Road, bike travel is difficult along this corridor. The establishment of
a combined sidewalk and bikepath within landscaped corridors provide alternative facilities for
pedestrians and cyclists on Mission Gorge Road and other streets within Town Center

Major entry points to the City are provided from the
west by Mission Gorge Road and from the east via
State Route 67 and Woodside Avenue. The west
entry along Mission Gorge Road creates a positive
statement as the roadway descends into the Santee
valley. The statement is one of an open, rural
feeling, utilizing open space and the hillsides as a
scenic backdrop. The entry from the east is off State
Route 67 southbound at Woodside Avenue, where
the setting is industrial or northbound at Prospect
Avenue where the setting is a mix of industrial and
commercial uses. Secondary entry points to the City
include Fanita Drive, Cuyamaca Street and
Magnolia Avenue from the south, and El Nopal from
the east. As a group, these entryways are undefined.
In the future, Mast Boulevard will also be a gateway
from the east.
Scenic Highways - The State’s Scenic Highway Program was established in 1963 to protect and
enhance California’s natural scenic beauty and to protect the social and economic values
provided by the State’s scenic resources. While scenic highways have traditionally run through
open-space areas, they can include routes that pass through interesting or unique urban sites. A
highway may be designated scenic depending upon how much of the natural landscape can be
seen by travelers, the scenic quality of the landscape, and the extent to which development
intrudes upon the traveler’s enjoyment of the view. The City does not include any officially
designated existing State Scenic Highways within its boundaries.
To pursue an official State designation for State Routes 67 and 52, the City would first adopt a
scenic corridor protection program and then apply to the California Department of
Transportation for scenic highway approval. State Route 52, in the vicinity of Santee, has been
designated by the State as an unconstructed state highway eligible for designation as a State
Scenic Highway. State Route 67 is currently designated as a County Scenic Highway. State
Route segments within the City limits that merit consideration for a state scenic highway
designation would be State Route 67 and State
Route 52 eastward from Mission Trails Regional
Park to its junction with State Route 125.
Historic Structures - The Edgemoor "Polo Barn" and
the Mission Dam Historic site (adjacent to the City)
are two significant man-made features illustrative of
the Santee community heritage. The green and white
"Polo Barn" dates back to 1893 and is considered to
be of significant architectural design and a design
resource of the community.

The Granite House, or James Love house, is a historic resource of local significance, located in
the City’s maintenance yard. It was constructed in 1934 using granite quarried from the Coyote
Hill quarry. Relocation of the Granite House is necessary with the Forester Creek channel
improvements. As such, its preservation either through reconstruction or use of original
materials from the structure at a different location or by other symbolic means is important to the
City.
The Mission Dam, in the Mission Trails Regional Park, is a registered historic site just outside
the western City limits. It is a significant design resource documenting the heritage of the region
and is an example of the historic uses of the San Diego River.
4.3      Natural Features
Open Space - Open space in Santee is predominantly composed by large tracts of undeveloped
hillside areas (Fanita Ranch, Rattlesnake Mountain and hillsides in the southwest portion of the
City), land in the San Diego River corridor and large centrally located vacant parcels in Town
Center. Additional open space is provided by parkland (including that associated with school
sites), and interspersed vacant parcels.
In summary, open space in Santee provides a number of community design resources:
      Panoramic hillside views and backdrops,
      Visual relief to the intensive developed areas,
      Visual and physical links to the San Diego River and its tributaries (Sycamore Creek,
       Forester Creek), and
      Opportunity areas for new high quality development.
      Opportunity for recreational activities that reinforce the environmental setting such as
       hiking trails.
The City of Santee is also a participant in the Multiple Species Conservation Program through its
Subarea planning efforts. Once adopted, the City’s Subarea Plan will ultimately preserve one-
fourth of the total area of the City in permanent open space.
A more detailed discussion of the City’s open space resources appears in the Conservation
Element.
Landforms and Views - Encompassed within the landforms of Santee are the flat San Diego
River valley and the gently sloping areas which transition to the steeply sloped hillsides
associated with major ridgeline systems. The dramatic hillsides, ridgelines, and rock outcrops
form a significant design resource.
The orientation of the San Diego River corridor creates impressive long views within Santee and
to the surrounding ridgelines and mountains (including El Capitan). The elevated western entry
to the City along Mission Gorge Road also affords an opportunity for scenic views along the San
Diego River corridor.

The              numerous
topographic features of
Santee        and       the
surrounding         vicinity
provide distinctive views
and vistas from within the
developed portions of the
City.      This provides
residents with scenic backdrops and visual relief from developed portions of the City. The major
ridgeline and hillside systems provided by the undeveloped areas of the northern portion of the
City, including the Fanita Ranch, present a large portion of these views and vistas. The
Rattlesnake Mountain and Mission Trails Regional Park also provide significant views from
within Santee.
Surface Water - Surface water resources are composed of three major elements: the San Diego
River, Sycamore Creek/Santee Recreational Lakes and Forester Creek. Secondary elements
include Woodglen Vista Creek and Big Rock Creek. This surface water system provides
continuous, linear features that not only convey runoff and flood water but also offer scenic,
recreational, habitat preservation and open space opportunities.
The most significant surface water element in the City is the San Diego River, which flows east
to west through the central portion of the City. The river corridor has been maintained and
enhanced in accordance with the City’s 1984 Santee River
Park Plan (discussed in greater detail in the Recreation
Element) which seeks to establish a linear rustic park in its
urban core, with trails, wildlife interpretation signs, parks
and passive open space.
The Sycamore Creek/Santee Lakes Regional Park provide a
strong linear water element/open space corridor that
provides a link to the San Diego River corridor from the
northern part of the City. The Sycamore Creek/Santee Lakes
Regional Park supports recreational activities including
picnicking, walking and biking, fishing and camping.
Forester Creek is currently an unimproved stream that flows
into the San Diego River corridor from the south (El Cajon).
From a concrete-lined channel in El Cajon, its natural course meanders through a variety of land
uses and vacant land, and provides an informal pedestrian link between Cuyamaca Street and
Mission Gorge Road. With the completion of the planned Forester Creek Improvement Project
this creek will fulfill its potential as a recreational water element/open space link to the San
Diego River.

5.0     Needs
5.1     Summary
Since 1980, the City has focused on introducing new development that is of high quality and
contributes toward achieving identified community design objectives in a growing City. Today
only 4,418 acres of the City are vacant (includes Fanita Ranch). New or revised policies and
objectives that address neighborhood vitality are also timely for Santee as it approaches build-
out. Therefore, as the City matures, more and more emphasis is placed on “caretaking” and
revitalization of existing neighborhoods, the maintenance and enhancement of commercial and
industrial districts, including its streets and the non-built environment (river corridors and parks).
5.2     Revitalization
A community enhancement program recognizes, protects and enhances the city’s neighborhoods
and ensures a high quality of life through stable home ownership, housing rehabilitation
programs, public participation in community events, public improvements and preservation of
the natural environment and open space. The overarching need is to sustain a livable community
where people can live, work and play. A community enhancement program recognizes disparate
current and future needs and coalesces city resources to effectively:
   Target older neighborhoods in need of revitalization
   Reinforce community identity
   Engage the public as partners with the City through individual neighborhood enhancement
   efforts such as Neighborhood and Kids Watch Programs
   Disseminate information about City Codes that address health and safety (building and
    zoning codes, noise abatement)
   Support community events (block parties, neighborhood church festivals, etc)
   Implement residential rehabilitation loan programs
   Promote tree planting programs
There are also older commercial and industrial areas that could benefit from revitalization
efforts. In addition to those listed above, tools that could be used to promote this include
business improvement districts tailored to specific needs such as building façade or landscaping
improvements along street frontages, street amenities and public art programs.
Street Maintenance - Streets also have a fundamental impact on the City’s visual environment
and on public activities. Street maintenance through re-surfacing and tree plantings will accent
the uniqueness of neighborhoods, parks, pedestrian environments and meeting places. Citizen
concerns over the years have been raised about adhering to speed limits on residential streets. A
combination of landscape enhancements and other traffic calming measures could enhance
quality of life.

Santee, California                           - 9-14 -

                                     COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT ELEMENT
Architecture - As land use designations / zone districts change to be responsive to market needs
and to the needs for housing, the self-imposed limitation in architectural themes is no longer
necessary to assure high quality development and exciting, responsive architecture. As such, the
Mission Gorge Road Design Standards have been modified to retain the site development
standards, including public improvements and tree themes, and made more flexible in terms of
architectural choices (Refer to Section 8.0: Implementation).
Public Arts Program - The arts are a proven asset to a community and a successful component in
the revitalization and development of commercial areas. Cultural facilities enhance a
community’s identity, pride and image and serve as a gathering place. The arts help to bridge
diverse cultures, serve as a common ground for collaboration and mutual enjoyment and
strengthen family ties by providing activities that encourage the participation of different
generations.
Traditionally, Santee residents look to neighboring urban areas for their cultural offerings.
However, Santee’s corporate base, and therefore sponsorship opportunities, are expanding to
support and invest in the community’s arts environment. A public arts program can boost
economic development and infuse vitality into local businesses. The City may wish to encourage
public participation in public space to foster community pride and enhance life experiences in
their home town.
5.3     Human Relations
Human relations involves the promotion of tolerance and diversity, and is important to the quality
of life. The City has strengthened alliances among key organizations that have roles to play in
fostering social harmony (law enforcement, schools). The City should continue to support
community and religious efforts and programs that advance tolerance, and embrace diversity and
anti-discrimination in the community.
Other future needs include:
   The establishment of the Human Relations Advisory Board, or other similar committee or
    commission that lays the groundwork for fighting discrimination and \improving racial, ethnic,
    and religious tolerance in the City.
   Mediation and conflict resolution
   Appreciation of diversity through art programs
5.4     Man Made Features
Housing - Residential development encompasses most of the developed portion of Santee and
the condition of neighborhoods reflects on the image and identity of the City. The definition of a
neighborhood can include a block or an area of several blocks around residents' homes. It is the
section of the City that most residents are familiar with and care the most about. If citizens are
going to take pride in Santee, they must first be able to take pride in their home and
neighborhood.

                                            Design treatments (thematic signage and lighting, entry
                                            statements, and distinctive landscaping for example)
                                            can strengthen and enhance neighborhood definition. A
                                            system of neighborhood vest-pocket parks for open
                                            space, discouraging through traffic on residential
                                            streets, and buffering of adjacent non-residential uses
                                            can improve the livability of a neighborhood.
                                            The changing market conditions, housing shortage and
                                            decreasing availability of minimally constrained
                                            building sites will play a role in the housing type and
design. Higher density multiple-family residential development along major streets and in Town
Center will introduce three-story buildings where one- and two-story buildings represent the
established scale. Additionally, hillside development is becoming more prevalent, where open
space protection, fire management zones, vehicular and emergency access and water supply are
integral to site design and product type. Large, privately-maintained manufactured slope areas
may become poorly maintained if access if difficult, or if they are screened from view.
Other future needs include:
   Reestablishment of vegetation on public and private slopes
   Reduce the visibility of hillside fencing
   Promote a wide range of housing products to meet the needs of all segments of the
    community and offer more opportunities for distinctive, high-quality development
   Identify neighborhoods that could benefit from broad-based revitalization strategies
Commerce - The development of Town Center in
the mid-1980’s established a “downtown” in a lush
landscaped setting and heralded the type and
quality of new commercial development
envisioned in the Town Center Specific Plan.
Sidewalks and bike paths support non-motorized
movement through Town Center. Outside the
Town Center, older strip commercial centers have
been remodeled to incorporate updated architecture
and site improvements. Additionally, opportunities
for shared access and reciprocal parking have
reduced driveways on Mission Gorge Road and
Town Center Parkway.
Many of the City’s neighborhood commercial centers, while generally well maintained, would
benefit from a comprehensive renovation that enhances facades, coordinates signage and
landscaping.

                                    COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT ELEMENT
The City has incrementally achieved improvements and enhanced architectural designs on
Mission Gorge Road. Success is founded on sign control, streetscape landscaping requirements,
site planning and architectural standards. Continued implementation of the Mission Gorge Road
Design Standards will ensure continued improvement of this important commercial corridor.
The County of San Diego and the City of Santee have partnered to plan the development of a
corporate office park on 104 acres of County-owned land in Town Center. The Master Plan will
integrate the San Diego River with the commercial backbone of the City through a series of
visual and physical linkages. The Plan will address broad-based design standards for buildings
and amenities that are compatible with adjacent development, including environmental
protection, enhancement and stewardship, mixed-use development, traffic flow/pedestrian paths
view protection and interconnectivity among uses.
Other future needs include:
   Continued renovation of older commercial centers
   Controlled signage that could include a city-wide kiosk program and wayfinding signs that
    draw from a regional base (Carlton Hills Country Club, Santee Lakes and Mission Trails
    Regional Parks)
   Ensure home-based businesses do not adversely affect quality of life in residential areas
   Attract and retain businesses that offer a wide range of goods and services to the community
   Explore a public arts program that serves as an economic engine for the community
Industry - The City’s more recent, comprehensively planned industrial park development along
North Woodside and Prospect Avenues presents a positive image by providing comprehensive
site planning and distinctive architectural treatments. The older less cohesive industrial
development located elsewhere within the community presents a mix of positive and negative
features.
Other future needs include:
   Consolidation of uses
   Upgrading structure conditions
   Site maintenance
   Introduction of landscaped buffers and improved signate
Trafficways/Streetscape - The City’s circulation system strongly influences the image and
identity of the City, as well as providing a basic framework for orientation and ease of
movement. A beautiful street fosters community pride, and attracts and retains homeowners and
businesses. One way to achieve this is through tree-lined streets and landscaped medians. The
streetscapes of Santee provide a well defined hierarchy based on the function and classification
of the street. Features include landscaped medians, street furniture, lighting, enriched paving,
                                                                  Santee General Plan

thematic street tree plantings, distinctive walls and other edge treatments, signs, bus shelters and
bus benches, etc.
To advance the planting of both public and private trees, the City, as a member of the National
Arbor Day Foundation, has enrolled in the Tree City USA Program, a community improvement
program sponsored by the National Arbor Day Foundation. The city’s “urban forest”
encompasses not only the trees in one’s private yard, but the trees along streets and highways, in
parks, along the San Diego River and its tributaries, and in the golf course. A community
forestry program offers the implementation structure, makes available resources for that care and
educates the public about the importance of trees in their community.
Related to the need for improved entries into the City is the need for introduction of distinctive
design treatments at major decision-making points and activity centers. Traffic corridors should
have identifiable patterns and design elements which signal the location of these unique areas.
Existing major intersections and large commercial developments are also included in those areas
that should have distinctive streetscapes. On a larger scale, the absence of landscaping along
State Route 67 sends a message of neglect.
Although not completed, the visual effect of State Route 52 through the City will be significant.
Caltrans, through its Transportation Art Program, supports the enrichment of the cultural and
visual environment for motorists and residents by facilitating and coordinating the placement of
artwork by others within the transportation right-of-way. Ensuring high quality landscaping of
freeway slopes and interchanges, and design enhancement of major features such as freeway
overpasses and bridges will reduce visual impacts associated with freeway construction.
Other future needs include:
   Enhancement of City gateways, including monument signage and landscaping
   Thematic bus shelters that provide shade and relate architecturally to adjacent buildings
   Maintaining an updated street tree list
   On-going street maintenance and rehabilitation, including sidewalk infill
   Enhancement of existing (SR67) and future freeways, including transportation art
Historic Structures - Protection and enhancement of the "Polo Barn" and Mission Dam site (in
the City of San Diego) has been guaranteed through listing on the Historical Register. The
Granite House will be removed from its location adjacent to Forester Creek due to the
construction of the State Route 52 freeway and the Forester Creek Improvement Project.
5.5     Natural Features
Open Space - The large amount of open space resources in Santee today perform many vital
functions with regard to aesthetics, community character, resource protection and hazard
avoidance. As the community advances in its transition from its rural heritage to an urban
community, open space will continue to play these vital roles and should continue to be
integrated into the community design strategy for the City.
Santee General Plan
Santee, California                         - 9-18 -

                                     COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT ELEMENT
Open space in the presently undeveloped hillside areas should be strategically maintained for
hazard avoidance, maintenance of views and resource protection. Site plans and structure
designs proposed for existing undeveloped hillside areas should be sensitive to these open space
functions and incorporate open space uses as part of the development proposal.
Landforms and Views - Topographic features should be respected and alteration of landforms
kept to a minimum except where public safety concerns are overriding and remedial landform
alterations are required. In this regard, proper siting of land uses in terms of their grading, access
and site planning requirements is critical to the success of maintaining topographic resources.
Rock outcrops or other unique physical features add points of interest and unique design
opportunities. As such, they too should be considered for integration into development proposals
as focal points or as part of natural open space systems.
Maintenance of high quality views should be considered in the siting and design features of
hillside projects and strategic location of open space. Development within the urban area must
frame and enhance view opportunities and not block or create significant negative visual impacts
on existing community-level viewsheds.
Surface Water
San Diego River Corridor - The San Diego River corridor provides a major focus for community
design within Santee and it should be properly utilized to define an overall theme, character and
design strategy for the City. Emphasis should be placed on maintaining and enhancing the
existing scenic and environmental resources of the river corridor.
New development along the river corridor should utilize the design elements this natural system
presents. Introduction of water elements, greenbelts, view orientation to the river and passive
water uses that complement the river system should be included in design proposals to create a
varied but consistent theme and character for river corridor development. The ongoing
implementation of the Santee River Park Plan must balance the need to maintain the integrity of
the natural systems with other community needs.
Sycamore Creek/Santee Lakes Regional Park - The Sycamore Creek/Santee Recreational Lakes
corridor supports a wide range of recreational uses, preserves significant habitat, vegetation and
open space and provides high quality views. Maintenance of these functions needs to be an
integral part of community design strategies. Furthermore, strengthening of its linkage to the San
Diego River System should be considered as part of a citywide strategy to enhance water
features.
Forester Creek - Forester Creek should play a major role in the development of a contiguous
water element system throughout the City. The improvement of Forester Creek should be a
model of urban stream restoration, balancing the need for flood control with habitat creation,
enhancement of water quality and community recreational needs.
                                                                    Santee General Plan

8.4     Mission Gorge Road Design Standards
In accordance with the Objectives and Policies of the General Plan, design standards for
coordinating the architecture, access, signage and landscaping of properties within the Mission
Gorge Road corridor are part of the City's zoning permit and subdivision map review processes.
These design standards are intended to serve as "guidelines" to direct future development, since
it is recognized that full implementation of the standards may not be appropriate for all
properties along Mission Gorge Road because of existing development patterns or property sizes
and configurations. In applying these design standards, it must be remembered that the objective
of the General Plan is to both improve the appearance and enhance the viability of commercial
properties within the Mission Gorge Road corridor.
Architecture - Architectural design addresses not only the functions of buildings, but also
building style through materials detailing colors, textures, and the configuration of the building.
Buildings should be complimentary to their surrounding environment. Buildings should address
site planning through the use of setbacks, parking, landscaping, entries and special features, such
as plazas or fountains.
Design Standard Number 1: New construction of commercial buildings and remodeling of
existing commercial buildings shall conform to the Mediterranean architectural theme along
Mission Gorge Road between Carlton Hills Boulevard and Magnolia Avenue. West of Carlton
Hills Boulevard, an “Old Western”, “Turn-of-the-
Century”, “Alpine” or other distinctive architectural
theme may be used, exclusive of “Mediterranean”.
When justified by special circumstances such as may
occur with remodeling, another theme may be used.
Mediterranean - A Mediterranean theme includes
Mission and Spanish styles, and is exclusive to
Town Center, between Carlton Hills Boulevard and
Magnolia Avenue. Materials should include stucco,
rough sawn wood for trim and accents, tile roofs,
slump stone block, glazed tile accents and tile
paving. Architectural form would include arches, gable or hipped roofs, deep-set mansards and
parapets. Special features would include fountains and covered arcades.
                                              Old Western - This architectural style is exemplified
                                              by the use of rough sawn vertical or horizontal
                                              wood siding, wood shingles, and stone. Building
                                              forms include gable roofs, porches and false fronts.
                                              Special features would include covered walkways
                                              and wooden lamp posts.
                                              Turn-of-the-Century - This style includes many
                                              forms of Victorian and 19th Century architecture.
                                                                  Santee General Plan

COMMUNITY ENHANCEMENT ELEMENT
Appropriate building materials include brick, painted clapboard, painted vertical tongue and
groove and wood shingles. A variety of forms are in keeping with this style including gable
roofs and flat roofs with decorative parapets. Special architectural features include bay
windows. period lamp posts, awnings and canopies, and molding.
Alpine – This architectural style relies on natural materials such as stone, shingle and wood
compatible with its topographical setting close to the San Diego River and the hillsides. This
theme is eclectic in the permissive application of folk styles. The primary areas for the
application of form and detailing are in the porch and cornice lines.
Signage
All signs on Mission Gorge should be compatible with the scenic corridor, with one another, and
should be consolidated wherever feasible. The size of commercial signs presently allowed by
the City are in proportion to the size of the building front. In addition, each individual property
is permitted one monument entry sign, which is also proportional to the frontage of the property.
While individual businesses can and should retain storefront signs, entry monument signs can be
consolidated. Through the use of common entry signage, the identification of consolidated
access points can also be provided.
Design Standard No. 2 - Coordination of monument entry signs to identify several
individual commercial properties and common access points shall be encouraged.
Design Standard No. 3 - All signs shall be reviewed for their compatibility with the
immediately surrounding area and the Scenic Corridor designation of Mission Gorge Road.
Access
Future left turn access to individual properties along Mission Gorge Road will be restricted by
the placement of median center dividers. In order that medians not be detrimental for businesses,
the consolidation of entrance points to properties should be required. In this manner, traffic
safety will be improved by limiting the number of curb cuts and conflict points along the street.
A key point in coordinating the design of properties is the coordination of access and the sharing
of parking. In this manner, individual properties would retain their legal identity but would
benefit from not being isolated from adjacent properties. The used of shared access and parking
also improves options for site design by allowing more flexibility in locating parking areas and
buildings. Easements among individual parcels for both access and parking can be required
through the Development review process.
With future construction of raised, landscaped medians in Mission Gorge Road, left turn access
to individual properties will be restricted. In order that medians not be detrimental to businesses,
entry points to several properties should be consolidated. Site planning can be enhanced through
the varying of building locations and parking areas on individual properties.

Design Standard No. 4 - Common access points and parking easements shall be encouraged
among individual parcels in order to allow coordinated site planning, improved access, and
improved traffic safety.
Landscaping/Streetscape Design
To provide a theme or cohesive thread tying all of Mission Gorge Road together, a coordinated
streetscape design is necessary. The use of the same variety of tree along all portions of the
street with each node having different median designs and landscaping along the side of the road
would accomplish this purpose. This is also consistent with the intent of providing each
commercial node with a separate identity; although, streetscape designs should be carried out
through residential areas as well. Selected street trees should provide shadow and canopy effects
which would be both aesthetically pleasing and beneficial by providing shade and lowering street
temperatures.
Along the south side of Mission Gorge Road a landscape buffer varying from 20 to 40 feet in
width (30 feet average) is encouraged. This buffer area would be improved with a meandering
pedestrian path within the 10 feet public right-of-way behind the curb, separated from both street
traffic and parking lots. Such a walkway should cross all streets and driveways adjacent to the
curb. Through the use of a meandering path, space for mounded landscaping between the curb
and the path is encouraged to screen parking lots and pathways from the street.
The landscape buffer dimension is measured from the curb. The thirty-foot average width of the
buffer is comprised of the following elements: ten (10) feet behind the curb designated as public
right-of-way (required); ten (10) feet behind the right-of-way designated as street yard setback in
commercial zones (refer to required setbacks contained in the City Zoning Ordinance); and ten
(10) feet beyond the minimum setback to provide landscape area of sufficient width.
North Side of Mission Gorge Road: On the north side of Mission Gorge Road, the landscape
buffer should be the same as the Town Center Specific Plan development standards, which is
thirty-five (35) feet from the curb. A combination pedestrian and bicycle path (5-foot wide
sidewalk and four-foot wide bicycle path) would be provided within 25 feet of public right-of-
way behind the curb.
At major intersections, both public street improvements and private development plans will be
coordinated to create special treatments. These intersections would include Mission Gorge Road
and Mast Boulevard, Mesa Road, Fanita Drive, Carlton Hills Boulevard, Town Center Parkway,
Cuyamaca Street, Cottonwood Avenue and Magnolia Avenue. The Design Element of the Town
Center Specific Plan requires gateway treatments at two proposed new intersections with
Mission Gorge Road.
Two specific elements are important along the Mission Gorge Road corridor: pedestrian and
bicycle paths; and selection of street trees for median and landscape buffer plantings.

Pedestrian/Bicycle Paths - The following dimensions shall apply:
       Sidewalk:               five (5) feet wide
       Bikeway:                four (4) feet wide
The walkway and bicycle path may be combined. The combined facility should meander within
the right-of-way portion of the landscape buffer, and path alignments should be integrated with
provision of street furniture, utilities, building entries, driveways, intersections, and bus stop
locations. Bike paths should use earth tone colored concrete with a broom finish. Sidewalks
should be constructed of one of the following: earth-tone colored concrete, or earth-tone colored
concrete with an exposed aggregate finish.
Street Trees - An important element for the entire corridor is the selection and planting of street
trees in medians and along the sides of the roadway. Two lists of street trees may be referenced:
a list maintained by the Community Services Department that identifies theme trees for medians
and parkways; the Town Center Specific Plan design standards; and 3) the Mission Gorge Road
Design Standards. Trees are selected for color and ease of maintenance within confined medians
and parkways, as well as to establish continuity in theme along Circulation Element Streets.
It is recommended that street tree planting along Mission Gorge Road be consistent with the
Town Center design guidelines in those portions of the corridor that abut the Town Center site.
Other portions of the corridor should be consistent with the Community Services Tree List.
In addition to median landscaping, a coordinated streetscape design along each side of the
roadway should also be required. A landscaping and buffer area of sufficient width to separate
pedestrians and bicyclists from both parking and the street should be required. At major
intersections, public and private improvement plans must be coordinated to create special
treatments.
Design Standard No. 5 - Themed street trees for Mission Gorge Road shall be selected
and used in all landscaping designs.
Design Standard No. 6 - Landscaped buffers shall be provided along both sides of Mission
Gorge Road. On the south side, the buffer shall average 30 feet in width from the curb (20
feet from property line) with a 20 foot minimum width. A five foot meandering walkway
within the right-of-way shall be provided. On the north side, the buffer shall be 35 feet in
width behind the curb with a combination four-foot wide bicycle path and a five-foot wide
meandering walkway. Both paths shall be located within 25 feet of public right-of-way
behind the curb.
8.5      Gateway Program
Gateway sites provide recognizable entrances into the City, create community identity and
reinforce a positive image.

Locations - At least seven gateway sites have been identified along Santee's existing circulation
system, and these may increase over time due to city annexations, street extensions (Mast
Boulevard) and new freeway off-ramps (Figure 9-1). Gateway signs should be located at the
future Cuyamaca Street interchange with State Route 52.
Design Features - A cohesive design consistent with the gateway prototype in regards to
materials, copy and letter style. Adjustments may be made to the size and shape to fit a particular
site.
    A location within medians is preferable.
    A size consistent with the scale of roadway
     in which they are installed.
    Placement that does not create any traffic
     hazards.
    Use of landscaping to frame and accentuate.
Implementation - There are a variety of ways in
which the City could obtain the land and funds
for the placement and construction of gateway
improvements.       The method chosen for a
particular gateway would depend on the
circumstances for each individual site. Alternative types of funding (street improvement funds,
grants) shall be examined and used whenever possible.
Gateway construction should be done in conjunction with street improvement projects wherever
possible. For sites which adjoin vacant but developable land, the gateway improvements could
be required as conditions of approval when the site is developed.
Freeway Exposure - Freeway signs, as “pre-gateway” signs, are also important in creating a
sense of pending arrival. The design of freeway signs is pre-determined by the State Department
of Transportation. The lack of signs on State Route 52 at the interchange with State Route 163,
and Interstate 15 minimizes the city’s presence on the region’s arterials. The City should
coordinate with the California Department of Transportation to have signs installed that inform
drivers of Santee’s location.
8.6      Development Review Procedure
The Development Review procedure is used by the City to review proposals for commercial,
industrial and multiple residential developments. It allows the City to review proposals in terms
of land use compatibility and structure and site design features. The objectives, policies and
guidelines established by the Community Enhancement Element shall be used to assist the City
in the Development Review process, and they provide a framework for developers to use in
preparing plan submittals that address community enhancement objectives.

                                                   availability for use, appreciation and enjoyment.
                                                   The Conservation Element includes policies and
                                                   implementation measures to encourage the
                                                   conservation and proper management of natural
                                                   resources and open space areas in the City.
1.0      Statutory Requirements
Section 65302 (d) of the California Planning and Zoning Laws requires each City’s General
Plan to contain a Conservation Element which is intended to address the conservation,
development and utilization of natural resources. These resources may include water, forests,
rivers, soils, minerals, fisheries and wildlife.
The State Guidelines also require each City to include an open space element to address the
preservation and management of natural resources, outdoor recreation, and public health and
safety, particularly in those areas which require special management because of hazards or
protection of water or air quality. This element also provides an inventory of privately and
publicly owned open space lands as well as policies and programs that strive to achieve the
community's open space goals.
The State Guidelines allow consolidation of required elements. To reduce repetition and
improve readability, the City has consolidated the requirements of both the Conservation and
Open Space Elements into the Conservation Element.
2.0      Accomplishments Since Adoption of the General Plan
Since the adoption of the City’s first General Plan in August of 1984, the City has
accomplished many of the goals and policies that were found in the Conservation (and
previous Open Space) Elements at that time. Major accomplishments include:
    i With the adoption in 1984 of the Development Review Ordinance and in 1985 of the
         Zoning Ordinance, procedures were established to review projects for compliance with
         specific criteria including the preservation of native vegetation, minimization of
         grading and landform alternation and establishment of a Park/Open Space district to
         protect valuable open space and biological resources in the San Diego River, Sycamore
         Creek and Forester Creek.
                                                                     Santee General Plan

                                           - 6-1 -

CONSERVATION ELEMENT
    i In 1985, the City adopted a Hillside Overlay District, which covers hillside properties
        in the City. The purpose of this district is to minimize grading and landform alteration,
        protect significant biological resources, protect watersheds and drainages, and to ensure
        development blends with the environment to the maximum extent feasible.
    i In 1988, the City Council approved a reclamation plan for the RCP mining operation in
        the San Diego River. The plan calls for a habitat restoration and creation plan for the
        mined lands that is being implemented in phases as mining is completed.
    i In 1991, the City, together with the California Department of Fish and Game, the
        County of San Diego and the City of Poway purchased the 321-acre Goodan Ranch
        property for recreational and habitat preservation purposes. This property was formally
        designated the Goodan Ranch Regional Park in 1995.
    i In 1995, the City Council approved a Conditional Use Permit to allow the expansion
        and upgrade of the Padre Dam Municipal Water District’s Water Recycling Facility
        located at the northern end of the Santee Lakes Regional Park.
    i In February of 2002, the City completed the Jurisdictional Urban Runoff Management
        Plan (JURMP) to address local water quality issues. The purpose of this program is to
        minimize or eliminate the impact of human activities on receiving water bodies, which
        will be accomplished through reducing pollutants in urban runoff to the maximum
        extent practicable
    i Ongoing implementation of General Municipal National Pollution Discharge
        Elimination System Permit requirements including dry weather storm drain field
        screening, public outreach and enforcement activities to improve water quality in the
        City’s waterbodies.
    i Four new public parks have been completed, including Mast Park, Santee Mini-Park,
        West Hills Park and Shadow Hill Park and construction begun on the 55-acre Town
        Center Community Park. The City has also implemented the Park Lands Dedication
        Ordinance which generates funds from new development to fund acquisition of new
        parks and renovation of existing parks.
    i The City has adopted and implemented local environmental review procedures to
        protect and preserve significant plant and animal species and ensure mitigation is
        provided for significant impacts associated with both public and private development.
    i The City has prepared a Multiple Species Conservation Program Subarea Plan that,
        once approved, will cover over 2,600 acres of the City to balance development and
        species protection and create a City-wide open space network.

3.0     Introduction
The City of Santee, which formerly had a semi-rural character, is now in the final stages of its
transition to a fully functional suburban community with balanced land uses. The community
continues to have an abundance of open space land and valuable natural resources. Santee's
unique environment affords the City the opportunity to encourage development while at the
same time promoting the wise management of both it’s natural resources and open space areas
for the benefit of the citizens of Santee.
Relationship to other Elements - The distribution of open space and natural resources
throughout the City is directly related to the distribution of land uses; therefore, the
Conservation Element is most closely correlated with the Land Use Element. In addition, the
Conservation Element discusses open space and recreational facilities which are also addressed
in the Recreation and Trails Elements. The open space areas, waterways and hillsides in the
City are also significant design elements and visual resources, which are primary
considerations in the Community Enhancement Element. As required by State Law, the
Conservation Element is consistent with the other elements in the General Plan.
4.0     Existing Conditions
4.1     Water Resources
Watersheds and Hydrology -The water in Santee's waterways comes primarily from four
sources: rainfall, surface runoff, groundwater from aquifers, and recycled water from Padre
Dam Municipal Water District's water recycling facility at Santee Lakes.
                                                   The City of Santee has six major drainage
                                                   courses, which are shown on Figure 6-1,
                                                   including: the San Diego River and its
                                                   tributaries - Forester Creek, Sycamore Creek,
                                                   Woodglen Vista Creek, Fanita Creek and Big
                                                   Rock Creek, which parallels Big Rock Road.
                                                   All of the creeks have their own watersheds in
                                                   addition to lying within the larger San Diego
                                                   River watershed. Forester Creek drains the
                                                   runoff from the north facing slopes of hills
                                                   within the City of El Cajon. Sycamore Creek
                                                   drains the runoff from Sycamore Canyon and
                                                   from Carlton Hills, and the creeks running
                                                                   Santee General Plan
                                                                      Santee, California

CONSERVATION ELEMENT
 parallel to Fanita Drive and Big Rock Road drain the runoff from Cowles Mountain and Fanita
 Hills located within the City of El Cajon. All of these watersheds empty into the San Diego
 River, which flows westward into the Pacific Ocean.
 Although none of these waterways have been fully improved, portions of the San Diego River
 and Forester Creek have been partially improved to mitigate potential flood hazards or prevent
 localized erosion. Even with these flood control measures, portions of Santee would be
 inundated by a 100-year flood event as shown on the Figure 6-1.
 Water Quality - There has been an increased level of regulatory activity in recent years focused
 on the effects of urban runoff on water quality. In 1987, amendments were made to the Federal
 Clean Water Act which established a regulatory framework for regulating storm water
 discharges from municipal, industrial and construction sources. In California, these permits are
 issued through the State Water Resources Control Board and the nine statewide Regional
 Water Quality Control Boards (RWQCB). In February of 2001, the San Diego RWQCB issued
 a countywide permit for storm water discharges requiring all the jurisdictions in the county to
 develop plans on a watershed (Watershed Urban Runoff Management Plan) and jurisdictional
 (Jurisdictional Urban Runoff Management Plan) basis. The intent of these plans is to develop
 methods and standards to control pollutant discharges into the receiving water to the maximum
 extent feasible.
 In 1994, the San Diego RWQCB adopted a Water Quality Control Plan, or Basin Plan, which
 recognizes and reflects regional differences in existing water quality, the beneficial uses of the
 Region’s ground surface waters, and local water quality problems.
 The San Diego Regional Board’s Basin Plan is designed to preserve and enhance water quality
 and protect the beneficial uses of all regional waters. Specifically, the Basin Plan: (1)
 designates beneficial uses for surface and ground waters; (2) sets narrative and numerical
 objectives that must be attained or maintained to protect the designated beneficial uses and
 conform to the state’s anti-degradation policy; (3) describes implementation programs to
 protect the designated beneficial uses of all waters in the Region; and (4) describes surveillance
 and monitoring activities to evaluate the effectiveness of the Basin Plan.
 The City of Santee is part of the San Diego River watershed and is working cooperatively with
 other jurisdictions on a plan for the overall watershed. In addition, the City completed a
 Jurisdictional Urban Runoff Management Plan in 2002 to address local water quality issues.
 The local plan addresses water quality issues in the primary water basins in the City. The goal
 of the plan is to reduce or eliminate the contaminants that are transported in stormwater and
 ultimately delivered to the rivers and creeks in the City and downstream. The program focuses
 on reducing pollution in the three major areas of development: planning, construction, and
 existing development. Other components of the program include storm drain monitoring to
 detect pollution, public reporting of illegal dumping, and providing education information to a
 variety of audiences describing water quality issues.

                           Domestic Water Supply - The vast majority of Santee residents
                           receive their water from the Padre Dam Municipal Water District.
                           The district’s serves a population of over 125,000 with an average
                           daily water use of approximately 17 million gallons. The district
                           currently has over 330 miles of potable water mains, 148 miles of
                           sewer mains and 25 miles of recycled waterlines.
                           The Padre Dam Municipal Water District contracts with the San
                           Diego County Water Authority for its potable water. The San Diego
                           County Water Authority is one of 27 member agencies in the
                           Metropolitan Water District (MWD), which is responsible for
                           importing and distributing water from the Colorado River and
                           northern California to its member agencies
The California Water Code requires larger urban water suppliers to prepare Urban Water
Management Plans and to update these plans every five years. According to the Padre Dam
District’s December 2000 Urban Water Management Plan, the supply of water from the
District is adequate to meet the demands within the City of Santee through the year 2020.
A number of factors including a growing population, limited storage capacity and uncertainties
of the imported water supplies from both the Colorado River and northern California are
causing the County Water Authority to review long-range plans for a secure water supply.
Measures to address these concerns include construction of new reservoirs (Diamondback
Reservoir, Olivenhain Reservoir and the expansion of the San Vicente Dam / Reservoir) to
boost emergency supplies locally, increased emphasis on water conservation and recycling, and
protecting and enhancing imported water supplies.
The District also promotes water conservation through a number of mechanisms including
distribution of conservation literature, providing water audit kits, participating in the ultra-low
flush toilet rebate program, and providing rebates or financial assistance for low-water use
appliances.

 The two million gallons of recycled water which is generated per day is currently utilized
 within the seven recreational lakes and for irrigation at the Santee Recreational Lakes Regional
 Park, freeway rights-of-way, City medians and parks, schools and other applications City-wide.
 The District’s plans to expand the use of recycled water and recycled water markets are
 detailed in their 1991 Water Reclamation Master Plan. The plan for expanding the use of
 recycled water is to first maximize recycled water service to existing and potential customers
 already within reach of the existing recycled water system and then to expand the system to
 reach new customers. The District currently requires developers within the service area of the
 existing system to provide dual-piping systems to allow the use of recycled water for landscape
 irrigation.
 4.2      Land Resources
 Landforms - Two main topographic features exist within the City of Santee - the coastal plain
 of the Coastal Province, and the foothills of the Peninsular Range Province. The narrow
 coastal plain, which is dominated by terraces or mesas and dissected by the San Diego River,
 occupies the majority of the City. This area, which is found in the center of the City, is
 characterized by relatively flat topography. Within the north and southeastern portions of the
 City are the foothills of the Peninsular Range. Topography is generally steeper in the far
 northern areas of the City, including the Carlton Hills and Fanita Ranch areas, and in the south
 including the Rattlesnake Mountain, Mission Trails and Grossmont Mesa areas.
 Geology - The geology and subsurface formations of Santee include Eocene Age sediments of
 the Friars Formation and Stadium Conglomerate, which comprise the marine terraces of the
 coastal plain landform. These sediments are generally underlain by granitic rock, which
 comprises the primary subsurface formation of the Peninsular Range. The rock strata
 underlying Santee was created as a result of the compaction of various rock sediments over
 thousands of years, thus its sedimentary designation. Alluvium and colluvium surficial
 deposits occur in the drainage bottoms and lower slopes within the City. The City’s geologic
 and soils conditions (discussed below) are discussed in greater detail in the Safety Element.
 Soils - The geologic straitigraphy of Santee consists of several surficial soil types including
 undocumented or previously placed fill, topsoil, colluvium, alluvium / debris flows, landslide
 deposits and terrace deposits. In general, surficial soils consisting of alluvium and colluvium
 are found in drainage areas, such as the San Diego River channel and near the bases of slopes.
 As discussed within the Safety Element, those soils associated with the Friars Formation and
 those soils located within valley and drainage bottoms are susceptible to erosion or other more
 significant forms of earth movement (landslides).
 Mineral Resources - Valuable sand, gravel and crushed rock resources, extremely important to
 the construction industry, are found in the City. Known collectively as aggregate, these
 commodities provide bulk and strength to concrete, cement, oil-based road mix, and plaster or
 stucco products. They are also used in road bases, sub-bases, and as fill for construction of
 homes and businesses. River sand and gravel is preferred to crushed stone for aggregate

because the naturally fragmented and rounded material is less expensive to quarry, and a wet
mix made with rounded particles of alluvial sand and gravel has better workability.
The portion of the upper San Diego River, which flows through Santee and Lakeside, contains
a significant share of the available construction sand reserves of the metropolitan San Diego
market area. San Diego River sand is of high enough quality to be competitive with other
sources in the County. The depth of the best deposits vary from 10 feet to 60 feet, although
industry sources report pockets of deeper deposits.

                                              Diego County. The report uses the term "Mineral
                                              Resource Zone" (MRZ) to describe the potential for
                                              mineral resources in an area. Santee has land
                                              designated in two categories: MRZ-2 and MRZ-3.
                                              MRZ-2 designates areas where adequate
                                              information exists to indicate that significant
mineral deposits are present or where it was judged that a high likelihood for their presence
exists. MRZ-3 areas are those containing mineral deposits whose significance cannot be
evaluated from available data. This classification also includes areas where both acceptable
and unacceptable quality material are intermixed, usually in layers. No new Mineral Resource
Zones were identified in Santee as part of the 1996 update.
In Santee, the areas designated in the MRZ-2 zone are primarily along the floodplain of the San
Diego River and on hills underlain by granitic rocks. These hills are located north of the
existing development in Carlton Hills, south of Prospect Avenue between Mesa Road and
Fanita Drive, and the north end of Magnolia Avenue. The remainder of Santee is designated
MRZ-3. Obviously, in spite of the potential for mineral recovery from any MRZ area,
consideration of economics, land use compatibility and environmental protection, including
regional habitat protection efforts, must be considered when deciding on the appropriateness of
mining in a particular area.
Existing Aggregate Mining Operations - Santee is one of the jurisdictions in San Diego County
having mines with in-stream sand deposits that meet the quality specifications for concrete
aggregate. Santee has three aggregate mining operations: (RCP - Pit #1, RCP - Pit #2, and
RCP - Pit #3) located in the San Diego River east of Magnolia Avenue. These three mining
operations have been active since the 1970’s and are approaching completion.
In 1991, a reclamation plan for these mines was approved by the City. The reclamation plan
calls for the mined areas to be reclaimed in phases as mining is completed in the various
stretches of the river. As of 2002, approximately 50% of the mining operation has been
reclaimed. As mining

 San Diego River.
 Existing as well as proposed new mining operations are subject to regulations for health,
 safety, water quality, land use and environmental compatibility by local, regional, state and
 federal agencies. These regulations are described within the Implementation Section later in
 this Element.
 4.3      Archaeological and Cultural Resources
 Cultural resources are defined as those environmental components which are fragile and non-
 renewable evidences of human activity as reflected in districts, sites, structures, artifacts, works
 of art, and natural features that were of importance in human events. As contained within the
 Santee City limits, these primarily consist of archaeological sites, features, and structures
 ranging from early prehistoric to recent historic age.
 Prehistoric Resources - The San Diego River Valley has been a prime focus for human
 occupation since Native American hunter-gatherers first arrived in the San Diego County
 region. While climatic conditions are known to have fluctuated during the prehistoric period,
 the valley would have remained an important environment, providing both a reliable water
 supply and abundant fauna and floral resources. Settlement of this rich environment was
 extensive in its range from the coast to the mountains and intensive in its relative density of
 sites. Archaeologically, the settlements are evidenced today in numerous prehistoric resources
 that dot the river valley area in and around Santee.
 At present, 65 cultural sites are known to occur within the Santee city limits, based on a review
 of official records. The great majority of cultural resources in the Santee area are prehistoric
 sites (60) with one that has both a prehistoric and an historic component. Prehistoric sites in
 the area tend to be characterized by diversity in the archaeological assemblage including
 bedrock milling stations, artifact scatters, and midden soils varying in size from small,
 temporary encampments to large, complex habitation areas. This is evidenced by the fact that
 only 20 sites are defined by only a lithic artifact scatter.
 Most are late prehistoric in age though a few may relate to the Early Archaic and Paleo-Indian
 cultural traditions. The late prehistoric sites may be affiliated with the Kumeyaay people that
 inhabited the area at the time of Euro-American contact. Fifteen prehistoric sites have been
 evaluated for eligibility to the state or national register. Six of these were determined eligible
 for listing and nine were ineligible. Human remains are known to occur at only one site. That
 site was evaluated and determined eligible to the National Register of Historic Places.
 Historic Resources - Whereas those cultural resources related to Native American occupation
 are classified as prehistoric, those related to Euro-American presence in the region are defined
 s historic resources. In San Diego, the historic period begins with establishment of the first

mission in Alta, California by Father Junipero Serra in 1769. Lasting until about 1824, this
first phase of historic occupation has been designated the Spanish missionization and early
agricultural development period. Following this, other phases are delineated: the Mexican land
grant distribution (1824-1920); and finally the Modern Period (1920-present) (Wirth
Associates, 1983).
Five historic sites have been recorded within Santee, representing less than 10 percent of the
total cultural resource inventory. One of these, SDI-5535/H, is an historic trash scatter that
also contains a prehistoric component. Two of the sites date to the early 1930's and were
recorded during a survey for proposed State Route 52. They include an historic trash site near
Cuyamaca Street and Mission Gorge Road, and a Depression-era agricultural complex located
in the eastern part of the City near Woodside Avenue. Another site is the Edgemoor Farm Polo
Barn within the vicinity of Mission Gorge Road and Magnolia Avenue, an area that may
contain numerous historic archaeological remains. The fifth site is an historic trash scatter that
has not been assessed. Only SDI-5535/H has been evaluated for NRHP listing and it was
subsequently determined to be ineligible.
Historic Structures - The City has one structure which is listed on the National Register of
Historic Places: the Edgemoor Farm Dairy Barn, or Polo Barn. Located on the Edgemoor
Hospital Grounds on Magnolia Avenue, the barn was built in 1913 by Walter H. Dupee to
house his prize cattle and champion polo ponies. The barn was added to the National Register
in 1985. The City also has one officially registered Local Historic Landmark, the James Love
House, or Granite House. The Granite House is located on the City’s maintenance yard
property on Hazeldon Drive, just south of Forester Creek. The Granite House was built in 1934
of granite quarried from the Coyote Hill quarry, now the site of the Cameron’s Mobile Estates
Mobilehome Park. The house was officially recognized by the City as a local historical
landmark in May, 1995. The structure does not however, qualify for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places. The Granite House will be relocated due to the impending
construction of the State Route 52 freeway.
Resource Evaluation - Currently most of the City is either urbanized and therefore of low
probability for significant cultural resources, or has been subjected to surveys within the last
decade resulting in complete resource inventories. As such, the potential for unexamined areas
with significant and California Register of Historic Resources eligible historic properties (sites)
is fairly low. The cultural resource sensitivity map (Figure 6-2) delineates areas within the
City of moderate potential for yet unidentified sites; the remaining unshaded area is considered
to be of lower potential, though not completely devoid of cultural resources. The low category
consists of the developed areas and sloping terrain, while the moderate includes two pockets of
land in the northern area of the city and the river plain itself, where there is the potential for
buried archaeological sites.
Since a few areas remain that have not been surveyed, additional sites can be anticipated,
especially buried sites located along the San Diego River. This area is delineated as being of
moderate potential for significant and register-eligible archaeological deposits which may be
encountered during construction-related excavations exceeding a meter in depth. The three

CONSERVATION ELEMENT
 general subareas of Santee are discussed below. These may be either regions of known
 significant resources or lands of projected resource potential.
 San Diego River - This corridor bisects the City from east to west, and consists of the
 prehistoric floodplain of the river. Numerous studies have been conducted in this subarea
 resulting in the discovery of major villages, several temporary camps, lithic scatters and
 milling stations. Also, most of the historic resources are located in this area, or are predicted to
 exist subsurface. Because of periodic flooding of the corridor, alluvial deposits may have
 buried many significant sites (thus necessitating different detection methods then would be
 used for surveys on high ground).
 Sycamore Canyon - This subarea consists of a portion of the eastern slope of the north-south
 trending Sycamore Canyon. Extensive development in the southern half of the canyon has
 obliterated most of the previously identified sites. However, a grouping of prehistoric loci in
 the northern portion of the canyon have been identified by recent surveys and are considered
 important. Included are village/temporary campsites with midden, rock art, rock features and
 other archaeological debris of both scientific and heritage value. These sites appear to be
 affiliated with the Late Prehistoric occupation of the region and, given their close proximity to
 the Mission, may yield important data on the period succeeding Spanish contact.
 North Magnolia Avenue - This area consists of the undeveloped land bounded by Fanita Ranch
 on the west and north, the city limits on the east, and residential subdivisions centered around
 Magnolia Avenue on the south. Although only prehistoric sites are known to occur within the
 area, the majority of acreage in this small interior valley has not been systematically
 inventoried; thus, the potential for additional resources is considered moderate.
 4.4      Biological Resources
 The regionally important biological resources that occur with the City include the coastal sage
 scrub and chaparral-covered hills in the north and south of the City and the riparian corridor
 along the San Diego River.
 Chaparral and Coastal Sage Scrub communities occur throughout the City on undeveloped
                                                  hillside areas in the North Magnolia Area, Fanita
                                                  Ranch, Rattlesnake Mountain and in the

                                                  Avenue and Rancho Fanita Drive. These
                                                  communities also provide valuable wildlife
                                                  habitat for a diverse group of species, including
                                                  protected species like the California Gnatcatcher.

riparian vegetation. The channel has been improved as a fully naturalized earthen channel
between Mast Park and Cuyamaca Street and ongoing sand mining occurs in the stretch east of
Magnolia Avenue.
Riparian/wetland communities are considered to be significant wildlife habitat, particularly for
bird species including the Least Bell’s Vireo. This resource is declining rapidly in San Diego
County and should be protected and enhanced in order to preserve the diverse native wildlife
that it supports. There are over 300 acres of wetland vegetation communities in the City,
concentrated primarily along the San Diego River and Sycamore Creek. Very little riparian
vegetation remains along Forester Creek, although restoration and habitat enhancement are
planned as part of the City’s Forester Creek Improvement Project. Freshwater aquatic
vegetation is found around man-made ponds in Sycamore Canyon (Santee Lakes) and the San
Diego River bed. This freshwater habitat is considered valuable to wildlife particularly in
combination with streamside woodlands.
There are several areas within the City of Santee that remain relatively undisturbed by urban
                                    development and contain adequate resources to support
                                    "high interest" floral or fauna species. These areas are

                                    to west, containing approximately 1,000 acres of natural
                                    and disturbed habitat. This corridor also functions as an
                                    important continuous wildlife corridor through the City.
                                    Tributaries to the San Diego River (e.g., Sycamore and
                                    Forester Creek) are important complements to this habitat,
                                    although habitat value in Forester Creek is somewhat
                                    degraded. Sand extraction in the central and eastern portion
                                    of the San Diego River has both disturbed (through
                                    mining) and enhanced (through ponding) valuable aquatic
                                    habitats.
Sycamore Canyon - This drainage is the most biologically significant tributary to the San
Diego River within the City of Santee. The man-made Santee Lakes and water treatment
ponds along Sycamore Creek, which parallel the northwestern City boundary, provide
important aquatic and woodland habitat for a variety of wildlife similar to the San Diego River.
Santee Recreational Lakes are considered one of the more popular areas for bird watching in
San Diego County. The adjacent woodland drainages and brush cover slopes also are identified
as excellent wildlife habitat.
Fanita Ranch - This area occupies 2,589 acres of the northern quadrant of the City, including
portions of Sycamore Canyon. The property contains a diverse mix of vegetation communities
including coastal sage scrub, chaparral, vernal pools, freshwater marsh, riparian woodland, and
native and non-native grasslands. Sensitive species known to occur on the site include the
California gnatcatcher, Cooper’s hawk, San Diego horned lizard,

 coastal sage scrub and chaparral communities. Grassland habitats are located in the foothill
 areas and a narrow band of riparian vegetation exists along Big Rock Creek and in small
 drainages south of Prospect Avenue. While surveys in these areas have been limited, known
 sensitive species include California gnatcatchers, San Diego horned lizard, San Diego barrel
 cactus and the San Diego goldenstar. Unoccupied vernal pools have been identified on the
 mesa top just north of Grossmont College.

 by coastal sage scrub vegetation. Sensitive plant species identified on the site during surveys
 conducted in 2002 include the San Diego barrel cactus and the San Diego sunflower. Sensitive
 animal species identified during those surveys include more than a dozen California
 gnatcatchers along with Cooper’s hawk, San Diego horned lizards, red diamondback
 rattlesnakes, Loggerhead shrike, orange throated whiptail lizards and California Rufous
 crowned sparrows. While it is a somewhat isolated area biologically, previous surveys have
 demonstrated the ability of the site to support a relatively stable population of gnatcatchers.
 4.5     Open Space
 Within the City of Santee there exists a diversity of open space resources, which are shown on
 Figure 6-4, Existing Open Space. They include designated open space lands (parks and
 floodways), large privately-owned vacant parcels of land, numerous small privately-held open
 space easements, school facilities, and other publicly-owned land. These open space resources
 provide numerous beneficial functions within the City; the primary ones being the provision of
 scenic relief and vistas, habitat preservation, watershed protection and recreation.

Santee has almost 3,000 acres of currently designated or planned open space lands in the City.
This acreage includes six City parks, the Santee Lakes Regional Park and Campground, the
portion of Mission Trails Regional Park within Santee, land within the floodways of the San
Diego River and Sycamore and Forester Creeks, open space easements and future Multiple
Species Conservation Program Preserve lands (Table 6-1). The parks are discussed in more
detail in the Recreation Element and the floodways are addressed in the Safety Element.
Parkland - Public parkland is land currently used for various recreational purposes and owned
or operated by public agencies. Mast Park, Woodglen Vista Park, Santee Mini-Park, West
Hills Park (discussed below), Shadow Hill Park, Big Rock Park, Town Center Community
Park and the San Diego River Park are City of Santee parks. The portions of Mission Trials
Regional Park within Santee are owned by the City and County of San Diego. The Santee
Lakes Regional Park and Campground is owned and operated by the Padre Dam Municipal
Water District.
In 1991 the City, together with the State, County of San Diego and the City of Poway,
purchased the 321-acre Goodan Ranch property which is located approximately one mile north
of Santee at Poway’s southern border. Now known as the Goodan Ranch Regional Park, the
park provides recreational opportunities such as hiking, biking and equestrian uses, as well as
preserving important habitat and open space.
Santee residents also have access to many acres of recreational open space that are not under
the direct control of the City. This includes the Padre Dam Municipal Water District's Santee
Lakes Regional Park (discussed above), the Carlton Oaks Golf Course, and school
playgrounds, ballfields and pool facilities. These facilities are discussed in more detail in the
Recreation Element.
                                           San Diego River Park Plan – This plan is the
                                           culmination of over 20 years of planning and
                                           implementation by the City. When completed, the
                                           park will stretch along both sides of the San Diego
                                           River across the entire length of the City, covering
                                           over 300 acres. The park is also a major component
                                           of the City’s draft Multiple Species Conservation
                                           Program Subarea Plan. This park involves multiple
                                           ownerships and is being implemented in phases. So
                                           far, approximately one-half of the park has been
completed or secured. The park will include restored habitat, public recreation areas (i.e. Mast
Park and Mission Creek) and over six miles of public trails. A more complete discussion of the
Santee River Park appears in the Recreation Element.
Floodways - Santee also has six waterways, including the San Diego River, Forester Creek,
Sycamore Creek, Woodglen Vista Creek, and intermittent creeks paralleling Big Rock Road
and
                                                                 Santee General Plan

CONSERVATION ELEMENT
 Fanita Drive. Floodways are considered for open space designation for reasons related to their
 natural and human functions. Natural functions include carrying waters (normal and storm
 flows), pollutant filtration (water quality), groundwater replenishment, habitat and wildlife
 dispersal corridors. Human functions include providing visual relief, water storage, recreation,
 and sources of sand and gravel.
 Multiple Species Conservation Program Preserve Areas – The City is in the process of
 obtaining approval of it’s Multiple Species Conservation Program (MSCP) Subarea Plan,
 which identifies those areas of the City which will be conserved as permanent open space for
                                                   preservation of habitats and species. As per the
                                                   established goals of the regional MSCP Plan,
                                                   Santee’s Subarea plan will balance economic
                                                   development with species conservation. The
                                                   Plan will specify where future development, as
                                                   well as habitat preservation, is expected to
                                                   occur and what mitigation which will be
                                                   required of future development. Through this
                                                   plan, the City intends to preserve a minimum
                                                   of 2,600 acres of open space.
                                                   The majority of the preserve lands are in
 private ownership. These portions of the preserve will be assembled over time by either
 development exactions or through purchase by either public or private entities. Once the
 preserve is assembled, these lands will provide protection for sensitive plant and animal
 species, visual and aesthetic benefits, and recreational opportunities such as biking, hiking and
 nature appreciation.
 Open Space Easements - Numerous open space easements have either been granted or assigned
 to the City, or to private land management entities. The majority of these easements have been
 granted as conditions of approval for residential subdivisions, generally preserving open areas
 of high biological value or steep slopes. While these easements are not generally available for
 public access or recreational purposes, they do provide important functions, including habitat
 and species preservation and visual relief from adjacent developed areas.
 Land Outside/Adjacent to Santee - Santee's location on the fringe of the San Diego
 metropolitan area gives it visual access to much additional open space beyond its borders. On
 a clear day, El Capitan Reservoir Recreation Area is well within view and the peaks of the
 Laguna Mountains are visible in the distance. In addition, Santee is almost completely
 surrounded by undeveloped land. Mission Trails Regional Park abuts the City on the west and
 southwest as well as being partially within Santee, providing recreational opportunities as well
 as a scenic backdrop to the west. Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, which includes
 thousands of acres of vacant land, borders the City to the west and northwest. The County's

Sycamore Open Space Preserve and the Goodan Ranch, comprising more than 2,000 acres of
natural land, are immediately north of Santee.
A low-density portion of the Lakeside community is to the east, with El Capitan Reservoir and
the Peninsular Ranges farther in the distance. Gillespie Field, immediately to the south of the
City and within El Cajon, constitutes a large open space area necessary for aviation and public
safety. The airfield provides a buffer between Santee and industrial areas within El Cajon.
The Conservation Element recognizes the value of these adjacent open space lands to Santee's
visual setting. Their use will remain a matter of importance to the City although most of the
above land is located outside the City limits.
Santee Recreation, Open Space and Conservation System (SANTEE ROCS!) – The Multiple
Species Conservation Program Subarea lands and designated open space areas discussed within
this element are two of the components of the City’s SANTEE ROCS! Plan. This plan brings
together several independent but related efforts, to create a comprehensive, City-wide system
of open space, parks and trails. The plan is discussed in detail in the Land Use Element.

 5.0      Needs
 5.1      Water Resources
 Hydrology - The natural watercourses within the City provide unique riparian habitat for
 various flora and fauna, filtration of urban pollutants, aesthetically appealing open space and
 passive recreational opportunities for the citizens of Santee. As such, the City needs to
 encourage the maintenance of appropriate open space uses adjacent to these waterways. This
 would reduce flood damage hazards, improve water quality, protect visual quality, promote
 recreational uses, and maintain use of these areas as wildlife habitats.
 Flooding of the various watercourses within the City is regarded as a significant public safety
 hazard as described within the Safety Element. One means for reducing this potential hazard
 would involve either the designation of low intensity land uses (open space) adjacent to these
 waterways or flood control improvements to the various waterways where flooding already
 exists as a problem. Flood control solutions must emphasize the consideration of wildlife
 habitat, water quality, and visual resource values. Priority should be given to natural stream
 channel designs for all flood protection projects.
 The mining of sand and gravel resources from water corridors has also contributed to
 increasing flood hazards in some areas and has threatened bridges, utility lines and other public
 facilities. To assure that these flood impacts are reduced, the City needs to carefully review all
 existing and proposed mining operations within water corridors, and require the mitigation of
 all identified impacts (i.e., flooding, bridge abutment scouring) where significant problems are
 identified or anticipated.
 Domestic Water - The rate of population growth projected within the City, in conjunction with
 anticipated regional growth, will result in an increased demand for water, thus placing an
 increasing burden on the common supplies of water for Santee and surrounding cities.
 To assure that adequate water supplies are made available in the future, the City should
 continue close coordination with the Padre Dam Municipal Water District on proposed
 development projects to assure that sufficient water supplies are available before development
 is approved. In addition, the City needs to continue to encourage water conservation measures

such as drought tolerant landscaping and water conserving irrigation technologies on both
private developments as well as on public projects and in public facilities.
                                 Water Recycling - The Padre Dam Municipal Water District
                                 operates a state-of-the-art water reclamation facility at the
                                 north end of the Santee Lakes Regional Park. The recycled
                                 water produced here is used for recreational and irrigation
                                 purposes. The City should continue to work with the District
                                 in implementing the District’s Water Reclamation Master Plan
                                 as new development is proposed and, as development occurs,
                                 to support the district’s planned expansion of the treatment
                                 facility to its ultimate capacity.
Water Quality - The City of Santee needs to preserve and enhance water quality and protect
designated beneficial uses of all local waters, while accomplishing economic growth and land
use objectives. Water quality issues to be addressed by the City include urban runoff and
stormwater discharge pollution from residential, commercial, industrial, construction and
municipal non-point sources. Water quality objectives need to be addressed through the
implementation of urban runoff management programs and enforcement of regulatory
requirements.
The City recognizes that water pollution control measures are important on a local level as well
as a regional watershed level. In response to regional water quality objectives, the City needs
to collaborate with surrounding jurisdictions in order to reduce impacts on receiving water
bodies. Collective efforts will address common issues, promote consistency, and coordinate
activities to reduce and prevent urban runoff pollution.
5.2     Land Resources
Landforms, Geology and Soils - The landforms, geology and soils are important considerations
for development in the City, primarily with respect to the potential for landslides, soil
liquefaction and slope instability as discussed within the Safety Element. These potential
problems create engineering constraints, which affect foundation stability and general building
safety. Those areas within the City susceptible to potential hazards include the properties north
of Carlton Hills Boulevard, on both sides of Fanita Drive south of Prospect Avenue, along the
south-central City boundary, along the San Diego River and in the Sycamore Canyon drainage
sub-basin.
Mineral Resources - The City of Santee includes a number of areas containing valuable
mineral (primarily sand and gravel) resources. These include areas along the San Diego River,
within hilly areas north of Carlton Hills, south of Prospect Avenue between Mesa Road and
Fanita Drive, and at the north end of Magnolia Avenue. In view of the potential environmental
and flooding problems associated with the mining of these resources, the City needs to
carefully review and regulate all sand mining and mineral recovery proposals. This will ensure
that flood hazards and risks to public infrastructure are reduced, and environmental protection
is provided for.
                                                                    Santee General Plan

CONSERVATION ELEMENT
 Biological and Cultural Resources - Within the City of Santee, there are a number of identified
 significant and potentially significant biological and cultural resources as shown on Figures 6-2
 and 6-3. In order to ensure their consideration and preservation where appropriate, biological
 and cultural resources surveys need to be required as development is proposed. Mitigation for
 cultural resources should be required consistent with the California Environmental Quality Act
 and mitigation measures proposed in accordance with the significance of the identified impact.
 All development proposals impacting biological resources should be consistent with the
 provisions of the City’s future Multiple Species Conservation Program Subarea Plan and
 Implementing Agreement, and applicable State and Federal Regulations.
 Open Space – There are currently thousands of acres of undeveloped land throughout the City.
 Although some will remain as permanent open space and is designated as such, much of it may
 be developed in the future, mostly for residential uses. As land is developed, developers will
 be required to dedicate land for recreational purposes (or pay "in-lieu" park fees, per the Park
 Lands Dedication Ordinance), and for biological mitigation purposes. This land will provide
 biological, recreational and visual open space functions.
 The San Diego River should continue to be recognized as a significant central open space
 corridor, emphasizing its visual integrity, natural resources, and recreational opportunities.
 These goals should continue to guide the City’s efforts in assembling Santee’s San Diego River
 Park.
 In regard to open space distribution, many of the designated open space lands are in the form
 of hillsides along the City’s perimeter, surrounding the developed portions of the community.
 This circumstance is important to the character and identity of Santee. As such, retaining
 viewsheds to these surrounding slopes is an important goal.
    6.0 GOAL
    The goal of the Conservation Element is to conserve open space, natural and cultural
    resources.

Natural resources within the City are protected by existing federal, state, regional and local
regulations and review procedures as discussed below. Following the description of these
various regulations and review procedures are a number of implementation measures, which
can be utilized within the City to respond to the various needs described within this Element.
8.1     Federal Regulations
(1) The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires that any proposed project within
the City of Santee receiving any federal funds or approvals must prepare an environmental
assessment or analysis to determine whether the project could significantly impact the
environment. If it is determined that there is a potential for significant adverse impact, an
Environmental Impact Statement must be prepared which discusses the existing environment,
potential impacts, and possible mitigation measures.
(2) Federal laws and guidelines that protect cultural resources within the City include the
Antiquities Act, the U. S. Historical Sites Act, and the U. S. Act for the Preservation of
Historical and Archaeological Data.
(3) The Federal Endangered Species Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, and the Fish
and Wildlife Act of 1956 give the United States Fish and Wildlife Service the legal authority to
regulate the taking of protected species as well as the authority to issue permits and enter into
Subarea Plans and Implementing Agreements with local agencies.
(4) The Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (Clean Water Act) gave the U. S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to set and enforce effluent limitations and performance
standards for industries and publicly-owned waste treatment plants.               It provides a
comprehensive framework to address many causes of water pollution including municipal and
industrial wastewater discharges, polluted runoff from urban and rural areas, and habitat
destruction. The Santee Lakes Wastewater Reclamation Facility is regulated by this Agency.
8.2     State Regulations
(1) The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that an Initial Study must be
prepared for all proposed projects within the City requiring a discretionary approval to
determine whether the project could have a significant environmental impact. If it is
determined that there is a possibility of a significant adverse impact, more extensive
environmental documentation must be prepared which analyzes the existing environment, the
potential impacts, and identifies potential mitigation measures. This process leads to early
identification of natural and cultural resources and to the identification of measures that may
reduce the severity of, or avoid the potential impact.
(2) California’s primary statute governing water quality and water pollution issues is the
Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act of 1970 (Porter-Cologne Act). The Porter-Cologne
Act grants the State Water Resources Control Board and the Regional Water Quality Control
Boards broad powers to protect water quality and beneficial uses of water, and is the primary
                                                                 Santee General Plan

 vehicle for the implementation of California’s responsibilities under the Clean Water Act. The
 State Water
  Resources Control Board is responsible for creating state policies on water quality control.
 These policies are administered by the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board and
 ultimately provide water quality control regulations for local jurisdictions. The City of Santee
 is required by law to abide by these water quality regulations.
 (3) The California Department of Fish and Game is responsible for reviewing all
 development proposals within the City which would affect State-listed plant or animal species
 (California Endangered Species Act) or would require a major modification of any stream bed
 (Section 1600 of the Fish and Game Code).
 It also publishes a list of High Interest Faunal species, which although only advisory in nature,
 does, however, recommends the preservation of any species on this list. The California Native
 Plant Society, a private, non-profit organization, also publishes such a list. These lists can be
 utilized to identify, and subsequently protect significant faunal species within the City.
 (4) The State Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA) governs nearly all
 surface mining and land reclamation, and requires that the California State Mining and
 Geology Board adopt regulations which establish State policy for the reclamation of mined
 lands in accordance with the State SMARA. The Board has adopted the California Surface
 Mining and Reclamation Policies and Procedures and has also conducted a study of available
 mineral deposits in western San Diego County in accordance with the requirements of the
 SMARA.
 The State Surface Mining and Reclamation Act requires that the City: 1) submit            proposed
 mineral resource management policies to the California State Mining and Geology Board for
 review before adoption; 2) ensure that these proposed policies recognize mineral information
 classified by the State; 3) ensure that these policies emphasize the conservation and
 development of identified mineral deposits; 4) notify the State Geologist of the filing of any
 application for a permit to conduct surface mining operations; and 5) establish procedures for
 the review and approval of reclamation plans, and the issuance of permits to conduct surface
 mining operations.
 8.3     Regional Regulations
 The County Health Department issues permits for all wells to be drilled and for all septic tanks
   to be installed within the County. The issuance of a septic tank permit requires: 1)         that
 there be no sewer service within 200 feet of the project area, 2) that a percolation test be
 undertaken by a registered civil engineer, and 3) that adequate setbacks from waterways,
 drainages and aquifers as stipulated.

8.4     Local Regulations
(1)     The City is currently preparing it’s Multiple Species Conservation Program Subarea
Plan which will identify those areas of the City which will be conserved as permanent open
space for preservation of habitats and species. This plan will balance development with species
conservation, will specify where future development is expected to occur, and will identify
mitigation ratios for replacement of habitat areas impacted through the development process.
This plan is being prepared in close consultation with the State Department of Fish and Game
and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and will require their approval.
Implementation of the approved plan will be carried out by the City in accordance with the
Subarea Plan Implementing Agreement.
(2)     Resource extraction is regulated by the City primarily through the Surface Mining and
Reclamation Ordinance which is part of the City’s Grading Ordinance. This ordinance
specifies application requirements for establishing new mining operations and scope and
content of the required reclamation plan. All new mining operations in the City require
approval of a Conditional Use Permit. This allows application of certain conditions of approval
and can provide for the periodic review of the permit.
(3)     The Zoning Ordinance designates which types of uses are considered appropriate in
which areas and under what conditions certain uses may be considered appropriate. The City's
project review and environmental review processes are designed to allow for early recognition
of potential problems and to provide for potential solutions or mitigating measures so that
resources may be conserved to the maximum extent feasible. The City encourages
development to be clustered on project sites to maximize conserved open space. The Zoning
Ordinance also requires specific open space requirements for all multiple family developments.
(4)     The City's local Environmental Review Procedures, mandated by the California
Environmental Quality Act of 1970, provides a vehicle for the early recognition of impacts to
existing resources and identification of mitigation measures.
(5)     The City’s Municipal Code includes chapters on the accepted usage of all drainages and
watercourses (Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance), surface mining operations, water and
water supplies, storm water management and discharge control, and sewage and refuse
disposal.
(6)     The City has adopted a Park Lands Dedication Ordinance, which requires the
dedication of park lands or the payment of fees-in-lieu of dedication for all new residential
subdivisions.

In addition to identifying areas of planned open space, it is important to identify possible
funding sources and opportunities which can be used to assemble the City’s open space
network. Possible sources of funding and acquisition include:
Local Funding Sources / Mechanisms
(1)      Development Impact Fees – The City collects park-in-lieu fees for new development
when the development in lieu of actual public park construction. These fees can only be used
for providing public park facilities.
(2)      Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act – this act provides a tax-based method for
financing community facilities including park and open space acquisition. These districts
require a two-thirds approval of the affected electorate.
(3)      General Obligation Bonds – In June of 1986, California voters approved Proposition 46
which allows cities to issue general obligation bonds for the acquisition and improvement of
real property, including open space. These bonds are secured by the City’s property taxes. As
with Mello Roos Districts, a two-thirds voter approval requirement applies to the issuance of
these bonds.
(4)      Landscaping and Lighting Act of 1972 – this Act enables City’s to, among other things,
acquire land for park, recreation or open space purposes. These monies can also be used for
maintenance of open space or landscaped areas. The City currently has several Landscape
Maintenance Districts that were created through this act to maintain public landscape areas
along major City streets.
(5)      Regional Open Space Districts – An Open Space District is an independent special
districts that is created through the cooperative effort of a region’s cities, county and voters,
and governed by a legislative body consisting of a board of directors. Districts can operate and
maintain a system of public parks and open space preserves for public recreation, use, and
enjoyment, and may select, designate, and acquire land by grant, purchase, or condemnation.
(6)      Conservation Groups or Land Trusts – These are typically private organizations
devoted to protecting open space and resource lands. They rely on private funds, grants and
property gifts to carry out their acquisition and management activities. There are at least two
separate sites in the City currently owned by land trusts and managed for permanent open
space purposes. The City has authorized land trusts or private conservation groups to manage
mitigation lands dedicated by developers to satisfy mitigation requirements of development
projects.
(7)      Open Space or Conservation Easements – this mechanism allows land to be protected
for open space or conservation purposes without requiring outright purchase. In this instance
the property owner grants to the City, or other land management entity an easement limiting
the use of the property as open space. These easements are often required on development
                                                                Santee General Plan
                                                                   Santee, California

 projects when open space areas are set aside as conditions of a project development. Numerous
 open space easements exist throughout the City.
 State Funds
 (1)     Park Bond Acts (PBA) - Subset programs contained within the bond acts include:
 Per Capita Allocations – based on population, these are allocations received automatically
 received through passage of the bond act.
 Roberti-Z’Berg-Harris – similar to per capita, but with a “low income communities”
 component. Santee does not qualify for the low-income component, but does receive
 per-capita funding.
 Historical and Cultural Resources – this component of the PBA has legislatively allocated
 funding for the “acquisition, development, preservation and interpretation of buildings, sites,
 places and artifacts that preserve and demonstrate culturally significant aspects of California’s
 history.”
 Land, Air and Water Conservation Program – The current PBA has substantial funding which
 has been legislatively allocated to various conservancies throughout the State, most notably the
 Coastal Conservancy. This portion of funding will not be available to municipalities, but does
 fund the activities of private conservancy groups for open space preservation activities.
 (2)     Wildlife Conservation Board - funds will be continuously appropriated for “the
 acquisition, development, rehabilitation, restoration, and protection of habitat that promotes the
 recovery of threatened and endangered species, that provides corridors linking separate habitat
 areas to prevent fragmentation, and that protects significant natural landscapes and ecosystems
 such as old growth redwoods and oak woodlands and other significant habitat areas.” Some
 funds will be appropriated for specific projects while other aspects will be competitive.
 (3)     Protection of Water Resources program - provides funding for the acquisition and
 development of river parkways and the protection of urban streams. The State Water Board
 will apportion these funds at a rate of at least $5 Million per year. Prior programs have been
 competitive.
 (4)     State Annual Programs – the State Department of Parks and Recreation or the
 Department of Water Resources administers these programs.
 Urban Streams – funds are available for “projects that prevent property damage through stream
 protection and restoration.”

                                                   CONSERVATION ELEMENT
Habitat Conservation – these are annual competitive grants funded at about $2 million per year
among four categories ($500,000 each). The category most likely to apply to the City of Santee
is the “Trails and Urban Access Program.”
Specified Grants – these are annual specified allocations made by the legislature for specific
projects. Lobbying efforts are critical to obtaining funding through this program.
Federal Funding
(1)      Land and Water Conservation Fund – this is a federal program administered by the
State that dates back to 1965, and was reenacted with 1999 legislation. Funds are available on a
competitive basis, with a Southern California preference (60%/40%). It is for the “acquisition
of land and facilities that support outdoor recreation.”
(2)      Recreational Trails Program – another federal program administered at the State level.
It is for the “acquisition of easements and fee simple title to property for recreational trails or
recreational trail corridors.” There are motorized and non-motorized components, with the
majority of the funding available on a competitive basis.
(3)      Urban Park & Recreation Recovery (UPARR) - provides matching grants to local
governments to rehabilitate recreation areas and facilities, provides for the development of
improved recreation programs, sites and facilities. It is a component of the Land and Water
Conservation Fund (LWCF).
(4)      Conservation Easements & Species Recovery - provides annual, dedicated funding for
conservation easements/landowner incentives for the recovery of endangered/threatened
species. Up to $150 Million/year is available nationwide under this component of the LWCF
program.
(5)      Specified Grants – like the State programs, there are annual legislative allocations
made. Lobbying efforts are key to getting these funds. Most of the grant funding in recent
years has gone to low income areas and tribal reservations; however, there are other grants to
higher income areas as well.

1. LAND USE ELEMENT
The Land Use Element is one of the
seven mandatory elements in a General
Plan. It is intended to be the guide to the
ultimate pattern of development in the
community. It specifies the location,
type and amount of housing, commercial
services, industrial uses, parks and
public facilities and open space that will
comprise the City at buildout. and it’s
employment centers. In practice it is the
most visible and often used element in
the General Plan.
1.0     Statutory Requirements
The California Planning and Zoning Laws specify that every General Plan in the State of
California shall include seven mandatory elements. One of these mandatory elements is the
Land Use Element. Section 65302 of the Planning and Zoning Laws states that the Land Use
Element is intended to designate “ the proposed general distribution and general location and
extent of the uses of land for housing, business, industry, open space, including agriculture,
natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public buildings and
grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and other categories of public and private
uses of land. The land use element shall include a statement of the standards of population
density and building density recommended for the various districts and other territory
covered by the plan.”
2.0     Accomplishments Since Adoption of the General Plan
Since the adoption of the City’s first General Plan in August of 1984, the City has fulfilled
many of the goals, and implemented the policies that are found in the Land Use Element.
Major accomplishments include:
i 1984 – The City adopts the Development Review Ordinance to ensure more detailed
                                                      review of development projects to ensure
                                                      that development in the City adhere to
                                                      high quality design principles and to
                                                      ensure the provision of adequate public
                                                      facilities.
                                                  i July, 1985 – The City adopts it’s first
                                                      Zoning Ordinance which includes
                                                      specific standards for residential,
                                                                  Santee General Plan

      commercial and industrial development to implement the goals, objectives and policies of
      the City’s General Plan.
 i October, 1986 - The City Council adopts the Town Center Specific Plan, the master plan
      to guide the development of the City’s Town Center. The plan includes provisions for
      retail commercial, office professional, civic center, recreational and other appropriate uses
      to establish a focal point for the City. Since that time, almost one million square feet of
      retail and office uses have been developed along with over 400 residential units. Over five
      miles of pedestrian paths have been constructed and successful revegetation of a potion of
      the San Diego River completed.
 i March, 1987 – The City Council adopts the Mission Gorge Road Design Standards to
      guide the development and redevelopment of this local scenic road and design sensitive
      corridor. The standards address architecture, landscaping, public improvements and
      circulation issues, providing specific guidelines for future development.
 i September, 1987 – The Town Center Development Committee is formed to facilitate
      development of the new Town Center Area in accordance with the Town Center Specific
      Plan.
 i July, 1992 – The City adopts the Santee Civic Square Master Plan to guide the future
      development of the City’s property at the northeast corner of Mission Gorge Road and
      Cuyamaca Street. The objective of the master plan was to provide an integrated approach
      to the planning and development of this cornerstone property.
 i August, 2000 – The City Council establishes a high tech office overlay over more than
      100 acres of the Town Center, south of the San Diego River. The intent of the overlay is
      to facilitate the establishment of a high-end businesspark with ancillary residential and
      commercial uses.
 i In 1997 the City won a small jurisdiction planning implementation award from the San
      Diego chapter of the American Planning Association for implementation of the Town
      Center Specific Plan.
 i In 2001, the San Diego Association of Governments identified the Mission Creek mixed-
      use project as a regionally significant example of Smart Growth development.
 3.0      Introduction
 Santee is a community which has transitioned from its rural heritage to an urbanized city. It
 is located in one of the most rapidly growing areas of the nation. Because of its location and
 physical environment, the City is experiencing significant pressures for growth and
 development. Development needs to be carefully managed and directed towards making a
 positive contribution to all sectors of the existing community.

                                                           LAND USE ELEMENT
The Land Use Element establishes a framework to direct the physical development of the
City and form the organization of the City's environment. The Land Use Plan (Figure 1-1)
indicates the intentions for the development, redevelopment, growth and preservation of
public and private properties within Santee through the year 2020. The Element establishes
the function and form of the City because it is a composite statement of the goals, objectives,
policies and programs of the other Elements of the General Plan. It serves as the primary
vehicle for ensuring the logical organization of residential, commercial, industrial and public
facilities, and for encouraging the timely provision of public facilities to meet the needs of the
community.
It also provides public decision-makers and private citizens with a means for obtaining a
clearer understanding of the long-range intentions of the City. As a result, both public and
private land use decisions made on a daily basis can be based on a stable overall framework
established for the City.
Relationship to Other Elements – The Land Use Element has perhaps the broadest scope of
all the General Plan Elements. The goals, objectives and policies of this element directly
affect all the other elements by establishing the future pattern of land uses, open space and
population densities. As an example, by identifying the location of the City’s residential,
employment and open space areas, the Land Use Element determines the location and
classification of the streets need to serve those land uses, the amount and distribution of park
and other recreation facilities and the levels of traffic noise and their impacts on sensitive
land uses. In practice, the Land Use Element is the most visible and influential element in the
General Plan.
The Land Use Plan is a summation and composite of the Goals and Objectives of all the
Elements in the General Plan. In differing degrees, all of the other Elements contain policies,
implementation measures and mapped information which relates to the Land Use Plan in
terms of establishing development procedures and modifying land use forms, layouts and
intensities based on distinct physical features in the City. Therefore, each Element of the
General Plan must be referred to for a complete understanding of the purposes, intentions and
development requirements embodied in the Land Use Plan.
Community Development (Circulation Element, Trails Element, Housing Element,
Recreation Element) - The Circulation Element and the Land Use Element are strategically
related in two basic ways. First, the determination of land uses has had a direct effect on the
level of service required along the various segments of the circulation system. Thus, the
street and travel patterns enable activities associated with land uses to be undertaken. In
contrast, the potential impacts which the circulation system brings (accessibility, noise, traffic
safety concerns, etc.) affect the type and location of potential land uses. Single-family
residential land uses are generally located along collector and local streets. Multiple family
designations have been located along major trafficways to provide a desirable level of service
with increased traffic volumes. Commercial development has also been strategically located
along major travel routes to ensure adequate roadway capacities. Industrial uses are similarly

   LAND USE ELEMENT
 located along major transportation routes to provide needed access and eliminate potential
 traffic conflicts in single-family residential areas.
 The Housing Element has been implemented on the Land Use Plan by accommodating a
 variety of residential densities that were located through an analysis of physical parameters
 (adjacent land uses, access, natural features). The distribution and intensities of residential
 uses have also addressed the socio-economic program mandates of the Housing Element.
 The Recreation Element establishes various standards and criteria for the passive and active
 recreational facilities necessary to adequately serve the population anticipated with
 implementation of the Land Use Plan.
 Resource Management (Conservation Element) - This Element identifies distinct areas within
 the City that support significant natural resources and open space areas. It establishes
 policies and implementation measures for controlling the impacts of development on the
 natural environment within these identified areas. This Element also defines areas to be
 maintained in their natural state for resource preservation (Multiple Species Conservation
 Program Subarea Plan) and open space purposes.
 Public Health and Safety (Noise Element and Safety Element) - These Elements together
 have assessed natural and man-induced hazards and established appropriate policies and
 implementation measures that restrict the intensity and pattern of development in certain
 areas of the City.
 Community Enhancement Element - This Element provides development controls in the form
 of design guidelines for the built environment, including streetscapes and areas of significant
 visual quality or sensitivity. The policies and implementation measures were determined
 after identification of design resources and establishment of community design goals and
 objectives.
 4.0      Existing Conditions
 4.1      Location and Surrounding Land Uses
 The City of Santee encompasses about 17 square miles (approximately 10,615 acres) in
 eastern San Diego County. It is located approximately 18 miles east of downtown San Diego.
 The Regional Location Map, Figure I-1, illustrates the City’s regional location.
 The City is bordered on the east by primarily residential development in the unincorporated
 San Diego County communities of Lakeside and Eucalyptus Hills and to the northeast by
 vacant land and active mining operations in Slaughterhouse Canyon (Figure 1-2). To the
 south, Santee is bordered by the City of El Cajon, unincorporated areas of the County of San
 Diego and the Gillespie Field Airport and further to the southwest by Mission Trails Regional
 Park property located in the City of San Diego.

To the west of the City is the Mission Trails Regional Park and East Elliot areas of the City of
San Diego and the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. To the north, the City is bordered by
vacant, privately owned land in the County of San Diego, as well as the County’s Sycamore
Canyon Open Space Preserve. Further to the north lies the Goodan Ranch Regional Park,
which is jointly owned by the Cities of Santee and Poway, the County of San Diego and the
State of California.
4.2      Historical Context
Originally, Santee was a rural area known for it dairies, ranches and vineyards which were
developed along the San Diego River. As transportation facilities were introduced to the
area, such as the railroad, Mission Gorge Road and Highway 67, housing gradually began to
develop around the San Diego River corridor.
During the 1950’s the City experienced a relatively rapid rate of growth. By 1961, in
association with the rapid development that included the development of the Carlton Hills
area, the population had grown to approximately 11,400 persons. The City experienced a
substantial population growth during the 1960’s. The estimated population at the end of that
decade was 27,000 persons and the total residential units, including both single family houses
and mobile homes, increased in number to 8,570. During the first half of the 1970’s, the
Santee population rose from 27,000 persons to 34,000 persons. That decade ended with a
City population of 40,039 persons.
In December 1980, the City of Santee was officially incorporated. The decade of the 1980’s
saw the beginning of a shift towards slower residential growth and an expansion in the City’s
industrial and commercial bases. While residential growth remained relatively strong, the
City added a significant amount of industrial development particularly in the established
industrial parks along Woodside Avenue and Prospect Avenue. In the last half of the 1980’s
the City added almost 800,000 square feet of industrial development. With the adoption of
the Town Center Specific Plan in 1986, the City began what would be a dramatic expansion
of it’s commercial base, adding almost 300,000 square feet during the last four years of the
decade.
The City began the decade of the 1990’s with a population of 52,902 persons. This decade
would see a significant reduction in residential growth, the result of a lack of available, easily
developable residential land, together with the removal of residential units resulting from the
first phases of the SR52 and SR125 freeways through the City. With the build-out of the
City’s industrial parks during the 1980’s, industrial growth slowed, with the City adding just
over 150,00 square feet of new industrial development. Commercial development, however,
was rapid, with the great majority of the increase occurring in the Town Center area. The City
completed East County’s first regional commercial power center by adding a new Home
Depot and WalMart into the Town Center. Together with other commercial developments
around the City, almost one million square feet of new commercial development was
constructed, helping to both expand employment opportunities as well as to solidify the
City’s fiscal base entering into the next millenium.

 4.3     Santee Today
 Population Characteristics – As of January 2002, the City of Santee supported a population of
 approximately 53,700 persons housed in approximately 18,475 dwelling units. Over seventy
 percent of the City’s housing stock is owner-occupied and over seventy percent of the
 households in the City are families. These counts were based on a land use inventory
 undertaken by the City and 2000 census data.
                                                 The average household size in Santee is 2.81
                                                 persons/dwelling unit. This compares to a
                                                 San Diego County average of 2.73
                                                 persons/dwelling unit. The average age of
                                                 persons residing in Santee is 34.8 years,
                                                 while the average age in the County of San
                                                 Diego as a whole is 33.2 years.
                                                 Santee’s median household income of
                                                 $53,620 is the highest of all the East County
                                                 cities according to the 2000 Census. The
                                                 median income in San Diego County as a
                                                 whole is $47,067.
 Public Services
 Schools - The Santee School District currently operates 10 elementary schools, 9 of which are
 located within the City limits. The Grossmont Union High School District operates two high
 schools in the City - Santana High School and West Hills High School. Community college
 services are provided by the Grossmont Community College, which is located directly to the
 south of the City boundary off Fanita Drive.
 Safety Services - Police protection is presently contracted through the San Diego County
 Sheriff's Department. The Sheriffs operate two facilities in Santee. The primary department
                                           offices are located at 8811 Cuyamaca Street. A
                                           storefront facility is located in the Santee Trolley
                                           Square Center in the Town Center area. (See
                                           Safety Element). The City has consistently
                                           maintained one of lowest crime rates of any City in
                                           the County.
                                           Fire protection, emergency medical assistance and
                                           paramedic services are provided by the City’s Fire
                                           Department. The City operates two fire stations,

Hospital District. (See Safety Element.)
Library Services - The Serra Cooperative Library System, in conjunction with the County of
San Diego, operates a public library in Santee located on Carlton Hills Blvd. The City has
plans for new, larger library to be located in the recently completed Santee Trolley Square
Center located at the northwest corner of Mission Gorge Road and Cuyamaca Street. The
City is currently investigating funding options for the library.
Waste Disposal - Water and sewage treatment facilities are provided to the City by the Padre
Dam Municipal Water District. Solid waste disposal including recycling and green waste, as
well as hazardous waste disposal services are provided by a City franchisee. A private
company, Landfill Systems, Inc., operates a landfill just outside the western City limits,
northwest of the intersection of Mast Blvd and West Hills Parkway.
Land Use Inventory - In January of 2001, a land use inventory was undertaken by the City to
determine the location of general land use types in the City and gross developed area by land
use type. Table 1-1 presents a breakdown of the approximate existing developed acreage
within the City.
The existing land use pattern in the City is illustrated on the Existing Land Use map, Figure
1-3. A brief summary follows:
                                                   Residential Land Uses - Residential uses in
                                                   Santee are primarily composed of single family
                                                   detached units on standard subdivision lots.
                                                   Table 1 reveals that over one-third of the
                                                   developed acreage in the City is in single
                                                   family housing uses. This residential product
                                                   type represents approximately 64% of the
                                                   City’s housing stock. Single family homes in
                                                   Santee are typically “starter homes”, of 1,200-
                                                   1,500 square feet in size on 6,000 square foot
                                                   lots. This type of residential development is
found in all sections of the City, but it is particularly dominant north of the San Diego River.
Since adoption of the City’s General Plan in 1984, this type of residential development has
been dominant; however there has been a marked shift towards larger move-up housing
products. Given the lack of available land in the R-2 district (6,000 square foot lot minimum),
the trend towards larger single family homes on larger lots is expected to comprise the
majority of future single family home development in the City.
Multi-family housing, including apartments and condominiums, together with mobile homes,
provide the balance of housing in the City today. There are currently 12 mobilehome parks
located within Santee, with 2,345 total spaces. These parks provide a unique living
environment and source of affordable housing. Sizes of the parks range from 66 to 364
                                                                   Santee General Plan

 spaces. Most of the 12 parks are located near the City's highly traveled roads including
 Mission Gorge Road, Magnolia Avenue and Prospect Avenue. The recent and planned future
 phases of State Route 52 through the City have, and will eliminate a number of mobilehomes
 located along the freeway alignment.

                                                         Magnolia Avenue. Since adoption of the
                                                         General Plan in 1984, approximately 1,400
                                                         condominiums and apartments have been
                                                         constructed in the City. As is the case with
                                                         mobilehome parks, the City lost several large

Commercial Land Use - A preliminary market analysis of existing and potential commercial,
office and industrial development in the City of Santee was undertaken as part of an update to
                                            the General Plan. The report, City of Santee
                                            General Plan Update Market Analysis, appears in
                                            its entirety in the Technical Appendices to the
                                            General Plan Environmental Impact Report.
                                            The study concluded that the City continues to
                                            export a significant amount of retail sales to other
                                            communities, particularly in the convenience
                                            goods, eating and drinking establishments and auto
                                            dealers and auto supply categories. The recent
completion of the Trolley Square commercial center at 425,000 square feet of space, is
expected to fulfill much of this need. The study also found that the City is a significant
importer of revenues in the home improvement and general merchandising categories.
Another of the study’s findings was that the development of the Fanita Ranch is critical to the
City’s financial future as it would generate an estimated $39 million dollars (2000 dollars) in
retail sales, with as estimated 30 million dollars staying in the City, and would provide a
significant stock of higher end housing which would be beneficial in the City’s efforts to
attract higher end firms and employers.
Office Land Use - Office development in Santee has not been significant historically,
however, interest in East County and Santee in particular has grown in recent years. Existing
office development in the City encompasses about 200,000 square feet, located at various
sites along Mission Gorge Road and Cuyamaca Street. With the City’s desire to focus future
office development in the Town Center and Fanita Ranch areas, existing office designated
properties were evaluated in the update process to determine if alternative land use
designations were appropriate.
The market analysis prepared for the General Plan Update concluded the Town Center was an
excellent location for the City’s future office and Research and Development type
development due to its excellent regional location, easy freeway access, good inventory of
available land, and availability of restaurants and other amenities in close proximity.
In August of 2000, the City Council adopted an Office Park Overlay, which covers an
approximately 110-acre area in the City’s Town Center, on the south side of the San Diego
River. The following year the City, in conjunction with the County of San Diego, a
developer was selected to develop this area in accordance with a master plan for a
comprehensive office-park development including office, residential and ancillary
commercial uses. In 2001, the San Diego Economic Development Commission released a
report that identified the City’s Fanita Ranch and Town Center areas as two of the best
locations for future office park development in San Diego County. The first phase of that
project occurred with the breaking of ground for the new Hartford Insurance building in the
summer of 2002.

                                                    development in Santee usually is in the
                                                    form of light industrial uses, characterized
                                                    by manufacturing and assembly, electronics,
                                                    research and development and light
                                                    warehousing uses. Industrial uses in the
                                                    City are concentrated in the south-central
                                                    along Prospect Avenue, Magnolia Avenue
                                                    and Cuyamaca Street, and north of
                                                    Woodside Avenue along the San Diego
                                                    River corridor. Since adoption of the City’s
                                                    General Plan in 1984, more than 1.25
 million square feet of industrial development has occurred, the majority of it in master-
 planned industrial parks along Prospect and Woodside Avenues.
 The market analysis prepared for the General Plan Update concluded that the inventory of
 entitled development sites for non-residential uses in the City is highly constrained, with
 virtually all of the City’s remaining inventory of industrial land being underutilized parcels
 which require assemblage with other parcels and higher preparation costs. These
 underutilized lands are typically industrially zoned properties that contain single-family
 homes. This development pattern is concentrated in the area north of Prospect Avenue in the
 Buena Vista / Cottonwood/ Railroad Avenue area. This area was recently added into the
 City’s Redevelopment project area. Together with the planned construction of the State Route
 52 freeway through this area, this will provide an incentive for redevelopment of this area
 with planned industrial uses.
                                                  Public/Semi-Public Land Uses - These uses
                                                  are composed of schools, public and private
                                                  parks, and churches. The City’s developed

 Vacant Land – Approximately 45% of the City of Santee is currently vacant. Parcels that
 comprise the primary vacant areas are undeveloped canyons and hillsides in the north (Fanita
 Ranch and the north Magnolia Avenue area), southeast (Rattlesnake Mountain) and steeply

sloped and rolling terrain in the southwest portions of the City. A significant amount of
vacant acreage is also found along the San Diego River corridor including the floodway, the
floodplain, a biological habitat preserve west of the Carlton Hills Blvd bridge and several
large, developable parcels in the Town Center owned by the County of San Diego.
The City’s Multiple Species Conservation Program Subarea plan identifies approximately
2,600 acres of the City which will be preserved in permanent open space to protect sensitive
plant and animal species and their habitats once the plan is adopted. This plan is discussed in
greater detail in the Conservation Element.
Santee Recreation, Open Space and Conservation System (SANTEE ROCS!) - The Santee
Recreation, Open Space and Conservation System (SANTEE ROCS!), is a plan which brings
together several independent but related efforts, to create a comprehensive, City-wide system
of open space, parks and trails. The goal of this ambitious plan is to create a balance between
the built environment – our homes, businesses, and streets, the community’s natural
environment and the need for recreational opportunities. While both the built and natural
environments are critical to the health of any community, a balancing of these goals is
necessary to create a truly sustainable community for future generations. This visionary plan
accomplishes the following goals:
x   preserving the biological resources in the City.
x   protecting and enhancing water quality.
x   Ensuring a significant portion of the City is protected as permanent open space.
x   Providing for active and passive recreational needs by creating a system of City parks and
    other varied recreational facilities and amenities.
x   Interconnecting the City through a system of paths and trails.
The primary components of the plan include:
¾ Multiple Species Conservation Program Subarea Plan – this system of open space and
    habitat will comprise almost one-fourth of the total area of the City when completed. The
    goal of this plan is to provide the City’s portion of a regional, interconnected open space
    preserve to protect endangered and sensitive plant and animal species and their habitats.
    This preserve system will also function as permanent open space for the community and
    will include public trails. This plan is discussed in detail in the Conservation Element.
¾ San Diego River Park Plan – This plan is the culmination of over 20 years of planning
    and implementation by the City. When completed, the park will stretch along both sides
    of the San Diego River across the entire length of the City, covering over 300 acres. The
    park is also a major component of the City’s Multiple Species Conservation Program
    Subarea Plan. This park involves multiple ownerships and is being implemented in
                                                                    Santee General Plan

                                                    jurisdictions. In addition to these paved
                                                    pathways, a system of community trails will
                                                    be established in the City for hiking, off-
     road bicycling and equestrians. These trails will wind through the City’s planned open
     space areas and will link not only with the community pathway system but also with other
     trail systems in Mission Trails Regional Park, Goodan Ranch and the Sycamore Canyon
     Open Space Preserve. The Trails Element includes a detailed discussion of the City’s
     planned pathway and trail systems.
 Taken as a whole, the SANTEE ROCS! will be one of the dominant factors in shaping the
 City’s future and our citizens quality of life. The plan balances economic development, open
 space and habitat preservation, and community recreation goals, leaving a legacy for our

5.0 Needs
5.1 Land Use Compatibility
Compatibility between adjacent land uses in the City is of primary importance to achieve a
safe, livable and functional community and to ensure a high quality of life. To minimize
conflicts, land uses must be located in a pattern that considers generic land use
characteristics, limitations and requirements such as; traffic and access, noise, public services,
siting and visual appearance, and public safety. Land uses that exist in a potentially
incompatible situation should be considered for relocation or remedial setback and/or
buffering treatments should be applied.
Enhancing compatibility between land uses can be achieved through locating uses together
that have similar or compatible public service and site planning needs. For example,
consolidation of scattered industrial uses into an industrial park development can take
advantage of common access, public services and site planning requirements. Mixed use
development, such as residential with commercial, can take advantage of differing peak hour
parking demands or availability of transit.
Figure 1-4, Adjacent Land Use Compatibility Guide, indicates the basic compatibility
between various land use types that could be located in Santee. This assessment should be
included as part of the information used to make land use determinations in the City.
In addition to ensuring compatibility with land uses within Santee, the City needs to remain
actively involved in reviewing land use changes that occur on the City’s borders and in
surrounding areas which may adversely affect residents and businesses in the City. Some of
these land use issues include:
Sycamore Canyon Landfill – A private waste management company currently operates the
Sycamore Canyon Landfill which is located in the City of San Diego, just west of the City.
There have been documented problems with odors emanating from the landfill, reported by
residents in the northwest areas of the City. While the landfill operators have taken steps to
address odor complaints, the City should remain active in tracking complaints of landfill
odors as operational changes or changes in the landfill footprint or waste pile elevation could
cause additional land use compatibility issues for Santee residents in the future.
Mining Operations - In recent years, there have been discussions with the owners of the
property located just to the north of the City regarding their intent to extend the existing
mining operation in Slaughterhouse Canyon south onto the properties bordering the planned
Fanita Ranch development. An active mining operation in this area could potentially be
incompatible with planned development in the Fanita Ranch.
                                                                  Santee General Plan

   LAND USE ELEMENT
 Off-Road Vehicle Parks – Over the years there have been several proposals by the State to
 locate an off-road vehicle park in the areas north or west of the City. These proposals could
 pose significant compatibility issues, such as noise or air quality, for existing as well as
 planned development.
 Regional Airport Proposals – There have been a number of possible sites that have been
 evaluated for a new airport for the San Diego Region. Depending on the location, a new
 regional airport could create significant land use compatibility issues for the City. One of the
 locations under consideration for a future airport is to the west of the City on the Marine
 Corps Air Station Miramar property. A new airport in this location could create significant
 compatibility issues for existing and planned development in the City.
                                             East Elliot Development – The East Elliot area of
                                             the City of San Diego borders Santee along the
                                             City’s western boundary. While the majority of this
                                             area is planned for preservation as part of the City
                                             of San Diego’s Multiple Species Conservation
                                             Program Subarea Plan, there are areas directly on
                                             the City’s western border that are designated for
                                             future residential development.
                                             While residential development itself would be
                                             compatible with the adjacent residential
 development in Santee, there could be impacts to the City from the additional traffic
 generated by any future development as well as fiscal impacts resulting from the City
 providing automatic aid public services such as fire, emergency transport and law
 enforcement service to this area.
 5.2   Public Services
 To ensure public safety and maintenance of the quality of life in Santee, future population
 growth and development should be consistent with existing and planned public services.
 Additionally, new development should not cause an economic burden on the City and should
 provide for a fair share of the public costs incurred by the development.
 5.3     Natural and Man-Induced Hazards
 In conjunction with the other Elements of the General Plan (especially Safety and
 Conservation) the Land Use Plan should culminate in a pattern of land uses that address the
 concerns of the health, safety and welfare of the public. The plan should minimize exposure
 of people and improved property to natural and man-made hazards and maintain minimal
 levels of risk where complete mitigation of hazards cannot be achieved.
 5.4     Regional Issues
Santee General Plan
Santee, California                        - 1-14 -

                                                             LAND USE ELEMENT
Many of the planning issues which Santee faces are regional in nature and are not
functionally related to political boundaries. Some of the major issue areas where regional
concerns are most evident are:
      x     Regional Governance and Land Use Control
      x     Biological Resource Preservation
      x     Hydrology and Water Quality
      x     Circulation
      x     Housing
      x     Economic Development
According to the government Code Section 65300 the City’s General Plan should consider
not only areas of the City itself, but also any area outside of it's incorporated boundaries that
"bears relation to its planning." The Planning Area must be strategically located and should
encompass territory beyond that which may ultimately be annexed by the City. The City has
established a Planning Area, depicted on Figure 1-5, to define this area.
Land intended for future annexation by the City must be included within a Sphere of
Influence as adopted by the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) as the "probable
ultimate physical boundaries and service area of a local governmental agency" (Government
Code Section 54774). The City’s current Sphere of Influence is coterminus with the City’s
boundary.
5.5     Areas for Special Study
Almost one-half the acreage in Santee today is undeveloped. As such, the City is presented
                                                   with major opportunities for the future
                                                   development or preservation of these areas.
                                                   The most significant of these undeveloped
                                                   areas are the Town Center along the San
                                                   Diego River, the Fanita Ranch and the North
                                                   Magnolia Area in the north, and Rattlesnake
                                                   Mountain in the southeast quadrant of the
                                                   City.
                                                   Town Center -The remaining undeveloped
                                                   portions of the Town Center, most of which is
                                                   in public ownership, represents a tremendous
                                                   opportunity area in the City’s central core.
The positioning along the San Diego River corridor, and proximity to planned freeways make
this area a significant economic resource for the City. Concerns here are maintaining the
integrity of the natural river system as a significant environmental resource supporting
sensitive habitats and vegetation, providing flood control and conveyance and maintaining
high-quality scenic resources.
                                                                    Santee General Plan
                                                                      Santee, California
                                          - 1-15 -

   LAND USE ELEMENT
 To address these concerns the City adopted the Town Center Specific Plan in October of
 1986 to guide the development of the Town Center area. The plan envisions a
 comprehensively planned, mixed use development of commercial, office, residential,
 recreational and open space uses over 706 acres in the center of the City. Since the plan was
 adopted, almost one million square feet of retail and office uses have been developed, along
 with over 400 residential units. In addition, the multiple-award winning Santee Multi-modal
 transit station has been completed along with over four miles of pedestrian paths providing
 alternative transportation modes linking land uses within the Town Center.
 A successful revegetation of a portion of the San Diego River has been completed and the
 area has been occupied by the Least Bell’s Vireo, an endangered riparian songbird.
 Construction is underway on the City’s 55-acre Town Center Community Park on the north
 side of the river and a Master Plan is underway for development of a 100-plus acre office
 park and mixed-use development on the south side of the river.
 In 2000, the City Council adopted an Office Park Overlay over approximately 110 acres in
 Town Center, south of the river. The intent of the overlay is to encourage the development of
 a high technology business campus that can take advantage of the proximity to freeways and
 the multi-modal transit station. The master plan for this area will also include a higher density
 residential component that will allow employees of the business park to live near work, one
 of the basic principles of Smart Growth.
 Fanita Ranch - The 2,589-acre Fanita Ranch exhibits varied topography, scenic resources,
 and significant vegetation and habitats. It is the largest single ownership area in the City and
 represents an area of tremendous development potential. Potential natural hazards related to
 slope stability and geologic resources also exist within this area.
                                                                 According to the market
                                                                 analysis prepared for the
                                                                 General Plan Update, the
                                                                 development of the Fanita
                                                                 Ranch will have a significant
                                                                 positive economic impact on
                                                                 the rest of the City, through the
                                                                 increased property taxes, and
                                                                 the sales taxes generated by
                                                                 increased     sales    at   local
                                                                 businesses. The Ranch also is
                                                                 the only remaining area in the
 City where significant numbers of move-up housing can be built. A good supply of move-up
 housing is not only needed to provide opportunities for existing residents, but is also a factor
 in attracting high technology and office users to the City’s planned office and technology
 parks.

                                                            LAND USE ELEMENT
Rattlesnake Mountain – The Rattlesnake Mountain is an approximately 400-acre hillside
area located in the southeast quadrant of the City. This area is under multiple ownership,
although significant portions are controlled by one primary landowner. This area is
characterized by steep topography, limited availability of public services such as road and
utilities, and is identified as a core biological resource area in the City (see Conservation
Element). This area is also included in the City’s draft Multiple Species Conservation
Program Subarea Plan.
While future development in the Town Center is guided by the Town Center Specific Plan,
the Fanita Ranch and the Rattlesnake Mountain areas need to be planned in a comprehensive
manner which addresses:
       x     Designation of appropriate land uses,
       x     Provision of adequate public facilities,
       x     Appropriate phasing of development,
       x     Requirements for financing public improvements,
       x     Environmental resource protection and enhancement, and
       x     Consistency with General Plan goals, policies and objectives
5.6      Economic Viability
Land use strategies must consider the overall economic viability and stability in the City.
Diversity of land use types, properly located and designed, can offer long term economic
stability for the City. Of particular concern in Santee is:
       x     Improvement of retail sales performance and local capture,
       x     Provision of a diverse and attractive housing stock,
       x     Increase in diversity and number of high quality employment opportunities,
       x     Enhancement of the San Diego River corridor to act as a focal point/attractor
The City of Santee General Plan Update Market Analysis report (see the General Plan
Environmental Impact Report Technical Appendices), prepared as part of the update process,
assessed existing conditions in the City and made determinations about future market support
and employment potential. A summary of those findings, which follows, is indicative of the
overall commercial, office and industrial land use needs in the City. The study concluded:
1.      Household incomes in the City are the highest in East County. The City also boasts a
very high rate of home ownership (71%).
2.     The City does not have a strong base of knowledge-based industries, however with the
completion of the planned SR52 freeway, regional accessibility will be dramatically
improved which will heighten the City’s ability to attract retail, office and industrial users.
The attraction of high tech firms is an attainable goal with aggressive marketing by the City.
                                                                  Santee General Plan
                                                                    Santee, California

   LAND USE ELEMENT
 3.    Regionally there is a shortage of development sites in the established office and
 industrial markets. The City’s Town Center represents is an excellent location for significant
                                              businesspark development for office and Research
                                              and Development firms due the excellent regional
                                              access via SR52 and the San Diego Trolley, a
                                              good inventory of available land of significant size
                                              and adjacent amenities such as restaurants and
                                              retail shops.
                                              4.     The City is a exporting a significant share of
                                                     retail sales to stores outside the City.
                                                     Specific areas of weakness are auto sales and
       supplies, convenience goods and eating and drinking establishments. The City is a net
       importer of sales in the general merchandising and home improvement categories.
 5.    Significant improvement in sales and local capture can result with the completion of the
       SR52 freeway.
 6.    With the completion of currently approved projects such as the Trolley Square, the City
       can support approximately 25 acres of additional retail development and a significant
       level of office/industrial development through the year 2015.
 7.    The development of the Fanita Ranch is critical to the City’s economic future by
       providing an estimated $30 million dollars in local retail sales, as well as providing the
       high-end housing stock needed to attract high-end office and R and D firms to the City.
      6.0 Goal
      Promote development of a well-balanced and functional mix of residential,
      commercial, industrial, open space, recreation, and civic uses that will create and
      maintain a high quality environment.

   Objective 7.0       Undertake development of           large,   contiguous,    vacant    or
underutilized parcels in a comprehensive manner.
Policy 7.1 The City shall utilize and initiate, in appropriate locations, the use of
comprehensive planning process for development of large landholdings. Appropriate
locations shall include large contiguous vacant or underutilized parcels (i.e., 10 acres or
larger in area) under single ownership that contain unique resources such as a hillside or
watercourse, where a combination of uses are proposed on the site or where phased
implementation of the development is necessary to minimize the impact on the City. If a
comprehensive planning process involves multiple ownerships, the plan should apply to the
total area of these ownerships.
For smaller contiguous vacant or underutilized parcels (i.e., less than 10 acres in area), a
comprehensive planning process should be considered to allow for the comprehensive
development of the land.
Policy 7.2 A comprehensive development plan shall be prepared prior to approving any
subdivision of land or land development proposal unless the Director of Development
Services makes a determination that the subdivision would not have a significant affect on the
ultimate development of the property.

8.0     Implementation
8.1     Land Use Classifications
The following section describes the intent of each of the land use categories found on the
Land Use Plan. The purpose is to describe the nature and general character of land uses
intended within each category. The symbols and numbers associated with each of the land
use classifications correspond to those uses on the Land Use Plan map (Figure 1-1).
Residential Density Ranges - Each of the residential use classifications indicate an allowable
range of development density. The maximum density indicated by the range defines the
maximum number of units per gross acre that residential development can achieve within a
given area. A residential development proposal does not have to provide the minimum
number of units per gross acre indicated by a residential density range to be found consistent
with the General Plan. The minimum density figure established for each range is intended to
                                                                 Santee General Plan
                                                                    Santee, California

   LAND USE ELEMENT
 encourage the location of certain product types and densities which are consistent with
 adjacent land uses, access, public services and environmental concerns.
 The residential density ranges are intended as expressions of the extreme limits of gross
 densities which are reasonable and desirable for areas within the City. For each residential
 density range indicated, with the exception of Hillside/Limited, the lowest number of the
 range on any given project, could typically be expected to be approved. This low-end density
 should be used by development proponents for purposes of determining land values and
 anticipating a realistic future density. In the Hillside Overlay District, the density
 determination would be tied to the average natural slope of the site. Approval of a density
 higher than the minimum of the range is a discretionary action and is a function of a
 combination of criteria including that listed below:
   x     Compliance with specific goals, objectives and policies of the General Plan which
         provide for avoidance of hazards while maximizing public safety and achievement of
         high quality site planning and design.
   x     No adverse impact on existing public facilities such as roadways, emergency services,
         schools and sewers.
   x     Consideration of on-site environmental constraints such as proximity to the
         floodplain, steep slopes, slope instability, significant landforms and significant
         vegetation and or sensitive species.
   x     Compliance with adopted City programs and policies including the City’s Multiple
         Species Conservation Program Subarea Plan and Implementing Agreement.
   x     Provision of on-site amenities that will contribute to the livability of the project and
         enhance the community character.
   x     Analysis of the opportunities and constraints presented by natural and socio-cultural
         features.
   x     Application of policies and implementation measures in the General Plan which
         provide for avoidance of hazards, maximizing public safety and achievement of high
         quality site planning and design.
   x     Application of appropriate provisions of the City’s Zoning Ordinance and / or
         applicable Specific or Master Development Plan.
 Project approval at any density is subject to obtaining all requested agency approvals.
 Mixed Use Development - Under certain land use designations on the Land Use Plan, a mix
 of land uses is contemplated to encourage innovative and attractive development in the City

and to promote Smart Growth concepts and principles. This concept has been set forth
specifically to integrate complementary land uses which can take advantage of mutual site
planning and public service requirements, and demonstrate increased economic viability of
the overall development proposal. Discretionary review is required for all mixed-use
development proposals.
HL – Hillside Limted Residential (0-1 dwelling units/gross acre)
This designation is intended for residential development in areas that exhibit steep slopes,
rugged topography and limited access. Residential uses are characterized by rural large estate
lots, with significant permanent open space area, consistent with the constraints of slope
gradient, soil and geotechnical hazards, access, availability of public services, biological
resources and other environmental concerns. This designation has primarily been applied in
the steeply sloped extreme southwest and northeast portions of the City.
R1 – Low Density Residential (1-2 dwelling units/gross acre)
This designation is intended for residential development characterized by single family
homes on one-half acre lots of larger, which are responsive to the natural terrain and
minimize grading requirements. This designation has been located in steeply sloped hillside
and canyon areas in the southwest, southeast, northeast and north central portions of the City.
R1A – Low Density Residential (2-4 units/gross acre)
This designation is intended for residential development characterized by single family
homes on average 10,000 square foot lots or larger, which are responsive to the natural terrain
and minimize grading requirements. This designation is intended to provide a transitional
designation between areas of denser development in the R-2 designation and lower density,
larger lot size development in the R-1 and HL land use designations.
R2 – Low-Medium Density Residential (2-5 dwelling units/gross acre)
This designation is intended for residential development characterized by single family
homes in standard subdivision form (6,000 sq. ft. lots). It covers the largest portion of the
City planned for residential uses and is usually found in areas of generally level topography.
It is intended to include mobile home parks in the City that may exhibit a slightly higher
gross density.
R7 – Medium Density Residential (7-14 dwelling units/gross acre)
This designation is intended for a wide range of residential development types including
attached and detached single family units at the lower end of the density range and multiple
family attached units at the higher end of the density range. Areas developed under this
designation should exhibit adequate access to streets of at least collector capacity and be
conveniently serviced by neighborhood commercial and recreational facilities. This

 Avenue and Fanita Drive.
 R14 – Medium-High Density Residential (14-22 dwelling units/gross acre)
 This designation is intended for residential development characterized at the lower end of the
 density range by multiple family attached units and at the upper end of the density range by
 apartment and condominium buildings. It is intended that this category utilize innovative site
 planning, provide on-site recreational amenities and be located in close proximity to major
 community facilities, business centers and streets of at least major capacity. This designation
 has been located along Mission Gorge Road, Magnolia Avenue, Mesa Road and Woodside
 Avenue.
 R22 – High Density Residential (22-30 dwelling units/gross acre)
 This designation is intended for residential development characterized by apartment and
 condominium buildings. It is intended that this category utilize innovative site planning and
 building design (including 3 story buildings) and incorporate on-site recreational amenities
 and open space. This designation has been applied in areas in close proximity to major
 community facilities and services, transit facilities and major streets.
 RB – Residential Business
 This designation is intended to allow for a mix of single and multiple family residential
 development, at densities up to 14 units per acre, and low intensity office uses. It is intended
 to encourage a mix of appropriate land uses within transitional neighborhoods that are
 adjacent to more intensive commercial, office and industrial areas. Low intensity commercial
 and office uses would be allowed which would not result in significant land use
 compatibility impacts.
 NC – Neighborhood Commercial
 This designation includes neighborhood shopping centers and small convenience centers
 which provide for a range of necessary day-to-day retail goods and services required by
 residents in the immediate vicinity. It encourages concentrated and consolidated shopping
 opportunities including, but not limited to, personal services, food and convenience stores,
 eating and drinking establishments, gas stations, banks and other neighborhood serving uses.
 Office and Professional services are intended under this category as uses that are secondary to
 the other neighborhood serving commercial uses. This category has been distributed
 throughout the City along major travel routes to provide adequate neighborhood shopping
 opportunities.

This designation provides for commercial areas with a wide range of retail and service
activities. Intended uses include community shopping center, department stores, restaurants,
financial institutions, automotive uses and other specialized services. This designation
encourages the grouping of commercial outlets into consolidated centers. Appropriate areas
to be established with general commercial activities should have direct access to major roads,
prime arterials or freeways.
GC/IL - General Commercial Overlay
The General Commercial Overlay is intended to allow opportunities for development of
general commercial uses in combination with light industrial uses and activities. This overlay
designation is applied in those areas which, due to their proximity to planned freeways or
major transportation corridors, have the potential to accommodate retail or service uses in
addition to standard industrial uses. Development proposed under this designation is required
to undergo site plan review as required by the Municipal Code.
OP – Office Professional
This designation is provided in close relationship to general commercial facilities. It is
intended for the encouragement of high technology, medical, dental, law or other professional
offices, which are located and designed as consolidated complexes. Commercial uses
contemplated as part of this category include business support services and support restaurant
and medical services.
IL – Light Industrial
This designation establishes light industrial areas where uses such as fabricating, assembly,
research and development, electronics, low intensity warehousing and other such similar
industrial uses are appropriate. All work and related activity, including materials and
equipment storage, is intended to be conducted specifically within enclosed facilities to
reduce adverse impacts on adjacent uses.
This land use is appropriate as a buffer between the general industrial areas and non-
industrial uses and where the site is visible from residential areas or major transportation
routes. Special landscaping, enclosures and other site development standards are appropriate.
Outdoor storage may be allowed in specific circumstances where, through the discretionary
review process, it is demonstrated that adequate screening and buffering of the outdoor
storage area can be achieved to eliminate any adverse impacts on adjacent uses and maintain
visual qualities of the area.
Industrial park development is intended on larger parcels to create distinct districts containing
light industrial, compatible offices and support uses. Such areas should have adequate off-
site access to major transportation facilities, as well as an efficient internal circulation system
of industrial streets.

8.2     Areas for Special Study
The following development guidelines for the Fanita Ranch Rattlesnake Mountain and
Carlton Oaks Planned Development (PD) designations on the Land Use Plan provide a
framework to assure that these unique and significant areas will be developed and preserved
with:
1.    Standards of quality for community appearance and function;
2. Compatibility of development of land and structures that ensures public health, safety
and welfare; and
3.    Policies that minimize grading, preserve significant biological resources, preserve
ridgelines and view corridors, and provide for recreational amenities.
Fanita Ranch - The Fanita Ranch planned development will be developed in a manner
consistent with the Guiding Principles described below:
1. The Planned Development may include a comprehensively planned, high architectural
    quality business or office park. The business or office park shall include such uses as
    research and development, high technology uses, medical complex, executive
    headquarters or other similar office or business uses.
2. The Planned Development shall include a community focus (Fanita Center) which
    includes provisions for public parks, commercial development and institutional uses such
    as schools, fire station, branch library or branch post office.
3. The plan shall contain a mix of house sizes on lot sizes distributed as follows:
          6,000 sq. ft. lots – 20 percent of total lots
                                                                    Santee General Plan

2. The property should be focused on a high-quality resort and recreation-related uses. Any
    residential uses should be accessory, and related to the primary recreation use.
3. Ancillary uses, such as restaurants, retail uses, or hotels shall be allowed by Conditional
    Use Permit if such uses are determined to be ancillary to the existing or planned resort
    and recreation facilities.
4. Use of the site should orient to, and be compatible with the San Diego River.
5. Development should respect the river environment, including protection of the riparian
    habitat and protected species.

 6. Development should protect natural drainage, and ensure protection of water quality.
 7. A multipurpose, public trail shall be provided on the property on the north side of the San
     Diego River, linking with existing and planned trails to the east and west of the site.
 8.3     Resource Protection, Public Safety and Community Design Overlays
 As part of the General Plan Process, mapped information has been developed which will be
 used as overlays to the Land Use Plan. The purpose of the overlays is to ensure that natural
 and man-made features, hazards and conditions found within Santee are adequately
 incorporated into the land use planning process. Overlays can restrict or condition land uses
 proposed by the Land Use Plan in certain areas as defined on the overlay maps. They shall be
 used by the City in conjunction with the Land Use Plan to determine consistency with the
 General Plan for all development proposals.
 The following maps, identified by Element, shall constitute those maps considered part of
 the mapped overlay system that place geographically defined restrictions or conditions on the
 Land Use Plan.
 1.    Safety Element - Geotechnical / Seismic Hazards Map. This overlay defines the areas
       where geologic and seismic-related hazards are located in the City. Based on that
       analysis, the map also identifies and defines the specific on-site studies required for
       consideration of approval for any development proposal.
 The Public Safety map and Dam Inundation Area map. The Public Safety map overlay
 defines the 100-year floodplain boundary which is regulated by certain performance criteria
 for development established by the flood hazard policies of the Element. The Dam
 Inundation Map locates areas which would be inundated in the event of an upstream dam
 failure. Policies and implementation measures contained in the Element establish
 requirements for development review procedures in these hazard areas.
 2.    Conservation Element – Cultural Resources, and Biology maps. These overlays
       define the cultural and biotic resources of significance in the City. In concert with the
       objectives and policies contained in the Element and once adopted, the City’s Multiple
       Species Conservation Program Subarea Plan and Implementing Agreement, the maps
       establish levels of consideration necessary for protection and preservation of these
       resources during the development review process.
 3.    Noise Element – The Future Noise Levels map identifies those areas in the City that
       will be subject to noise levels in excess of the City’s standard at build-out. Policies and
       objectives in the Element require the preparation of an acoustical analysis for any noise-
       sensitive development proposed within these areas to identify and mitigate and noise
       related impacts.

4.     Community Enhancement Element - Design Sensitive Areas map. This overlay
categorizes design sensitive areas within the City and locates them geographically. Design
guidelines which address the character and form of development are established as Policies
and Implementation measures for each type of design sensitive area.
In summary, the overlay system, in conjunction with the Land Use Plan, establishes the
framework for achieving land use goals and objectives in the City. This process also
provides the City with an information base to assist in:
   1. Evaluating development proposals and conducting environmental analysis on a site
       specific basis, and
2.    Determining appropriate zoning categories to implement the General Plan.
8.4 Implementation Procedures
Zoning Ordinance - Zoning regulations are the primary means for translating the General
Plan into parcel specific allowable uses and development standards. Zoning maps and
regulatory provision must be consistent with the land uses, objectives, policies and
implementation measures of the General Plan.
Subdivision Regulations - Consistent with provision of the State Subdivision Map Act, the
City of Santee Subdivision Ordinance provide standards for design and improvement of
subdivided land within the City. Measures "as may be necessary or convenient to ensure
conformity to or implementation of the General Plan" can be included under subdivision
regulations. The City should review and update its subdivision regulations as necessary to
achieve such ends especially with respect to public improvements, natural hazards avoidance
and design criteria.
Multiple Species Conservation Program Subarea Plan – Once adopted, the Santee Subarea
Plan of the Multiple Species Conservation Program will comprehensively address how the
City of Santee will conserve natural biotic communities and sensitive plant and wildlife
species in the City. The Plan will address the potential impacts to natural habitats and rare,
threatened, or endangered species due to public and private projects within the City of Santee.
The plan will institute a strategy to proactively mitigate these impacts on the City’s biological
resources, and will contribute to the recovery of identified species by ensuring coordinated
conservation of key biological areas, and by establishing proactive habitat management
actions for conserved lands.
Other Municipal Code Provisions – The Municipal Code contains several Ordinances that
directly affect land use and development. These include the Flood Damage Prevention
Ordinance, the Grading Ordinance and the Noise Abatement and Control Ordinance. The
Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance prohibits development in floodways and regulates
development in the 100-year floodplain to reduce flood-related damage and losses. The
Grading Ordinance regulates grading in the City, and includes special requirements for
                                                                  Santee General Plan
                                                                    Santee, California
                                          - 1-35 -

   LAND USE ELEMENT
 grading in hillside areas which are intended to minimize the extent of, and reduce the visual
 impacts resulting from grading operations. The Noise Abatement and Control Ordinance
 regulates stationary noise sources in the City and regulates the acceptable levels of noise from
 various activities with reduced noise levels for sensitive land uses, such as residential.
 Redevelopment - The City of Santee City Council acts as the Community Development
 Commission (Redevelopment Agency) for the City pursuant to California Community
 Redevelopment Law (Health and Safety Code, Division 24, Part 1). It has adopted a
 Redevelopment Plan which establishes procedures for administrative, acquisition,
 improvement and funding activities within a defined redevelopment project area. The
 purpose of the plan is to revitalize blighted areas and to improve development potential of
                               areas within the City consistent with the General Plan. The
                               principle financing mechanism for redevelopment is tax
                               increment financing.
                               The City has, and should continue to, periodically review the
                               existing Redevelopment Plan and update the regulations,
                               procedures and make boundary revisions as needed to assist in
                               the implementation of the General Plan.
                               Capital Improvement Programs - The City of Santee has a five-
                               year Capital Improvement Program which lists the
                               recommendations for study or construction of public works
                               projects on an annual basis. The Government Code Section
                               65401 requires Planning Commission (City Council) to review
                               the City’s Capital Improvement Program each year for
                               conformity to the General Plan.
 Environmental Impact Reports/Procedures - The California Environmental Quality Act
 (CEQA) requires preparation of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for projects which
 may have significant impacts. Section 15063(d) of the EIR Guidelines requires that the
 Initial Study of a project consider whether it is compatible with the General Plan.
 Additionally, an EIR must discuss any inconsistencies between the proposed project and the
 General Plan. The City has adopted Local Implementing Procedures for implementing the
 California Environmental Quality Act.
 Construction and Building Codes - Construction and building codes set forth minimum
 standards and specifications for structural soundness, safety, occupancy factors and
 conditions of both new and existing developments. Codes used by the City and other
 municipal agencies to implement the General Plan's goals, policies and objectives include the
 Uniform Building Code, Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Plumbing Code, Uniform
 Electrical Code and the Uniform Fire Code.
 Development Review Procedures - The Development Review process is used by the City to
 review development proposals for commercial, industrial and residential developments. It

                                                           LAND USE ELEMENT
allows the City to review proposals in terms of land use compatibility, landscaping and
building and site design features. The objectives, policies and guidelines established by the
General Plan provide the framework for review. All development proposals must be found to
be consistent with the General Plan as part of the provisions of the Development Review
process.
Master Planning – For large landholdings or unique properties, the use of a master planning
process is often desirable. The process is particularly applicable to larger undeveloped areas,
areas under transition, and areas designated for redevelopment which exhibit complex natural
and man-made features.
The following criteria shall be used by the Director of Development Services in the
determination that a master development plan or other comprehensive development plan, as
may be determined to be appropriate, shall be prepared:
1.    A phased development plan is desirable; or
2.    The site contains unique features such as a hillside or watercourse which require special
planning considerations; or
3. An implementation plan which identifies the cost of public or private improvements,
and the method of financing said improvements over a specified time period is necessary to
reduce the impact of the development on the existing facilities; or
4.    A variety of uses are proposed such as commercial, recreational, and residential, and
their comprehensive planning is necessary to mitigate conflicts.
                                                    Prezoning - The City may, if it chooses,
                                                    prezone property adjoining the City which
                                                    is outside City boundaries. Prezoning,

 Review and Update - The General Plan is dynamic in that it is based on currently available
 information, and existing community goals, objectives and needs, which are constantly
 changing. Government Code Section 65400(b) requires an annual report to be provided to the
 City Council, the Office of Planning and Research, and the Department of Housing and
 Community Development "on the status of the (general) plan and progress in its
 implementation, including progress in meeting its share of regional housing needs.."
 Government Code Section 65588 requires that the Housing Element be reviewed and updated
 at least every five years.
 Generally, amendments to any individual element of the General Plan are limited to four
 times in one year, with specific exceptions provided for by the Government Code.
 Funding – The following are some of the primary funding sources used to implement the
 City’s General Plan:
 a.       Local Funding - Taxes, exactions, fees, assessments and debt financing are five major
 sources for local funds. Taxes include property, retail sales, use, occupancy, business license,
 etc., and are used to fund general purpose programs. Also included is property tax increment,
 which is used to fund redevelopment activities, including the elimination of blight, as well as
 to provide for low and moderate income housing. Exactions relate to the dedication of land,
 improvements or in-lieu payments imposed on new development as part of subdivision
 requirements. Fees are levied to finance a particular facility, improvements, or services
 which confer "direct and identifiable" benefit to those paying fees. Special assessments are
 used to fund specific improvement projects, (flood control, street and sidewalk
 improvements, etc.), and are also paid for by those benefiting from the improvements. Debt
 financing can be used to raise capital needed for major public improvements and the
 maintenance thereof. Debt financing can include General Obligation Bonds, Mello-Roos
 Bonds, Redevelopment Bonds and 1911/1915 Act Bonds, and - depending on what is being
 financed - can be enabled through general referendum or district balloting.
 b.       State Funding - There are a variety of grant and loan programs available to local
          governments which fall under the following broad headings: housing, energy,
          parks/open space, recreation, solid waste management and historic preservation. Most
          of these programs are enabled by voter-approved bond acts, while others are
          implemented through the legislative and budgetary approval process.
 c.       Federal Funding - The Federal Government also provides a wide variety of funding
          programs. The most utilized has been Community Development Block Grant
          program funds that are used for housing, public facilities improvements, and urban
          renewal. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the
          Economic Development Administration have other grant and loan programs available
          for specific purposes.
 Population Projections - Implementation of the General Plan forms the basis for anticipated
 population growth in the City. While each residential designation in the City allows a range

of dwelling unit densities, the actual number of dwelling units constructed and associated
population amounts would realistically fall near the middle of the density range due natural
constraints including: presence of biological resources, soil and geologic conditions,
floodplain and slope gradients. Access, availability of services and desired product types
would also influence the ultimate number of dwelling units constructed and the population.
Based on examination of the land use allocations on the Land Use Plan and Census 2000
population projections, the following population estimates are provided for overall planning
purposes. These projects assume future residential projects develop at the mid-range of the
density scale.

 7. NOISE ELEMENT
The purpose of the Noise Element is to
provide information for programs to control
and abate environmental noise, and to protect
the citizens of Santee from excessive
exposure to noise. This information then can
be used in the planning and environmental
review processes to guide the location, type,
density and design of future development
within the City, with particular consideration
to noise.
1.0      Statutory Requirements
Section 65302 of the California Planning and Zoning Laws requires each General Plan in the
State to contain a Noise Element. The purpose of the Noise Element is to identify and appraise
noise problems in the community. The Noise Element analyzes and quantifies to the extent
possible, existing and project noise levels for freeways, primary arterial and major local roads,
transit, aircraft and airports, as well as stationary noise sources such as industrial plants or
outdoor manufacturing uses. Implementation measures and possible solutions to address
identified noise problems must be identified as well.
The Noise Element is designed to develop policies which may reduce the loss of property values,
social cohesion, psychological stability and physical health, which are often the results of
excessive amounts of noise.
2.0      Accomplishments Since Adoption of the General Plan
Since the adoption of the City’s first General Plan in August of 1984, the City has fulfilled many
of the goals, and implemented the policies found in the Noise Element. Major accomplishments
include:
    i The City adopted a Development Review process in 1984 to review applications for
         development. Through this process, and the City’s environmental review procedures, the
         City has applied the noise thresholds found in the Noise Element to all new development.
    i The City has applied the Noise Element policies to all public projects constructed by the
         City, including the extension of Mast Blvd, the widening of Magnolia Avenue,
         construction of three new City parks, and the planned extension of Olive Lane.
                                                                   Santee General Plan
                                                                     Santee, California

NOISE ELEMENT
   i In July of 1985, the City adopted a new Zoning Ordinance that includes larger setbacks
      for both single family and multiple family homes along collector and major roads to
      reduce noise impacts to new development.
   i The City has worked closely with the California Department of Transportation
      (CalTrans) to ensure that noise impacts from the construction of State Routes 52 and 125
      are addressed in the design of the freeway in a way that both reduces noise, and
      encourages the use of berms or other noise control measures to avoid the visual impacts
      often associated with large, continuous noise walls.
   i With the completion of the State Route 52 freeway to the western City boundary, the City
      undertook an extensive review of noise issues along Mast Boulevard and implemented
      additional noise attenuation measures to reduce noise impacts resulting from the phased
      completion of the freeway and the extension of Mast Boulevard.
   i Since adoption of the General Plan, no new residential development has been approved
      which fronts on a collector or major classification roadway.
   i Through the Santee Sheriffs Department, the City has enforced motor vehicle laws and
      set appropriate speed limits throughout the City, which has helped in reducing noise
      along busy roadways.
   i The City has coordinated review of development applications within the Airport
      Influence Area for Gillespie Field with the San Diego Association of Governments,
      acting as the Airport Land Use Commission, to identify and address noise impacts from
      aircraft operations.
   i Through the Code Compliance Division and the Santee Sheriffs Department, the City
      enforces the Noise Abatement ordinance of the Santee Municipal Code, addressing noise
      complaints relating to construction activities, commercial and industrial noise, and other
      stationary noise sources.
   i Through the Building Division of the Department of Development Services, the City
      enforces the interior noise standards of the Uniform Building Code.
   i The City has worked with both Gillespie Field and Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS)
      Miramar to reduce excessive noise impacts to City residents from aircraft overflights.
   i In 1999-2001, the City was actively engaged in discussions with the Marines to ensure
      that their flight operations out of MCAS Miramar, particularly the Yuma helicopter route,
      did not generate substantial noise impacts to Santee residents.

                                                                    NOISE ELEMENT
3.0     Introduction
The City of Santee can still be characterized as generally quiet, although certainly subject to
typical suburban noise patterns. The primary sources of noise in the City are traffic along
freeway corridors and major roadways, and aircraft and helicopter overflights from both
Gillespie Field and Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. However, as the City and surrounding
areas continue to develop, and planned roads and freeways are completed, potential noise
conflicts will increase. Thus, the City has developed a Noise Element to identify existing and
future noise sources and ways to address their impacts.
Noise is an everyday occurrence. People’s tolerance for noise depends on where they are and
what they are doing. In a typical noisy daytime urban area, such as Mission Gorge Road or
freeway corridors, noise levels can approach 80 decibels (unit of measure for noise, commonly
abbreviated as dB) for short periods of time. In a quiet residential neighborhood, the daytime
noise levels typically average around 50 dB. In general, people are more tolerant of noise in
busier commercial and industrial areas because there is an expectation that these areas will be
noisier. In residential areas, people do not expect high noise levels and therefore have a lower
tolerance.
Increases and decreases in noise need to be viewed in proper perspective. A one-decibel change
in the community noise level can’t be perceived by the average human ear. A two to three
decibel change can be discerned, while a five-decibel change is generally quite noticeable. A ten-
decibel change will double the perceived level of noise. A good illustration of how noise level
changes work is traffic noise. A doubling of the traffic volume on any street or freeway will
only increase the noise level by three decibels. A 50% reduction in traffic volumes works the
same way in that it will only result in reducing the noise levels by three decibels.
It should also be noted that noise level standards are generally based on one-hour (generally for
stationary sources only), or 24-hour averages. This means that noise levels will fluctuate during
the measurement period and can, and often do exceed the applicable noise standard during peak
periods as long as over the averaging period, the standard is met.
The City uses the Day-Night Average Sound Level (abbreviated as Ldn) to measure noise in the
City. This is a measure of the overall noise experienced during an entire day. The time-weighted
refers to the fact that noise that occurs during certain sensitive time periods is penalized for
occurring at these times. In the Ldn scale, those noise levels that occur during the night (10 p.m.
to 7 a.m.) are penalized by 10 dB to reflect the fact that noise at these times is perceived as being
louder. This penalty was selected to attempt to account for increased human sensitivity to noise
during the quieter period of a day, where home and sleep is the most probable activity.
Another frequently used measure of noise is the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL).
This measurement is similar to the Ldn, except that noise levels between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. are
also increased by 5dB, in addition to the 10dB nighttime weighting. CNEL is used mainly to
describe the noise around airports. The values of Ldn and CNEL are normally within one dB of
each other. The Gillespie Field CLUP uses the CNEL measurement. When analyzing airport
                                                                     Santee General Plan
                                                                       Santee, California

NOISE ELEMENT
operations within the City of Santee, therefore, CNEL values will need to be translated into Ldn
measurements for consistency.
Relationship to Other Elements - The distribution of noise throughout the City is directly
related to the distribution of land uses and the circulation network; therefore, the Noise Element
is most closely correlated with the Land Use and Circulation Elements. The noise environment
affects the distribution of land uses in the City and is one factor in the siting of more noise-
sensitive land uses such as single family homes, schools, hospitals and libraries. Since the
primary noise generators in the City are vehicle traffic and aircraft, the Noise Element is closely
related to the Circulation Element which identifies the circulation network in the City, including
streets, freeways and aircraft flight paths.
As required by State Law, the Noise Element is consistent with the other elements in the General
Plan.
4.0      Existing Conditions
4.1      Noise Sources
The City is subjected to variable levels of noise in terms of intensity and duration. The major
sources of noise include traffic, aircraft from Gillespie Field and Marine Corps Air Station
(MCAS) Miramar, commercial/industrial noise, and community activities. For the purpose of
this discussion, noise levels refer to the combination of the ambient (background) noise and local
noise sources.
The effect noise has on society is, to a large degree, dependent upon the nature of an activity or
land use. Generally speaking, residential, education and medical uses are more sensitive to noise
than are commercial and industrial activities which may, in fact, be noise generators. Noise
sensitive uses are defined in this element as those facilities "including, but not limited to, areas
containing residences, schools, hospitals, rest homes, long-term medical or mental care facilities,
or any other land use areas deemed noise sensitive by the local jurisdiction." They include, but
are not limited to, the City’s residential areas, Santana and West Hills High Schools, nine
elementary schools, Edgemoor Geriatric Hospital, the Stanford Court Nursing Center, and the
City’s branch library. The City has established a noise standard of 65dB(A) (Ldn) for noise
sensitive uses. This element includes policies that are intended to reduce noise impacts to these
sensitive land uses.
In order to quantify the existing noise levels and establish a new frame of reference, an
acoustical study was conducted for the General Plan in 2002. Field measurements were taken
and modeling carried out to define noise levels. This information was then converted into noise
contours to graphically illustrate existing noise conditions. Noise was measured in decibels on
an "A" weighted scale, dB(A), to most closely represent the response of the human ear. A 24-
hour average (Ldn) which places a weighting factor (penalty) on noise levels between 10 p.m.
and 7 a.m. was used to calculate the existing and projected future noise levels. These terms and
others are defined further in the Glossary of this document.

                                                                   NOISE ELEMENT
Traffic Noise - Traffic continues to represent the most significant source of noise in the City. All
the freeway corridors and major roads in Santee currently carry traffic volumes which raise noise
levels on adjacent property to 65 dB(A) and higher (see Figure 7-1). By the year 2020, noise
levels along most of these major transportation routes are expected to increase. The projected
noise contours for 2020 are shown on Figure 7-2. It should be noted that the noise levels shown
on the figures are a worst-case depiction and does not take into effect any noise attenuation
measures such as walls or berms which may exist, or changes in topography or the effect of
intervening structures which act to reduce noise.
                                                       The construction of State Route (SR) 52
                                                       and the planned construction of State Route
                                                       125 will heavily influence future noise
                                                       conditions in Santee. The first two phases
                                                       of SR52 through the City have been
                                                       completed, with two phases remaining. In
                                                       addition to being a noise source itself, the
                                                       phased construction of the freeway causes
                                                       shifts in traffic patterns and volumes on
                                                       City streets, which will cause changes in the
                                                       noise levels along these roads as the project
                                                       is constructed. This redistribution of traffic
was graphically demonstrated when the first phase of SR52 was completed to Mast Blvd. Traffic
on Mast Blvd increased dramatically almost overnight, resulting in widespread noise complaints
from residents bordering Mast Blvd. At the same time, traffic along certain portions of Carlton
Oaks Drive and Mission Gorge Road dropped, which improved the noise environment along
those streets.
In general, while traffic volumes on portions of the City’s major east-west streets such as Mast
Blvd., Mission Gorge Road and Prospect Avenue will lessen once the freeway is completed to
SR67, they will continue to be above 65dB(A) Ldn. Noise levels along the freeway corridors will
also increase as traffic volumes on the freeway increase and the freeway is built out to it’s
ultimate six lane configuration.
The State has plans to extend SR125 north from its present terminus to connect with SR15 north
of Poway. While the currently studied alignment does not run through the City itself, this
extension has the potential to generate noise impacts to existing and planned residential
                                        development in the City. These impacts would require
                                        mitigation depending on the ultimate design and location
                                        of this future route.
                                        Rapid Transit - The East County extension to the San
                                        Diego Trolley terminates in the Town Center area at the
                                        northwest corner of Mission Gorge Road and Cuyamaca
                                        Street and is not a significant noise generator due to its
                                        intermittent operation and it’s alignment which passes
                                                                    Santee General Plan

NOISE ELEMENT
through a primarily commercial corridor on Cuyamaca Street.
Aircraft Noise - Aircraft are the other major source of noise in Santee. The principal source of
aircraft noise in the City is aircraft operating out of Gillespie Field. Annual operations from
Gillespie Field totaled approximately 175,392 in 2001, with most of the aircraft taking off
towards the west and then turning north or south.
In 1987, SANDAG, acting as the Airport
Land Use Commission for the San Diego
Region, updated the 1974 Comprehensive
Land Use Plan (CLUP) for Gillespie Field.
The plan identifies an “Airport Influence
Area” around the airport, which is the area
that could be impacted by noise levels
exceeding 60dB CNEL or where height
restrictions could be needed to protect
navigable airspace. The plan projects
aircraft operations at the airport will
increase to 280,000 per year in 2010. While
aircraft operations peaked at 340,000 in 1979, there has been a steady decline in operations over
the last 20 years. There has been an increase in recent years in the mix of aircraft with an
increase in the percentage of jet operations projected by the CLUP. While the plan recommends
the County reevaluate any change in the mix of aircraft to determine if there are changes that
could affect projected noise contours, no reevaluation of the contours has been done to date.
The projected noise contours from the CLUP are shown on Figures 7-1 and 7-2. Some residential
uses in the Atlas View Drive / Pryor Drive neighborhood are within the 65dB Ldn noise contours
and are considered incompatible uses by the plan. The CLUP recommends the City redesignate
these areas to industrial to correct this incompatibility. The City has overridden the CLUP
recommendations with a 2/3’s majority of the Council, making findings that the proposed action
is consistent with the CLUP.
Marine Corps Air Station Miramar – In 1998/1999, a
base realignment was undertaken by the military that
resulted in the Marines replacing the Navy at the
Miramar air base. This change actually reduced the
overall noise impacts to the City at buildout, but
increased nuisance noise impacts. Prior to the
realignment, noise from naval jet operations resulted
in noise levels exceeding 60dB CNEL in the far
northern area of the City, which remains
undeveloped. However, with the base realignment
none of the City is projected to be impacted by noise
levels in excess of 65dB CNEL.

The Marines use helicopters to a greater degree than the Navy and the flight path from Miramar
to Yuma passes directly over the City. While these operations do not result in average daily noise
levels in excess of 65dB CNEL, they were a source of nuisance noise and significant complaints
during 1999 and 2000 when the helicopters deviated from the approved routes or flew at lower
than the approved elevation.
Commercial/Industrial Noise - Noise sources such as manufacturing, retail centers and mining
also occur throughout the City, but have a much more localized effect. These stationary noise
sources are regulated by the City’s Noise Abatement and Control Ordinance. In general, retail
center noise is largely a function of traffic and is, therefore, taken into account in the previous
discussion of traffic noise. Generally, the commercial areas presently existing in the City of
Santee do not generate noise in excess of the City’s standards, although some nuisance noise
from loading dock and delivery activities does occur. Manufacturing and industrial activities are
generally restricted to the City’s industrial districts in the southeast and far southern portions of
the City.
Extraction of sand and gravel and associated construction material manufacturing along the river
channel does represent a major noise source. Equipment such as bulldozers, conveyers,
mechanical shovels and heavy trucks generate high noise levels which can, in some instances,
exceed 80 dB(A) Ldn. The impact of extraction activities is, however, lessened because they
tend to be temporary uses. The sand mining operations in the river are winding down which will
reduce noise levels in this stretch of the San Diego River. Noise associated with the block
manufacturing may remain somewhat beyond the end of the mining operation.
                           Construction Noise - Construction activities within the are considered a
                           temporary source of noise. Chapter 8.12, “Noise Abatement and
                           Control”, of the Santee Municipal Code regulates construction as well
                           as other stationary noise sources. This ordinance sets limits on the time
                           of day, and days of the week that construction can occur as well as
                           setting noise limits for construction activities.
                           Community Noise - For the purpose of this Noise Element, community
activities are defined as any noise source that intrudes above the local ambient noise levels and
which is not associated with traffic flow, business and industry, or aircraft operations. These
activities include normal household operations such as lawn mowing, air conditioners, house
cleaning, recreational areas such as Santee Lakes and Carlton Oaks Country Club, and animal
noise, i.e., barking dogs. These activities are not considered significant noise sources; while they
can be objectionable, they are normally classified as nuisance noise.
5.0     Needs
5.1     Traffic Noise
Within the City of Santee, future noise problems are primarily traffic-related. Traffic noise is
expected to change significantly in the City over the next 15 years. Three major factors will
                                                                     Santee General Plan
                                                                         Santee, California
                                            - 7-7 -

NOISE ELEMENT
cause this change. The first factor is the natural growth occurring both in Santee and the East
County, which generally will cause the traffic on some streets to rise, creating higher noise
levels. Secondly, completion or widening of major freeways will introduce significant noise into
some areas that are now relatively quiet. Finally, changes in the traffic circulation due to the
new freeways may cause a redistribution of traffic on some streets, in some instances reducing
noise levels. The development of Santee's circulation system includes the completion of two
freeways (State Routes 52 and 125) and the widening of a third (State Route 67), completion of
the street network in Town Center and extensions or improvements to many of the City's major
thoroughfares.
The Circulation Element depicts the adopted alignment for State Route (SR) 52 which will
extend from its current terminus at the interchange with SR125 east to SR 67. The alignment
runs approximately 500 feet north of and parallel to Prospect Avenue east to SR67. Caltrans
expects SR52 to be carrying over 100,000 ADT through the City of Santee, which is
approximately 50% higher than projected volumes on SR67. Given the relatively quiet
conditions along much of this corridor, the remaining phases of SR52 will result in increased
noise levels along the freeway corridor, even with mitigation.
The Regional Transportation Improvement Program includes a northerly extension of the SR125
                                               freeway running outside the City’s western border.
                                               The Caltrans forecast for this corridor is
                                               approximately 25,000 ADT. Depending on the
                                               design and ultimate alignment, this highway could
                                               create a considerable noise impact at Santee Lakes
                                               and some residential neighborhoods at the western
                                               edge of the City.
                                               Planned improvements to State Route 67 would
                                               widen the portion of the freeway between SR52
                                               and Interstate 8 from six to eight lanes and between
                                               52 and Mapleview Street from four to six lanes.
                                               This widening will increase the capacity of the
freeway and could cause additional noise impacts to existing residential areas along Graves
Avenue and South Woodside Avenue areas. It should be noted that noise mitigation measures do
not exist along SR67 through the City, so any future expansion of this freeway could have a
beneficial effect if noise mitigation measures, such as berms or walls, are installed in conjunction
with the freeway’s improvement.
The northern extensions of Carlton Hills Boulevard, Fanita Parkway, Cuyamaca Street and
Magnolia Avenue as significant roads will cause noise impacts in residential areas where they
now exist as less frequently traveled streets or do not exist at all. The same applies to the
completion, and opening, of Mast Boulevard east to Lakeside. Mitigation will need to be
considered and applied for these future street extensions to address impacts on existing as well as
new noise sensitive uses.
Santee General Plan
Santee, California                         - 7-8 -

                                                                    NOISE ELEMENT
Other improvements expected to create significant noise impacts are the improvements to
Prospect Avenue and the completion of the planned street network in Town Center. The road
network in Town Center is expected to primarily affect new development, which will be
designed with noise mitigations to address expected traffic volumes.
While the San Diego trolley is not a significant noise generator, and in fact contributes to
reductions in traffic-related noise impacts, future extensions of the trolley to the east could result
in noise increases for existing and planned noise sensitive uses. The noise impact of any future
rapid transit installations in Santee will be dealt with through the environmental review process.
5.2     Aircraft Noise
In 2001, Gillespie Field logged 175,392 operations, a
seven percent reduction from 2000. Based on the 1987
Comprehensive Land Use Plan for Gillespie Field, the
noise level within the influence of Gillespie Field will
rise by approximately 3 dB(A) CNEL over the next 8
years and will then remain fairly constant unless
expansion of the airport takes place. Changes in the mix
of aircraft, such as an increase in private jet operations,
could also alter the noise projections in the existing
Gillespie Field plan.
Military Aircraft – While projected noise contours would not result in any significant noise
impacts to the City, changes in the alignment of any fixed wing or helicopter routes, particularly
the Yuma route, could result in increased noise impacts to existing or future residences and noise
sensitive use in the City.
Future Airport - Over the years there have been studies prepared to evaluate the feasibility of
constructing a civilian airport at MCAS Miramar (assuming the base was vacated by the
military), or east of I-15, to replace Lindbergh Field. While no specific noise studies are yet
available to quantify the actual impacts, it is likely that any future airport located on or near
MCAS Miramar could result in direct and significant noise impacts to the City as well as other
communities in the region. The City should remain active in tracking this issue and providing
input on this regionally significant issue.
5.3     Community Activities
General neighborhood noise sources are not expected to change. In fact, some household
operations, such as lawn mowing, could become quieter because of Federal, State and local
regulations which are aimed at reducing noise output from household equipment.
5.4     Off Road Vehicle Parks / Activities
There have been discussions and proposals over the years to locate a State-sponsored off-road
                                                                     Santee General Plan

NOISE ELEMENT
vehicle facility in the open space areas to the north or to the west of the City limits. The City has
opposed these proposals which would likely result in noise impacts to existing and planned
residential development in Santee. The City should continue to oppose the establishment of any
off-road vehicle facility that results in noise impacts to the existing or planned development in
the City. Unauthorized off-road vehicle activity will likely continue to occur with open space
areas throughout the City. The City will need to continue a program of active enforcement
through the Sheriff’s Department.
5.5     Other Noise Sources
In recent years, there have been discussions with the owners of the property located just to the
north of the City regarding their intent to extend the existing mining operation in Slaughterhouse
Canyon south onto the properties bordering the planned Fanita Ranch development. An active
mining operation in this area could have considerable noise impacts on future planned
development in the Fanita Ranch.
  6.0     Goal
  Improve the city's overall quality of life by reducing harmful and annoying noise for
  existing and future residents.
7.0     Objectives and Policies
      Objective 1.0       Control noise from sources adjacent to residential, institutional and

      Policy 1.17 The City shall officially support the control of noise through legal regulations
      and cooperative government efforts.
      Objective 2.0       Ensure that future developments will be constructed to minimize
                          interior and exterior noise levels.
      Policy 2.1 The City shall adhere to planning guidelines and building codes which include
      noise control for the exterior and interior living space of all new residential developments
      within noise impacted areas.
      Policy 2.2 The City should require new development to mitigate noise impacts to existing
      uses resulting from new development when: 1) such development adds traffic to existing
      City streets that necessitates the widening of the street; and 2) the additional traffic
      generated by the new development causes the noise standard or significance thresholds to
      be exceeded.
      Policy 2.3 The City should not require new development to mitigate noise impacts to
      existing uses when the new development only adds traffic already anticipated by the City’s
      General Plan to an existing street, but does not necessitate widening of that street.
8.0     Implementation
There are a variety of existing Federal, State and local programs and strategies that can be used
within the City to reduce the potential noise impacts described within this Element.
8.1     Local Regulations
Thresholds of Significance: The California Environmental Quality Act encourages jurisdictions
to establish local thresholds for determining whether a particular impact is significant. Impacts
exceeding these thresholds would require that measures be identified to avoid or reduce the
severity of the impact. Noise impacts shall be considered significant if any of the following
occur as a result of the proposed development:
1.    If, as a direct result of the proposed development, noise levels for any existing or planned
      development will exceed the noise levels considered compatible for that use as identified in
      Figure 7-3, Noise / Land Use Compatibility Guide.
2.    If, as a direct result of the proposed development, noise levels which already exceed the
      levels considered compatible for that use are increased by 3 or more decibels.
Development standards should be applied to future projects during the discretionary review
process and should include the following:

NOISE ELEMENT
1.    Whenever it appears that new development will result in any existing or future noise
      sensitive uses being subjected to noise levels of 65 dB(A) Ldn, or greater, as depicted on
      Figure 7-2, an acoustical study will be required.
      For residential uses, noise sensitive areas shall include rear yard areas on single family
      residences and ground floor common areas and private patio areas for multiple family
      residences. For other noise sensitive uses such as libraries, schools or hospitals, noise
      sensitive areas shall be those areas that serve a significant function for the use that could be
      adversely affected by noise. Examples include resting or patient recovery areas at hospitals,
      outdoor service areas for churches (excluding areas used for short-term social gatherings)
      or outdoor teaching or discussion areas at schools (does not include playgrounds or other
      active outdoor areas).
2.    If the acoustical study shows that the noise levels at any noise sensitive area will exceed 65
      dB(A) Ldn, the development should not be approved unless the following findings are
      made:
      a.    Modifications to the development have been, or will be made, which will reduce the
            exterior noise level in noise sensitive areas to 65 dB(A) Ldn or less, or
      b.    If, with current noise abatement technology, it is not feasible to reduce the exterior
            noise level to 65 dB(A) Ldn or less, then modifications to the development will have
            been, or will be made which reduce the exterior noise level to the maximum extent
            feasible and the interior noise level to 45 dB(A) Ldn or less. Particular attention shall
            be given to noise sensitive spaces such as bedrooms.
            For rooms in noise sensitive areas which are occupied only for a part of the day,
            (schools, libraries or similar), the interior one-hour average sound level during
            occupation, due to noise outside, should not exceed 45 dB(A) Leq (hour).
The City's noise maps will be used to determine whether a proposed project or land use is
compatible with its surrounding land uses. Noise compatible land uses are assessed according to
the categories depicted on Figure 7-3, Noise / Land Use Compatibility Guide. The Noise / Land
Use Compatibility Guide should not be misinterpreted as being prohibitive but should be used as
a guide and a resource. If doubt exists as to the noise impact, whether it be the existing or future
noise on the project or from the project on the surrounding community, an acoustical study will
be required. Land use changes should be reviewed for potential noise impacts.
The acoustical study shall include existing and future noise levels on the site, the effect of the
project on its surroundings, and mitigating measures, if necessary. The mitigation measures may
include, but not be limited to the following:
1.    The use of site design techniques such as the provision of buffers to increase distances
      between the noise source and receiver, siting of buildings and parking areas and the careful
Santee General Plan

                                                                   NOISE ELEMENT
       siting of noise-sensitive outdoor features to minimize noise impacts;
2.     Provision of berms, landscaping and other sound barriers, without the exclusive use of
       walls; i.e., a combination of a small wall and a berm in concert with the overall streetscape
       in the area could be appropriate; and
3.     Insulation of buildings against noise, including thicker-than-standard glazing and
       mechanical ventilation.
In addition, there are several other procedures, which, where practical, would be effective in
reducing noise throughout the City. These include:
1.     Improving traffic circulation to "smooth" flow by such measures as interconnecting traffic
       signals;
2.     Considering the use of innovative construction technologies and materials in constructing
       or reconstructing streets;
3.     Reducing speed limits in noise sensitive areas;
4.     Setting time limits on certain noisy activities; and
5.     Purchasing demonstrably quiet equipment for City use.
With regard to transportation, a liaison should be maintained with transportation agencies, such
as CALTRANS, the Regional Airport Authority and the Marine Corps in a cooperative effort to
reduce noise at existing facilities and ensure the consideration of noise impacts when designing
and locating proposed facilities and operations. The City should encourage other transportation
agencies and the military to comply with the City’s noise regulations when designing new
facilities, or route alignments which impact the City. In addition, the City should review ongoing
policies, programs, and ordinances every five (5) years or as warranted by technological
developments, as per State guideline requirements
6.2      State Regulations
Noise Compatibility Guidelines, State of California Office of Noise Control – Developed in
1976, these guidelines were developed to evaluate noise levels for various land uses and
determine the acceptability or compatibility of noise levels with specific land uses.
Motor Vehicle Code, Sections 23130, 27002, 27150, 27151 and 27160 (Annex A), sets the noise
level limits for all vehicles operating on California highways. These regulations are normally
enforced by the California Highway Patrol.
The State Uniform Building Code (Title 24, Noise Insulation Standards), establishes interior
noise levels of 45 dB CNEL for new hotels, motels, apartment houses, condominiums, and
                                                                   Santee General Plan
                                                                      Santee, California
                                            - 7-15 -

dwellings other than single family dwellings. When such structures are subject to noise levels of
60 dB(A) Ldn or greater, an acoustical analysis is required to show that the interior noise levels
will not exceed 45 dB(A)Ldn. This regulation is enforced by the City's Building Inspection
Department. When it is proposed to erect an eligible building within a noise impacted zone, an
acoustical analysis is required. This analysis must be carried out by a qualified acoustical
consultant and the report submitted together with the building plans.
California Environmental Quality Act - The California Environmental Quality Act (Public
Resources Code Section 21000 et seq) requires that the impacts of both short-term (temporary)
and permanent noise sources and ground borne vibration be evaluated and that such impacts be
eliminated or mitigated to the extent feasible. The City of Santee has adopted local
environmental review procedures which implement the California Environmental Quality Act.
The California Environmental Quality Act (Section 21096) also requires the use of the Airport
Land Use Planning HandBook prepared by the California Department of Transportation’s
Division of Aeronautics to be used as a technical resource in evaluating airport-related noise and
safety issues.
6.3      Federal Regulations
The Federal Highway Adminstration (FHWA). The FHWA administers regulations 23 CFR 772,
which provide procedures for noise studies and noise abatement criteria to be used in the
planning and design of federally funded or permitted freeway projects.
The Noise Control Act of 1972 established a national policy “to promote an environment for all
Americans free from noise that jeopardizes their public health and welfare”. The Act provides
for a division of powers between the federal, state and local governments in which the primary
federal responsibility is for noise source emission control, with the states and other agencies
retaining the rights to control noise sources and the level of noise within their communities and
jurisdictions.
The Federal Interagency Committee on Noise (FICON) – FICON consists of representatives of
governmental agencies that have responsibilities for airport noise, including the FAA and
military services. It reviews policies that govern the assessment of airport noise impacts.
The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) sets noise exposure limits in the workplace. In
California this Act is administered as CAL/OSHA.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates noise emissions for private and
commercial aircraft. The FAA and the Caltrans Division of Aeronautics (Title 21, Subchapter 6)
have adopted general standards that define compatible uses within the 65 CNEL contour around
civil airports.

8.      SAFETY ELEMENT
The purpose of the Safety Element is to
reduce loss of life, injuries, and damage to
property resulting from natural and
human-caused public safety hazards
including flooding, geologic and seismic
hazards, fire, traffic hazards and crime.
The Safety Element identifies areas where
private and public decisions on land use
need to be responsive to potentially
hazardous conditions. It also serves to
inform individuals, firms and public
agencies of Santee's policies regarding
appropriate levels of public services such
as Sheriff’s and Fire protection.
1.0     Statutory Requirements
The California Planning and Zoning Laws identify a Safety Element as one of the seven mandatory
elements in a General Plan. The current Safety Element represents a consolidation of the previous
Public Safety and Seismic Safety Elements.
The Safety Element must address public safety issues such as wildland and urban fire, flooding,
crime prevention and seismic and geologic hazards. This element must also identify plans and
programs for emergency response and must be reviewed by the State Department of Conservation
Division of Mines and Geology and the State Office of Emergency Services before adoption.
2.0 Accomplishments Since Adoption of the General Plan
Since the adoption of the City’s first General Plan in August of 1984, the City has fulfilled many
of the goals, and implemented the policies found in the Safety Element. Major accomplishments
include:
 Adopted a Grading Ordinance that addresses hillside grading and provides recommendations
    and requirements necessary to permit safe development within these areas.
 Adopted Zoning Ordinance requirements that limit hillside development and require site
    sensitive grading to reduce impacts.
 Development of a number of residential subdivisions within geologically sensitive areas
    ensuring the recommendations of the existing General Plan are followed and the all

SAFETY ELEMENT
 In the early 1980's, the Santee and Lakeside Fire Departments signed an automatic aid
   agreement to provide response to the others' geographic area automatically to reduce
   response times and enhance public safety. This successful effort spearheaded a larger
   automatic aid agreement for the entire East County region.
 In 1984, the City Council approved an ordinance requiring automatic fire sprinkler systems
   in commercial occupancies. The ordinance was revised in the early 90's to include sprinkler
   systems in residential structures as well.
 In the late 1980's the City began to install “opticom” devices in traffic signals to give
   emergency vehicles priority at intersections and improve response times. Today, all City
   traffic signals are equipped with these devices.
 In the early 1990's, the Fire Department initiated a unique and extremely successful public
   education program targeted mostly to school-aged children. The programs capture the
   audiences' attention by using firefighter clown characters to deliver important fire and life
   safety messages in an entertaining fashion.
 In the late 1990's, the City became a participating agency in the County's 800 MHz Regional
   Communications System, greatly improving inter-agency communications throughout the
   region during mutual aid and disaster operations.
 Since medical emergencies constitute nearly 80% of the Fire Department emergency
   responses, the City initiated a program that upgraded all first responding fire companies to
   be equipped and staffed with a paramedic.
 In 1994, the Fire Department developed an program using senior volunteers to assist with fire
   prevention inspections. The size and scope of the program have been expanded to include
   report data entry and staffing of informational booths at civic events.
 The City continuously updates its emergency operations plan and provides ongoing training
   to maintain compliance with the Statewide Emergency Management System (SEMS),
   increasing preparedness in the event of a disaster.
 In June of 2000, the Fire Department moved from the station at Carlton Hills Blvd. to a new
   facility at the corner of Fanita Parkway and Carlton Oaks Dr. The new facility will enhance
   public safety by allowing the Department to add a much needed two- person rescue
   company. The building won an award from the American Public Works Association in 2000.
 In 2002, the City adopted a public access defibrillation program that allows for placement of
   automated cardiac defibrillators in public places.
 Implementation of Community Oriented Policing and Problem Solving (COPPS), by the San
   Diego County Sheriff’s Department, with a staff of 8 Special Purpose Officers, in partnership
   with the City and its citizens. The Zoning Ordinance was amended in 2001 to include zoning

3.0     Introduction
Within the City of Santee, growth and development is expected to continue as the City approaches
build-out. With planned growth, and the associated public safety considerations, the City has
developed a Safety Element to address public safety concerns. The public safety considerations
addressed within the Element include flooding, fire hazards, geotechnical and/or seismic hazards,
hazardous materials, crime prevention, traffic safety, aircraft safety and disaster preparedness.
This information is utilized in the planning process to guide the location, type and design of
future developments within the City to avoid or reduce risks to public safety.
Relationship to Other Elements – The intent of the Safety Element is to identify natural and
man-caused hazards and to develop policies to reduce the risk associated with such hazards. The
Safety Element is most closely related to the Land Use, and to a lesser extent the Housing
Element since this information is used to guide the location of the various land uses and direct
the location and design of future development.
4.0     Existing Conditions
4.1     Flood Hazards
Rivers and Creeks - Flooding in Santee could result primarily from four conditions or a
combination of them: (1) heavy, prolonged rain; (2) the collapse or cresting of a dam; (3) a
degraded watershed or drainage system; (4) a release of water from upstream dams. In this area,
one of the most serious watershed management problems arises from wildland fires, which remove
thick underbrush and chaparral, stripping the moisture-retaining ground cover from the soil. Runoff
from bare slopes increases, and soil erosion takes place.
Santee has five primary waterways: the San Diego River, Forester Creek, Sycamore Creek, and
intermittent creeks paralleling Big Rock Road and Fanita Drive shown on Figure 8-1, Public
Safety. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) mapped the San Diego River and
Forester Creek and updated maps as of June 19, 1997 as part of the National Flood Insurance
Program.
Within the City there are a total of 1020 acres within the floodplain of the San Diego River,
approximately 596 within the floodway and 424 acres within the floodplain fringe. The Forester
Creek floodplain is estimated to cover an area of approximately 100 acres. The low flow channel
of Sycamore Creek is estimated to cover roughly 42 acres (also shown on Figure 8-1.). The low
flow channel of the creek parallel to Big Rock Road covers roughly 5 acres. The portion of the
low flow channel of the creek parallel to Fanita Drive that is within Santee covers roughly 2.8
acres.
There are a variety of existing and designated land uses (i.e. residential, commercial, and
industrial) located within the floodplain areas of these waterways. Many of these uses would be
                                                                     Santee General Plan
                                                                         Santee, California

SAFETY ELEMENT
susceptible to flood damage (depending upon their siting and design considerations) in the event of
a 100-year flood.
In 1993 the City completed a comprehensive update of the City’s Flood Damage Prevention
Ordinance to minimize the public and private losses due to flooding. The intent of the ordinance is
to reduce the risks to residents and public and private improvements from flooding. The ordinance
precludes development in flood-prone floodway areas and requires all new development to be
designed to be above the height of the 100-year flood.
                                                    Historical flood records indicate extensive flood
                                                    damage to surrounding areas in Santee
                                                    associated with flood events along the San
                                                    Diego River and to a lesser extent, Forester
                                                    Creek. Portions of both of these waterways
                                                    have been improved to reduce flooding. Santee
                                                    is currently working on the required
                                                    environmental process, channel design, right-of-
                                                    way acquisition, and future construction of
                                                    improvements to Forester Creek between
                                                    Mission Gorge Road and Prospect Avenue, for a
                                                    distance of approximately 1.2 miles.          The
                                                    improvements to the creek will increase the
flood-carrying capacity of the creek to contain the l00-year flow. This project would reduce the
floodplain of the creek from 100 to approximately 25-30 acres in size. These improvements are
expected to be completed by 2004.
Water Reservoirs – The Padre Dam Municipal Water District provides potable water, recycled
water, wastewater management services and recreational facilities to an 85 square mile District,
including the entire City of Santee. The District’s service area population is estimated at 125,000,
with an average daily water use of 17 million gallons. The
district currently has over 330 miles of potable water mains, 140
miles of wastewater mains and 25 miles of recycled water
mains.
The District maintains seven water reservoirs within Santee
(Figure 8-1). The Charles C. Price Reservoir, located just east of
State Route 67 and Via Madonna, is the largest, with a capacity
of 15.5 million gallons. The Northcote reservoir, located at the
end of Northcote Road, is the smallest reservoir with a capacity
of 0.71 million gallons. The Fanita Reservoir, an aboveground
tank located just south of the southern terminus of Organdy
Lane, is the only water tank in the City that holds recycled
water, storing up to 1.5 million gallons. The District is planning
an additional potable-water reservoir near the southern end of
Mesa Road, for future development in this area. When the
Fanita Ranch is developed, additional water storage facilities
will be required to serve this area.
Each of the reservoirs is located on the top of a hill in order to minimize the need for pumps. In the
event of the failure and release of water from of any of the reservoirs, the land adjacent to and
below the ruptured reservoir could be flooded. The reservoirs range from 150 to more than 1,500

feet from the nearest homes. Inundation studies for these reservoirs have not been completed by
the District.
In addition to the reservoirs within Santee, the City could also be subject to flood damage from
failure of water storage tanks located nearby. One is located near Grossmont College, just south of
the City limits. This reservoir holds 3.6 million gallons of water for the Padre Dam and Helix
Water Districts. The nearby Fletcher Hills Reservoir on Weld Avenue, in El Cajon, has a capacity
of 1.5 million gallons.
Dam Failure - The central portion of the City of Santee is located in the San Diego River Valley
downstream of three major dams in San Diego County. These include the San Vicente Dam, the
El Capitan Dam, and the Chet Harrit Dam (Lake Jennings).
The El Capitan Dam, roughly 10 miles upstream from Santee, was built in 1935 by hydraulic fill
methods The dam is rock-filled, with a clay core. It has a storage capacity of 112,807 acre-feet of
water at the spillway elevation of 750 feet above sea level. Due to the failure of a large
hydraulically filled dam in Los Angeles in 1971, the State's Department of Water Resources'
Division of Safety of Dams requested all owners of hydraulic fill dams to conduct an investigation
of the safety of their dams under seismic loading. The study of El Capitan showed that the
maximum water surface elevation should be 720 feet, which is now the permanent storage
elevation.
The Chet Harrit Dam (Lake Jennings) is an earth-fill dam located approximately 3 miles east of
Santee. Lake Jennings, which is retained by the dam, has approximately 10,700 acre-feet of
capacity. The dam was built in 1962 by modern methods to resist seismic damage.
The San Vicente Dam is a concrete gravity structure located approximately 3-½ miles northeast of
Santee. This dam was constructed in 1943 and has a capacity of 90,230 acre-feet of water. Studies
conducted in 1981 found the dam was capable of resisting seismic damage under the regional
seismic regime. The San Diego County Water Authority is proposing to raise San Vicente Dam by
54 feet to provide room to store another 52,100 acre-feet of water as part of the Emergency Water
Storage Project. Modeling done as part of the project’s Environmental Impact Report estimated
that the downstream dam break flood zone would not change significantly with the expanded
reservoir. The project may actually reduce the risk of dam failure as a result of the new dam
structure, which will be attached to the downstream face of the existing dam.
Maps prepared in the 1970s showing areas of inundation for the three dams located upstream of
the City of Santee have been reproduced on Figure 8-2, Dam Break Inundation Areas. The
inundation maps for the El Capitan Dam and the San Vicente Dam were prepared in 1974 for the
City of San Diego. The inundation map for the Chet Harrit Dam was prepared in approximately
1975 for the Helix Water District. Based on current knowledge, no hazardous conditions exist at
any of the structures. The safety of these dams is reviewed annually by the California
Department of Water Resources, Division of Dam Safety. In addition, the County of San Diego
Office of Disaster Preparedness has prepared a report entitled “General Dam Evacuation Plan for
San Diego County”.
4.2     Soil and Geologic Conditions
The City of Santee lies near the junction of a relatively narrow coastal plain and the Peninsular
Mountain Ranges of southwestern California and Baja California. The coastal plain is made up
of a series of marine terraces, which are deeply incised by canyons and tributaries, including the
channel of the San Diego River, which bisects the City. Much of Santee is located within the
                                                                   Santee General Plan
                                                                       Santee, California
                                            - 8-5 -

SAFETY ELEMENT
San Diego River Valley; however, the northern part of the City, much of which is undeveloped,
is located on the highest of these old marine terraces. In the southeastern part of the City, the
marine terrace and valley province ends abruptly in the foothills of the Peninsular Ranges.
The geologic stratigraphy of Santee consists of several surface soil types and three geologic
formations as shown on Figure 8-3, Geotechnical / Seismic Hazards Map. The surficial soil
deposits consist of undocumented fill, previously placed fill, topsoil, colluvium, alluvium/debris
flows, landslide deposits, and terrace deposits. Geologic formations include the Stadium
Conglomerate and Friars Formation, and granitic rock associated with the Penisular Ranges.
Undocumented Fill - In undeveloped and developed areas of the City of Santee, fill soils
presumed to be undocumented have been mapped in numerous geotechnical reports. An example
of a larger undocumented fill deposit is located in an undeveloped area north of the northern
terminus of Strathmore Drive. These types of deposits typically contain a wide range of soil
types including silt, sand, clay, and rock derived from the local geologic formations.
Undocumented fills typically are poorly compacted and often are underlain by potentially
compressible topsoil or alluvium. Consequently, where these deposits are located in areas of
proposed development they require special evaluation and recommendations.
Previously Placed Fill - The majority of the central and southern portions of the City of Santee
are developed. The fill materials placed during development of these areas generally consist of
silt and clayey sands and sandy clays with gravel and cobble mixtures.
Prior to grading or constructing additional improvements in previously graded areas, specific
geotechnical evaluations or update reports should be performed to address the potential impacts
to existing or proposed improvements.
Topsoil - In the undeveloped areas, topsoils blanket the majority of the formational units and
range in thickness from approximately 1 to 3 feet. The topsoils are generally characterized as
silt/clayey, fine to medium sands and sandy clays. Topsoil deposits typically are considered
compressible in their natural state, and ordinarily require remedial grading in areas planned to
receive structural fill and/or settlement-sensitive structures. The clayey topsoils characteristically
have a medium to high expansion potential, and when present at the ground surface, commonly
require specialized foundations to mitigate their impacts.
Colluvium - Colluvial soils are deep deposits of soils that have accumulated near the base of
slopes through erosion of upslope materials and soil-creep processes. Colluvial deposits are
encountered in the gentle, low-lying, slope areas near alluvial drainages primarily overlying the
Friars Formation; however, they also occur in areas underlain by Stadium Conglomerate and
granitic rocks. These deposits generally possess medium to high expansion potential, are poorly
consolidated, and often require remedial grading in areas of planned development.
Alluvium/Debris Flows - These deposits consist of relatively loose/soft, silt/clayey sands and
sandy clays, with varying amounts of gravel and cobble derived from the bedrock units.
Alluvial deposits typically occur in the drainage areas, such as the San Diego River channel, the
valley bottoms, and lower portions of the valley slopes. The San Diego River alluvium is
relatively deep and, in the near surface, typically consists of clean, medium-grained sands that
are locally mined as a source of concrete sand. It appears that many of the debris flow deposits
originated from higher elevations of the northern portion of the City along steep slopes within
the Stadium Conglomerate, and followed pre-existing alluvial channels.

The alluvial and debris flow deposits are often poorly consolidated and compressible, and
typically require remedial grading or special design considerations. Where development is
planned in main drainage channels, such as the San Diego River floodplain, soil improvement
techniques and structural reinforcement to remediate the effects of potential liquefaction may be
necessary.
Landslide Deposits - Numerous ancient landslides and several possible landslide features exist
within the City. The presence of the inferred features on Figure 8-3 are based on topographic
evaluation during field reconnaissance, interpretation of aerial photographs and topographic
maps, and reports by the California Geological Survey.
Nearly all of the landslides encountered at the northern, undeveloped portion of the City occur
along relatively gentle slopes within the Friars Formation and below an elevation of
approximately 590 feet above Mean Sea Level (MSL). On the southern portion of the City,
landslides occur approximately between elevations of 400 to 600 feet above MSL. Landslide
areas are characterized by bulging, hummock topography, as well as deflected drainages. Some
landslide areas express a more subdued topography suggestive of older landslide deposits.
In general, new developments should be planned to avoid or mitigate ancient landslide deposits.
Some landslides will require complete removal, while other landslides will only require partial
removals to compact the compressible portions of the deposits.
Terrace Deposits/Older Alluvium - Terrace deposits/older alluvium are found within a limited
area between the alluvial deposits and either the Friars Formation or granitic rock. These
deposits are relatively limited in extent and consist of locally cemented gravely sands and/or
clayey gravel/cobble conglomerate.
Stadium Conglomerate - The Stadium Conglomerate occurs throughout the southwestern and
northern parts of the City underlying the previously discussed high terrace and overlying both the
granitic rocks and the Friars Formation. This deposit generally consists of dense sandy to clayey,
gravel and cobble conglomerate with interbedded silt sands.
Landslides occurring entirely within the Stadium Conglomerate are uncommon; however, this
unit is often involved in sliding where it overlies the Friars Formation. Debris flows or mudflows
are relatively common and are discussed in more detail under Geologic Hazards.
The Stadium Conglomerate forms characteristic resistant dissected ridges within the upper
elevations of the City. Localized, steeply eroded scars occur within this formation where debris
flows originated at the head of tributary canyons.
Moderately heavy to heavy excavation effort should be anticipated during grading within the
Stadium Conglomerate due to randomly occurring highly cemented zones. Cut or fill slopes
composed of the Stadium Conglomerate generally possess good slope stability.
Friars Formation - Friars Formation deposits are found overlying the granitic rocks in the
southern and north-central parts of the City. This formation is exposed between Cuyamaca Street
and the eastern foot of Cowles Mountain in the southwestern portion of the City, and throughout
the northern part of the City, with the exception of the northeastern area of the Fanita Ranch.
Numerous large, ancient landslides occur within the Friars Formation. Soils derived from the
Friars Formation typically posses a medium to high expansion potential and low shear strength.
Where exposed in cut slopes, these soils can be prone to surficial instability, and often require
                                                                   Santee General Plan

stabilization measures. Bedding-plane shears are relatively common within the Friars Formation
and are significant in that they represent inherent planes of weakness within the formation.
During development, where the shears are anticipated to "daylight" in cut slopes, stabilization
measures such as drained stability fills or buttresses are necessary.
Granitic Rock - The high marine terrace which forms the surface of the northern parts of the City
above Carlton Hills is underlain by Friars Formation and Stadium Conglomerate. Both
formations overlie granite rocks. The less weathered, more resistant rock has been utilized in the
past as quarry stone and can be observed as large rounded boulders on the hills east of Gillespie
Field, near Carlton Oaks Golf Course, on Cowles Mountain and in the eastern part of the City.
4.3      Geologic Hazards
Ancient Landslides - A landslide is defined as any mass movement of earth occurring below the
limits of the soil mantle, caused by shear failure along one or several surfaces. Landslides occur
throughout the area underlain by the Friars Formation. The approximate locations of known or
suspected landslides are shown on the Geotechnical/Seismic Hazard Map, Figure 8-3. The
largest of the ancient landslides are typically 1,000 to 1,500 feet in width and length (as in
Carlton Hills) and extend to depths of 20 to 100 feet below the ground surface. Landslide
complexes or clusters of more than one individual slide are also common in the Fanita Ranch
area.
Reactivated ancient landslides have been responsible for either partial or complete loss of 20 to
30 homes in the Santee area. The reactivation of ancient landslides, and the creation of new
landslides, has been most commonly caused by grading activities or a rise in groundwater level
in a slide area.
Debris Flow Deposits - A debris flow is a rapid downslide movement of saturated soil and near
surface rock debris. The locations of some of the larger flows identified are within city limits
shown on Figure 8-3.
The debris flows or mudflows are initiated near the crests of very steep ridges underlain by
Stadium Conglomerate and probably occur as a result of high intensity rainfall. As the near
surface soils become saturated, the soils lose strength and fail relatively rapidly to form a river of
mud and rock with considerable destructive power. While the cause of debris flows are generally
well understood, specific details concerning these events make them difficult to predict. High
rainfall, loss of vegetation cover through fire or other causes, and the steepness of the slope
appear to be the main causative factors.
Ground Water and Seepage - Groundwater and seepage conditions are significant factors in
assessing engineering and geologic hazards. Groundwater is typically found in the deep alluvial
drainage areas such as the San Diego River channel, but may also be found in shallower
drainages as a result of storm water infiltration. Seepage is typically the result of a ground water
table or perched water, either seasonal or permanent, being exposed at the ground surface.
Ground water and seepage are major contributing factors to landslides in San Diego County,
especially in the reactivation of old landslides.
Seismic Hazards - Seismic hazards are threats to life and property caused by earthquake-induced
ground shaking. While there are no active or potentially active faults are known to occur within
or adjacent to the City, Santee is similar to other areas in California in that it is subject to
periodic seismic shaking due to earthquakes along remote or regional active faults. An active

fault is defined by the California Geological Survey as a fault showing evidence for activity
within the last 11,000 years.
The Rose Canyon Fault Zone, located approximately 10 miles west of the City of Santee, is the
closest known active fault. Earthquakes that might occur on the Rose Canyon Fault Zone or other
faults within the southern California and northern Baja California area are potential generators of
significant ground motion in the City. The Rose Canyon Fault Zone is the dominant source of
potential ground motion in the city. Seismic parameters for the Rose Canyon Fault Zone include
an estimated maximum earthquake magnitude of 6.9.
The seismic risk within the City is not considered significantly greater than that of the
surrounding municipalities and the San Diego County area in general. Since no Alquist-Priolo
Earthquake Fault Zones exist within the City of Santee, there are no restrictions on development
related to the Alquist-Priolo requirements.
Soil Liquefaction - Within the City of Santee, the soil deposits that may be susceptible to
liquefaction are the alluvial soils found in the San Diego River and its deeper tributary channels.
The general extent of the liquefaction-susceptible materials is shown on Figure 8-3. Although all
major deposits of alluvial soils have been shown on Figure 8-3 as being susceptible to
liquefaction, some areas may have a water table sufficiently deep or may have particular soil
conditions that may result in a very low potential for liquefaction. In general, for deposits with a
water table below a depth of 50 feet, a seismic event would have to be especially strong for
liquefaction to occur. Therefore, these deeper deposits will have a low potential for liquefaction
as a result of the maximum expected seismic events.
Liquefaction-related distress could range from small, localized areas, to liquefaction covering a
large area, resulting in lateral movement of the near-surface soils and heavy damage to any
affected structures. The potential risk to a structure should be evaluated whenever development
is proposed in a liquefaction susceptible area.
Seismically Induced Settlement - Seismically induced settlement is very closely related to
liquefaction in that loose sands and silts below the water table may tend to settle as the result of
ground shaking. If the soil is loose, the settlement can be quite large, as much as 20 percent of
the affected thickness of the deposit. The soils most susceptible to seismically induced settlement
are the loose alluvial soils of the San Diego River and its tributaries. Site-specific studies should
be performed in these areas to evaluate the effect of anticipated maximum seismic events.
Seismically Induced Landslides and Rock Falls - Seismically induced landslides and rock falls
are common in areas of high seismicity near the earthquake source. Since Santee is located far
from any major active faults, the potential for landslides caused by earthquakes is considered
low.
4.4     Fire Hazards
Santee's location in Southern California, surrounded by significant vacant land, makes it a medium
fire hazard area. The prevalence of brush-covered hillsides, many of which are not easily
accessible, add to the City’s fire hazards. The most common type of fire is a “common
combustible” fire, which starts with common materials such as wood, cloth, furniture, brush, etc.
Roughly 80 percent of the fires in Santee are in single-family residences.
A significant fire, one that burns a minimum of 500 acres and requires the heavy use of mutual aid
resources, occurs in Santee on a periodic basis. The Fanita Ranch and Rattlesnake Mountain areas,
                                                                    Santee General Plan
                                                                       Santee, California

both of which represent inaccessible, elevated, brush-covered hillsides, have a higher than average
proportion of the fires in Santee.
Fire and Life Safety Services and Regulations - The Santee Fire Department provides the
community with fire and life safety education, inspection and prevention services, code
enforcement, and by preparing for, responding to, resolving and recovering from emergencies.
The department is also the City’s lead for emergency preparedness, management, and response to
earthquakes, floods, explosion, fires, hazardous materials, rescue and medical problems in the City.
The Fire Department provides fire protection and paramedic services to the City, as well as roughly
two square miles adjacent to Santee in the Pepper Drive area of the County, under County Service
Area 115-contract agreement.           The Insurance
Services Office (ISO) last surveyed the City in 1997
and the City received a Class 2 rating based upon the
ISO rating system of 1 through 10 (with the highest
rating being 1 and the 10 the lowest). Santee
maintains a minimum daily staffing of 16 emergency
response personnel including the “on-call” Duty
Chief.
The City currently has two fire stations, one at 8950
Cottonwood Avenue and another at 9130 Carlton
Oaks Drive. The Department's response times vary within the City, with the current goal being to
provide an average maximum initial response time of no more than six minutes, with an average
maximum response time of no more than ten minutes for supporting paramedic transport units 90%
of the time. Response time is defined as the time when the units receive notification to their arrival
at the scene. To maintain adequate response times, it is anticipated that another fire station will be
needed when the currently vacant Fanita Ranch area develops.
The City has a signed automatic aid agreement on first alarm or greater with all surrounding
communities. The City is also part of both the San Diego County and State of California Master
Mutual Aid Agreements, and maintains a separate agreement with the California Department of
Forestry and U.S. Forest Service.
Paramedic Services - Paramedic advanced life support services are currently provided with first
responding fire companies and paramedic transport ambulances. The paramedic ambulances are
staffed with Firefighter Paramedics and operated in partnership with the Lakeside Fire Protection
District under the terms of a contract with County Service Area 69. All firefighters are required to
maintain a minimum of EMT-D State Medical
License. All Firefighter Paramedics maintain a
State EMT-P license and San Diego County
accreditation.
Public Education and Awareness - The City’s Fire
Department also operates many public awareness
programs to help address potential safety issues for
City residents. These include the Smoke Detector
Program in which Fire Department personnel
responding to emergencies check smoke detectors
within the home, or if no detectors exist, install one
at no charge to the resident. The Department also
maintains information about fire prevention on

the City’s website and distributes brochures on how to be prepared for wildfire. They also
provide an educational program for kids, using clown firefighters to spread fire safety ideas at
schools and city functions and also participated in “Every 15 Minutes", the national program to
make teens aware of the dangers of drinking and driving. The Department also organizes free
classes for Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Training and maintains a visible presence at
many community events providing information on department programs and safety issues.
Senior Volunteers - In 1996, the City Council approved the Fire and Life Safety Department’s
Retired Senior Volunteers in Prevention (RSVP) Program. The RSVP’s help Santee meet its fire
and life safety goals and maintain its relatively low annual fire loss by providing prevention
inspections, conducting traffic control at major fires, staff support, as well as providing meals
and drinks to firefighters on the lines.
Fire Regulations - The Fire Department also administers a weed abatement ordinance to reduce the
risk of structural damage from wildfires. In the spring, the Fire Department inspects the entire City
and notifies property owners to clear a defensible space around structures, and to clear
undeveloped lots of weeds. If owners do not voluntarily clear the property, the City can direct the
work to be done via a private contractor at owner’s expense.
All new construction in the City requires the installation of fire sprinklers, which further reduces
potential for fire loss. The City requires a minimum pressure flow of water for fire protection
purposes, based on the type of structure. While there are currently no fire-fighting water flow
pressure problems in the City, much of the future development may occur on the tops or sides of
hills in the northern part of the City where water pressures are lower.
To address fire and life safety issues on new development, the City’s Fire Marshal reviews all
proposed residential, commercial and industrial projects through the City’s Development Review
process. In this way, it is possible to ensure that adequate fire hydrant locations, water flow
pressures, access for emergency vehicles, and other requirements are met.
4.5      Crime Hazards
Crime Hazards - Police protection for Santee residents is provided by the County Sheriff’s
Department, which operates out of the Santee Substation on Cuyamaca Street, and a recently
opened storefront facility in the Santee Trolley Square retail center at the northwest corner of
Mission Gorge Road and Cuyamaca Street. The ratio of officers to population in Santee is 1.42:
12,000, which is higher than the County average. Santee also has quicker response times than the
                       County average. The average priority call response time for general law
                         enforcement within the City is 8.2 minutes and the average for traffic law
                         enforcement is 7.5 minutes. The City has consistently had one of the
                              lowest crime rates in the County.
                               Thefts and burglaries are the largest crime problem in Santee,
                            although Santee’s crime rate is well below the average for the County
                            as a whole. In general, higher density residential areas tend to have
                             more property-related crimes than do single-family areas, with
                         businesses being the main target for burglaries.
The Sheriff’s Department administers a Neighborhood Watch Program in the City, aimed at
reducing the number of burglaries. Neighborhood Watch is a program involving the joint efforts
of the Sheriff's Department and the community designed to enhance neighborhood security. The
                                                                    Santee General Plan
                                                                        Santee, California
                                            - 8-11 -

SAFETY ELEMENT
Sheriffs also administer a similar program called Kids Watch, which is oriented towards children
and teaches them to watch their neighborhood and how to contact law enforcement when needed.
The Sheriffs Department utilizes a Community Oriented Policing and Problem Solving (COPPS)
approach to crime prevention. COPPS is an effective community policing that has a positive
impact on reducing crime, helping to reduce fear of crime and enhancing the quality of life in the
community by combining the efforts and resources of the police, local government and
community members.
Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design - One of the proactive strategies used by the
Department to address thefts and other crimes in the community is the Crime Prevention
Through Environmental Design (CEPTD) program. This program emphasizes the application of
preventative measures in new construction as well as existing buildings or locations.
CPTED emphasizes understanding and changing the physical environment of a building or
neighborhood, using four primary concepts to reduce potential incidents of crime - Natural
Surveillance, Territoriality, Access Control, and Maintenance. Site design, landscaping and
lighting are major components of the four concepts. Decisions made by planners, designers and
law enforcement officials can influence resident and business conditions and behavior.
The Sheriff’s Department COPPS and Crime Prevention Units review all new development
proposals as part of the City Development Review Committee to incorporate safety
recommendations and CPTED principles into the design of new developments. As an example,
the City is promoting and the establishment of video surveillance cameras in large retail parking
lots to reduce the incidence of vehicle thefts.
Graffiti - The Santee Sheriff’s station is the only sheriff’s command where deputies are assigned
to investigate graffiti as a major function of their duties on a regular basis. The City’s graffiti
investigators enjoy a 100% conviction rate on graffiti cases submitted to the District Attorney’s
Office. General acts of graffiti have been displaced to neighboring communities due to the
investigative efforts of Santee deputies and the lower priority placed on this activity by
neighboring law enforcement agencies.
The City also funds four School Resource Officer (SRO) positions. These officers are assigned to
the Santee Elementary School District and the Santana and West Hills High Schools. The officers
are an educational resource, provide both intervention and follow-up services. They act as an on-
campus resource for school students to both provide a law enforcement liaison as well as to ensure
a safe environment for learning.
Las Colinas Detention Facility - The County of San Diego operates the Las Colinas Detention
Facility, a women-only facility with an inmate cap of 500 persons. The facility is located at 9000
Cottonwood Avenue. More than 12,000 bookings every year of female prisoners are performed at
Las Colinas for regional law enforcement agencies.
The County is evaluating possible alternative locations and designs for the facility including
combining the jail with a new Sheriff’s substation as a comprehensive public safety facility at the
site of the existing Edgemoor Geriatric Hospital on Magnolia Avenue. The City supports
reconstruction of the jail into a more modern, enclosed facility, which would be more compatible
with the surrounding community.

4.6      Traffic Haza rds
There are roughly 108 miles of roads in Santee. Most streets have been well maintained and do not
present significant driving hazards. The main cause of traffic accidents appears to be correlated to
uncontrolled turning movements onto high volume streets. Most collisions occur on the major
streets in or near intersections where traffic is heaviest and turning movements are frequent, such
as the intersection of Mission Gorge Road at Cuyamaca Street. This intersection is the focal point
of the Town Center area and it also serves as the terminus of the San Diego Trolley East Line.
For streets as a whole, Mission Gorge Road has highest accident rate due to the
amount of traffic this facility handles per day. This east-west roadway serves
primarily commercial and business establishments. With these types of land uses,
an increase in conflicting traffic movements may contribute to potential vehicle
collisions on this street. Currently there are over 44,000 vehicles per day on
portions Mission Gorge Road and 23,800 vehicles per day on Cuyamaca Street. In
the year 2020, up to a maximum of 70,000 vehicles per day are expected to use
Mission Gorge Road between SR125 and Carlton Hills Blvd, and up to 31,000
vehicles per day will use Cuyamaca Street.
The City recently installed Liquid Electronic Display (LED) traffic signal lights throughout the
city. These lights use less energy and are more visible. In the future, major intersections will have
battery back-up power so that in the event of a power outage these key intersections will continue
to operate smoothly, reducing the potential for traffic accidents.
4.7      Airport Hazards
The City of Santee is situated between two aircraft operation areas: Marine Corps Air Station
Miramar to the northwest and Gillespie Field to the immediate south. The San Diego County
Regional Airport Authority is responsible for overseeing operation of the regions airports. As
such, it is responsible for preparing comprehensive land use plans for the area surrounding each
airport within its jurisdiction, based on aircraft-produced noise impacts and aircraft-produced
accident potential considerations.
Marine Corps Air Station Miramar – The San Diego Association of Government's Comprehensive
Land Use Plan for NAS Miramar and the February 1996 Environmental Impact Statement for the
Realignment of NAS Miramar, does not include Santee within any of the airfields Accident
Potential Zones, which are areas with highest accident potential.
Gillespie Field - Gillespie Field was established in
1942 and is the oldest and largest of the county’s
general aviation airports. It is used primarily for
recreational and business purposes, and includes
seven runways, a tower, terminal, helicopter
landing pad, and airport related businesses. The
aircraft weight limits will continue to limit the
airport to general aviation and there are no plans
for it to become a commercial airport. Gillespie
Field’s current certification allows corporate jets
with wingspans up to 79 feet. The airport currently
has roughly 200,000 operations (take-off and
landings) per year. This has dropped from the high
of over 300,000 in 1979, and is expected to rise to
                                                                    Santee General Plan

maximum of 250,000 to 300,000 operations in 2010.
The Gillespie Field Comprehensive Land Use Plan, (CLUP) has a designated "Airport Influence
Area" which is the area that may be subject to either noise hazards or to height restrictions required
to prevent obstructions to navigable airspace.
The “Clear Zones” are areas of significant risk resulting form aircraft takeoff and landing patterns.
While the Clear Zones for Gillespie Field fall mainly within airport boundaries, there are several
County-owned properties north of the airport on Prospect Avenue that are designated as airport
clear zones. These properties area designated as Park / Open Space to reflect their airport function.
Airport noise compatibility issues are discussed in detail in the Noise Element.
4.8      Disaster Preparedness
The role of government in a disaster – whether it’s city, county, state or federal – is the
preservation of life and property. The City has adopted an Emergency Operations Plan, which
addresses the planned response to extraordinary emergency situations associated with natural and
man-caused disasters. The plan describes the overall responsibilities of government entities, as well
as the Santee Emergency Management Organization for protecting life and property in the City.
Santee is also a member of the Unified San Diego County Emergency Services Organization
(ESO) which is comprised of the 18 incorporated cities within the county and the County of San
Diego. The ESO provides coordination of disaster response and recovery activities. The
Organization operates under a Joint Powers Agreement that provides for cooperation and
coordination between member jurisdictions.
The Office of Disaster Preparedness (ODP) is the liaison between the incorporated cities, the State
Office of Emergency Services (OES) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),
as well as non-governmental agencies such as the American Red Cross. The Office of Disaster
Preparedness ensures the preparation and execution of emergency plans in the event of a major
emergency or disaster within the San Diego County area. It is important to note that ODP is not a
response agency, but rather serves to ensure coordination of efforts among County departments,
cities, special districts and other agencies within the county, as well with the state federal agencies.
Each year the City conducts drills and training simulations for the emergency operations center to
assure improved operation in the event of an actual disaster.

hazardous waste stream can be safely managed, and serves as the guide for local decisions
regarding the management of hazardous wastes.
The Hazardous Material Division of the County of San Diego’s Department of Environmental
Health protects the health and safety of the public and the environment by assuring that hazardous
materials and bio-medical waste are properly handled and stored. The Hazardous Materials
Division assists regulated businesses in the City in developing their business plans, as well as
developing an area plan for hazardous material emergency response coordination in the City and
County.
The City also provides residential curbside pick-up of waste automotive oil and filters in addition
to participating in a Household Hazardous Waste Program, which allows residents to safely
dispose of any unused or leftover portions of products containing toxic chemicals. Residents can
bring these types of materials to one of two collection facilities in their original containers for no-
cost, safe disposal.
5.0      Needs
While it is not possible to create an environment free from safety hazards, steps can be taken to
minimize the level of risk for citizens and property. This can best be accomplished by having a
population, which is aware of the hazards, and also of measures that can reduce or eliminate them.
Those agencies within the City whose responsibility it is to further the health and well-being of
Santee's residents need to continue striving for readiness in implementing any preventative or
emergency actions which might be required.
5.1      Flooding
Waterways - The major waterways in the City may continue to cause flooding problems. Since
urban development generally creates more runoff than vegetated lands, it is important that future
planning take into consideration the impacts of potential increased runoff. Any project proposed
within a floodplain area is subject to site plan review. In addition, planning for flood control
improvements for the San Diego River and other City waterways must be comprehensive, and
balanced with other goals such as providing recreation and protecting valuable habitat and species,
prior to constructing any improvements.
Water Reservoirs - Some homes could be damaged by water runoff from a rupture of any of the
seven water reservoirs and upstream dams. It is important that future planning takes into
consideration the general direction of flow in the event of a rupture in any of the reservoirs and
avoids the placement of buildings in those areas. The City should encourage the water district to
complete inundation studies for existing and planned reservoirs in the City.
5.2      Geologic / Seismic Hazards
Potential geologic problem areas exist within the City of Santee, as indicated on the
Geotechnical/Seismic Hazard Map, Figure 8-3. While the certainty of occurrence, timing, and
degree of significance of geologic and/or seismic hazards cannot be accurately predicted today, it
is possible to take appropriate actions which may minimize the loss of life and destruction of
property within the City caused by geologic or seismic hazards.
The City should continue to evaluate geologic and seismic risks during the review of
development proposals, as part of the environmental review process. Mitigation measures

measures should be placed as conditions of approval for the project. The identification of
impacts and mitigation measures should be based on a project specific geotechnical
investigation. The type of study required should be based on the type of project proposed and the
location of the project site on the Geotechnical / Seismic Hazard Map.
Seismic Hazards - Potential seismic hazards within the City associated with movement along
regionally active faults can neither be prevented nor predicted with any certainty. However, the
existing City of Santee Emergency Plan needs to be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure
that it continues to meet the changing needs of residents, transportation systems and public
services in the event of a seismically induced emergency.
5.3     Fire Hazards
Santee's fire problems are primarily related to the large amount of brush-covered vacant land
within the City, which are oftern not easily accessible. To minimize this potential hazard, the
existing weed abatement program and other preventative measures should be emphasized. As
development within the City’s vacant hillside areas proceeds, adequate water pressure and delivery
systems, emergency vehicle access, non-combustible roofing material and brush clearance zones
should be required to ensure fire safety.
5.4     Crime Hazards
The most frequent crime problems within the City are thefts and burglaries within higher density
residential areas, and within businesses located along Mission Gorge Road. These problems can
continue to be addressed for new development through the utilization of improved building
design techniques and lighting, which take into consideration defensible space strategies and
through the continued promotion of the Neighborhood and Kids Watch Programs and
enforcement actions for existing developed areas of the City. In addition, parking lot surveillance
systems for large scale commercial developments have also proven to be beneficial.
5.5     Traffic Hazards
                                          Traffic accidents along Mission Gorge Road are primarily
                                          due to heavy traffic volumes in association with numerous
                                          entrances and exits, which results in an increase in
                                          conflicting traffic movements. The City should continue to
                                          require the installation of shared driveways and reciprocal
                                          access between adjoining properties, in association with
                                          the implementation of other traffic control devices
                                          including the utilization of center medians, left turn
                                          pockets and signalized intersections, all of which would
                                          reduce conflicting traffic movements and potential for
                                          traffic accidents.
5.6     Aircraft Hazards
There are currently no areas in the City which are within designated crash hazard zones as
identified in the Comprehensive Land Use Plans for either Gillespie Field or Marine Corps Air
Station Miramar. However, the various Airport Safety Zones designated by the Caltrans Division
of Aeronautics do extend into the City. While these areas are almost entirely developed, the City
should ensure that future development or redevelopment in the most restrictive safety zones
Santee General Plan
Santee, California                          - 8-16 -

                                                                   SAFETY ELEMENT
addresses airport safety issues through measures such as recordation of avigation easements and
should discourage the establishment of sensitive uses such as hospitals and schools in those zones.
Future updates of the CLUPs for these two airfields should be carefully reviewed by the City to
identify any future aircraft safety issues.
5.7      Disaster Preparedness
The City has an Emergency Operations Plan that provides specific implementation measures in
case of any natural or human-induced disasters. Update of this Plan is an ongoing process by
which the City maintains an adequate level of public safety.
The City also has implemented procedures to initiate a coordinated Emergency Operations Center
in the event of a significant natural or man-induced disaster. The City should continue to provide
annual training to critical personnel to improve effectiveness in the event of an actual disaster.

8.0      Implementation
There are a variety of existing Federal, State and local programs and strategies that can be utilized
within the City to reduce the potential public safety hazards described within this Element.
Existing regulations and review procedures and other programs which can be undertaken within
the City in response to identified public safety needs for each potential public safety hazard are
described below.
8.1      Floodplain Management Regulations and Review Procedures
   1. The Colby- Alquist Floodplain Management Act prohibits the placement of structures in the
                                                                   Santee General Plan

SAFETY ELEMENT
       floodway, except for public utility or communication lines.
   2. The City’s Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance limits the placement of structures and uses
       in flood prone areas, controls dredging, filling or other activities that could modify the
       natural floodplain and prevents construction of barriers or structures that could divert
       floodflows and cause upstream or downstream impacts.
   3. The City Zoning Ordinance applies the Park/Open Space district designation to all property
       within the floodway of the San Diego River and Forester Creek. The development of
       property within the floodplain of these waterways is reviewed by the City to ensure that all
       building elevations are one foot higher than the peak flow level of a 100-year flood.
   4. The City's Public Works Standards give specific requirements for design of drainage
       facilities to ensure they are properly sized to handle 100-year flood conditions.
   5. The State Department of Water Resources' Division of Safety of Dams inspects all dams in
       California.
   6. In order for property owners within the City to qualify for Federal flood insurance, the City
       must have a program of identifying flood hazard areas and controlling development within
       these areas. The City has met these qualifications by maintaining up-to-date floodplain
       maps and controlling new development through the floodplain designator of the Zoning
       Ordinance and other provisions of the Municipal Code.
   7. The Uniform Building Code and Subdivision Ordinance regulate new development and
       other activities that may impact drainage ways or flood control facilities.
8.2     Geologic / Seismic Hazards Regulations and Review Procedures
   The implementation of an effective geologic/geotechnical review process necessitates the
   development of a methodology for determining the level of geologic risk or hazard associated
   with the development of various types and/or functions of structures within particular
   (geologic) areas within the City of Santee. This review process shall include:
    1. A classification of structure types or functions relative to their sensitivity to potential
        geologic risk.
    2. Minimum suggested requirements for the level of geotechnical investigation for various
        combinations of site location and type of structure or development.
    3. Design considerations that can be integrated into the proposed project design to avoid or
        adequately mitigate potential geologic hazards.
   The factors requiring consideration are the type and/or function of a structure, the presence of
   geological hazards at the proposed site and the level of risk that can be accepted. In areas of
   potentially higher risk or where more critical structures are planned, special design
   considerations will be necessary to reduce the level of risk to an acceptable factor. The intent
   is to provide a basis for evaluating specific site/structure combinations and to eliminate those
   that are unsuitable.
   Implementation of step (1) and (2) of the aforementioned review process can be accomplished
   through implementation of those actions stated in Table 8.1, Determination of Geotechnical

   Maximum Probable Earthquakes," CDMG Notes Number 43.
   Step (3) of the review process can be implemented through the environmental review process
   as mandated by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). CEQA requires all
   significant environmental effects of a proposed project, including geologic and soil
   conditions, to be identified and discussed, and identified significant effects are adequately
   mitigated. The procedure consists of a review to ensure that all pertinent geotechnical
   considerations had been adequately addressed and that appropriate land use and design
   considerations or siting alternatives be integrated into the project to mitigate identified
   hazards.

5.       TRAILS ELEMENT
The purpose of the Trails Element is to identify
and plan for Santee's needs in the future for the
development of bicycle, equestrian and
pedestrian trails.      The Trails Element is
designed to set policies and implementation
strategies for the development of a
comprehensive, City-wide, trail system which
will encourage residents to use alternative
modes of transportation for both recreation and
commuting.
1.0      Statutory Requirements
Section 65302 of the California Planning and Zoning Laws requires each General Plan in the
State to contain seven mandatory elements. The Trails Element is not a mandated element, but
rather is a permissive element adopted by the City to identify the location and availability of
trails in the City. Section 65303 of the California Government Code states that the City's General
Plan may include any other elements or address any other subjects which, in the judgement of
the legislative body, relate to the physical development of the city. While it is a permissive
element, it is as equally binding as a mandatory element once adopted by the City.
2.0      Accomplishments Since Adoption of the General Plan
Since the adoption of the City’s first General Plan in August of 1984, the City has fulfilled many
of the goals, and implemented the policies that are found in the Trails Element. Major
accomplishments include:
i Adoption and ongoing implementation of the Town Center Specific Plan which includes a
     comprehensive system of interconnected bike and pedestrian corridors. Over six miles of the
     planned corridor system has been constructed since adoption of the Specific Plan in 1987.
i Continuing efforts and coordination with other jurisdictions and agencies to obtain trail
     access to Goodan Ranch, Sycamore Canyon Open Space Preserve and future Mission Trails
     North property.
i Completed, or secured for the completion of over 60% of the high priority San Diego River
     bike and pedestrian trail system through the City as part of the City’s implementation of the
     Santee River Park plan.
i Adoption and ongoing implementation of the Mission Gorge Road Design Standards which
     include provisions for a bike and pedestrian paths along the full length of Mission Gorge
     Road.
                                                                    Santee General Plan

    development to dedicate easements and / or construction of trail segments shown in the
    General Plan as part of the discretionary review process.
i Since adoption of the General Plan in 1984, the City has completed either the entire stretch,
    or portions of, all but one of the trails identified as high priority in the 1984 General Plan.
3.0     Introduction
The City of Santee historically has been a commuter-oriented bedroom city, dominated by the
automobile. However, with increasing levels of traffic on both local streets and the regional
circulation system, alternative forms of transportation, including walking and bicycling are
becoming more important as one way to reduce traffic congestion.
The City of Santee is located in an area of the county that traditionally has been used by
equestrians and hikers. In addition, bicycles are becoming increasingly popular as a means of
transportation not only for recreation, but for commuting as well. A comprehensive and
functional system of paved and unimproved (dirt) trails and pathways will give residents the
opportunity to enjoy the recreational, heath and transportation benefits of a well-planned trail
system.
Relationship to Other Elements – The Trails Element is most directly related to the
Circulation, Recreation and Land Use Elements. Many of the bike paths in the City are
associated with major circulation element roads, such as Cuyamaca Street and Mission Gorge
Road. These are typically used by bicyclists as commuter paths. Other trails are primarily
recreational in nature and used by pedestrians, bicyclists and equestrians. Examples include the
San Diego River trail and many of the pathways in the Town Center. Lastly, as many of the trails
are designed to link land uses such as connecting residential uses with commercial or
recreational destinations the Trails Element is also related to the Land Use Element which
defines the spatial distribution of land uses in the City.
4.0     Existing Conditions
4.1     Bicycle Trails
The term "Bikeway" is used to define lanes designated primarily for safe bicycle travel. There
are three classifications of Bikeways:
      Class I Bike Path - Provides a completely separated right-of-way designated for the
      exclusive use of bicycles. Crossflows of pedestrians and vehicles are minimized.
Santee General Plan
Santee, California                            - 5-2 -

                                                                  TRAILS ELEMENT
      Class II Bike Lane - Provides a restricted right-of-way
      designated for the exclusive or semi-exclusive use of
      bicycles with through travel by motor vehicles or
      pedestrians prohibited, but with vehicle parking and
      crossflows of pedestrian and motorist traffic permitted.
      Class III Bike Route - Provides for a right of way
      designated by signage or permanent marking with
      shared use of pedestrians and/or motorists.
The City has approximately 37 miles of existing bikeways.
There are approximately 6 miles of Class I bike paths, 25
miles of Class II bike lanes, and 6 miles of Class III bike
routes. Figure 5-1 depicts the existing and future location of
bikeways in the City. There are two main east/west bikeways in the City. One is the Class I bike
path along the San Diego River. To date approximately one mile of this approximately 3.7-mile
path has been completed from Carlton Oaks to Cuyamaca Street through the City’s Mast Park
and the mixed-use Mission Creek development. This trail also links with a the Town Center
shopping district by means of a pedestrian bridge over the San Diego River and is used by
pedestrians, bicyclists and occasional equestrians. The second major east-west bikeway is a
Class II bike lane installed along the majority of Mast Boulevard connecting with existing bike
lanes on westbound State Route 52. This bikeway is more of a commuter bikepath and
eventually will be extended to the east into the County of San Diego when Mast Blvd is
completed. In addition to these two primary east-west routes, there is also a Class III bike route
running the length of Carlton Oaks Drive.
Some of the main north/south Bikeways include existing Bike Lane (Class II) facilities on
Carlton Hills Boulevard, Halberns Boulevard, Cuyamaca Street and Magnolia Avenue.
                                       Most areas of the City are served by existing bikeway
                                       facilities with the exception of the southeast portion of the
                                       City. This area, south of Mission Gorge Road and east of
                                       SR-125, supports residential and commercial/industrial
                                       land uses but lacks bikeway facilities.
                                       4.2    Equestrian Trails
                                       Currently there is one designated equestrian trail within the
                                       City of Santee. This segment of trail begins at the Carlton
                                       Hills Blvd bridge at Mast Park, and extends east across the
                                       Mission Creek floodway to Cuyamaca Street. In addition,
                                       there is considerable open space remaining in the City that
                                       can potentially be used for horseback riding. Figure 5-1
                                       contains the potential location of future equestrian trails
                                                                   Santee General Plan

within the City. An opportunity for a more regional linkage would be a future trail linking Santee
with Goodan Ranch and the Mission Trails North property. With the completion of the City of
San Diego’s planned equestrian center in Mission Trails Regional Park, the park itself, with its
55 miles of trails will be a prime destination
4.3      Pedestrian Trails and Pathways
Pedestrian access is currently provided by sidewalks adjacent to City streets, as well as within
designated pedestrian paths that are often shared with bicyclists. The Town Center Specific Plan,
                                              adopted by the City in 1987 to guide the development
                                              of the city center, calls for a series of interconnected
                                              bike and pedestrian paths to link destinations both
                                              within the Town Center itself and also with
                                              destinations outside the own Center. To date, over six
                                              miles of these pathways have been constructed
                                              throughout the Town Center, providing convenient
                                              bicycle and pedestrian links between residential,
                                              commercial and civic uses.
                                              Examples of completed pedestrian paths include the a
                                              Class I path within the San Diego River corridor
                                              adjacent to the Mission Creek development, the Class
                                              I path within the San Remo residential development,
                                              which provides access to Town Center Park and
                                              future Town Center development and combination
pedestrian and bike paths constructed along Town Center Parkway, Cuyamaca Street and
Mission Gorge Road.
Despite the significant amount of open space in the City, there are no designated public access
hiking trails in the City, although easements for future trails have been conditions on recently
approved projects.
5.0      Future Trail Needs
In order to encourage the utilization of alternative and non-motorized forms of transportation
within the community and to expand recreational opportunities, continued development of new
bikeway, equestrian and pedestrian trails is needed. The intent is to establish a comprehensive
system of bike, equestrian and pedestrian trails providing access to commercial centers, schools,
recreation areas, regional trails, and other important activity centers within Santee such as Town
Center.
While portions of the major north-south and east-west trail links in the City are in place, these
trails should be completed. The planned east-west link passes through Town Center, along the
San Diego River and will continue along the river both to the west and east of Town Center. The

The City also benefits from the proximity of three surrounding regional parks, which are
important destinations for residents. The Sycamore Canyon Open Space Preserve is a 1,700-acre
open space preserve that is located along the City’s north boundary in the County of San Diego.
The Goodan Ranch Regional Park is a 325-acre open space park that is located north of the City
and contiguous to the Sycamore Canyon preserve. Mission Trails Regional Park is an
approximately 5,800-acre natural park located west of the City. A portion of the park is located
within the southwesternmost boundary of the City of Santee. The park includes a campground,
and a proposed equestrian staging area near the park’s eastern boundary near the Mast Boulevard
terminus. The parks allow hiking, biking, and equestrian trail riding on 55 miles of trails. The
City should actively pursue coordinated trail connections to existing and proposed trail systems
within these parks.
One of the City’s primary
goals     should     be     the
development of a trail
connection from Santee north
into the Goodan Ranch
Regional Park. This park is
jointly owned and managed
by the City, the State
Department of Fish and
Game, the County of San
Diego and the City of Poway.
There is currently no direct,
legal connection from Santee
to the Park. The City should continue to support efforts to establish a direct link via the
Sycamore Canyon trail on MCAS Miramar, Clark Canyon or through the Sycamore Canyon
Open Space Park. The most likely link will utilize all or a portion of the Stowe Trail, which
                                       passes through Sycamore Canyon and provides a direct
                                       link between Santee and the Goodan Ranch Regional
                                       Park. The historical significance of this trail was reflected
                                       in its recent designation by the federal government as a
                                       Millenium Trail.
                                       The City is also developing a Multiple Species
                                       Conservation Program Subarea Plan which will identify
                                       those areas in the City which will be available for
                                       development and those areas which will remain as open
                                       space for habitat and species preservation. This area will
                                       include an extensive system of existing trails which are
                                       currently on private property and not accessible to most
                                       City residents. Due to the high habitat values in the

preserve, care must be given to locating trails. Existing trails or dirt roads (including utility
access roads) should be used wherever possible and the design and location of any new trails
needs to be carefully considered to avoid adversely impacting the function of the preserve.
Equestrian trails and trailhead facilities will also need careful planning to ensure they are located
a sufficient distance from riparian or other resources where cowbird parasitism could become a
problem. Fencing should also be considered for use in strategic locations to limit off-trail use
and to preclude use of non-sanctioned trails.
As trails of various kinds are developed, a public information program must be implemented in
order to educate the public regarding the availability of the system within Santee.
  6.0      OVERALL GOAL
  The Trails Element shall encourage alternative means of transportation on a

       5.2 Improved Trails Goal (Bicyclists)
       Designate the location and the appropriate type of improved (paved) bicycle trails
       that would have the greatest potential to serve the commuter and recreational
       needs of the commu munity.
    Objective 5.0      To provide paved trails which are safe.
    Policy 5.1 The determination of the appropriate type of paved trail should primarily be
    based upon safety requirements. There are three classifications of bike trails:
         1.    Bicycle paths (Class I) are the safest type of bicycle trail and should, therefore, be
               utilized as much as possible for regional and community trails, but not for those
               designated on small local streets where traffic volume is minimal.
         2.    Bicycle lanes (Class II) are the second safest type of bicycle trail. These should
               be utilized as necessary links to bicycle paths or local routes where paths are not
               feasible.
         3.    Bicycle routes (Class III) are the least safe type of bicycle trail. They should be
               utilized as a last priority for necessary links or as interim links prior to the
               implementation of bicycle paths. When used, they should be signed wherever
               possible.

8.0     Implementation
The successful outcome of the Trails Element depends heavily upon its implementation. In order
to ensure implementation, certain issues need to be addressed. The two most common problems
regarding planning for a trail system are: 1) Where are they going to go?, and 2) Who is going to
pay for them? These basic questions are addressed under the following sections, as are trail
priority, design standards and public information.
8.1   Trail Priority
In order to focus energies effectively, the implementation of trails should be directly related to
the growth and needs of the community and should be coordinated with efforts of neighboring
jurisdictions. In the Trails Element, trails are identified as either "high priority" or "moderate
priority". Ideally, high priority trails should be implemented within the next five years, after
which, moderate trails would then take a "high priority" and be implemented within the
following five to ten years.
While setting objectives within timeframes is important, the classifications are not binding. And,
while regional trails should maintain a high priority, the implementation of the community and
local trails may greatly depend on the level of private development activity. As funding becomes
available, more detailed analysis will be done to determine if a given route is, in fact, feasible at
that time. This more detailed level of analysis may eventually alter various trail priorities.
Therefore, the trail priorities are set here as guidelines for the City, not requirements.
This is also true with the recommended classifications of each proposed trail. It should be
assumed that if a given class of trail is not possible on a particular route, or a portion of a
particular route, the next most desirable type of trail should be developed.
                                  On Major Streets, Collector Streets and Industrial Streets within
                                  Santee, there is generally enough right-of-way for four lanes of
                                  traffic (two lanes on Industrial streets) and either on-street
                                  parking or bicycle lanes, but not both. Therefore, prior to funding
                                  and implementation of a bicycle lane (Class II trail), a decision
                                  must be made by the City as to whether on-street parking or
                                  bicycle lanes are of a greater priority on a given street. Where
                                  additional right-of-way is available, both on-street parking and
                                  bicycle lanes (Class II) or paths (Class I) could coexist, if desired.
                                                                      Santee General Plan
                                                                          Santee, California

TRAILS ELEMENT
In the future, there may be some Major Streets (i.e., Mission Gorge Road, Cuyamaca Street)
which will be expanded to six lanes of traffic. Under such circumstances, neither on-street
parking nor bicycle lanes could exist, unless additional right-of-way were obtained.

TRAILS ELEMENT
Class - It is recommended that this route serve as a Class I Trail (bike path).
14.   Rancho Fanita Drive
This route connects Mission Gorge Road to Mesa Road.
Class - It is recommended that this route serve as a Class III trail (bike route) from Mission
Gorge Road to Big Rock Road and a Class I trail (bike path) from Big Rock Road to Mesa Road.
Equestrian Trails
Equestrian trails are considerably more difficult to locate within an urbanized area than are
bicycle trails, primarily because horses are normally not compatible with automobiles. Also,
equestrian trails need a specific starting point and ending point, and these points must have some
type of facilities for horses. Additionally, horse manure attracts cowbirds which parasitize the
nests of protected bird species such as the Least Bells Vireo. As a result, the location of
equestrian trails and trailhead facilities must be located in areas where cowbird parasitism would
not be a problem.
Due to these constraints, there are a limited number of equestrian trails proposed for the City and
even these routes will need further feasibility studies. The two primary areas which are suitable
for an equestrian trail system are along the San Diego River and possibly within the Fanita
Ranch.
High Priority
1.    San Diego River Route
The San Diego River route serves as an open space linear corridor which extends from the City
of San Diego to Lakeside. Bisecting the City, the route functions as a primary east-west regional
corridor which includes a continuous path along the north side of the River. Not only does the
route serve as a regional link, it also provides direct access within the City between focal points
such as Town Center and Mast Park.
2.    Mission Trails / Goodan Ranch Route
While the exact alignment of this future route is not known at
present, the City should place a high priority on working with
other jurisdictions and the military to secure a trail connection
linking Mission Trails Regional Park with the Goodan Ranch,
Sycamore Canyon Open Space Preserve and the future Mission
Trails North properties. The City shall work to establish all
reasonable necessary linkages through the City that are
necessary to make viable trail connections.

Other Areas
Town Center Specific Plan Area - The Town Center Specific Plan was adopted in 1986 and
contains extensive trail systems for bicycle, pedestrian and equestrian users. Except for routes
along the San Diego River, Cuyamaca Street and Cottonwood Avenue, no trails are proposed in
this Element for the Town Center area. This area is master planned through the Town Center
Specific Plan, which contains a comprehensive trail system which links destinations within the
Town Center area as well as connecting to the planned trail network in the rest of the City.
Multiple Species Conservation Program
Subarea Plan area - Once adopted, this
planned preserve area will cover one-
quarter of the City, including areas
within the Fanita Ranch, along the San
Diego River and other areas discussed
separately in this Element. The majority
of the land within the City’s preserve
plan is under private ownership and is
not currently accessible to City
residents. The preserve will be
established incrementally and presents
an opportunity to provide access to an
extensive system of existing unimproved trails. While some of the trail system in the preserve,
such as the portion within the Fanita Ranch, will be planned as part of development, much of the
remaining system will be established as preserve lands are acquired. The City should place a
priority on using existing trail alignments in the preserve to minimize impacts to existing
landforms and habitat. Establishment of a trail system in the preserve will be consistent with the
City’s Multiple Species Conservation Program Subarea Plan and Implementing Agreement.
                                                  Fanita Ranch - The Fanita Ranch will contain
                                                  an extensive trail system. Except for a route
                                                  along Cuyamaca Street, no trails are proposed
                                                  in this Element for Fanita Ranch, although
                                                  future connections to trails within the Ranch
                                                  are established. This area will be master
                                                  planned and it is intended that when the plan is
                                                  adopted it will contain its own trail system that
                                                  will integrate with planned trails in the rest of
                                                  the City. The Trails Element may be amended
                                                  at the time of master plan adoption to reflect
the added trails within Fanita Ranch. Provision of a trails system is one of the “Essential
Elements” for the Fanita Ranch discussed in the Land Use Element.

TRAILS ELEMENT
East Camp Elliot Prezone Area - The East Camp Elliot Prezone Area along the City’s western
border is a key for establishing future regional trail connections between Mission Trails Regional
Park and the Fanita Ranch, and Goodan Ranch Regional Park, Sycamore Canyon Open Space
Preserve and the planned Mission Trails Park North property. These linkages, which include
portions of the Stowe Trail, should be considered and protected as part of the development or
preservation of this property.
8.2     Trail Implementation
There are three primary types of costs associated with trails: feasibility study costs,
implementation costs, and maintenance costs. A feasibility study is particularly important when
there are a number of opportunities and/or constraints associated with a trail under consideration.
Implementation includes, but is not limited to, the acquisition of the land, the construction of the
trail, and the provisions of equipment which accommodates the trail user, such as bicycle racks
or hitching posts for horses. Maintenance costs reflect long-term expenses of keeping trails and
associated improvements, such as fencing and trailhead facilities, safe and usable.
Feasibility Study Costs - Depending on the complexity of the designated trail, the costs
associated with the feasibility study may vary from almost nothing to thousands of dollars. The
costs include City staff time or consultant time spent researching ownership, safety,
environmental constraints, and design standards. In 1989 the City completed a comprehensive
Bike and Trail Study Engineering Report which included detailed design standards and cost
estimates for the City’s trail system. The City should periodically update the study to reflect
changes in the planned trail system and to update cost estimates to maintain its value as an
implementation tool.
Implementation Costs - Some of the trails have been designated on privately owned vacant land.
In these areas, the City would not normally need to acquire the land. The construction costs
would be assumed by the property owner or the developer as a condition of development of the
property.
The City would need to pay for implementation costs where trails are designated on: 1) public
property or utility and drainage easements, 2) private property which is already developed, 3)
undeveloped private property which is unlikely to ever be developed, and 4) undeveloped private
property which is unlikely to be developed within the time frame the City wishes to implement a
specific trail.
There are two basic ways for the City to attain trail rights-of-way. First, and most preferably, the
City may require, as a condition of development, easements or dedications for trails. Secondly,
the City may purchase fee title land for trails from private property owners. The first alternative
is preferable because the City can attain right-of-way without cost and can even require the
private developer to improve and maintain the portion of the trail system on his property.

                                                                  TRAILS ELEMENT
Maintenance Costs - Maintenance costs will vary depending on the location and type of trail.
Maintenance includes clean up, resurfacing, and structural repairs. The costs of clean up may be
kept to a minimum by using available manpower such as youth organizations, service clubs,
school groups, California Conversation Corps, and court referrals.
While man power may be available at a low cost, costs are also attached to the supervision of the
work. The maintenance of the trails will normally be the responsibility of the City. The costs
will be paid for by the City and possibly partially covered by maintenance assessment districts.
The City may also require private entities to maintain portions of trails that are dedicated on their
property. Typically, this option would only be feasible if the trail passes through an area that will
be maintained as open space by a private land management entity. In such a situation,
maintenance of the trail could be required of the landowner as a condition of development.
8.3    Funding
Apart from requiring property owners to construct trails at the time of development of their
property, there are a number of sources of possible funding available for bicycle trails and for
hiking and riding trails. The City should actively pursue all these funding sources for the timely
implementation of a City-wide trails system.

8.4    Public Information
As a comprehensive trails system is developed in Santee, providing the public with information
about the system is of prime importance in insuring the most effective use of the system. The
following are guidelines to implement a public information program:
1.   Use of the City Newsletter and website to publicize the trails system.
2.   Post information regarding the system (maps, etc.) at schools, parks and other points of
     congregation throughout the City.
3.   Encourage the local media to spotlight the developing trails system within Santee.
4.   Sponsor or coordinate bike rallies, mini-marathons, and equestrian events throughout the
     City using the trails system.

Section 1
Introduction
A.        Purpose and Content of Housing Element
The Housing Element of the General Plan is designed to provide the City with a coordinated
and comprehensive strategy for promoting the production of safe, decent, and affordable
housing within the community. California Government Code Section 65580 states the intent of
creating housing elements:
    The availabili(y ef hot1sing is ef vital statewide importance, and the ear!J attainment ef decent housing
    and a sttitable living environmmt for every Californian, including far7Jlworkers, is a priori(}! ef the
    highest order.
Per State law, the Housing Element has two main purposes:
    (1) To provide an assessment of both current and future housing needs and constraints in
        meeting these needs; and
    (2) To provide a strategy that establishes housing goals, policies, and programs.
The Housing Element is an eight-year plan for the 2013-2021 period. The Housing Element
serves as an integrated part of the General Plan, but is updated more frequently to ensure its
relevancy and accuracy. The Housing Element identifies strategies and programs that focus on:
    (1) Matching housing supply with need;
    (2) Maximizing housing choice throughout the community;
    (3) Assisting in the provision of affordable housing;
    (4) Removing governmental and other constraints to housing investment; and
    (5) Promoting fair and equal housing opportunities.
The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
    •   A profile and analysis of the City's demographics, housing characteristics, and existing
        and future housing needs (Section 2, Community Profile);
    •   A review of the constraints to housing production and preservation. Constraints include
        potential market, governmental, policy, and environmental limitations to meeting the
        City's identified housing needs (Section 3, Housing Constraints);
    •   An assessment of resources available to meet the City's objectives regarding housing
        production and preservation. Resources include land available for new construction and
        redevelopment, as well as financial and administrative resources available (Section 4,
        Housing Resources);
                                                                                                        Page 1 - 1

City of Santee Ilousing Element
     •   A summary of program accomplishments under the 2005-2012 Housing Element
         (Section 5, Summary of Program Accomplishments); and
     •   A statement of the Housing Plan to address the City's identified housing needs,
         including housing goals, policies and programs (Section 6, Housing Plan).
B.         State Requirements
State law requires housing elements to be updated periodically to reflect a community's changing
housing needs. A critical measure of compliance with the State Housing Element Law is the
ability of a jurisdiction to accommodate its share of the regional housing needs - Regional
Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). For the San Diego region, the regional growth projected
by the State was for the period between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2020. Therefore,
while the Housing Element is an eight year document covering April 30, 2013 to April 30, 2021,
the City has eleven years Ganuary 1, 2010 to December 31, 2020) to accommodate the RHNA.
The City's RHNA and resources available to meet the RHNA are discussed in Section 4,
Housing Resources.
C.         Data Sources and Methodology
In preparing the Housing Element, various sources of information were consulted. Wherever
possible, Census 2000 and Census 2010 data provided the baseline for all demographic
information. Additional sources provided reliable updates to Census data. These include
housing market data from DataQuick, employment data from the Employment Development
Department, lending data from financial institutions provided under the Home Mortgage
Disclosure Act (HMDA), and the most recent data available from service agencies and other
governmental agencies, including a comprehensive Housing Element Data Package obtained
from the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) in April 2012.
The RHNA is based, in part, upon the growth that the SANDAG has estimated for the City of
Santee in its 2050 Regional Growth Forecast. This forecast was prepared in 2010 and is based
on current adopted land use plans and policies. SANDAG forecasts that Santee will grow to
72,554 residents and 22,312 housing units by 2050.
D.           Public Participation
The State Department of Housing and Community development (HCD) requires jurisdictions to
make a diligent effort to achieve public participation of all economic populations during the
Housing Element update. The City was diligent with its efforts to achieve public participation in
the development and adoption of the Housing Element.
As part of the Housing Element update process, the City held two Housing Element workshops.
On January 30, 2012, and February 28, 2012, the City held public workshops for residents and
housing, public and social service providers to solicit input regarding the community's housing
needs. In addition to publishing a public notice in the newspaper, the workshops were posted

                                                                                 Introduction
on the City's website, and special invitations were sent by email to service providers and
community stakeholders to elicit participation by groups that represent the interests and
concerns of lower and moderate income persons and persons with special needs. A list of
agencies and organizations that received invitations is included in Appendix A to this Housing
Element. The February 28 meeting was also posted to the City's official Twitter feed and
publicized in a story in the Santee Review, an online source of community news. The January 30
workshop was attended by one person, and the February 28 workshop was attended by one
person.
Input at the January 30 workshop was provided by a staff member from the San Diego Housing
Federation, who provided information on "best practices" to follow during preparation of the
Housing Element. The sole attendee at the February 28 workshop was a staff member from the
City of El Cajon who was there to learn about Santee's process; not to provide comment.
The City also held a public workshop on November 14, 2012 and a public hearing on January 9,
2013, both pertaining to designating properties for the provision of adequate land to
accommodate the housing needs of the lower income households. In addition to the three
public workshops and one public hearing, staff directly solicited additional input from certain
housing advocacy organizations separately, and published a housing element survey, which
received 41 responses. The organizations contacted in this second stage of outreach are listed in
Appendix A, which also includes a summary of anonymous survey responses.
Comments received in response to the above outreach efforts were used to help establish goals,
objectives, policies, and programs in this Housing Element. Section 4, Housing Resources of
this Housing Element identifies capacity to accommodate the City's remaining share of the
RHNA for lower income households.
A public hearing will be held before the City Council prior to adoption of the Housing Element.
E.          General Plan Consistency
The City of Santee General Plan 2020 was adopted on August 23, 2003 and is comprised of the
following nine elements: Land Use; Housing; Circulation; Recreation; Trails; Conservation;
Noise; Safety; and Community Enhancement. The Housing Element is being updated at this
time in conformance ,vith the 2013-2021 update cycle for jurisdictions in the SANDAG region
and has been reviewed with the rest of the General Plan to ensure internal consistency. As
portions of the General Plan are amended in the future, the Plan (including the Housing
Element) will be reviewed to ensure that internal consistency is maintained.
New State law requires that the Safety and Conservation Elements include an analysis and
policies regarding flood hazard and management information upon revisions to the Housing
Element. The City will ensure compliance with this requirement by reviewing its Safety and
Conservation Elements.
                                                                                        Page 1 - 3

Section 2
Community Profile
The City of Santee incorporated in 1980. Santee is an urbanized community developed primarily in
the 1970s and 1980s. Located in the eastern part of the San Diego metropolitan area, Santee is
bordered by El Cajon on the south and southeast, the City of San Diego on the west and northwest,
and the County of San Diego on east and northeast.
Most of the City's residentially zoned land has already been developed with a diversity of housing
types, including single-family homes, mobile home parks, townhomes, condominiums and
apartments. However, several hundred acres designated Planned Development District and in the
Town Center District remain undeveloped and available for future housing development. The
Villages at Fanita, an approved development of 2,600 acres in northern Santee, will include single-
family residential neighborhoods, parklands, a natural preserve, and supporting commercial and
mixed-use facilities in a village center. The residential portion of the project will consist of
approximately 1,380 single-family dwelling units and 15 live/work units in accordance with the
General Plan.
A.      Population Characteristics and Trends
The following section describes and analyzes the various population characteristics and trends in
Santee that affect housing need.
1.      POPULATION GROWfH
According to the Census, Santee's population rose slightly from 53,090 in 2000 to 53,413 in 2010
(fable 2-1 on page 2-2). Contributing to the low population growth was the removal of hundreds
of homes to provide right-of-way for the extensions of two freeways through the southern portion
of the City. State Route 52 was constructed south of Mission Gorge Road through to State Route
67, and State Route 125 parallels Fanita Drive, terminating at Mission Gorge Road. These
extensions, while necessary for the full development of the City, resulted in the loss of hundreds of
dwelling units.
The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) forecasts that the Santee population will
reach 64,551 by the year 2020. This represents a growth rate of over 17 percent, or approximately
11,138 people. Although this population increase seems quite rapid, the ability to accommodate this
many residents in such a short time already exists within the current General Plan and Zoning Map.
Existing vacant and underdeveloped land and projects already approved/proposed represent the
capacity to accommodate this need.

2.       AGE COMPOSITION
The age structure of a population is also an important factor in evaluating housing and community
development needs and determining the direction of future housing development. Typically, each
age group has distinct lifestyles, family types and sizes, incomes, and housing preferences. As people
move through each stage of life, housing needs and preferences change. For example, young
householders without children will have different housing preferences than middle-age householders
with children or senior householders living alone. Consequently, evaluating the age characteristics
of a community is important in determining the housing needs of residents.
Santee's population is, as measured by the median age of its residents, slightly older than in
neighboring communities and the County as a whole. In 2010, Santee's median age was 37.2 years,
while the County's median age was 34.6. The proportion of residents aged 65+ in Santee (11
percent) was tied for lowest among its neighbors, but has risen significantly in the past 10 years (see
Figure 2-1 on page 2-3). The proportion of residents under 18 was the third highest among si..x
neighboring jurisdictions (Table 2-2).

      Source: Census, 2000 and 2010.
As shown in Table 2-2, a shift in the ages of Santee residents occurred between 2000 and 2010.
Due to Santee's relatively flat population change in the last decade, these changes in age structure
represent a significant change in the age composition of Santee, which could affect the housing
needs of Santee residents during the planning period.
Page 2-2
                                                                                             Profile
For example, from 2000 to 2010, the proportion of Santee residents under the age of 18 declined
dramatically, from 30 percent to 24 percent. This is a reversal of the trend from 1990 to 2000, when
this age group increased slightly as a proportion of the population.
Also apparent is an increase in the share of City residents over the age of 65. From 2000 to 2010,
the proportion of Santee residents over 65 increased from nine percent to 11 percent. This trend
has been taking place since 1990, when only eight percent of Santee residents were 65+.
An increase in residents aged 18-64 has also taken place in the last decade, with this age group
increasing from 61 percent to 66 percent of the population. Leading this change are residents aged
20-29 (14 percent increase) and those aged 40-64 (32 percent increase). As a result, Santee's median
age rose by more than two years between 2000 and 2010. These changes match the general trends
seen in San Diego County in the past 10 years, but they are more pronounced in Santee.
The City is committed to expanding affordable housing opportunities within Santee for households
of all ages. Santee's First-Time Homebuyer Program (Section 6, Program 7) provides assistance to
lower income first-time homebuyers. The First-Time Homebuyer Program may be used in
conjunction with the San Diego County Regional Mortgage Credit Certificate Program (Section 6,
Program 8), which authorizes income-qualified first-time homebuyers to take a credit against
federal income taxes of up to 20 percent of the annual mortgage interest paid. The City can also
collaborate with, and offer regulatory incentives and concessions to, developers to facilitate the
construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable housing units (Section 6, Program 10).

3.        RACE AND ETHNICITY
Different racial and ethnic groups often have different household characteristics, income levels, and
cultural backgrounds, which may affect their housing needs and preferences. Studies have also
suggested that different racial and ethnic groups differ in their attitudes toward and/ or tolerance for
"housing problems" as defined by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD), including overcrowding and housing cost burden. 1 According to these studies, perceptions
regarding housing density and overcrowding tend to vary between racial and ethnic groups.
Especially within cultures that prefer to live with extended family members, household size and
overcrowding also tend to increase. In general, Hispanic and Asian households exhibit a greater
propensity than White households for living in extended families.
The racial composition of Santee residents in 2010 was 74 percent White, four percent Asian, two
percent Black, four percent for those who declared more than one race, and less than once percent
for American Indian/ Alaskan and Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander (Figure 2-2). In the 2010 Census,
Hispanic descent was not considered a race, it was considered an ethnicity. A person can be of any
race and be Hispanic. Approximately 16 percent of Santee residents considered themselves
Hispanic in 2010 (Table 2-3).

 Santee has a substantially larger proportion of White residents and smaller proportion of
 Hispanic/Latino residents compared to neighboring jurisdictions and the County as a whole (Table

 Figure 2-3 on page 2-6 shows the distribution of minority populations in Santee. Minority
 individuals comprise between 10 and 14 percent of the population in most Census tracts in the City.
 However, there are a few tracts in the northern and western portions of the community with less
 than 10 percent minority, and two tracts in the center and southern portions of the City where
 minorities are concentrated (>20 percent of tract population).

B. Employment Proftle
An assessment of the needs of the community must take into consideration the type of employment
held by City residents. Incomes associated with different jobs and the number of workers in a
household determines the type and size of housing a household can afford. In some cases, the types
of jobs themselves can affect housing needs and demand (such as in communities with military
installations, college campuses, and seasonal agriculture). Employment growth typically leads to
strong housing demand, while the reverse is true when employment contracts.
1.         OCCUPATION AND LABOR PARTICIPATION
The U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) provides information about
employment, specifically the number of City residents by industry type, who are employed by
businesses either outside or within their community. 2 As of 2010, Educational Services/Health Care
and Retail Trade were the two largest occupational categories for City residents (fable 2-5). These
categories account for almost 35 percent of the jobs held by employed residents. Similarly, these
categories accounted for 31 percent of jobs held County residents. The proportion of City residents
in all other occupations was roughly similar to the occupation profile of County residents, with a
higher proportion of Santee residents being employed in construction and retail, and a lower
proportion being employed in professional, scientific, and management.

C.       Household Characteristics
The Census defines a household as all persons who occupy a housing unit, which may include single
persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood, and unrelated individuals living
together. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes, dormitories, or other group living
situations are not considered households. Information on household characteristics is important to
understand the growth and changing needs of a community.
1.       HOUSEHOLD TYPE
According to the Census, 19,306 households lived in Santee in 2010. Of these households, 21
percent were single-person households, an increase of more than two percentage points since the
last Census, and households headed by seniors (65+) comprised 19 percent, an increase of nearly
three percentage points since the last Census. Single-person households represented a lower
proportion of Santee's households than in neighboring jurisdictions and countywide. Conversely, 37
percent of Santee households consisted of families with children, a much larger proportion than

Different household types generally have different housing needs. Seniors or young adults typically
comprise the majority of single-person households and tend to reside in apartment units,
condominiums, or smaller single-family homes. Families often prefer single-family homes. Santee's
housing stock provides a range of unit types to meet the needs of its residents (fable 2-12 in
Section E.1 starting on page 2-18). Roughly, 64 percent of the City's housing stock is comprised of
single-family units, while approximately 24 percent of the units consist of multifamily units such as
apartments and condominiums.
2.        HOUSEHOLD SIZE
Household size identifies sources of population growth and household overcrowding. A city's
average household size will increase over time if there is a trend towards larger families. In
communities where the population is aging, the average household size may decline. The average
household size in Santee in 2010 was 2. 72, a decline from the 2.82 of the previous Census, and
slightly lower than the County as a whole (2.75) (Figure 2-4).

4.        OVERCROWDING
An overcrowded housing unit is defined as a unit occupied by more than one person per room. 3
Overcrowding can result when there are not enough adequately sized units within a community,
when high housing costs relative to income force too many individuals to share a housing unit than
it can adequately accommodate, and/ or when families reside in smaller units than they need to
devote income to other necessities, such as food and health care. Overcrowding also tends to
accelerate deterioration of housing. Therefore, maintaining a reasonable level of occupancy and
alleviating overcrowding are critical to enhancing quality of life for residents and aesthetic quality of
neighborhoods.
According to the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), roughly two percent of
Santee households experienced overcrowded living conditions in 2008, the latest year for which data
are available from HUD. Of these, 45 percent were in owner-occupied households, and 55 percent
were renters. This suggests that renters are disproportionately affected by overcrowding - as of
2010, only 29 percent of the households in Santee were renter-occupied, but they represent 55
percent of all overcrowded households.
This pattern often suggests an inadequate supply of larger rental units. While over 60 percent of
occupied housing units in the City had more than three bedrooms (the minimum size considered
large enough to avoid most overcrowding issues for large households), only 17 percent of these
units were occupied by renters.
In 2001, the City committed substantial redevelopment housing set-aside funds to rehabilitate the
Shadow Hills Apartment complex on Woodside Avenue. The project, completed in 2003, included
the substantial rehabilitation of 60 units and the construction of 22 new three-bedroom units. This
project resulted in the conversion of six two-bedroom units to three-bedroom units. The Cedar
Creek and Forester Square affordable housing developments, constructed in 2010 and 2013
(respectively), include a combined 38 three-bedroom units and represent 41 percent of units
constructed in these two projects. The City will collaborate ,vith, and offer regulatory incentives and
concessions to, developers to facilitate the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of
affordable housing units (Section 6, Program 10).
While a portion of overcrowding problems is likely attributable to a lack of larger housing units
available for rent, analysis of another housing problem, overpayment, reveals that the incidence of
overcrowding is also caused by a high ratio of housing costs to income, potentially forcing families
to take on additional roommates to devote income to other basic needs. However, with the
dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency and diminishing federal and State housing funds, the
City's ability to expand affordable housing opportunities in the community is seriously
compromised.

5.      OVERPAYMENT
State and federal standards for housing cost burden (overpayment) are based on an income-to-
housing cost ratio of 30 percent and above. Households paying more than 30 percent of their
income on housing have limited remaining income for other necessities. Upper income households
generally are capable of paying a larger proportion of income for housing; therefore, estimates of
housing cost burden generally focus on lower and moderate income households.
According to the CHAS data, 44 percent of Santee households overpaid for housing in 2008 and
housing cost burden affected a larger proportion of homeowners (44 percent) than renters (41
percent). By contrast, housing cost burden affected only 34 percent of households in 2000 and the
incidence of overpayment was greatest among renters (37 percent) when compared to homeowners
(33 percent). Overpayment affected a majority of lower and moderate income households in 2008
regardless of tenure; however, the incidence of overpayment was greatest among very low income
homeowners (88 percent) and very low income renters (75 percent) (Figure 2-6). A high prevalence
of overcrowding amongst lower income households suggests households may be attempting to
mitigate overpayment problems by taking in additional roommates or occupying smaller and
presumably cheaper units.

The City of Santee implements a variety of programs aimed to relieve overpayment. Income-
qualified first-time homebuyers are assisted through the First Time Homebuyer Program (Section 6,
Program 7) and San Diego County Regional Mortgage Credit Certificate Program (Section 6,
Program 8). Short-term space leases in mobile home parks are regulated through the Manufactured
Home Fair Practices Program (Section 6, Program 9).

D. Special Needs Populations
Certain segments of the population may have more difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing
due to their special needs. Special circumstances may be related to one's employment and income,
family characteristics, disability, and household characteristics, among other factors. Consequently,
certain residents in Santee may experience a higher prevalence of housing overpayment (cost
burden), overcrowding, or other housing problems.
"Special needs" groups include the following: senior households, single-parent households, large
households, persons with disabilities, agricultural workers, students, and homeless (Table 2-9). This
section provides a detailed discussion of the housing needs facing each particular group as well as
programs and services available to address their housing needs.

1.        SENIOR HEADED HOUSEHOLDS
Many senior-headed households have special needs due to their relatively low incomes, disabilities or
limitations, and dependency needs. The population over 65 years of age is considered senior and
has four main concerns: limited and often fixed income; poor health and associated high health care
costs; mobility limitation and transit dependency; and high costs of housing.
From 2009-2011, seniors (age 65+) comprised 11 percent of Santee residents and 19 percent of
households were headed by seniors. Of these households, the majority (85 percent) owned their
homes, while the remainder (15 percent) rented.
Aside from overpayment problems faced by seniors due to their relatively fixed incomes, many
seniors are faced with various disabilities. Roughly, 40 percent of Santee's senior population was
reported as having one or more disabilities between 2009 and 2011 by the ACS. The need for senior
housing can be expected to increase in Santee due to the changing demographics of the population.
 It will therefore be particularly important for the City to encourage and facilitate the development of
 housing that is affordable to seniors.

and disabled mobile home park residents annually. This program was funded by redevelopment
money that is no longer available to local jurisdictions; however, the City remains committed to
finding additional ways to assist seniors. In January 2013, the City updated the Zoning Ordinance to
accommodate single room occupancy (SRO) buildings in multifamily zones with approval of a
Development Review Permit. SRO buildings can be a source of affordable housing for lower
income seniors, including extremely low income seniors. The City will collaborate with, and offer
incentives and regulatory concessions to, developers to facilitate the construction or acquisition and
rehabilitation of housing for seniors (Section 6, Program 10). The City will also continue to fund
agencies that provide supportive services, including agencies that provide meals and case
management services to the elderly (Section 6, Program 11).
2.      SINGLE-PARENT HOUSEHOLDS
Single-parent households require special consideration and assistance because of their greater need
for day care, health care, and other facilities. Female-headed households with children in particular
tend to have lower incomes, thus limiting housing availability for this group.
According to the 2009-2011 ACS, approximately nine percent of Santee households were headed by
single parents, down from 11 percent in 2000. The large majority of these, 86 percent, were headed
by females. According to the 2006-2010 ACS, 15 percent of single-parent households had incomes
below the poverty level; 90 percent of those households were headed by women.
City efforts to expand affordable housing opportunities will help meet the needs of single-parent
households. The City will collaborate with, and offer incentives and regulatory concessions to,
developers to facilitate the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable housing
(Section 6, Program 10). The City will also continue to fund agencies that provide supportive
services, including agencies that provide temporary shelter, food, and clothing to single-parent
households that may be displaced due to domestic violence (Section 6, Program 11).
3.      LARGE HOUSEHOLDS
Large households (with five or more members) are identified as a group with special housing needs
based on the limited availability of adequately sized, affordable housing units. Large households are
often of lower income, frequently resulting in the overcrowding of smaller dwelling units and in
turn, accelerating unit deterioration.
Almost 11 percent of Santee households were classified as "large households" by the 2009-2011
ACS. About 30 percent of those households rented the units they occupied. The housing needs of
larger households are typically met through larger units. While 22 percent of occupied housing units
in the City had four or more bedrooms, only a small portion of these units (13 percent) were
occupied by renters. Since only 11 percent of Santee's households are large households, Santee's
housing stock should be adequate to meet the needs of larger households. However, lower income
large renter households may have greater difficulty securing adequately-sized units than other large
renter households.

                                                                                                           Profile
The City recently approved two t:ownhome projects with a total of 40 units. Each unit has three or
more bedrooms and, based on sales data from the developers, most of the units were sold at prices
affordable to moderate income households. Redevelopment: of the Shadow Hills Apartment:
complex in 2001-2002 resulted in the construction of 22 new three-bedroom units and the
conversion of six two-bedroom units to three-bedroom units. The Cedar Creek and Forester Square
affordable housing developments, constructed in 2010 and 2013 (respectively), include a combined
38 three-bedroom units, which represents 41 percent: of units constructed in these two projects.
The City will collaborate with, and offer incentives and regulatory concessions to, developers to
facilitate the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable housing (Section 6,
Program 10).
4.        PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Disability is a physical, mental, or developmental condition that substantially limits one or more
major life activity. Disabilities can hinder access to housing units of conventional design, as well as
limit the ability to earn adequate income. The 2009-2011 ACS estimated that 11 percent: of Sant:ee's
population over five years of age had a disability. The ACS also tallied the number of disabilities by
type for residents with one or more disabilities; a person may have more than one disability. Among
the disabilities tallied, 36 percent involved difficulty hearing, 21 reported cognitive difficulty, 15
percent: were ambulatory disabilities, 15 percent: made independent: living difficult:, eight percent
limited self-care ability, and five percent involved visual difficulty.
Four factors - affordability, design, location and discrimination - significantly limit the supply of
housing available to households of persons with disabilities. The most obvious housing need for
persons with disabilities is housing that is adapted to their needs. Most single-family homes are
inaccessible to people with mobility and sensory limitations. Housing may not be adaptable to
widened doorways and hallways, access ramps, larger bathrooms, lowered count:ert:ops and other
features necessary for accessibility. The cost of retrofitting a home often prohibits homeownership,
even for individuals or families who could otherwise afford a home. Furthermore, some providers
of basic homebuying services do not have offices or materials that are accessible to people with
mobility, visual or hearing impairments.
Location of housing is also an important: factor for many persons with disabilities, as they often rely
upon public transportation. Furthermore, the 2011 San Diego Regional Analysis of Impediments to
Fair Housing Choice concluded: "Discrimination against: people with disabilities has become an
increasing fair housing concern ... " and "Housing choices for persons ,vith disabilities are limited" in
the San Diego region. 4
Services for persons with disabilities are typically provided by both public and private agencies.
State and federal legislation regulate the accessibility and adaptability of new or rehabilitated
multifamily apartment: complexes to ensure accommodation for individuals with limited physical
mobility. The City provides CDBG funds to non-profit organizations that provide home
improvement: and repair services to lower income households, including ADA improvements
(Section 6, Program 3). Furthermore, the City updated the Zoning Ordinance in January 2013 to
     San Diego Fair Housing Resources Board, San Diego Regional Anafysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice, March
     2011.
                                                                                                            Page 2-15

PERSONS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES
A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element discuss the housing needs of
persons with developmental disabilities. As defined by federal law, "developmental disability"
means a severe, chronic disability of an individual that:
     •    Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical
          impairments;
     •    Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
     •    Is likely to continue indefinitely;
     •    Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major
          life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-
          direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic self-sufficiency; and
     •    Reflects the individual's need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or
          generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong or
          extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated.
The Census does not collect or report statistics for developmental disabilities and no other source is
known to have this data for Santee. According to the State's Department of Developmental
Services, as of November 2012, approximately 460 Santee residents with developmental disabilities
were being assisted at the Developmental Center and Regional Center in San Diego. Most of these
individuals were residing in a private home with their parent or guardian and 156 of these persons
with developmental disabilities were under the age of 18.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional
housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where
 supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional
 environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental
 disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally
 disabled is the transition from the person's living situation as a child to an appropriate level of
independence as an adult.
 5.       AGRICULTURAL WORKERS
Agricultural workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
 permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farm laborers work in the fields, processing
 plants, or support activities on a generally year-round basis. When workload increases during
 harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal labor, often supplied by a labor
 contractor. For some crops, farms may employ migrant workers, defined as those whose travel
 distance to work prevents them from returning to their primary residence every evening.
 Determining the true size of the agricultural labor force is problematic. For instance, the
 government agencies that track farm labor do not consistently define farm-workers (e.g. field
 Page 2-16

                                                                                                Profile
laborers versus workers in processing plants), length of employment (e.g. permanent or seasonal), or
place of work (e.g. the location of the business or field). Further limiting the ability to ascertain the
number of agricultural workers within Santee is the limited data available on the City due to its
relatively small size.
According to the 2009-2011 ACS, no residents of Santee residents were employed in farming,
forestry, or fishing occupations. Santee is an urbanized community with no undeveloped parcels
zoned for agriculture as a principal use; however, some residential zones allow a range of agriculture
and related uses. Although the most recent available employment data available from the U.S.
Census Bureau indicated that no Santee residents were employed in farming, fishing, and forestry
occupations and there is little potential for this occupational category to expand within Santee, the
Housing Element includes a program to evaluate provisions for farm worker housing consistent
with State law (Section 6, Program 15).
6.       STUDENTS
Santee is in relatively close proX11nlty to Grossmont Community College and San Diego State
University. Approximately nine percent of Santee residents were enrolled in college between 2009
and 2011, which is slightly lower than the proportion of college students countywide (10 percent).
San Diego State University is the largest university in the San Diego region, with approximately
30,000 students. The university provides housing for an estimated 10 percent of enrolled students.
Typically, students have lower incomes and therefore can be impacted by a lack of affordable
housing. Overcrowding within this special needs group is a common concern.
Many State and federal programs are not available to students. However, City housing programs
designed to expand affordable rental housing opportunities in the City, such as SRO buildings, may
help expand housing options for students.
7.       HOMELESS
According to HUD, a person is considered homeless if he/she is not imprisoned and:
     1) Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence;
     2) The primary nighttime residence is a publicly or privately operated shelter designed for
         temporary living arrangements;
     3) The primary residence is an institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals
         that should otherwise be institutionalized; or
     4) The primary residence is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily used as a
         regular sleeping accommodation.
Assessing a region's homeless population is difficult because of the transient nature of the
population. San Diego County's leading authority on the region's homeless population is the
Regional Task Force on the Homeless. Based on information provided by individual jurisdictions,
the majority of the region's homeless is estimated to be in the urban areas, but a sizeable number of
homeless persons make their temporary residence in rural areas (fable 2-10 on page 2-18). RTFH
estimates that all of Santee's homeless population (26 people) was unsheltered in 2012.
                                                                                                 Page 2-17

Homelessness is a regional issue that requires the coordination among regional agencies. Santee is
part of the San Diego County Continuum of Care Consortium that covers the unincorporated
County and all incorporated cities with the exception of the City of San Diego.
The City's Supportive Services Program provides CDBG funds to homeless service providers to
meet the immediate needs of homeless or near homeless in Santee (Section 6, Program 11).
Services include the provision of food, temporary shelter, health care, and other social services. The
City's Zoning Ordinance was amended in January 2013 to update the requirements for emergency
shelters and transitional housing pursuant to SB 2. The City has identified more than seven acres on
eight parcels on Woodside Avenue within the General Industrial "IG" zoning designation where
emergency shelters could be sited with ministerial permit approval. Transitional housing is allowed in
all residential zones.
E. Housing Stock Characteristics
A community's housing stock is defined as the collection of all housing units located within the
jurisdiction. The characteristics of the housing stock, including growth, type, age and condition,
tenure, vacancy rates, costs, and affordability are important in determining the housing needs for the
community. This section details the housing stock characteristics of Santee in an attempt to identify
how well the current housing stock meets the needs of current and future residents of the City.
1.        HOUSING UNIT GROWfH AND TYPE
Santee has experienced steady housing growth since 2000. The City's housing stock grew from
18,883 units in 2000 to an estimated 20,299 units as of January 2012, or approximately 7.8 percent
(fable 2-11 on page 2-19). The City's housing growth out-paced that of nearby East County
neighbors El Cajon and La Mesa since 2000 despite the demolition of over 650 Santee homes due to
the CalTrans extensions of State Routes 125 and 52.

Santee maintains a diverse housing stock. In 2012, single-family homes comprised 64 percent of the
housing stock, while multifamily units comprised 24 percent, and 11 percent of the housing stock
consisted of mobile homes (see Table 2-12 and Figure 2-7). Compared to surrounding
communities, the City had a larger proportion of mobile homes.

2.       HOUSING AGE AND CONDITION
Housing that is 30 years or older is assumed to require some rehabilitation. Such features as
electrical capacity, kitchen features, and roofs, usually need updating if no prior replacement work
has occurred. Santee's housing stock is older than the County's; 85 percent of the City's housing
stock was constructed prior to 1990, while only 76 percent of the County's housing stock is more
than 22 years old (Figure 2-8). Therefore, more than four out of every five existing housing units in
Santee will be older than 30 years and of sufficient age to be susceptible to deterioration, requiring
maintenance or rehabilitation by the end of this planning period (2021).

The City's Code Enforcement Officer surveyed residential properties in May 2007 and identified 63
substandard or dilapidated homes in need of substantial rehabilitation. Another five homes were
identified as dangerous and in need of demolition and replacement. The City estimates that the
number of substandard, dilapidated, or dangerous homes in the City has not changed significantly
since 2007. Although some of the homes have been repaired or demolished and replaced since May
2007, a limited number of additional homes could be considered in need of rehabilitation or
replacement.
Substandard and dilapidated units were spread throughout the City; however, analysis of the data
revealed a cluster of 16 units within an approximate 31 -acre area located south of Mission Gorge
Road, east of Cottonwood Avenue, north of Prospect Avenue, and west of Railroad A venue. While
older single-family homes predominate, this area was rezoned Light Industrial (IL) in the 1990s in
anticipation of the State Route 52 extension to be completed in 2010. The City envisions the
transition of this area from single-family use to a use that is more compatible with a nearby freeway.
A Residential-Business (R-B) Overlay applies to slightly more than half of the 31-acre area. The R-B
Overlay is intended to encourage a mix of appropriate land uses within transitional neighborhoods
that are adjacent to more intensive commercial, office and industrial areas. Routine maintenance
and repair of non-conforming uses and structures is allowed per the City's Municipal Code.

Nearly 85 percent of the City's existing housing stock will exceed 30 years of age by the end of this
Housing Element planning period. Continued maintenance will be essential to prevent widespread
housing deterioration. The Code Enforcement Officer tracks and maintains statistics annually for
housing units in need of rehabilitation or replacement. The City also provides CDBG funds to
assist non-profit organizations that provide minor home improvement and repair services to lower
income households (Section 6, Program 3).

and 2011, 71 percent of Santee residents
owned the units they occupied, while 29 percent rented (Table 2-13). This rate of homeownership
is the highest among all of neighboring communities and nearly 17 percentage points higher than the
countywide rate.
Both owner- and renter-occupied households in Santee had similar household size, as evidenced by
the almost identical average household sizes (Table 2-14). Among those who owned their homes
between 2009 and 2011, 46 percent lived in homes with more than three persons per household,
compared to 47 percent for the renter-households.

4.      HOUSING VACANCY
A certain number of vacant units are needed to moderate the cost of housing, allow sufficient choice
for residents, and provide an incentive for unit upkeep and repair. Specifically, vacancy rates of 1.5
to 2.0 percent for ownership housing and 5.0 to 6.0 percent for rental housing are considered
optimal to balance demand and supply for housing.
Vacancy rates in Santee are close to what is considered optimal for a healthy housing market.
According to the 2009-2011 ACS, the overall vacancy rate in Santee was 5.5 percent. Specifically,
the vacancy rate for ownership housing was 2.8 percent, while the overall rental vacancy rate was 6.0
percent.
5.       HOUSING COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY
The cost of housing is directly related to the extent of housing problems in a community. If housing
costs are relatively high in comparison to household income, there will be a correspondingly higher
prevalence of housing cost burden and overcrowding. This section summarizes the cost and
affordability of the housing stock to Santee residents.
HOMEOWNERSHIP MARKET
The California Association of Realtors made median home prices (including single-family homes
and condominiums) for cities and counties throughout California available to the public until
December 2010. As of December 2010, the median home price in Santee was $325,000 (Table 2-
15). When compared to nearby jurisdictions, the California Association of Realtors data shows that
Santee's median home price was comparable to the median prices of homes in neighboring
jurisdictions; however, Santee was the only city among its geographic peers to experience median
home price increase from December 2009 to December 2010.

The Multiple Listing Service (MLS) database was also consulted in an effort to better understand the
more current home sale market in Santee. The MLS listed 74 single-family detached homes and 48
attached homes for sale in November 2012 (fable 2-16 on page 2-23). The median asking price for
a unit was $275,000, with a range of $74,000 to $1,100,000. Detached units were priced higher
($335,000 median) than attached units ($152,500 median).

Although asking price is generally more than actual selling price, it appears the home sale market
continues to rise in Santee, as the median asking price of single-family homes in November 2012
($354,700) is significantly higher than the median sale price of homes in December 2010 as reported
by the California Association of Realtors ($325,000).
RENTAL MARKET
With renters comprising approximately 30 percent of the City's households, it is important to
understand the rental market in Santee. Internet resources were consulted to understand the rental
housing market in Santee (fable 2-17 on page 2-24). Rental price information was collected for
four apartment complexes within the City with units for rent advertised on Rent.com in November
2012. At the time of the research, there were no studio apartment units available, while one-
bedroom units rented for $1,055 to $1,100. Larger units were more expensive; two-bedroom units
were offered at rents ranging from $1,125 to $1,395, while three-bedroom units ranged from $1,275
to $1,725 per month.
The San Diego County Apartment Association publishes quarterly rental market reports based on
surveys conducted throughout the region from Fall 2010 through Fall 2011. Fall average rents
declined for units of all sizes in Santee. The average price of three-bedroom units declined
substantially during this period (-18.4 percent); while rental rates for one-bedroom and two-
bedroom units decreased modestly (-0.6 percent and -5.5 percent, respectively) in Santee (fable 2-
18 on page 2-24). In general, average rents for units in Santee were slightly lower than average rents
of similar units in neighboring jurisdictions.

HOUSING AFFORDABILITY BY HOUSEHOLD INCOME
Housing affordability is dependent upon income and housing costs. Using set income guidelines,
current housing affordability can be estimated. According to the HUD income guidelines for 2012,
the Area Median Income (AMI) in San Diego County was $75,900 (adjusted for household size).
Assuming that the potential homebuyer has sufficient credit and down payment (10 percent) and
spends no greater than 30 percent of their income on housing expenses (i.e. mortgage, taxes and
insurance), the maximum affordable home price and rental price can be determined. The maximum
affordable home and rental prices for residents of San Diego County are shown in Table 2-19 on
page 2-26. Households in the lower end of each category can afford less by comparison than those
at the upper end. The market-affordability of Santee's housing stock for each income group is
discussed below:
Extremely Low Income Households: Extremely low income households earn 30 percent or less
of the AMI. The maximum affordable rental payment ranges from $383 per month for a one-
person household to $557 per month for a family of five (Table 2-19). The maximum affordable
home purchase price for extremely low income households ranges from $42,465 for a one-person
household to $52,429 for a five-person household.
Very Low Income Households: Very low income households are classified as those earning 50
percent or less of the AMI. The maximum affordable rental payment ranges from $664 per month
for a one-person household to $991 per month for a family of five (Table 2-19). The maximum
affordable home purchase price for very low income households ranges from $86,495 for a one-
person household to $115,653 for a five person household.
Based on the rental data presented in Tables 2-17 and 2-18, extremely low and very low income
households of all sizes would be unlikely to secure adequately sized and affordable rental housing in
Santee. According to the MLS real estate database, extremely low and very low income households
could not afford the asking price of any adequately sized home listed for-sale in November 2012
(Table 2-16).
Low Income Households: Low income households earn 51 to 80 percent of the County AMI.
The maximum home price a low income household can afford ranges from $152,443 for a one-
person household to $217,413 for a five-person family. Affordable rental rates for low income
households would range from $1,085 for a one-person household to $1,641 for a five-person
household.
As indicated by the data presented in Table 2-16, low income households could afford a limited
number of adequately sized homes listed for-sale in November 2012. Low income households have
a better chance in securing an adequately sized and affordable rental housing unit (Tables 2-17 and
2-18). However, the limited number of apartment complexes offering three-bedroom units in
Santee at prices affordable to larger low income households is indicative of the potential difficulty
these households face.

Moderate Income Households: Moderate income households earn up to 120 percent of the
County AMI. The maximum affordable home price for moderate income households ranges from
$267,412 for a one-person household to $395,100 for a family of five. A moderate income
household can afford rental rates of $1,554 to $2,366 per month depending on household size.
Based on the rental and for-sale housing market data presented in Tables 2-16 and 2-17, moderate
income households can afford a wide range of apartments, condominiums, and single-family
detached dwellings advertised in November 2012.

2.       AT-RISK HOUSING
State law requires that the City identify, analyze, and propose programs to preserve existing
affordable multifamily rental units that are eligible to convert to market rate uses due to termination
of subsidy contract, mortgage prepayment, or expiring use restrictions during a 10-year period
starting January 1, 2013. Consistent with State law, this section identifies publicly assisted housing
units in Santee and analyzes their potential to convert to market rate housing uses.
During the 2013-2022 "at-risk" housing analysis period, two assisted housing projects in Santee are
at risk of converting to market-rate housing. As of January 2013, 309 units were at risk of
converting to market rate rents. Of these units, 121 were within the Carlton Country Club Villas,
while the Woodglen Vista Apartments had 188 at-risk units. The City will continue to monitor these
at-risk units and should a notice of intent to convert to market rate be filed, work with potential
purchasers to preserve the units, and ensure that tenants were properly notified of their rights under
California law. In November 2012, the City sent a letter to all agencies participating in the State's
Opportunity to Purchase and Right of First Refusal Program to assess their interest in acquiring and
managing at-risk properties. There were several responses. In January 2013, those who responded
were given contact information for the owners of the two properties at risk during the planning
period.

3.       PRESERVATION OPTIONS
Preservation of the at-risk units can be achieved in several ways: 1) facilitate transfer of ownership of
these projects to or purchase of similar units by nonprofit organizations; 2) purchase of affordability
covenant; and 3) provide rental assistance to tenants using funding sources other than Section 8.
TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP
Long-term affordability of lower income units can be secured by transferring ownership of these
projects to non-profit housing organizations. By doing so, these units would be eligible for a greater
range of government assistance. Table 2-21 presents the estimated market value for the 309 units at
Carlton Country Club Villas and Woodglen Vista Apartments to establish an order of magnitude for
assessing preservation costs. As shown, the total market value of these units is approximately
$37,100,000. Assuming a five-percent down payment is made on each project, at least $1,850,000
down payment cost would be required to transfer ownership of these buildings to non-profit
organizations. Unless some form of mortgage assistance is available to interested nonprofit
organizations, rental income alone from the lower income tenants would not likely be adequate to
cover the mortgage payment, and rental subsidy would be required.

                 Market value for each project is estimated with the following assumptions:
                     1. Average market rent for 1-BR is $988, 2-BR is Sl,205, and Sl,153 for a 3-BR
                           (fable 2-18 on page 2-24).
                     2. Average bedroom size for 1-BR assumed at 600 square feet, 750 square feet for
                           2-BR, and 900 square feet for a 3-BR.
                     3. Vacancy rate= 5%
                     4. Annual operating expenses per square foot = S4.50
                     5. l\farket value = Annual net project incomc*multiplication factor
                     6. Multiplication factor for a building in good condition is 12.5.
PURCHASE OF AFFORDABILITY COVENANT
Another option to preserve the affordability of at-risk projects is to provide an incentive package to
the owners to maintain the projects as lower income housing. Incentives could include writing
down the interest rate on the remaining loan balance, and/ or supplementing the subsidy amount
received to market levels.

RENT SUBSIDY
Tenant-based rent subsidies could be used to preserve the affordability of housing. Similar to Housing
Choice Vouchers, the City through a variety of potential funding sources could provide a voucher to
very low income households. The level of the subsidy required to preserve the at-risk affordable
housing is estimated to equal the Fair Market Rent for a unit minus the housing cost affordable by a
very low income household. Table 2-22 estimates the rent subsidies required to preserve the housing
affordability for the residents of the 309 at-risk units. Based on the estimates and assumptions shown
in this table, approximately $1,678,000 in rent subsidies would be required annually.

                1. J\ 1-BR unit is assumed to be occupied by a 1-person household, a 2-BR unit by a 3-pcrson household,
                     and a 3-BR unit by a 5-person household.

                3.   Based on 2012 Arca Median Income in San Diego County, affordable monthly housing cost for a 1-
                      person very low income household is S664, S840 for a 3-pcrson household, and S991 for a 5-person
                      household (fable 2-19 on page 2-26).
                4.    IJUD 2012 Fair Market Rents in the San Diego MSA is S984 for a 1-BR, Sl,126 for a 2-BR, and
                     S1,960for a 3-BR.
4.        REPLACEMENT COSTS
The cost of developing new housing depends on a variety of factors such as density, size of units,
location and related land costs, and type of construction. Assuming an average development cost of
$300,000 per unit for multifamily rental housing, replacement of the 309 at-risk units would require
approximately $92,700,000. This cost estimate includes land, construction, permits, on- and off-site
improvements, and other costs.
5.        COST COMPARISON
The cost to build new housing to replace the 309 at-risk units is high, with an estimated total cost of
more than $92,700,000. This cost estimate is substantially higher than the cost associated with
 transfer of ownership ($37,100,000) and providing rent subsidies similar to Housing Choice
Vouchers for 20 years ($33,560,000).
                                                                                                                        Page 2-29

RESOURCES FOR PRESERVATION OF AT-RISK UNITS
A variety of potential funding sources are available for the acqwsltlon, replacement, or rent
subsidies; however, due to the high costs of developing and preserving at-risk housing relative to the
amount of available local funds, multi-layering of local and non-local sources may be required. A
more thorough description of resources for the preservation of at-risk units is presented in Section
4, Housing Resources.
G. Estimates of Housing Needs
The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) developed by the Census for HUD
provides detailed information on housing needs by income level for different types of households in
Santee. Detailed CHAS data based on the 2006-2008 ACS is displayed in Table 2-23 on page 2-31.
Based on CHAS, housing problems in Santee include:
    1)   Units with physical defects Oacking complete kitchen or bathroom);
    2)   Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room);
    3)   Housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 30 percent of gross income; or
    4)   Severe housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50 percent of gross income.
DISPROPORTIONATE NEEDS
The types of problems vary according to household income, type, and tenure. Some highlights
include:
    •    Overall, housing problems affected roughly the same proportion of renter-households (44
         percent) as owner-households (45 percent).
    •    Elderly renters had the highest level of housing problems regardless of income level (65
         percent).
    •    All extremely low income large renter families had housing problems; the CHAS estimates
         that all of these households paid more than 50 percent of their income on housing costs.
    •    More than half of all lower income households (<80 percent AMI), regardless of tenure,
         incurred a cost burden.
    •    Of the 1,555 extremely low income Santee households reported in the 2006-2008 CHAS,
         approximately 65 percent incurred a housing cost burden exceeding 50 percent of their
         monthly income.
    •    Projected housing needs for extremely low income households through the end of the
         planning period include a need for additional Housing Choice Vouchers and new or
         substantially rehabilitated rental housing of adequate size and at affordable rates to avoid or
         alleviate the problems of overcrowding and cost burden (Section 6, Programs 5 and 10).

Section 3
Housing Constraints
Although the City of Santee strives to ensure the provision of adequate and affordable housing
to meet the needs of the community, many factors can constrain the development, maintenance,
and improvement of housing. These include market mechanisms, government codes and
policies, and physical and environmental constraints. This section addresses these potential
constraints that affect the supply and cost of housing in Santee.
A.        Market Constraints
Locally and regionally there are several constraints that hinder the ability to accommodate
Santee's affordable housing demand. The high cost of land, rising development costs, and
neighborhood opposition make it expensive for developers to build housing. These constraints
may result in housing that is not affordable to lower and moderate income households, or may
render residential construction economically infeasible for developers.
1.       LAND AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
High development costs in the region stifle potential affordable housing developments.
Construction costs for residential units have increased rapidly over the last decade, to the point
where a typical new apartment costs approximately $300,000 to develop, including land,
entitlements, and construction costs.         Furthermore, neighborhood resistance to some
developments lengthens development time, driving up costs. The difficulty of assembling and
developing awkward infill sites can also add to costs.
Reduction in amenities and the quality of building materials (above a minimum acceptability for
health, safety, and adequate performance) could lower costs and associated sales prices or rents.
In addition, prefabricated factory-built housing may provide for lower priced housing by
reducing construction and labor costs. Another factor related to construction costs is the
number of units built at one time. As the number of units increases, overall costs generally
decrease due to economies of scale.
The price of raw land and any necessary improvements is a key component of the total cost of
housing. The diminishing supply of land available for residential construction, especially land
available for higher density residential development, has served to keep the cost of land high. At
the peak of the housing boom between 2000 and 2006, high and rapidly increasing land costs
resulted in home builders developing increasingly expensive homes in order to capture profits.
                                                                                          Page 3 - 1

In October 2012, the cost of advertised vacant land in Santee zoned for single-family residential
development yielded an average price of $63,270 per acre (Table 3-1 on page 3-2). The cost per
acre of lower density single-family lots in the R-1, R-1-A, and HL zones (i.e., 0-4 units per acre)
was substantially lower than the price per acre of lots in the R-2 zone (2-5 units per acre). No
vacant multifamily lots were listed for sale in October 2012. According to Zillow.com, vacant
multifamily lots in the R-7 and R-14 zones were substantially more valuable on a per-acre basis
when compared to single-family lots. The overall average cost per acre for these higher density
lots was $342,493, with an average of $288,601 per acre for R-7 sites and $399,176 for R-14 sites.

A density bonus up to 35 percent over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density
under the applicable zoning district is available to developers who provide affordable housing as
part of their projects. Developers of affordable housing are also entitled to at least one
concession or incentive as established in the Zoning Ordinance. Density bonuses, together with
the incentives and/ or concessions, result in a lower average cost of land per dwelling unit
thereby making the provision of affordable housing more feasible (Section 6, Program 10).
2.       AvAILABILITY OF HOME FINANCING
Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to
disclose information on the disposition of loan applications and the income, gender, and race of
loan applicants.
CONVENTIONAL LENDING
Overall, 510 households applied for conventional home mortgage loans in Santee in 2010
 (Table 3-2 on page 3-3). Of these applications, approximately 62 percent were originated
 (approved by the lenders and accepted by the applicants). The overall denial rate was 16
percent, while 22 percent of the applications were withdrawn, closed for incompleteness, or
received approval, but the loan was not accepted by the applicant.
Page 3 - 2
                                                                                           Housing Constraints
Among applicant households in 2010, 39 were lower income and 242 were moderate income.
Lower income applicants had a slightly higher denial rate than upper income applicants: 18
percent of lower income and 19 percent of moderate income applicants had their applications
denied, compared to 13 percent of upper income households. Lower and moderate income
applicants also had the lowest loan origination rate (59 and 56 percent, respectively) when
compared to applicants earning upper incomes (69 percent). The City participates in the San
Diego County Regional Mortgage Certificate Program (Section 6, Program 8) and provides
down payment and closing cost assistance to first-time lower and moderate income homebuyers
(Section 6, Program 7).

   *"Other" includes applications approved but not accepted, files closed for incompleteness, and applications
   withdrawn.
There were 82 applications for home improvement loans in 2010. Among the applications 61
percent were originated, 26 percent were denied, and 13 percent were withdrawn, closed for
incompleteness, or received approval but not accepted by the applicants. Origination and denial
rates were identical for applicants with upper and moderate incomes, while loans were originated
for a smaller percentage of lower income applicants. Specifically, approximately 64 percent of
loan applications for moderate and upper income applicants were originated, compared to an
origination rate of only 33 percent for lower income applicants. Lower income households
already holding a mortgage loan may have difficulty qualifying for an improvement loan due to
their high loan-to-income ratio.
The City also provides CDBG funds to assist non-profit organizations that provide minor home
improvement and repair services to lower income households (Section 6, Program 3).
GOVERNMENT-BACKED LENDING
In addition to conventional mortgages, HMDA tracks loans for government-assisted mortgages
(e.g. FHA, VA, or RHS) offered through conventional lenders. However, mortgage assistance
programs by local jurisdictions are not monitored. In 2010, 643 Santee households applied for
government-backed home mortgage loans (Table 3-3 on page 3-4). Of these applications, 75
percent were originated (approved by the lenders and accepted by the applicants), 10 percent
were denied, and 15 percent were withdrawn, closed for incompleteness, or received approval,
but the loan was not accepted by the applicant.
                                                                                                                 Page 3 - 3

Among applicant households in 2010, 19 were lower income, with a substantially lower
origination rate (37 percent) when compared to moderate (75 percent) and upper income (77
percent) applicants. However, fewer lower income applications (19 applications) were submitted
in 2010 than moderate (329 applications) and upper income (288 applications) applicants. A
higher percentage of applications filed by upper income households (10 percent) were denied
when compared to moderate income households (eight percent). Only seven applications for
government-backed home improvement loans were processed in 2010. Of these loans, three
were originated and one was denied.

3.        CONSTRUCTION FINANCING
The financing of a residential project, particularly affordable housing is quite complex.
Construction loans are almost never available for over 75 percent of the future project value for
multifamily developments. This means that developers must usually supply at least 25 percent of
the project value. Furthermore, no firm threshold determines what a lender considers to be an
acceptable 'return' on investment, nor the maximum equity contribution at which an otherwise
feasible project becomes infeasible. Upfront cash commitment may not be problematic for
some developers as long as the project can generate an acceptable net cash flow to meet the
acceptable returns. Although financing costs impact project feasibility, these problems are
generally equal across jurisdictions and thus are not a unique constraint to housing production in
Santee.

B.       Governmental Constraints
Policies of the City can have an impact on the price and availability of housing in Santee. Land
use controls, site improvement requirements, building codes, fees, and other local programs
intended to improve the overall quality of housing may serve to constrain development of
housing affordable to all segments of the community. The following public policies can affect
overall housing availability, adequacy, and affordability in Santee.
1.       LAND USE CONTROLS
The Land Use Element of the Santee General Plan sets forth the policies that guide residential
development Santee and establishes the community's long-term vision for development. The
City's last comprehensive update of the General Plan occurred in August 2003. A new Urban
Residential land use designation that permits 30 units per gross acre was added in 2010. The
residential designations include the following:
    •    Hillside Limited (HL}1: 0-1 dwelling units per gross acre
    •    Low Density Residential (R-Jf 1-2 dwelling units per gross acre
    •    Low Density Residential Altemative (R-1-Af 2- 4 dwelling units per gross acre (1/4-
         acre lot minimum)
    •    Low-Medium Density Residential (R-2): 2-5 dwelling units per gross acre
    •    Medium Density Residential (R-7): 7-14 dwelling units per gross acre
    •    Medium High Density Residential (R-14): 14-22 dwelling units per gross acre
    •    High Density Residential (R-22): 22-30 dwelling units per gross acre
    •     Urban Residential (R-30): 30 dwelling units per gross acre
    •    Residential - Business-. This district is intended to permit both single-family residential
         and/ or low intensity office and commercial uses
In addition to the above residential land use categories, the Town Center Specific Plan area and
the Planned Development District designated in the General Plan and the Zoning Ordinance
allow residential uses.
The City's residential land use designations provide for the development of a wide range of
housing types including single-family dwellings, mobile homes, townhomes, condominiums,
second dwelling units, and multifamily units at various densities. Therefore, the land use
regulations are not considered a constraint to residential development.
    In the City's hillside areas with a slope of 10 percent or greater, the density is determined by a formula that
    takes into account the average natural slope of the property. For instance, on sloped property with an average
    natural slope between 10 percent and 19.9 percent, the percent of the base district's maximum permitted
    density is 75 percent. \'<'here the natural average slope is 20 percent and above, the percent of the base
    district's maximum permitted density is 50 percent.
                                                                                                          Page 3 - 5

GILLESPIE FIELD AIRPORT LAND USE COMPATIBILITY PLAN (ALUCP)
The City of Santee is located within the Airport Influence Area (AIA) of Gillespie Field. State
law requires each local agency having jurisdiction over land uses within the AIA to either: (1)
modify its General Plan, zoning ordinance or other applicable land use regulation(s) to be
consistent with the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan (ALUCP); or (2) overrule all or part of
the ALUCP within 180 days of adoption of the ALUCP. If the City of Santee fails to take either
action, the City is required to submit all land use development proposals to the Airport Land
Use Commission (ALUC) for consistency review until such time as the ALUC deems the City's
General Plan consistent with the ALUCP.
At the present time, land use proposals within the AIA are subject to land use compatibility
determinations by the ALUC. The City is responsible for submitting the Application for a
Consistency Determination to the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. Airport staff
would review and make recommendation to the ALUC as to the appropriate determination. The
ALUC must act upon an application for a determination of consistency with an ALUCP within
60 days of the ALUC deeming such application complete. The City may override an ALUC
determination of inconsistency by a two-thirds vote of its governing body if it can make certain
findings and provide a 45-day notice of the same to the ALUC and the California Department of
Transportation (Caltrans) per Public Utilities Code Section 21676.5(a). Where possible conflict
between the residential density provisions mandated by State law and Airport Safety Zones are
identified with a specific land use proposal, the ALUCP density limitations shall apply unless
overridden by the City Council. Since this process is not unique to the City of Santee, it does
not constitute a distinct or unusual constraint. The Gillespie Field Airport Land Use
Compatibility Plan was adopted on January 25, 2010, and is posted on the San Diego Regional
Airport Authority's website. 2
Approximately 63.91 acres of the residential sites inventory is located within the boundaries of
the Gillespie Field ALUCP. Of this acreage, 26.30 acres fall within Safety Zone 6, which will
not negatively affect residential density. The remaining 37.61 acres fall within Safety Zones 3
and 4. The City will override the Gillespie Field ALUCP on these residential sites as
appropriate, and as necessary to ensure adequate sites are available during the planning period
unless AB 2292 "no net loss" findings can be made (Section 6, Policy 5.7). Furthermore, the
City will develop and implement a formal ongoing (project-by-project) evaluation procedure
pursuant to Government Code Section 65863 (Section 6, Program 14). Should an approval of
development result in a reduction of capacity below the residential capacity needed to
accommodate the remaining need for lower income households, the City will identify and rezone
sufficient sites to accommodate the shortfall and ensure "no net loss" in capacity to
accommodate the RHNA.
2.         RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
The City's Zoning Ordinance implements the General Plan. It contains development standards
 for each zoning district consistent with the land use designations of the General Plan. Santee's
 Zoning Ordinance provides for the following residential districts:

• Hillside/Limited Residential (HL) -- (0-1 dwelling units/ gross acre): This
  designation is intended for residential development in areas that exhibit steep slopes,
  rugged topography and limited access. Residential uses are characterized by rural large
  estate lots with significant permanent open space area, consistent with the constraints of
  slope gradient, soil and geotechnical hazards, access, availability of public services and
  other environmental concerns.
• Low Density Residential (R-1) -- (1-2 dwelling units/gross acre): This designation is
  intended for residential development characterized by single-family homes on one-half
  acre lots or larger that is responsive to the natural terrain and minimizes grading
  requirements. The intent of this designation is to provide development of a semi-rural
  character through the use of varying setbacks and dwelling unit placement on individual
  parcels.
• Low-Altemative (R-1-A) -- (2-4 dwelling units/ gross acre): This designation is intended
  for residential development characterized by single-family homes on one-quarter acre
  lots or larger which provide a transitional option between the R-2 (6,000 square foot lot)
  and the larger R-1 (20,000 square foot lot) zones.
• Low-Medium Density Residential (R-2) -- (2-5 dwelling units/ gross acre): This
  designation is intended for residential development characterized by single-family homes
  in standard subdivision form. It is normally expected that the usable pad area within this
  designation will be a minimum of 6,000 square feet.
• Medium Density Residential (R-7) -- (7-14 dwelling units/gross acre): This
  designation is intended for a wide range of residential development types including
  attached and detached single-family units at the lower end of the density range and
  multifamily attached units at the higher end of the density range. Areas developed under
  this designation should exhibit adequate access to streets of at least collector capacity and
  be conveniently serviced by neighborhood commercial and recreational facilities.
• Medium High Density Residential (R-14) -- (14-22 dwelling units/gross acre): This
  designation is intended for residential development characterized at the lower end of the
  density range by multifamily attached units and at the upper end of the density range by
  apartment and condominium buildings. It is intended that this category utilize innovative
  site planning, provide on-site recreational amenities and be located in close proximity to
  major community facilities, business centers and streets of at least major capacity.
•  High Density Residential (R-22) -- (22-30 dwelling units/ gross acre): This designation
  is intended for residential development characterized by mid-rise apartment and
   condominium buildings characteristic of urban high density development in close
   proximity to community facilities and services, public transit services, and major streets. It
  is intended that this category utilize innovative site planning and building design to provide
   on-site recreational amenities and open space.
                                                                                        Page 3 - 7

City of Santee Ilousing Element
    •     Urban Residential (R-30) -- (30 dwelling units/ gross acre): This designation is
         intended for residential development characterized by mid-rise apartment and
         condominium development typical of urban development at higher densities than R-22.
         This designation is intended for architecturally designed residential development, up to
         four stories, with parking facilities integrated in the building design. Areas developed
         under this designation would be located in close proximity to major community facilities,
         commercial and business centers and streets of at least major capacity. Development
         amenities would include on-site business centers, fitness and community rooms, and
         indoor and outdoor recreation facilities. Site design would implement pedestrian-
         friendly design concepts, including separated sidewalks, landscaped parkways, traffic
         calming measures, and enhanced access to transit facilities and services. Measures that
         reduce energy and water consumption are required. New development in this zone is
         required to meet the minimum density of the zone.
Santee's Zoning Ordinance establishes residential development standards for each zone to
ensure quality of development in the community. Site Development Criteria as specified in
Section 17 .10.040 of the Zoning Ordinance are presented in Table 3-4.
Developers of affordable and senior housing and property owners who initiate lot consolidation
may request a variety of incentives, including concessions, modifications, or waivers of otherwise
applicable development standards (Section 6, Programs 10 and 13).
All residential uses and structures proposed in Santee regardless of zoning are required to have
the number of parking spaces specified in Section 17.24.040 Parking Requirements (Table 3-5).
An exception is made for secondary dwelling units, which require no additional parking.
Parking requirements for single-family and multifamily residential uses in Santee and nearby
jurisdictions are summarized in Table 3-6. Santee's parking requirements for a prototypical
100-unit multifamily residential development are comparable to requirements of nearby cities.
Santee's requirement is lower than what would be required for the same development in El
Cajon, Poway, and Lemon Grove. Santee's requirement for a prototype within the R-7, R-14, or
R-22 zones is slightly higher than the requirement in La Mesa, but lower for a typical
development within the R-30 zone than La Mesa's requirement.

Notes: 1) In addition to the required number of parking spaces for each unit, one off-street uncovered parking space is required for
each four units for visitor parking (for the R-30 zone, visitor parking requirement is one space for every ten units). For single-family

  Notes: 111e prototypical multifamily project is a 100-unit development with 10 studio units, 20 one-bedroom units, 40 two-
  bedroom units, and 30 three-bedroom units.
The provision of off-street parking can increase the cost of housing; however, Santee's standards
are reasonable as requirements for multifamily developments are equal to or less than
requirements for single-family detached dwellings (two spaces per unit) and comparable to
parking requirements of nearby jurisdictions. Guest space requirements for multifamily
developments are also reasonable because these types of developments do not provide
driveways for each unit to accommodate parking for guests as is required for new single-family
homes. Relative parity in parking requirements across jurisdictions makes it easier for
developers to incorporate the design and construction costs into project pro formas.
Furthermore, the City's parking requirements in multifamily zones are already comparable to the
parking requirements established in the State density bonus law for affordable housing. Parking
standards in Santee are not considered a constraint to housing development.
Although Santee's parking requirements are comparable to the parking standards established in
State density bonus law, should a parking requirement pose a specific hardship or constraint to a
proposed affordable housing development, the City may consider further modification to the
parking standards on a case-by-case basis (Section 6, Program 10). The City will also consider
reduced parking as one of the incentives offered to land owners who assemble and consolidate
smaller multifamily lots for the purpose of providing well-planned and high quality development
(Section 6, Program 13).

  3.        PROVISION FOR AVARIETY OF HOUSING
   State housing element law specifies that jurisdictions identify adequate sites to be made available
   through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the development of
  various types of housing for all economic segments of the population. This includes single-
   family housing, multifamily housing, factory-built or manufactured housing, emergency shelters,
   and transitional housing among others. In January 2013, the City amended its Zoning
   Ordinance to allow for supportive housing and single room occupancy (SRO) buildings, as well
   as to facilitate further accommodation of transitional housing and emergency shelters in
   accordance with State law. Table 3-7 summarizes the housing types permitted and conditionally
   permitted under the Zoning Ordinance.

   MULTIFAMILY HOUSING
   Multifamily housing includes duplexes, apartments, condominiums, or townhomes. As of
  January 2012, multifamily housing units constituted approximately 24 percent of Santee's
   housing stock. The Zoning Ordinance provides for multifamily developments in the R-7, R-14,
   R-22, and R-30 zones subject to approval of a Development Review Permit (DR) to ensure
   consistency with applicable development standards and design guidelines. The R-7 zone permits
   up to 14 units per gross acre while up to 22 units per gross acre are permitted in the R-14 zone.
   Up to 30 units per gross acre are permitted in the R-22 zone and the density for the R-30 zone is
   30 units per gross acre, with no range.
   MANUFACTURED HOUSING/MOBILE HOMES
   Manufactured housing and mobile homes offer an affordable housing option to many low and
   moderate income households. According to the California Department of Finance, there were
   2,320 mobile homes in the City in January 2012. The City permits manufactured housing placed
   on a permanent foundation in all residential zones that allow single-family housing and within
   mobile home parks in accordance with the Santee Zoning Ordinance.
                                                                                             Page 3 - 11
City of Santee I-lousing Element
The Zoning Ordinance also contains a Mobile Home Park Overlay District to accommodate mobile
home parks in the City. According to Section 17.22.030, the Mobile Home Park Overlay District
may be applied in combination with any other residential district with the approval of a Conditional
Use Permit (CUP). The Overlay District establishes specific development standards for a mobile
home park and is applied over the base residential district. A Mobile Home Park Overlay district is
indicated on the zoning district map by the letters "MHP."
SECOND DWELLING UNITS
Second dwelling units are attached or detached dwelling units that provide complete
independent living facilities for one or more persons including permanent provisions for living,
sleeping, cooking and sanitation. Second units may be an alternative source of affordable
housing for lower income households and seniors.
California law requires local jurisdictions to adopt ordinances that establish the conditions under
which second dwelling units are permitted (Government Code, Section 65852.2). State law also
requires that local governments use a ministerial, rather than discretionary process for approving
second units (i.e. second units otherwise compliant with local zoning standards can be approved
without a public hearing).
Second dwelling units are permitted in all residential zones on lots that contain an existmg
single-family home pursuant to Section 17.10.030(F)(6) of the Zoning Ordinance. Since January
1, 2003, six building permits have been issued for second dwelling units. In January 2013, the
City amended the Zoning Ordinance to remove the Development Review Permit requirement.
Second dwelling units are subject the ministerial building permit application process.
RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES
Residential care facilities can be described as any State-licensed family home, group care facility or
similar facility for 24-hour non-medical care of persons in need of personal services, supervision, or
assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily living. In accordance with State law, Santee
permits residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons within all residential zones, subject to
the same development review and permit processing procedures as traditional single-family or
multifamily housing. Residential care facilities serving more than six persons are permitted with
approval of a CUP within the R-2, R-7, R-14, R-22, and R-30 zones. Potential conditions for
approval may include hours of operation, security, loading requirements, and management.
Conditions would be similar to those for other similar uses in the same zones and would not serve
to constrain the development of such facilities. Occupancy standards for residential care facilities
are the same as occupancy standards for all other residential uses. The City has not adopted a
 spacing requirement for residential care facilities.
TRANSITIONAL AND SUPPORTIVE HOUSING
The Zoning Ordinance definition for "transitional housing" references the State's definition
 contained in Health and Safety Code Section 50675.2, which defines "transitional housing" and
 "transitional housing development" as "buildings configured as rental housing developments, but
 operated under program requirements that call for the termination of assistance and recirculation of
 the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined future point in time,
which shall be no less than six months."
 Page 3 - 12
                                                                                Housing Constraints
The definition for "supportive housing" in the Zoning Ordinance also references the State's
definition contained in Health and Safety Code Section 50675.14(b), which defines the use as
"housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target population, and that is linked
to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining the housing,
improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible,
work in the community." "Target population" is defined in the same subsection of the Health and
Safety Code Section as "persons, including persons with disabilities, and families who are
'homeless,' as that term is defined by Section 11302 of Title 42 of the United States Code, or who
are 'homeless youth,' as that term is defined by paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 11139.3
of the Government Code."
The City permits transitional and supportive housing that meets applicable Health and Safety Code
definitions in all residential zones, consistent \vith State law. The same development standards and
permit process that applies to single-family or multifamily housing applies to transitional and
supportive housing.
EMERGENCY SHELTERS
The Zoning Ordinance definition for "emergency shelter" references the State's definition
contained in Health and Safety Code Section 50801 (e), which defines the use as "housing \vith
minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less
by a homeless person. No individual or household may be denied emergency shelter because of an
inability to pay." Although no emergency shelters are currently located within Santee, these facilities
are permitted and without discretionary review on more than seven acres on eight parcels on
Woodside Avenue within the General Industrial "IG" zone.
     •   Vacant or underutilized parcels \vithin the IG zone are presented in Appendix B. These
         parcels are considered underutilized because they are currently vacant or being used for
         outdoor storage or fleet storage with limited or no site improvements. The undeveloped
         and underutilized IG-zoned parcels could accommodate a year round emergency shelter to
         accommodate an emergency shelter for at least 26 homeless individuals (identified
         unsheltered homeless population in Santee as of January-February 2012) and at least one
         year-round emergency shelter.           The IG zone is suitable for emergency shelters
         because:Shelters are compatible with a range of uses that are common in suburban
         communities and allowed in the IG zone (e.g., motels/hotels, office buildings, religious
         institutions, athletic or health clubs, public buildings, educational facilities, etc.);
     •   The IG-zoned parcels on Woodside Avenue are located approximately one mile &om
         public bus service that connects to regional transit, including trolley service;
     •   Existing uses in the IG zone are primarily light industrial, warehousing, and office uses - no
         heavy industrial uses are present; and
     •   The parcels are not known to be constrained by the presence of hazardous materials either
         on or adjacent to the properties.
                                                                                                  Page 3 -13

City of Santee Ilousing Element
Emergency shelters are subject to ministerial Development Review Pennit approval. The follO\ving
specific and objective development standards are established in the Municipal Code and apply to
emergency shelters, pursuant to State law:
    •    An emergency shelter shall not be located within three hundred feet of another shelter; and
    •    The agency or organization operating the shelter shall submit a Facility Management Plan
         containing facility information, including the number of persons who can be served nightly,
         the size and location of onsite waiting and intake areas, the provision of onsite
         management, exterior lighting details, and onsite security during hours of operation.
SINGLE ROOM OCCUPANCY (SRO) BUILDINGS
SRO buildings are defined in the Santee Zoning Ordinance as "a building providing single-room
units for one or more persons with or without shared kitchen and bath facilities, including
efficiency units per Health and Safety Code Section 17958.1." SRO buildings are considered
suitable to accommodate the housing needs of extremely low income households. This housing
type is permitted in all multifamily zones, subject to all Municipal Code and other standards
applicable to any new multifamily residential building, including, but not limited to, density,
height, setback, on-site parking, lot coverage, development review, compliance ,vith the
California Building Code, building fees, charges and other requirements generally applicable to a
proposed multifamily development in the Zone District in which a property is located.
FARMWORKER HOUSING
According to the 2009-2011 ACS, no residents of Santee residents were employed in farming,
forestry, or fishing occupations. Moreover, the Regional Task Force on the Homeless did not
identify any homeless farmworkers/ day laborers in Santee in 2012. Although the share of the
City's population working in farming or agricultural occupations is negligible, a variety of
agricultural uses are pennitted or conditionally pennitted in multiple residential zones. The City
will revise the Zoning Ordinance to evaluate farm worker housing in residential zones that
currently allow agricultural operations and consider changes to the Zoning Ordinance to achieve
consistency with State law (Section 6, Program 15).
4.       SITE IMPROVEMENTS, DEVELOPMENT FEES AND EXACTIONS
For large subdivisions, the City requires the construction of reasonable on- and off-site
improvements pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act. The minimum improvements required of
the developer include:
     •   Grading and improvement of public and private streets and alleys including surfacing,
         curbs, gutters, cross gutters, sidewalks, ornamental street lighting, street name signs and
         necessary barricades and safety devices;
     •   Storm drainage and flood control facilities within and outside of (when necessary) the
         subdivision sufficient to carry storm runoff both tributary to and originating within the
         subdivision;
Page 3 - 14

                                                                                      Housing Constraints
     •    A public or private sewage system that meets public sewer system standards, unless
          waived by the planning commission or city council;
     •    A water supply system providing an adequate supply of potable water to each lot and fire
          hydrant within the subdivision. The water supply system design must be approved by
          the water district and is subject to the approval of the city engineer;
     •    Fire hydrants and connections shall be of the type and at locations specified by the fire
          marshal; and
     •    Public utility distribution facilities including gas, electric, telephone and cable television
          necessary to serve each lot in the subdivision.
Specific standards for design and improvements of subdivisions must be in accordance with the
applicable sections of the Zoning Ordinance, General Plan, Subdivision Ordinance, any specific
plans adopted by the City, and requirements established by the City Engineer.
The City also requires dedication of parcels of land intended for public use. Dedicated streets,
highways, alleys, ways, easements, rights-of-way, etc., must be designed, developed, and
improved according to the City of Santee Public Works Standards. The City of Santee Street
Design Criteria is summarized in Table 3-8 on page 3-16.
The City often requires dedication of bicycle paths for the use and safety of residents of
proposed subdivisions with more than 200 units. Schools, fire stations, libraries, or other public
facilities may also be required. Park dedication or fee in-lieu of dedication required according to
the standard of five acres per one thousand persons, consistent with the Quimby Act. This ratio
amounts to 740.5 square feet per single-family unit, 675.2 square feet per multifamily unit, and
370.3 square feet per mobile home unit proposed. Improvement and dedication requirements
are important to maintaining the quality of life in Santee and to ensuring public health and
safety. These standards are typical in the region.

In addition to improvements and dedication of public land, land developers are subject to a variety
of fees and exactions to cover the cost of processing permits and providing necessary services and
facilities. In general, these fees can be a constraint on housing development and compromise
market-rate affordability because the additional cost home by developers contributes to overall
increased housing unit cost. However, the fees are necessary to maintain adequate planning services
                                                                                                 Page 3 - 15

Reduced, waived, or reimbursed fees are possible incentives under the City's density bonus
ordinance and could be a potential consideration for future lot consolidation incentives (Section 6,
Programs 10 and 13). When fees calculated on a prototypical single-family home by the Building
Industry Association in 2006-2007 (the last year for which fee survey data for Santee and nearby
jurisdictions is available), Santee's fees were average when compared to its neighbors (fable 3-10 on
page 3-17).

Despite all of these various fees for single-family and multifamily development, the fees are
necessary and are reasonable since they constitute between nine and ten percent of estimated
building costs and the fees for multi.family development are approximately 38 percent less on a
per-unit basis than fees for a detached single-family dwelling.                                Permit processing and
development impact fees will not impede the City's ability to achieve its regional housing share
objectives.

5.        DEVELOPMENT PERMIT PROCEDURES
Development review and permit procedures are necessary steps to ensure that residential
construction proceeds in an orderly manner. The following discussion outlines the level of
review required for various permits and timelines associated with those reviews. The timelines
provided are estimates; actual processing time may vary due to the volume of applications and
the size and complexity of the projects. The City offers a pre-application process with a $500
fee charged to developers of projects that require a Development Review Permit, Conditional
Use Permit, Tentative Map, or Tentative Parcel Map. The pre-application process facilitates and
encourages the construction of housing through the early identification of potential issues
related to proposed projects. Priority permit processing is one potential incentive that could be
obtained through the City's density bonus ordinance and/ or lot consolidation incentives
(Section 6, Programs 10 and 13). The City Council functions as the Planning Commission and
therefore approval of applications in Santee is not subject to two discretionary bodies. This
streamlined review process saves a considerable amount of time when compared to processes of
many other jurisdictions that require separate Planning Commission and City Council approval
of large residential projects.
SINGLE-FAMILY
A single-family dwelling, on an existing parcel located in a zone that permits single-family
residential development (HL, R-1, R-1-A, R-2, and R-7 zones) that does not contain any natural
slopes greater than 10 percent and is not located in a biological resource area, on a ridgeline, or
in a similar type of visually prominent location, is subject to a building permit to ensure
compliance with zoning regulations and the building and fire codes. Approval of a building
permit for a single-family dwelling meeting these criteria is ministerial. Staff involved in the
approval process includes members of the Department of Development Services and Fire
Department. Processing time is approximately six weeks, but highly dependent on the quality of
the initial submittal.
If the proposed single-family project does not conform to the development regulations of the
zone or does not meet the above criteria, it requires an administrative discretionary action.
Examples of an administrative discretionary approval include an administrative Development
Review Permit or Variance. An administrative Variance requires a public hearing before the
Director of Development Services while an administrative Development Review Permit does
not. Approval is based on findings as outlined in the zoning regulations. Processing time for a
hearing before the Director of Development Services or non-hearing decision is approximately
six weeks, but may extend to two months or more when processing involves compliance ,vith
 the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
A single-family project, which includes a minor or major subdivision, requires approval of a
Development Review Permit and subdivision map by the City Council at a public hearing. The
 basis for approval is consistency ,vith the General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, and subdivision
 regulations. The length of time required to process a subdivision map is variable, based on the
 size and complexity of the project. In most cases, the approval process can be completed in six
 months to a year.

MULTIFAMILY HOUSING
Multifamily housing on an existing parcel in any multi-family residential zone (R-7, R-14, R-22,
and R-30) is subject to a discretionary City Council approval of a Development Review Permit.
Staff involved in the approval process includes members of the Department of Development
Services and Fire Department, as well as other local, state, and federal agencies depending on the
impacts of the project. Processing time is approximately six months, but varies on the size of
the project and quality of the initial submittal.
If the multifamily housing is proposed as a condominium, or planned unit development, the
approval process also includes a subdivision map. The subdivision map and Development
Review Permit are processed concurrently. Processing time is approximately six months and the
project is also subject to discretionary review by the City Council.
The Development Review Permit procedure is established in Chapter 17.08 of the Santee
Municipal Code. The purpose of the permit is to:
    •   Encourage site and structural development which exemplify the best professional design
        practices;
    •   Enhance the residential and business property values within the city and                   in
        neighborhoods surrounding new development;
    •   Develop property in a manner which respects the physical and environmental
        characteristics of each site;
    •   Minimize stress from poorly designed development which can create physical and
        psychological conditions affecting the health, safety, comfort and general welfare of the
        inhabitants of the city; ensure that each new development is designed to best comply
        with the intent and purpose of the zone in which the property is located and with the
        City's General Plan; and
    •   Ensure that access to each property and circulation thereon are safe and convenient for
        pedestrians and vehicles.
The following types of projects are subject to a Development Review Permit:
    •    New construction on vacant property;
    •    One or more structural additions or new buildings, either ~vith a total floor area of one
         thousand square feet or more;
    •    Reconstruction or alteration of existing buildings on sites when the alteration
         significantly affects the exterior appearance of the building or traffic circulation of the
         site; and
    •    Conversion of residential, commercial or industrial buildings to condominiums.
In January 2013, the City modified the Municipal Code approval criteria for Development
Review Permits to achieve compliance with Government Code Section 65583(a)(4) by reducing
ambiguity, clarifying design requirements, and increasing development certainty. Development
Review Permit approval criteria are summarized as follows:
     •   The development must be designed in a manner that is compatible with and
         complementary to existing and potential development in the immediate vicinity of the
                                                                                           Page 3 - 21

           project site by such means as landscaping buffers, screens, site breaks, and use of
           compatible building colors and materials;
      •   The building designs must include variations in rooflines and wall planes, and
          incorporate windows, doors, projections, recesses, arcades and/ or other building details
           to avoid large wall surfaces;
      •   The removal of significant native vegetation must be minimized and the replacement
          vegetation and landscaping must be compatible with the vegetation of the surrounding
           area and must harmonize with the natural landscaping;
      •   Any development involving more than one building, or structure must provide common
           access roads and pedestrian walkways;
      •    Parking must be screened from view, to the extent feasible;
      •    Natural topography and scenic features of the site should be retained and incorporated
          into the proposed development to the extent feasible;
      •    Signage must comply with zoning regulations and not detract from the visual setting of
           the designated area or obstruct significant views; and
      •   Light fixtures for walks, parking areas, driveways, and other facilities must be provided in
           sufficient number and at proper locations to provide illumination and clear visibility to
           all outdoor areas, with minimal shadows or light leaving the property.
Additional approval criteria are provided for commercial, industrial, and residential uses. The
following criteria for multifamily residential developments are limited to the on-site functionality,
compatibility with adjacent uses, and aesthetic integration of projects:
      •    Buildings must be sited to avoid crowding and allow for a functional use of the space
           between buildings;
      •    Repetition of building or roof lines visible from public streets should be avoided;
      •    Adequate setback or single-story design is required for projects located adjacent to a
           single-family residential zone;
      •    Parking spaces must be located so as close as possible to the dwelling units they serve;
           and
      •    The adverse visual impact of parking areas adjacent to public streets must be minimized
           through the use of mounded or dense landscape strips, or low decorative masonry or
           stucco walls. Parking areas must be treated with decorative surface elements to identify
           pedestrian paths, nodes and driveways.
Achievement of the criteria can be met by the following:
      1. Site buildings to avoid crowding. Where multiple buildings are proposed, the minimum
           building separation shall be fifteen feet in accordance with Section 17.10.040.F.
      2. Site and design buildings to avoid repetitions of building or roof lines. This may be
           achieved through: variation in building setback; wall plane offsets; use of different
           colors and materials on exterior elevations for visual relief; and architectural projections
           above maximum permitted height in accordance with Section 17.10.050.C.
Page 3 - 22

                                                                          Housing Constraints
     3. For each five-foot increase in building height over 45 feet, the wall plane shall be
        stepped back an additional five feet.
    4. Where adjacent to a single-family residential zone, design buildings to ensure a transition
        in scale, form, and height with adjacent residential properties. Setbacks are required in
        accordance with Table 17.10.040.A. Designs may incorporate elements such as building
        massing and orientation, location of windows, stepbacks, building materials, deep roof
        overhangs, and other architectural features that serve to further transition the scale.
    5. Assigned parking spaces shall be located so as to be functional to the dwelling units they
        serve. Refer to Section 17.24.030.B for additional parking standards.
    6. The visual impact of surface parking areas adjacent to public streets shall be minimized
        through the use of mounded or dense landscape strips or low decorative masonry or
        stucco walls no more than three and one-half feet in height.
    7. In accordance with the "Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design" program,
        site and building design shall incorporate at a minimum, the following additional
        elements:
        a. Access control by defining entrances to the site, buildings and parking areas with
            landscaping, architectural design, lighting, and symbolic gateways; dead-end spaces
            shall be blocked ,vith fences or gates or otherwise prohibited.
        b. Natural surveillance by designing buildings and parking structures so that exterior
            entrances/ exits are visible from the street or by neighbors, and are well lit; windows
            shall be installed on all building elevations; recreation areas,_elevators and stairwells
            shall be clearly visible from as many of the units' windows and doors as possible;
            playgrounds shall be clearly visible from units and not located next to parking lots or
            streets.
        c. Territorial reinforcement by defining property lines with landscaping and
            decorative fencing; individually locking mailboxes shall be located next to the
            appropriate units and common mailbox facilities shall be well lit. All buildings shall
            be clearly addressed and visible from the adjoining street(s). Architecturally designed
            wayfinding signs shall be installed on the premises.
        d. Maintenance of the site and common areas by regular pruning of trees and shrubs
            back from windows, doors and walkways; exterior lighting shall be used and
            maintained and inappropriate outdoor storage shall be prohibited.
Only two findings must be made prior to the approval of a Development Review Permit: (1) the
proposed development must be compatible with the General Plan; and (2) meet the purpose and
design criteria of the Zoning Ordinance. These findings are required for all proposals subject to
Development Review, regardless of use.
Since the year 2000, nearly 1,400 multifamily units 1n 19 developments representing
approximately 3,748 new residents have been approved by the City Council subject to the
requirement for a Development Review Permit. No applications for multifamily units have been
denied. As the Development Review Permit is required for residential and non-residential uses
alike, and each use has common and unique review criteria established in the Municipal Code,
the permit requirement is not a constraint on the provision of multifamily housing in Santee.
                                                                                            Page 3 - 23

GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT AND/ OR ZONE CHANGE
A proposed housing project may include a general plan amendment and/ or rezone. This type of
approval is discretionary, requiring approval by the City Council at a public hearing. Approval
of a rezone or general plan amendment would depend on the applicant's ability to show that the
proposal would further and not detract from the City's established land use goals. General Plan
Amendments and Zone Code Amendments are generally processed concurrently with required
project entitlements to save time.
CEQA COMPLIANCE
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) compliance process determines the
timeframes for approval of many discretionary projects. Most projects are either Categorically
Exempt or handled through the negative declaration process, which is processed concurrently
with other discretionary approval processes. However, if an Environmental Impact Report is
required a minimum of six months is added to the approval process.
6.         BUILDING CODES AND ENFORCEMENT
The City of Santee adopted the 2010 California Building Code (CBC), Part 2, Title 24 of the
California Code of Regulations. The CBC is based on the International Building Code, 2009
Edition and considered to be the minimum necessary to protect the public's health, safety and
welfare. The City adopted the CBC with minor administrative changes and one amendment
related to minimum roof covering classifications for increased fire protection. The fire-related
amendment applies uniformly to all construction types throughout the City and is intended to
enhance public health and safety. Although this amendment to the CBC may result in an
increase in the cost of construction, such cost increase is minor relative to the overall cost of
construction. Furthermore, developers have not indicated that the amended roof covering
classifications constrain or otherwise limit development opportunities in Santee.
Substandard housing conditions within the City's existing housing stock are abated primarily
through code compliance. Identification of code violations is based on resident complaints. The
City then advises property owners on proper corrective action. The City has also adopted the
Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings to require the repair or removal of
any structure deemed a threat to public health and safety. In order to facilitate the code
compliance process for property maintenance, the City has adopted an administrative abatement
process in an effort to expedite compliance and reduce the City's enforcement costs. The
primary focus of these hearings has been property maintenance issues.
The City of Santee actively pursues reported code violations in the City. From January 2010
through October 2012, the Department of Development Services and Code Enforcement
conducted an estimated 8,515 inspections and resolved 3,424 cases. When code violations are
unable to be resolved through voluntary compliance or through the nuisance abatement
procedure, the City refers such cases to the City Attorney for prosecution. The City Attorney's
office may seek injunctions, receivership and civil lawsuits to achieve compliance with City
codes. Of the cases since 2010, 38 were referred to the City Attorney's office.

7.        HOUSING FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Both the federal Fair Housing Amendment Act (FHAA) and the California Fair Employment
and Housing Act direct local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e.
modifications or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such
accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and
enjoy a dwelling.
The City conducted an analysis of the Zoning Ordinance, permitting procedures, development
standards, and building codes to identify potential constraints for housing for persons with
disabilities. The City's policies and regulations regarding housing for persons with disabilities are
described below.
ZONING AND LAND USE
Under State Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (aka Lanterman Act), small
State-licensed residential care facilities for six or fewer persons must be treated as regular
residential uses and permitted in all residential districts; Santee is compliant with the Lanterman
Act. The Land Use Element and Zoning Ordinance provide for the development of multifamily
housing in the R-7, R-14, R-22, and R-30 zones. Traditional multifamily housing for persons
with special needs, such as apartments for seniors and the disabled, are considered regular
residential uses permitted in these zones. The City's land use policies and zoning provisions do
not constrain the development of such housing. State-licensed residential care facilities for more
than six persons are conditionally permitted in the R-2, R-7, R-14, R-22, and R-30 zones.
Potential conditions for approval may include hours of operation, security, loading requirements,
and management. Conditions would be similar to those for other similar uses in the same zones
and would not serve to unduly constrain the development of residential care facilities for more than
six persons. Occupancy standards for residential care facilities are the same as occupancy standards
for all other residential uses. The City has not adopted a spacing requirement for residential care
facilities.
In January 2013, the City updated the Zoning Ordinance to update and include provisions for
transitional and supportive housing. These facilities may serve persons with disabilities.
Consistent with State law, transitional and supportive housing facilities as defined in the Health
and Safety Code are permitted in all residential zones.
The City also accommodates persons with disabilities in group care facilities. Group care facilities
serve mentally disabled, mentally disordered or otherwise handicapped persons regardless of
whether they are living together as a single household unit. These facilities are separate from
State-licensed residential care facilities and require approval of a CUP in all residential zones.
Group care facilities are subject to the same review process, approval criteria, and findings as all
other uses that require a CUP, including large residential care facilities.
                                                                                            Page 3 - 25
City of Santee Ilousing Element
It may also be reasonable to accommodate requests from persons with disabilities to waive a
setback requirement or other standard of the zoning ordinance to ensure that homes are
accessible for the mobility impaired. Whether a particular modification is reasonable depends on
the circumstances, and must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Consistent with the State's
model Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance, policy objectives of the previous Housing
Element, and the current update, the City amended the Zoning Ordinance in January 2013 to
establish a ministerial procedure for handling requests for reasonable accommodation.
The City's Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance is based on the State's model ordinance.
When a request for reasonable accommodation is filed with the Department of Development
Services, it is referred to the Development Services Director for review and consideration. The
Development Services Director must consider the following criteria when determining whether
a requested accommodation is reasonable:
     1. The Applicant making the request for reasonable accommodation is an individual
         protected under the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988.
     2. The accommodation is necessary to make a specific dwelling unit(s) available to an
         individual protected under the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988.
     3. The requested accommodation would not impose an undue financial or administrative
         burden on the City.
     4. The requested accommodation would not require a fundamental alteration in the nature
         of a program, policy, and/ or procedure.
If necessary to reach a determination on the request for reasonable accommodation, the
Development Services Director may request further information from the applicant consistent
with the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, specifying in detail what information is
required.      Not more than 30 days after receiving a written request for reasonable
accommodation, the Ordinance requires the Development Services Director to issue a written
determination on the request. In the event that the Development Services Director requests
further information pursuant to the paragraph above, this 30-day period is suspended. Once the
Applicant provides a complete response to the request, a new 30-day period begins.
BUILDING CODES
The City enforces Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations that regulates the access and
adaptability of buildings to accommodate persons with disabilities. No unique restrictions are in
place that would constrain the development of housing for persons with disabilities.
Compliance with provisions of the Code of Regulations, California Building Standards Code,
and federal Americans "vith Disabilities Act (ADA) is assessed and enforced by the Building
Services Division of the Department of Development Services as a part of the building permit
submittal.
Government Code Section 12955.l(b) requires that 10 percent of the total dwelling units in
multifamily buildings without elevators consisting of three or more rental units or four or more
condominium units are subject to the following building standards for persons "vith disabilities:
   1. The primary entry to the dwelling unit shall be on an accessible route unless exempted by
       site impracticality tests.
Page 3 - 26
                                                                         Housing Constraints
  2. At least one powder room or bathroom shall be located on the primary entry level served
      by an accessible route.
  3. All rooms or spaces located on the primary entry level shall be served by an accessible
      route. Rooms and spaces located on the primary entry level and subject to this chapter
      may include but are not limited to kitchens, powder rooms, bathrooms, living rooms,
      bedrooms, or hallways.
  4. Common use areas shall be accessible.
  5. If common tenant parking is provided, accessible parking spaces is required.
PERMIT PROCESSING
Requests for reasonable accommodation with regard to zoning, permit processing, and building
codes will be reviewed and processed by the Building Services Division of the Department of
Development Services within 30 days of receipt. The reasonable accommodation procedures
are based on the State's model ordinance, and they clearly state how to apply for and obtain
reasonable accommodation; therefore, they do not represent a constraint on the development or
improvement or housing for persons with disabilities.
DEFINITION OF FAMILY
A "family" is defined in the Santee Zoning Ordinance as one or more individuals living together
as a single household unit. The City's Ordinance does not regulate residency by discriminating
between biologically related and unrelated persons nor does it regulate or enforce the number of
persons constituting a family. In conclusion, Santee's definition of "family" does not restrict
access to housing for persons with disabilities.
CONCLUSION
The City fully complies with the requirements of ADA and provides reasonable accommodation
for housing intended for persons with disabilities on a case-by-case basis.
C. Public Policy Constraints
State and federal requirements may act as a barrier to the development or rehabilitation of
housing, and affordable housing in particular. These include State prevailing wage requirements,
Article 34 of the State Constitution and environmental review requirements.
1.      STATE PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENTS
The State Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) has greatly expanded the kinds of projects
that require the payment of prevailing wages. Labor Code Section 1720, which applies
prevailing wage rates to public works of over $1,000, now defines public works to mean
construction, alteration, installation, demolition, or repair work done under contract and paid for
in whole or in part out of public funds. For example, public transfer of an asset for less than fair
market value, such as a land write-down, would now be construed to be paid for in part out of
public funds and trigger prevailing wage requirements.
                                                                                          Page 3 - 27
City of Santee Housing Element
While the cost differential in prevailing and standard wages varies based on the skill level of the
occupation, prevailing wages tend to add to the overall cost of development. In the case of
affordable housing projects, prevailing wage requirements could effectively reduce the number
of affordable units that can be achieved with public subsidies. The following types of projects
are not however required to pay prevailing wages:
    •    Residential projects financed through issuance of bonds that receive an allocation
         through the State; or
    •    Single-family projects financed through issuance of qualified mortgage revenue bonds or
         mortgage credit certificates.
2.       ARTICLE 34 OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION
Article 34 of the State Constitution requires a majority vote of the electorate to approve the
development, construction, or acquisition by a public body of any "low rent housing project"
within that jurisdiction. In other words, for any projects to be built and/ or operated by a public
agency where at least 50 percent of the occupants are low income and rents are restricted to
affordable levels, the jurisdiction must seek voter approval known as "Article 34 authority" to
authorize that number of units.
Santee has not sought voter approval to grant "Article 34 authority." In the past, Article 34 may
have prevented certain projects from being built. In practice, most public agencies have learned
how to structure projects to avoid triggering Article 34, such as limiting public assistance to 49
percent of the units in the project. Furthermore, the State legislature has enacted Sections
37001, 37001.3, and 37001.5 of the Health and Safety Code to clarify ambiguities relating to the
scope of the applicability of Article 34. Although Santee does not have Article 34 authority, the
City does not view this as a significant constraint to the development of affordable housing since
the City does not typically function as a developer or owner of low-cost housing.
3.       ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
State and federal regulations require environmental review of proposed discretionary projects
(e.g., subdivision maps, development review permits, etc.). Costs resulting from the
environmental review process are also added to the cost of housing and are passed on to the
consumer. These costs include fees charged by local government and private consultants needed
to complete the environmental analysis, and from delays caused by the mandated public review
periods. However, the presence of these regulations helps preserve the environment and ensure
environmental safety to Santee residents.
D. Infrastructure and Public Service Constraints
Another factor adding to the cost of new home construction is the cost of providing adequate
infrastructure such as streets, curbs, gutter, sidewalks, water and sewer lines, and street lighting.
The cost of these additions or improvements is borne by developers and then, to the extent
possible, added to the cost of new housing units, impacting affordability.
Page 3 - 28

                                                                          Housing Constraints
Fees collected for new development contribute to the cost of housing and may constrain the
development of lower priced housing units. Development Impact Fees are collected by the City
to cover the cost of providing drainage, traffic, park, and other public facility improvements for
new development.
1.      WATER AND SEWER
Padre Dam Municipal Water District charges fees to provide sewer, water and recycled water
service. At present, the Water District indicates adequate capacity is available to meet the City's
projected water and sewer needs. The District's Integrated Facilities Plan (2001) and Urban
Water Management Plan (2010), which relied upon the City's General Plan to project future
demand, indicate adequate sewer treatment capacity and water supply to accommodate buildout
of the City's land use designations. Furthermore, environmental documents prepared in 2010
and 2013 pursuant the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for rezones to
accommodate the fourth and fifth Housing Element cycle RHNAs concluded that the additional
residential capacity created by the increased development potential would not have a significant
impact on the District's sewer facilities or water supply.
The District's water service limitations for Santee is to an approximate maximum elevation of
525 feet above mean sea level; however, some of the hillside areas have existing service to higher
elevations due in part to the new Magnolia Summit Reservoir and the Woodside Meadows
Reservoir in the Northcote/Shadow Hills area. New development serving higher elevations,
including within the North Magnolia area, will require the creation of new pressure zones and
reservo1.rs.
Development, requiring an expansion of existing water, sewer, or recycled water service, will be
coordinated with the Integrated Facilities Plan and specialized localized development demand
studies, as necessary. The District is currently soliciting proposals from consultants to prepare a
Water/Wastewater Master Plan, which will replace the Integrated Facilities Plan. The City will
support the District in this update process by providing land use data and continuing to
coordinate during review of development applications and during construction.
Senate Bill 1087 (enacted 2006) requires that water providers develop written policies that grant
priority to proposed development that includes housing affordable to lower income households.
The legislation also prohibits water providers from denying or conditioning the approval of
development that includes housing affordable to lower-income households, unless specific
written findings are made. The City will provide a copy of the adopted Housing Element to the
Padre Dam Municipal Water District within 30 days of adoption. The City will also continue to
coordinate with the District to ensure affordable housing developments receive priority water
service prov1s10n.
2.       SCHOOLS
The Santee Elementary School District and Grossmont Union High School District each
collects school fees for the provision of school facilities. The fees are assessed for residential,
commercial, and industrial uses by building square footage.
                                                                                          Page 3 - 29
City of Santee Ilousing Element
3.        INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS
Both on-site improvements and off-site improvements required for new construction affect the
cost of housing. On-site improvements typically include drainage facilities, sewer/water
facilities, and street frontage improvements consisting of curbs, gutters, sidewalks and
undergrounding of utilities. Off-site improvements typically include drainage facilities, parks (or
park-in-lieu fees), traffic improvements and sewer/water facilities. While affecting the cost of
housing, these improvements are necessary to ensure public health and safety.
Fee reductions, waivers, or reimbursements or other incentives and/ or concessions may be
granted with the commitment to dedicate as affordable a portion of new residential units or
through the assemblage and consolidation of smaller parcels (Section 6, Programs 10 and 11).
E. Environmental Constraints
Approximately 45 percent of land within the City is currently undeveloped. The primary
undeveloped areas are canyons and hillsides in the north (Fanita Ranch and the north Magnolia
Avenue area), southeast (portions of Rattlesnake Mountain) and steeply sloped and rolling
terrain in the southwest portions of the City. A significant amount of undeveloped acreage is
also found along the San Diego River corridor including the floodway, the floodplain, a
biological habitat preserve west of the Carlton Hills Blvd bridge, and several large, developable
parcels in the Town Center owned by the County of San Diego, parts of which have been
identified in the residential sites inventory (Section 4, Housing Resources). None of the sites
identified in the sites inventory are unduly constrained by environmental factors.
1.        BIOLOGICAL RESOURCE AREAS
T he City's Multiple Species Conservation Program (MSCP) Draft Subarea Plan identifies
approximately 2,600 acres in the City that will be preserved as permanent open space to protect
sensitive plant and animal species and their habitats once the plan is adopted. The MSCP Draft
Subarea Plan is a system of open space and habitat that comprise almost one-fourth of Santee's
total area when completed. This preserve system will function as permanent open space for the
community. None of the sites identified in residential sites inventory (Appendix C, Sites
Inventory) are located within the MSCP Draft Subarea Plan preserve area nor are they unduly
constrained by other environmental factors.
2.        FIRE HAZARDS
The most serious threat of fire in the City occurs at the interface between the undeveloped
foothill/hillside areas and the urban areas. These foothill/hillside areas contain large quantities
of grassland and other combustible plants that could place structures within close proximity to
potentially high severity fire hazards. The prevalence of brush-covered hillsides, some of which
are not easily accessible, add to the City's fire hazards. As a result, Santee has adopted the
California Fire Code (2010) with additional amendments to address development proximate to
an "Urban-Wildland Interface".
Page 3 - 30
                                                                        Housing Constraints
Santee requires a fuel-modified defensible space, comprised of two distinct brush management
areas referred to as Zone One and Zone Two. Within Zone One, vegetation is irrigated, and
trees are fire-resistive with crowns separated from structures by a minimum of ten feet. Within
Zone Two, plants are comprised of low-growing, fire resistive shrubs and ground covers.
Building standards include requirements for fire sprinkler systems, fire-resistive Class A roof
coverings, and tempered glass.
The most common type of fire is a "common combustible" fire, which starts with common
materials such as wood, cloth, furniture, brush, etc. Roughly 80 percent of the fires in Santee are
in single-family residences. A significant fire, one that burns a minimum of 500 acres and
requires the heavy use of mutual aid resources, occurs in Santee on a periodic basis.
Fire safety is integrated with project design for proposed developments in the Urban-Wildland
interface areas of the City. The City implements a Fire Protection Plan for the Urban-Wildland
Interface that requires provision of defensible space for development along the Urban-Wildland
interface to mitigate for fire hazards. Although the City's Fire Protection Plan may constrain
development on certain vulnerable sites, this constraint does not affect any of the sites included
in the residential sites inventory of Appendix C, Sites Inventory identified for lower or
moderate income households.
                                                                                          Page 3 - 31

Section 4
Housing Resources
This section summarizes the resources available for the development, rehabilitation, and
preservation of housing in Santee. The analysis includes an evaluation of the adequacy of the
City's land inventory to accommodate Santee's regional housing needs goals for the 2013-2021
planning period.         Financial resources available to support housing activities and the
administrative resources available to assist in implementing the City's housing programs are also
analyzed in this section.
A.         Available Sites for Housing
State law requires communities to play an active role in ensuring that enough housing is available
to meet expected population growth in the San Diego region. Periodically as set forth by State
statutory timeframe, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) is authorized to
set forth specific goals for the amount of new housing that should be planned for in each
jurisdiction over a specified time period, in this case 2010-2020. This section discusses how
Santee will plan for the provision of housing for all economic segments by 2020.
1.       FUTURE HOUSING NEED
SANDAG developed a Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) based on the California
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) determination for the region's
"fair share" of statewide forecasted growth through 2020. Overall, the region needs to plan for
an additional 161,980 units. Santee's share of the regional housing need for the 2010-2020
RHNA period is allocated by SANDAG based on a number of factors, including recent growth
trends, income distribution, and capacity for future growth.
Santee was assigned a future housing need of 3,660 units for the 2010-2020 RHNA period,
representing 2.3 percent of the total regional housing need. Of the 3,660 units allocated to
Santee, the City must plan for units affordable to all income levels, specifically: 457 extremely
low income, 457 very low income, 694 low income, 642 moderate income, and 1,410 upper
.             . I
income uruts.
I The City has a RHNA allocation of 914 very low income units (inclusive of extremely low income units).
Pursuant to State law (AB 2634), the City must project the number of extremely low income housing needs based
on Census income distribution or assume 50 percent of the very low income units as extremely low. Assuming an
even split, the City's RHNA allocation of 914 very low income units may be divided into 457 very low and 457
extremely low income units. However, for purposes of identifying adequate sites for the RHNA allocation, State
law does not mandate the separate accounting for the extremely low income category.
                                                                                                     Page 4 -1
City of Santee Ilousing Element
2.       CREDITS TOWARDS THE            RHNA
Since the RHNA uses January 1, 2010 as the baseline for growth projections for the Housing
Element planning period, jurisdictions may count the number of new units issued building
permits or certificates of occupancy since January 1, 2010 toward their RHNA. This section
describes the applicability of the rehabilitation and new construction credits, while latter sections
discuss the availability of land to address the remaining RHNA. Table 4-1 summarizes Santee's
RHNA credits and the remaining housing need through December 31, 2020.

CEDAR CREEK APARTMENTS
The Cedar Creek Apartments was completed in 2010 and includes 48 dwelling units on 2.52
acres at 8616-8630 Fanita Drive, in the R-7 zone. Of the 48 units, 47 are rent-restricted to lower
income households for 55 years. The affordability mix may vary, but at least 10 units must be
reserved for very low income households. For the purposes of determining credits against the
RHNA, the following affordability is assumed: 10 very low income units, 37 low income units,
and one above moderate income unit. Table 4-2 provides additional details about the project.

FORESTER SQUARE APARTMENTS
The Forester Square Apartments was substantially completed at the time of preparation of the
Housing Element; full occupancy is anticipated in early 2013. The development provides a total
of 44 housing units in the R-14 zone, of which, 43 are deed restricted as affordable to lower
income households for 55 years. Like the Cedar Creek Apartments, the day-to-day affordability
mix may vary, but at least five units must be reserved for very low income households at all
times. For the purposes of determining credits against the RHNA, the following affordability is
assumed: five very low income units, 38 low income units, and one above moderate income unit.

OTHER BUILDING PERMITS
In addition to the recently completed units within the Cedar Creek and Forrester Square
apartment developments, 221 building permits have been issued for the construction of for-sale
single-family detached, townhome and condominium product types between January 1, 2010
and December 31, 2012. Given the product mix and the prevailing sales prices, most of these
units are assumed to be affordable to above moderate income households. However, 35 units
permitted since January 1, 2010 were offered at prices affordable to moderate income
household. As shown in Table 2-19 on page 2-26, large moderate income households can
afford to purchase homes up to $395,100 without incurring cost burden. Of the 12 units
constructed at Mission Villas Trails in 2011, seven units were sold at prices between $383,000
and $395,000. The first nine units sold within the 28-unit Las Brisas townhome development
that is currently under construction ranged from $260,000 to $299,000; listings for the remaining
19 units range between $321,000 and $380,000. All of the units sold or pending sale ,vithin the
Mission Villas Trails and Las Brisas townhome developments have three or four bedrooms, the
minimum size necessary to avoid overcrowding among large households. Therefore, 35 of the
221 building permits issued since January 1, 2010 can be credited against the City's moderate
income RHNA.

   3.        RESIDENTIAL SITES INVENTORY
   Because the RHNA period extends from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2020, a jurisdiction
   may meet the RHNA requirement using potential development on suitable vacant and/ or
   underutilized sites within the community. A jurisdiction must document how zoning and
   development standards on the sites facilitate housing to accommodate the remaining RHNA
   identified in Table 4-1 on page 4-2. Santee currently has adequate land capacity to meet the
   needs of all income groups. The following Table 4-4 is a summary of the detailed parcel data
   included in Appendix C, Sites Inventory.

REALISTIC CAPACITY ASSUMPTIONS
Most residential zone districts in Santee establish a range of allowable density. For example,
density within the R-14 zone may range between 14 and 22 dwelling units per acre (dua) and
between 22 and 30 dua is allowed within the R-22 zone. For purposes of calculating the realistic
capacity of sites in Appendix C, Sites Inventory, the midpoint of allowable density was used in
these districts. This is considered a highly conservative assumption as development projects
proposed in Santee's multifamily districts (R-7, R-14, and R-22) have historically been approved
at the upper end of the allowable density. The R-22-TC and R-30-TC districts within the Town
Center Specific Plan (fCSP) do not have an allowable density range; development within these
districts must meet the established density (22 and 30 dua, respectively). Therefore, the TCSP
density threshold was used for sites in these districts.
AFFORDABILITY, SUITABILITY, AND AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS
This subsection describes the assumptions applied to each parcel in Appendix C, Sites
Inventory, to determine affordability level and establish the suitability and availability for
development within the planning period.
Very Low Income
Zone districts that allow 30 dwelling units per acre are considered sufficient to accommodate
housing that is affordable to lower income households "by default" per Government Code
Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B). The City has two land use designations and zone districts that meet
this default affordable density: the R-22 (22-30 dua) and R-30-TC (30 dua) districts. The City
identified 32.48 acres on two large parcels within these zoning districts that are vacant and
available for development in the planning period and have capacity to accommodate at least 918
very low income units.
The 12.27-acre R-22 site was rezoned from R-14 (14-22 dua) by the City in January 2013 to
create additional capacity and incentive for development for the current Housing Element
update. The 20.21-acre R-30-TC site is owned by the County and was rezoned in 2010 to create
capacity needed to accommodate the lower income RHNA for the 2005-2012 Housing Element.
The minimum and maximum density of the R-30-TC zone is 30 dua. Section 17.10.020(H) of
the Zoning Ordinance states, in part, "New development in this zone is required to meet the
minimum density of the zone." Given the site area, a residential development must yield at least
600 units to be in compliance with the City's Municipal Code. The City anticipates a single
development proposal. City oversight of the project will ensure compliance with mixed use
provisions, and, as a single development proposal, will offer greater timing certainty,
comprehensive, sustainable development that benefits residents and the community.
                                                                                         Page 4- 5
City of Santee Housing Element
Low Income
The City identified 30.81 acres on 14 parcels that are available and have capacity to
accommodate at least 654 low income units by 2020. Of these parcels, five are zoned R-22 (22-
30 dua) and can accommodate low income units "by default" per Government Code Section
65583.2(c)(3)(B). The two vacant R-22 parcels are located adjacent to each other, creating
consolidation potential. The other three R-22 parcels are also located adjacent to each other and
are highly underutilized. The underutilized properties are currently occupied by a small
commercial building, small animal raising, two single-family homes, and vehicle storage. All five
R-22 parcels were rezoned in January 2013. The two adjacent vacant parcels were rezoned from
R-14 (14-22 dua) and the three adjacent underutilized parcels were rezoned from General
Commercial (GC).
The other nine parcels are zoned R-14 and R-22-TC. The maximum allowable density in these
zones is 22 dua. In cases where a city or county does not have enough residential sites zoned at
30 dua to meet their RHNA allocation for lower income households, depending on local market
conditions, State law allows alternative analysis of feasibility for construction of affordable units
on sites zoned for less than 30 dua. The City recently approved two affordable housing
developments at less than 30 dua: the Cedar Creek development in the R-7 zone (7-14 dua) and
the Forester Square project in the R-14 zone (14-22 dua). Both projects were completed within
the current Housing Element RHNA period and provide 75 low income units and 15 very low
income units. Through the City's density bonus ordinance, Cedar Creek achieved 19 dua per
acre and Forester Square achieved 26 dua. The average density of these two projects is 22 dua.
This average density of the Cedar Creek and Forester Square projects demonstrates that the City
can accommodate housing affordable to lower income households at less than 30 dua. Although
the Cedar Creek and Forester Square developments provided very low income housing an
average of 22 dua, the proportion of total units that are reserved for this income group is
relatively small (20 and 11 percent, respectively). As a conservative analysis, the City has
assumed that larger parcels zoned R-14 and R-22-TC can accommodate housing affordable to
low income households.
The nine R-14 and R-22-TC parcels that are suitable to accommodate low income households
are all greater than one acre in size; the vacant R-14 parcel is 2.28 acres, the vacant R-22-TC
parcel is 12.77 acres, and the average size of the seven underutilized R-14 parcels is 1.30 acres.
The seven underutilized R-14 parcels are occupied by small, older one-story single-family homes
and three have consolidation potential as they are located adjacent to each other.
Moderate Income
Another 51.19 acres on 89 parcels in the R-7 (7-14 dua), R-14 (14-22 dua), and R-22-TC (22 dua)
zones are available to accommodate at least 658 housing moderate income units within the
RHNA period. The parcels are relatively small (average 0.57 acres) and most are developed.
The developed properties are highly underutilized -- small one-story single-family homes built in
the 1960s and in poor or fair condition on land zoned to accommodate much higher density
typify existing uses and improvements. Nearly all of the parcels have consolidation potential
given their adjacency to vacant or other highly underutilized properties.
Page 4 - 6
                                                                            Housing Resources
The Cedar Creek development involved the consolidation of smaller underutilized parcels to
provide lower income housing on land zoned R-7. Although the Cedar Creek project
demonstrates that a developer could assemble and consolidate smaller parcels and develop
housing that is affordable to lower income households on land zoned to accommodate at least
seven units per acre, for the purposes of this analysis the City has assumed that these smaller
vacant and underutilized parcels are suitable to accommodate moderate income housing. The
Housing Costs and Affordability analysis in Section 2.E.5 starting on page 2-22 of this Housing
Element also supports this affordability assumption. Based on the rental and for-sale housing
market data presented in Tables 2-16 and 2-17 on pages 2-23 and 2-24 (respectively), moderate
income households can afford a wide range of apartments, condominiums, and single-family
detached dwellings in Santee. Therefore, even with limited or no consolidation, development or
redevelopment of these parcels with housing affordable to moderate income households within
the planning period is feasible.
Above Moderate Income
Santee's remaining RHNA for above moderate income households will be accommodated on
the 2,600-acre Fanita property, which is located in the PD (Planned Development) zone in the
northern part of the City. The PD zone does not contain development standards for Fanita
Ranch. Rather, the area will be developed in a manner consistent with the 12 General Plan
Guiding Principles for Fanita Ranch. Of these, several relate to housing and related amenities.
        o  The plan shall contain a mix of house sizes on lot sizes distributed as follows:
                • 6,000 sq. ft. lots - 20 percent of total lots
                • 10,000 sq. ft. lots - 20 percent of total lots
                • 20,000 sq. ft. lots - 60 percent of total lots or greater
        o  The Fanita Ranch area shall not be subdivided until a Planned Development is
           adopted by the City of Santee. The exact number of parcels and unit count are not
           specified for the PD zone in Fanita Ranch; however, based on the gross acreage and
           on the unit counts of recent development proposals, the City estimates that at least
            1,395 dwelling units can be constructed in this area, and is committed to ensuring
            that this unit count is achievable within the planning period.
        o  The plan may consider alternative residential design and grading requirements which
            are sensitive to the existing topography and out of the City's viewshed.
        o   Regarding phasing, all public improvements and land uses shall be phased according
            to detailed phasing plan. Public improvements would be constructed prior to or
            simultaneously with their projected need. The plan would contain performance
            standards or other measurements for determining the timing for all public
           improvements. Performance standards may include any appropriate means of
            measurement to determine when a given public improvement is deemed necessary
            by the City. Private land uses shall be phased to ensure that land uses deemed
            desirable by the City (i.e. golf courses, estate units, executive units, etc.) will be
            included within the earliest phases of the Fanita Ranch.
                                                                                            Page 4 - 7

City of Santee Housing Element
          o   To ensure that proposed development is appropriate for a given site, the Planned
              Development would contain schematic or illustrative development plans which show
              prototype circulation systems and residential product types for each area designated
              by residential development.
FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS
The Cedar Creek (2010) and Forester Square (2013) housing developments demonstrate the
feasibility of constructing affordable housing in Santee on sites zoned for less than 30 units per
acre. The Cedar Creek Apartments was built at 19.0 dua with a per-unit gap financing of
$112,255 (Table 4-2 on page 4-2). The Forester Square Apartments achieved 26.8 dua;
however, the per-unit gap financing was $127,767 (Table 4-2 on page 4-3). The average density
of these two projects was 22.9 dua. Forester Square was an applicant-initiated request to rezone
Light Industrial to R-14. This demonstrates that the applicant found the R-14 zone, which
allows 14 to 22 dua, sufficient to provide affordable housing. Both developers assembled
smaller contiguous parcels to facilitate their projects. The per-unit gap financing for the 19 dua
Cedar Creek Apartments was 14 percent lower than the per-unit gap financing required for the
higher density 26.8 dua Forester Square Apartments. Therefore, based on the recent experience
of two affordable housing developers, it can be concluded that it is feasible to construct lower
income housing in Santee in zones that allow up to 22 dua, including the R-14 and R-22-TC
zones.
A 2012 study of affordable housing projects in San Diego County constructed since 2009
provides additional evidence that constructing affordable housing is feasible at densities less than
22 units per acre.2 The report found that "surface parked garden style apartments were found to
generate the lowest financing gap" when compared to lower density townhomes and higher
density stacked flats. The overall median density of projects included in the study was 22.1 dua
and the report identified four garden-style apartment projects constructed at less than 22 dua,
including one that achieved 21.6 dua in Lakeside, which is an unincorporated community that
borders Santee on the east.
LOT CONSOLIDATION INCENTIVES
Approximately 45 percent of the acreage identified in Appendix C, Sites Inventory, and zoned
for multifamily uses consists of parcels that are smaller than one-acre in size. All of these parcels
are identified as suitable to accommodate moderate income households; however, affordability
for lower income households may achieved through lot assemblage and consolidation. In recent
years, existing zoning and development standards have enabled developers to assemble and
consolidate smaller underutilized parcels to facilitate the construction of multifamily housing.
The Cedar Creek and Forester Square apartments involved the consolidation and redevelopment
of smaller parcels previously occupied by single-family homes to provide lower income housing
and the Las Brisas development (currently under construction) involved the consolidation of
parcels that included a single-family dwelling and an auto repair and vehicle storage yard to
provide market-rate townhomes. Notwithstanding this successful track record, the City
acknowledges that market forces and dwindling federal, State, regional, and local resources may

                                                                            Housing Resources
make similar consolidation more difficult in the future. In response, this Housing Element
update includes a new program to amend the TCSP and update the Zoning Ordinance to offer
incentives to developers who acquire and propose consolidation of smaller parcels to provide
well-planned and high quality residential developments (Section 6, Program 13). Specific
incentives to be considered include alternative parking options (e.g., tandem, shared, and off-site
parking) and graduated density bonuses (e.g., density bonuses proportional to the number of lots
and total area consolidated).
4.      INFRASTRUCTURE AvAILABILITY
As discussed in details in the Section 3, Housing Constraints, no significant public service or
infrastructure constraints have been identified. Public infrastructure improvements required of
new developments, impact fees, and planned city improvements of facilities help ensure that
services and facilities are available to both current and future residents. Parks, schools,
emergency services facilities, and other public facilities are also extended in this manner. All
vacant and redevelopable sites identified in Appendix C, Sites Inventory, as suitable for lower
and moderate income households can be readily served by existing infrastructure and services.
Substantial new infrastructure would need to be built to serve the Fanita Ranch property;
however, provision for infrastructure required to serve future development on the property is
assured by conditions of project approval.
5.      ADEQUACY OF SITES TO MEET REGIONAL FAIR SHARE .ALLOCATION
Table 4-5 summarizes the City's accommodation of the RHNA for all income groups during
the planning period. After accounting for development credits and the realistic capacity of
vacant and underutilized sites, the City has identified surplus capacity of at least 278 units for the
planning period, including a minimum surplus of 19 very low income units, 35 low income unit,
51 moderate income units, and 173 above moderate income units.

B.          Financial Resources
The City of Santee has access to several federal and local resources to achieve its housing and
community development goals. Specific funding sources will be utilized based on the eligibility
and requirements of each project or program. The City leverages, to the maximum extent
feasible, local funds with federal and State funds in meeting its housing and community
development objectives. With the State's dissolution of the redevelopment agencies in early
2012, the City's primary resources to address housing and community development needs are
now from federal CDBG and HOME funds. In addition, the City works closely with the County
and other service providers in funding collaborations (Section 6, Program 11).
1.         COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT (CDBG)
The CDBG Program is administered by HUD. Through this program, the federal government
provides monies to cities to undertake certain kinds of community development and housing
activities.
Activities proposed by the City must meet the objectives and eligibility criteria of CDBG
legislation. The primary CDBG objective is the development of viable urban communities,
including decent housing and a suitable living environment, and expanding economic
opportunity, principally for persons of lower income (<80 percent AMI). Each activity must
meet one of the three broad national objectives of:
      •    Benefit to lower income families
      •    Aid in the prevention of elimination of slums or blight
      •    Meet other community development needs having a particular urgency because existing
           conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the
           community
Santee's CDBG funding allocation has declined steadily in recent years. The City's current
allocation is approximately $280,000 annually. A portion of these funds are frequently used to
assist non-profit organizations that provide home improvement and repair services to lower
income households (Section 6, Program 3). CDBG funds are also used to fund supportive
services for the homeless (Section 6, Program 11).
2.         HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP ACT (HOME)
The HOME program provides federal funds for the development and rehabilitation of
affordable rental and ownership housing for lower income households (<80 percent of AMI).
The program gives local governments the flexibility to fund a wide range of affordable housing
activities through housing partnerships with private industry and non-profit organizations.
HOME funds can be used for activities that promote affordable rental housing and
homeownership by low income households, including:
       •   Building acquisition
       •   New construction and reconstruction

                                                                          Housing Resources
    •    Moderate or substantial rehabilitation
    •    Homebuyer assistance
    •    Rental Assistance
Strict requirements govern the use of HOME funds. Two major requirements are that the funds
must be: 1) used for activities that target lower income families; and 2) matched 25 percent by
non-federal funding sources.
HOME program funding allocated to Santee has declined steadily in recent years. The current
annual allocation is approximately $170,000 annually. The City uses HOME funds to provide
downpayment and closing cost assistance to first-time lower and moderate income homebuyers
(Section 6, Program 7).
3.       HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER ASSISTANCE
In the course of the Housing Element cycle, the City has participated in the Housing Choice
Voucher program, which extends rental subsidies to very low income (up to 50 percent of AMI)
family and seniors who spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent. The subsidy
represents the difference between the excess of 30 percent of the monthly income and the actual
rent. Rental assistance is issued to the recipients as vouchers, which permit tenants to locate
their own housing and rent units beyond the federally determined fair market rent in an area,
provided the tenants pay the extra rent increment.
The City of Santee contracts with the San Diego County Housing Authority to administer the
Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 6, Program 5). According to the Housing
Authority, approximately 344 households received assistance through the program as of June 30,
2012. Among voucher recipients, 133 were seniors (39 percent), 165 were small families with
fewer than five members (48 percent), and 46 were large families \vith five or more persons (13
percent). As of June 30, 2012, 1,122 Santee residents were on the County's waiting list for
vouchers.
C.        Administrative Resources
A variety of public and private sector organizations have been involved in housing and
community development activities in Santee. These agencies are involved in the improvement
of the housing stock, expansion of affordable housing opportunities, preservation of existing
affordable housing, and/ or provision of housing assistance to households in need.
1.       CITY OF SANTEE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENT SERVICES
The Department of Development provides housing and community development services to
residents, developers, and others interested in housing issues. The Division is responsible for
the development of the City's HUD Consolidated Five-Year and Annual Action Plans for the
expenditure of Community Planning and Development (CPD) funds, including CDBG and
HOME. The Department is also responsible for ensuring the implementation of the City's
housing programs.
                                                                                      Page 4- 11

2.       SAN DIEGO COUNTY HOUSING AUTHORITY
The San Diego County Housing Authority coordinates and administers Housing Choice
Voucher Program rental assistance on behalf of the City of Santee. According to the Authority,
approximately 344 households received assistance through the program as of September 2012.
3.       NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS
The City of Santee works with a number of nonprofit organizations to provide affordable
housing and supportive services to residents in need. These include, but are not limited to, the
following organizations.
WAKELAND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
Wakeland Development Corporation is the developer of the 44-unit affordable Forester Square
Apartments, which are currently under construction. Wakeland has developed, acquired and
rehabilitated over 5,700 units of affordable housing, in communities in San Diego County and
throughout California. Wakeland utilizes federal, state and local funding resources including tax
exempt bonds and tax credits and leverages other funds from the private and public sectors to
provide affordable housing.
LUTHERAN SOCIAL SERVICES
The Lutheran Social Services organization implements a Caring Neighbors Minor Home Repair
Program. The program provides lower income households with minor home repair services.
Examples of home improvement and repair include the installation of home security devices, in-
home ADA improvements, weatherproofing, etc. The City has provided CDBG funds for this
program in recent years.
CRISIS HOUSE
Crisis House provides case homeless prevention and intervention services to meet the
immediate needs of the homeless and near-homeless in Santee. Immediate need includes the
provision of food, temporary shelter, health care, and other social services. The City has
provided CDBG funds for this program in recent years.
CENTER FOR COMMUNITY SOLUTIONS
Project Safehouse, run by the Center for Community Solutions, provides emergency shelter and
transitional housing for women and children who are victims of domestic violence. The City has
provided CDBG funds for this program in recent years.

CENTER FOR SOCIAL ADVOCACY
The Center for Social Advocacy promotes housing opportunities for all persons regardless of
race, religion, sex, family size, marital status, ancestry, national origin, color, or disability. The
Center also provides tenant/landlord mediation services. The City has provided CDBG funds
for this program in recent years.
SANTEE MINISTERIAL COUNCIL
The Santee Ministerial Council operates the Santee Food Bank, which provides emergency food
supplies and assistance for needy extremely low income individuals and households, including
the homeless. The City has provided CDBG funds for this program in recent years.
D. Energy Conservation Opportunities
The primary uses of energy in urban areas are for transportation, lighting, water heating, and
space heating and cooling. The high cost of energy demands that efforts be taken to reduce or
nurunuze the overall level of urban energy consumption. Construction of energy efficient
buildings can add to the production costs of ownership and rental housing. Over time,
however, housing with energy conservation features should reduce occupancy costs as the
consumption of fuel and electricity is decreased. This can result in monthly housing costs that
are equal to or less than what they otherwise would have been had no energy conservation
devices been incorporated in the new residential buildings. This section provides an overview of
opportunities for energy conservation during the housing planning period.
1. STATE REGULATIONS
Title 24 of the California Administrative Code establishes energy conservation standards that
must be applied to all new residential buildings. The regulations specify energy saving design for
walls, ceilings and floor installations, as well as heating and cooling equipment and systems, gas
cooling devices, conservation standards and the use of non-depleting energy sources, such as
solar energy or wind power. Compliance with the energy standards is achieved by satisfying
certain conservation requirements and an energy budget. Among the alternative ways to
meeting the energy standards are the following:
     •   Alternative 1: The passive solar approach which requires proper solar orientation,
         appropriate levels of thermal mass, south facing windows, and moderate insulation
         levels.
     •   Alternative 2: Generally requires higher levels of insulation than Alternative 1, but has
         no thermal mass or window orientation requirements.
     •   Alternative 3: Also is without passive solar design but requires active solar water heating
         in exchange for less stringent insulation and/ or glazing requirements.
                                                                                              Page 4 - 13

City of Santee llousing Element
The City implements Title 24 requirements through Title 15, Building and Construction, of the
Municipal Code. Residential developers must comply with these standards while localities are
responsible for enforcing the energy conservation regulations.
2. STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS
The California Department of Community Services and Development in partnership with the
network of local community services agencies that assist lower-income households, administers
the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and Energy Low Income
Weatherization Assistance Program (DOE-LIWAP). LIHEAP provides financial assistance to
lower income households to offset the costs of heating and/ or cooling their residences. DOE-
LIWAP provides installation and weatherization measures that increase energy efficiency of
existing residential and multi-family dwellings occupied by lower income persons. Eligible
weatherization services include a wide variety of energy efficiency measures that encompass the
building envelope, its heating and cooling systems, its electrical system, and electricity consuming
appliances. In San Diego County, the energy service provider is Campesinos Unidos, Inc.
3. CITY OF SANTEE INITIATIVES
The City will continue strict enforcement of local and state energy regulations for new residential
construction, and continue providing residents with information on energy efficiency (Section
6, Program 1). Specifically, the City encourages the use of energy conservation devices such as
low flush toilets and weatherization improvements in new development. The City also promotes
design concepts that utilize technological advances in the application of alternative energy
sources which make the use of the natural climate to increase energy efficiency and reduce
housing costs.
4. PRIVATE SECTOR PROGRAMS
The following private sector energy conservation programs are available to housing developers
and Santee residents:
    •    California Alternative Rates for Energy (CARE): Lower-income customers enrolled
         in the CARE program receive a 20 percent discount on their electric and natural gas bills
         and are not billed in higher rate tiers that were created for San Diego Gas & Electric
         (SDG&E). CARE is funded through a rate surcharge paid by all other utility customers.
    •    Energy Assistance Program Rate (EAPR): Includes a one-year electric rate reduction
         home energy audit, free compact fluorescent lights, and replacement of inefficient
         refrigerators. Income qualification and enrollment by Red Cross.
    •    Family Electric Rate Assistance Program (FERA): This program was developed for
         families whose household income slightly exceeds the threshold for assistance in other
Page 4 -14

                                                                      Housing Resources
  energy program allowances. Qualifying households have some of their electricity usage
  billed at a lower rate.
• Low Income Energy Efficiency Program (LIEE): The LIEE program provides no-
  cost weatherization services to lower income households who meet the CARE
  guidelines. Services provided include attic insulation, energy efficient refrigerators,
  energy efficient furnaces, weather stripping, caulking, low-fl.ow showerheads, water
  heater blankets, and door and building envelop repairs that reduce air infiltration.
• Residential Energy Standards Training: SDG&E offers seminars on energy
  efficiency compliance best practices. Architects, designers, builders, engineers, energy
  consultants, HVAC contractors, building department inspectors, and plan checkers are
  encouraged to learn about new technologies that improve energy efficiency and reduce
  the cost of complying ,vith evolving State energy standards.
• Lighting Tum-In Program: Through this program, SDG&E replaces resident's
  incandescent bulbs with more energy-efficient compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) free of
  charge. Residents can access the program via community events that are held
  throughout SDG&E's service area and coordinated through an extensive network of
  community organizations and government agencies.
• Rebate Program: SDG&E offers rebates for single-family and multifamily dwelling
  units for certain improvements in their units that lead to greater energy efficiency. These
  improvements include purchase and installation of insulation, energy efficient appliances,
  and the replacement of old light bulbs with Energy Star light bulbs.
                                                                                     Page 4 - 15


Section 5
Evaluation of
Accomplishments under
Adopted Housing Element
Government Code Section 65588(a) requires each jurisdiction to review its housing element as
frequently as appropriate to evaluate:
    •   The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to the
        attainment of the state housing goal;
    •   The effectiveness of the housing element in attainment of the community's housing
        goals and objectives; and
    •   The progress of the city, county or city and county in implementation of the housing
        element.
This section documents the City's achievements under the 2005-2012 Housing Element with
respect to the actions and objectives contained therein. This section describes the relative
success of the City's efforts to implement the 2005 programs, and contains recommendations
for program retention, revision, deletion or addition to address current and projected needs and
state requirements between 2013 and 2020. Table 5-1 starting on page 5-2 lists these housing
programs and provides a summary of accomplishments during the 2005-2012 Housing Element
cycle. Table 5-2 on page 5-11 presents quantified accomplishments during this period.
For the 2005-2012 Housing Element cycle, the City elected to pursue certification of the
Housing Element through the State Department of Housing and Community Development
(HCD). The City will be seeking HCD certification again in this cycle.
                                                                                         Page 5 - 1

                    condominium conversion      Element. On March 14, 2007 the City Council adopted an
                    regulations.                amendment to the condominium conversion ordinance
                                                that: 1) limits the number of rental units that can be
                                                converted to 50 percent of the yearly average of apartment
                                                units constructed in the previous two fiscal years; 2)
                                                increases the amount of rental assistance from one month
                                                to three months; and 3) requires fire and aesthetic-related
                                                improvements as conditions of approval. Since adoption
                                                of the ordinance in 2007, the housing market has collapsed
                                                and the lending industry has tightened the underwriting
                                                criteria for mortgage financing, making home purchase
                                                difficult. Therefore, no conversion has occurred since
                                                2007.

Section 6
Housing Plan
This section of the Housing Element contains objectives, policies, and programs the City will
implement to address a number of important housing-related issues and achieve the Santee's
overarching housing goal, which states:
       Ensure that decent, sefe housing is available at a cost that is effordable to all current and
      future residents of this community. To this end, the City will strive to maintain a reasonable
       balance between rental and ownership hottsing opportttnities and to encottrage a variety of
       individual choices of tenure, type, and location of housing throttghout the community.
The section contains quantified (numerical) objectives for housing construction, rehabilitation,
and the preservation of affordable housing, with a program of actions that:
    •    Provides regulatory concessions and incentives and uses local, federal, and state
         financing and subsidy programs to support the development of affordable housing;
    •    Identifies adequate sites with appropriate zoning, development standards, services and
         facilities to encourage the development of a variety of housing types for all income
         levels;
    •    Assists in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs of lower and
         moderate income households, including extremely low income households;
    •    Addresses and, where appropriate and legally possible, removes governmental
         constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing, including
         housing for all income levels and housing for persons with disabilities;
    •    Conserves and improves the condition of the existing affordable housing stock, which
         may include addressing ways to mitigate the loss of dwelling units demolished by public
         or private action;
    •    Promotes housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race, religion, sex, marital
          status, ancestry, national origin, color, familial status, or disability; and
    •    Preserves assisted housing developments for lower income households.
The Department of Development Services staff regularly reviews Housing Element programs,
objectives, and progress towards accommodating the City's share of the regional housing need.
An annual implementation report is prepared and provided to the City Council, California
Office of Planning and Research, and California Department of Housing and Community
Development. Depending on funding availability, the City will consider modifications to
Housing Element programs as necessary and appropriate to implement General Plan goals and
policies.

Notes:
     (1)  Pursuant to AB 2634, the City must estimate the portion of the IU IN A for very low income households that qualify as
          extremely low income. The City may use Census data to estimate the proportion of extremely low income households
          or to apply a 50 percent split. Assuming an even split, the City's IU IN,\ allocation of 914 very low income units may
          be divided into 457 very low and 457 extremely low income units. For purposes of identifying adequate sites for the
          IU·INA, however, no separate density threshold is established for extremely low income units.
     (2)  Participants in the City's first-time homebuyer program (Program 8) may also receive assistance from the MCC
          program (Program 9) . Therefore, the quantified objectives in this table assume some degree of overlap.
     (3)  "Other Assistance" inc:ludes residents assisted through the Manufactured Ilomc Fair Practices Program (Program 10),
          Supportive Services (Program 12), and Equal Housing Opportunity Services (Program 16). Income data for residents
          assisted under thcse programs arc not reported.
B.              Objectives, Policies, and Programs

1.      PRESERVING, CONSERVING, AND IMPROVING THE EXISTING HOUSING
        STOCK
While most of Santee's housing stock is in good condition, a large proportion of the City's
housing is nearing or has already exceeded 30 years of age, indicating the need for continued
maintenance to prevent widespread housing deterioration. Specifically, more than four out of
every five existing housing units in Santee will be older than 30 years and of sufficient age to be
susceptible to deterioration, requiring maintenance or rehabilitation by the end of this planning
period (2021). Other housing conservation needs of the City include existing affordable housing
stock and rental units at-risk of converting to market-rents or condominiums, and the Housing
Choice Voucher Program.
Objective 1.0: Conserve and improve the condition of the existing housing stock.
    Policy 1.1:   Advocate the rehabilitation of substandard           residential  properties    by
                  homeowners and property owners.
    Policy 1.2:   Continue to offer a residential rehabilitation program, which provides financial
                  and technical assistance to lower income property owners to enable correction
                  of housing deficiencies that could not otherwise be undertaken.
    Policy 1.3:   Focus rehabilitation assistance to create substantive neighborhood
                  improvement and stimulate additional unassisted improvement efforts.
    Policy 1.4:   Continue to utilize the City's code enforcement program to bring substandard
                  units into compliance with City codes and to improve overall housing quality
                  and conditions in Santee.
    Policy 1.5:   Promote increased awareness among property owners and residents of the
                  importance of property maintenance to long-term housing quality. Educate
                  property owners regarding existing resources for residential rehabilitation.
    Policy 1.6:   Track and maintain statistics annually for housing units in need of
                  rehabilitation or replacement.
Objective 2.0: Preserve existing affordable housing options in Santee.
    Policy 2.1:   Monitor the status of at-risk multifamily rental housing units, work with
                  potential purchasers/managers as appropriate, and explore funding sources
                   available to preserve the at-risk units.
    Policy 2.2:    Encourage the retention of existing, viable mobile home parks, which are
                   economically and physically sound.
                                                                                            Page 6 - 3
City of Santee Ilousing Element
   Policy 2.3:        Regulate the conversion of existing multifamily rental properties to
                      condominiums through application of Santee's Condominium Conversion
                      Ordinance.
   Policy 2.4:        Continue to support existing County and City rental assistance programs.
Program 1:         Code Enforcement
   Title 25 of the Califomia Ad1JJi11istrative Code (M.obileho1JJe Parks Act)
   Chapter 2 of Title 25 is the Mobilehome Parks Act. Article 10 of Chapter 2 deals with the
   maintenance, use and occupancy requirements of mobilehome parks. The purpose of this
   article is to implement, interpret and make specific the requirements of the Health and Safety
    Code as it pertains to mobilehome parks. The condition of mobile homes in Santee as well
   as the abatement of substandard conditions is regulated by Chapter 2 of Title 25. The
   provisions of Article 10 are implemented on an ongoing basis in Santee. The enforcement
    agency is the State Department of Housing and Community Development.
    Unifonn Ad1JJi11istrative Code
   The City adopted and implements the Uniform Administrative Code, 1997 edition. The
    abatement of substandard housing conditions in the City has relied upon the requirements of
    the Uniform Administrative Code, and the City's zoning laws governing property
    maintenance. The Uniform Administrative Code requirements relate principally to
    substandard structural conditions. These conditions are described in the "unsafe buildings"
    section of the Code. Implementation of these provisions of the Codes for purposes of
    assuring housing quality is accomplished on an ongoing basis.
    U11ijol7JJ Hot1si11g Code
    The Uniform Housing Code is enforced through the County Health Department, at the
    request of tenants who believe that their rental property is in violation of the Uniform
    Housing Code. The most common violations reported are leaking roofs, lack of heat,
    electrical and plumbing problems. The County enforces State Housing Law pertaining to
    sanitation, ventilation, use or occupancy of apartment complexes, as well as hotels.
    The provisions of the Uniform Housing Code relate only to existing dwellings and do not
    affect new construction. Adoption of the 1994 Uniform Code for Abatement of Dangerous
    Buildings and 2010 California Building Code expands the City's direct involvement in the
    abatement of a wide range of substandard housing conditions, and to achieve abatement
    through established procedures.
    The City of Santee actively pursues reported code violations in the City.             When code
    violations are unable to be resolved through voluntary compliance or through the nuisance
    abatement procedure or through the Administrative Citation process, the City refers such
    cases to the City Attorney for prosecution. The City Attorney's office may seek injunctions,
    receivership and civil lawsuits to achieve compliance with City codes.

                                throughout the planning period.
Program 2:      Mobile Home Conversion Regulations
   Conversion regulations for mobile homes are contained in both Section 16.20.020 of the
   City Subdivision Ordinance and Section 17.22.030(D) of the Zoning Ordinance. The City
   Zoning Ordinance, through the Mobile Home Park Overlay District, regulates the rezoning
   of existing mobile home parks. Rezoning applications for property containing an existing
   mobile home park and zoned for such use must satisfy several requirements and standards.
   When considering a Conditional Use Permit for conversion to a different use, the City
   Council shall ensure that applicants have satisfied the requirements of Sections 65863.7
   ("Report of impact on conversion of mobile home park to another use") and 65863.8
   (''Verification of notification by applicant for conversion of mobile home park to another
   use") of the California Government Code. These provisions assure that mobile home park
   occupants are afforded some protection if an existing facility is to be rezoned for another
   use.

                                throughout the planning period.
Program 3:      Minor Home Improvement Loans
   The City has used CDBG funds to assist organizations that provide home improvement and
   repair services to lower income households. Examples of home improvement and repair
   include the installation of home security devices and minor home repair such as in-home
   ADA improvements, weatherproofing, etc.

Program 4:      Conservation of Existing and Future Affordable Units
    As of January 2013, 309 units were at risk of converting to market rate rents. Of these units,
    121 were within the Carlton Country Club Villas, while the Woodglen Vista Apartments had
    188 at-risk units (see Table 2-20 on page 2-27). Neither property has provided notice of
    intent to convert to market rate. In November 2012, the City sent a letter to all agencies
    participating in the State's Opportunity to Purchase and Right of First Refusal Program to
    assess their interest in acquiring and managing at-risk properties. There were several
    responses. In January 2013, those who responded were given contact information for the
    owners of the two properties at risk during the planning period.
    Responsible Agency:          City of Santee Department of Development Services; U.S.
                                 Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD); and
                                 San Diego County Housing Authority.
    Financing:                   Section 8 vouchers, other funding sources as available
    2013-2021 Objectives:        Monitor the status of the 309 at-risk units at Carlton Country
                                 Club Villas and Woodglen Vista. The City of Santee will work
                                 with property owners, interest groups and the State and federal
                                 governments to implement the following programs on an
                                 ongoing basis to conserve its affordable housing stock:
                                 •   Monitor Units at Risk: Monitor the status of Carlton
                                     Country Club Villas and Woodlen Vista since they may lose
                                     their subsidies due to discontinuation of the Section 8
                                     program at the federal level or opting out by the property
                                     owner.
                                 •   Work with Potential Purchasers: Where feasible, provide
                                     technical assistance to public and non-profit agencies
                                     interested in purchasing and/ or managing units at risk.
                                 •   Tenant Education: The California Legislature extended the
                                     noticing requirement of at-risk units opting out of low
                                     income use restrictions to one year. Should a property owner
                                     pursue conversion of the units to market rate, the City will
                                     ensure that tenants were properly noticed and informed of
                                     their rights and that they are eligible to receive Section 8
                                     vouchers that would enable them to stay in their units.
                                 •   Assist Tenants of Existing Rent Restricted Units to Obtain
                                     Section 8 Voucher Assistance: Tenants of housing units with
                                     expired Section 8 contracts are eligible to receive special
                                     Section 8 vouchers that can be used only at the same
                                     property. The City will assist tenants of "at-risk" units to
                                     obtain these Section 8 vouchers through the San Diego
                                     County Housing Authority.

                              tenants of their rights, and assist tenants to obtain rental
                              assistance in accordance with this program.
Program 5:      Housing Choice Voucher Program
   The Housing Choice Voucher Program extends rental subsidies to extremely low and very
   low income (up to 50 percent of AMI) families and seniors that spend more than 30 percent
   of their income on rent. The subsidy represents the difference between the excess of 30
   percent of the monthly income and the actual rent. Rental assistance is provided to the
   recipients in the form of vouchers, which permit tenants to locate their own housing and
   rent units beyond the federally determined fair market rent in an area, provided the tenants
   pay the extra rent increment. Cities may contract with the San Diego County Housing
   Authority to administer the Housing Choice Voucher Program. According to the Housing
   Authority, approximately 344 households received assistance through the program as of June
   2012.

                                  applications for additional voucher allocations and efforts to
                                  maintain and expand voucher use in the City.
   Timeframe:                     Ongoing implementation and annual monitoring throughout
                                  the planning period.
Program 6:      Mobile Home Park Assistance Program
   Administered through the California Department of Housing and Community Development
   (HCD), the Mobile Home Park Assistance Program (MPAP) provides financial and technical
   assistance to mobile home park residents who wish to purchase their mobile home parks and
   convert the parks to resident ownership. Loans are made to lower income mobile home
   park residents or to organizations formed by park residents to own and/ or operate their
   mobile home parks, thereby allowing residents to control their housing costs. Loans are
   limited to 50 percent of the purchase prices plus the conversion costs of the mobile home
   park and are awarded by the State on a competitive basis. Applications must be made by
   mobile home park residents who must form a resident organization ,vith the local public
   entity as a co-applicant.
                                                                                        Page 6 - 7
City of Santee Ilousing Element
    The City successfully co-sponsored one MPAP application in 1996. Residents of the
    Highlands Mobile Home Park on Mission Gorge Road formed a corporation and purchased
    a 30-year lease using State MP AP funds. The City assisted 29 lower-income residents by
    lending $8,500 each to purchase a share in the non-profit corporation. The City will
    continue to advertise the program's availability to mobile home park residents and will serve
    as co-applicant for interested resident organizations. The City's Zoning Ordinance, through
    the Mobile Home Park Overlay District, provides for a 50 percent reduction in project
    application fees as an incentive for the conversion of existing rental parks to resident-owned
    parks.

    Financing:                  Department budget
    2013-2021 Objectives:       Circulate fliers to existing mobile home renter parks periodically.
                                Co-sponsor MPAP applications as opportunity arises.
    Time frame:                 Annual flier circulation and monitoring and reporting throughout
                                the planning period.
2.       ASSISTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF                            AFFORDABLE          HOUSING
         OPPORTUNITIES AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES
New construction is a major source of housing for prospective homeowners and renters but
generally requires public sector support for the creation of units affordable to lower income
households, including extremely low income households. While a wide range of for-sale and
rental housing options are available in Santee to above moderate and moderate income
households, affordable options for lower income households are more limited (Section 2,
Community Profile). Compounding the need for affordable rental housing in the City is the
displacement of lower income tenants from multifamily housing to accommodate the extension
of State Route 52 to Mission Gorge Road, completed in fall of 1998. The extension of SR 52 to
SR 67 is estimated to have displaced approximately 118 single-family dwelling units, 310
multifamily dwelling units, and 229 mobile home units, for a total of 657 dwelling units.
CalTrans maintains responsibility for mitigation through relocation assistance. Where there is a
need for affordable housing, often there is also a need for supportive services for lower income
households, including extremely low income households. The following Objectives, Policies,
and Programs intend to address the overall need for affordable housing and supportive services
in Santee.
Objective 3.0:    Expand affordable housing options ,vithin Santee.
    Policy 3.1:   Develop and maintain collaborative efforts among nonprofits, for-profit
                  developers, and public agencies to encourage the development, maintenance,
                  and improvement of affordable housing.

                  weatherization improvements.          Promote design concepts that utilize
                  technological advances in the application of alternative energy sources which
                  make the use of the natural climate to increase energy efficiency and reduce
                  housing costs.
   Policy 3.3:    Encourage the use of favorable home purchasing techniques, such as shared
                  equity and limited equity cooperatives, as might become available through
                  public and private agencies and institutions.
   Policy 3.4:    Encourage the provision of housing affordable to extremely low income
                  households when reviewing proposals for new affordable housing
                  developments.
Objective 4.0:    Provide housing support services to address the needs of the City of Santee's
                  lower and moderate income residents, including extremely low income
                  households.
   Policy 4.1:    Continue to support and actively market shared housing as an affordable
                  housing option for seniors.
   Policy 4.2:    Continue to support and coordinate with social service providers and regional
                  agencies to address the housing related needs of Santee residents, particularly
                  those with special needs.
   Policy 4.3:    Coordinate with local social service providers to address the needs of the City's
                  homeless population. Provide funding to groups providing shelter and other
                  services to the homeless. Continue to participate in the Countywide homeless
                  working group in preparing and implementing recommendations to the Board
                  of Supervisors, the appointed bodies and municipalities regarding plans for
                  providing emergency housing, halfway houses and homes with supervised care.
Program 7:      First Time Homebuyer Program
   Through this program, the City assists Santee first-time lower and moderate income
   homebuyers with down payment and closing cost assistance. This assistance functions
   similar to a "silent second" to the assisted household's primary home loan application.

Program 8:      San Diego County Regional Mortgage Credit Certificate Program
    Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCCs) are certificates issued to lower and moderate income
    first-time homebuyers authorizing the household to take a credit against federal income taxes
    of up to 20 percent of the annual mortgage interest paid. The mortgage payments are used
    to repay the bonds; there is no City guarantee required. The City is a part of a coalition
    consisting of the County of San Diego and several other cities in providing MCCs to
    income-qualified first-time homebuyers. The coalition hires a consultant to administer the
    program and the City contributes to the administration costs. Participants in the City's first-
    time homebuyer program (Program 7) that meet the income requirements of the MCC
    program are referred by the City to the consultant.

                                    AMI). Continue to promote the MCC program by notifying
                                    eligible applicants to other City programs and providing
                                    information on the City's website.
    Timeframe:                      Ongoing implementation and annual monitoring and
                                    reporting throughout the planning period.
Program 9:      Manufactured Home Fair Practices Program
    The City regulates short-term space leases in mobile home parks and provides staff support
    to the Manufactured Fair Practices Commission, which holds quarterly meetings. The
    program requires significant financial resources in administration and legal defense of the
    Ordinance. Through the City Attorney's office, the City has defended or initiated many
    lawsuits to uphold the requirements of the Manufactured Home Rent Stabilization Program
    since 1998. To date, all of the City's efforts to maintain the rent control system have been
    successful.

                                throughout the planning period.
Program 10:      Facilitate Affordable Housing Development
    Dissolution of the City's Redevelopment Agency by the State in 2012 eliminated the Low
    and Moderate Income Housing Fund (LMIHF), formerly the City's primary mechanism for
    providing direct funding support of affordable housing development. Continuing reductions
    in federal funding of HUD programs such as CDBG and HOME will constrain the City's
    ability to offer committed funding assistance to future affordable housing even further.
    With limited funding, the City will rely on the following non-funding-related actions to
    encourage affordable housing production during the planning period:

   •   Collaborate with Affordable Housing Developers: Affordable housing developers
       work to develop, conserve and promote rental and ownership affordable housing.
       Particularly in relation to senior citizen housing, the affordable housing developer is
       often, but not always, a local organization interested in developing affordable
       housing. The affordable housing developer is often involved with what is called
       "assisted housing", where some type of government assistance (such as Section 8 or
       Tax Credits) is provided to the individual household to keep rents affordable. An
       affordable housing developer can help meet the goals for additional housing by
       implementing or assisting with the implementation of programs described in this
       Element. The City will continue to collaborate with affordable housing developers
       to identify potential sites, write letters of support to help secure governmental and
       private-sector funding, and offer technical assistance related to the application of
       City incentive programs (e.g., density bonus and lot consolidation).
   •   Regulatory Concessions and Incentives: The City will continue to work with
       developers on a case-by-case basis to provide regulatory concessions and incentives
       to assist them with the development of affordable and senior housing. In a relatively
       small city like Santee, this is the most effective method of assisting developers, as
       each individual project can be analyzed to determine which concessions and
       incentives would be the most beneficial to the project's feasibility. Regulatory
       concessions and incentives could include, but are not limited to, density bonuses,
       required parking reductions, fee reductions or deferral, expedited permit processing,
       and modified or waived development standards. For example, the City recently
       approved density bonuses and reduced parking for the Cedar Creek and Forester
       Square affordable housing developments. The City also modified a setback for the
       Forester Square development, pursuant to the density bonus ordinance. The City
       will also offer incentives to developers who acquire and consolidate smaller parcels
       for the purpose of providing well-planned and high quality residential development
       (Program 13).

3.       PROVIDING ADEQUATE SITES TO ACHIEVE A VARIETY OF HOUSING
         TYPES AND DENSITIES
A key element in satisfying the housing needs of all segments of the community is the provision
of adequate sites for housing of all types, sizes, and prices. This is an important function in both
zoning and General Plan designations.
Objective 5.0     Encourage the provision of a wide range of housing by location, type of unit,
                  and price to meet the existing and future needs of Santee residents to the
                  maximum extent possible.
    Policy 5.1:   Provide a variety of residential development opportunities in the City, ranging
                  in density from very low density estate homes to medium-high and high
                  density development.
    Policy 5.2:   Encourage both the private and public sectors to produce or assist in the
                  production of housing, with particular emphasis on housing affordable to
                  lower income households, including extremely low income households, as well
                  as housing suitable for the disabled, the elderly, large families, and female-
                  headed households.
    Policy 5.3:   Require that housing constructed expressly for lower and moderate income
                  households not be concentrated in any single area of Santee.

                                                                                Housing Plan
   Policy 5.4:   Encourage developments of new housing units designated for the elderly and
                 disabled persons to be in close proximity to public transportation and
                 community services.
   Policy 5.5:   Ensure that all new housing development and redevelopment in Santee is
                 properly phased in amount and geographic location so that City services and
                 facilities can accommodate that growth.
   Policy 5.6:   Facilitate the consolidation of smaller parcels to encourage well-planned and
                 high quality residential developments.
   Policy 5.7:   Ensure that sites in the Residential Sites Inventory are available during the
                 planning period by overriding the Gillespie Field ALUCP as appropriate, and
                 as necessary unless AB2292 downzoning findings can be made.
Program 12:    Inventory of Available Sites
   Santee's residential sites inventory consists of over 2,714 acres of developable land with the
   capacity to yield at least 3,625 new units during the planning period. These sites can
   accommodate Santee's RHNA for all income levels through 2021. To accommodate a
   portion of the City's remaining need lower and moderate income households, the City
   rezoned 14.57 acres from R-14 (14-22 dua) to R-22 (22-30 dua), 5.61 acres from General
   Commercial (GC) to R-22, and 4.60 acres from R-7 (7-14 dua) to R-14 in January 2013. The
   City will maintain an inventory of available sites for residential development and provide it
   to prospective residential developers upon request. The parcel-by-parcel inventory located
   in Appendix C, Sites Inventory, of this Housing Element.

   Financing:                    Department budget
   2013-2021 Objectives:         Maintain an inventory of the available sites for residential

                                 upon request.
   Timeframe:                    Ongoing implementation and annual monitoring and reporting
                                 throughout the planning period. .

Program 13:     Lot Consolidation Incentives
    Approximately 45 percent of the acreage identified in Appendix C, Sites Inventory, that is
    zoned for multifamily uses and consists of parcels that are smaller than one-acre in size. In
    recent years, existing zoning and development standards have enabled developers to
    assemble and consolidate smaller underutilized parcels to facilitate the construction of
    multifamily housing. The City acknowledges that market forces and dwindling federal, State,
    regional, and local resources for may make similar consolidation more difficult in the future.
    In response, the City will research and evaluate the effectiveness of lot assemblage and
    consolidation incentives offered by other cities and counties. Based on the results of this
    research, the City will develop a menu of incentives appropriate for Santee and amend the
    Town Center Specific Plan (fCSP) and update the Zoning Ordinance. Incentives to be
    considered for developers who acquire and propose consolidation of smaller parcels to
    provide well-planned and high quality residential developments include alternative parking
    options (e.g., tandem, shared, and off-site parking) and graduated density bonuses (e.g.,
    density bonuses will be proportional to the number of lots and/ or total area consolidated).

                                Ordinance to include lot consolidation incentives.
    Timeframe:                  Update the Zoning Ordinance to include lot consolidation
                                incentives within one year of adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing

                                planning period.
Program 14: Monitoring of Residential Capacity (No Net Loss)
    Monitor the consumption of residential acreage to ensure an adequate inventory is available
    to meet the City's RHNA obligations. To ensure sufficient residential capacity is maintained
    to accommodate the RHNA, the City will develop and implement a formal ongoing (project-
    by-project) evaluation procedure pursuant to Government Code Section 65863. Should an
    approval of development result in a reduction of capacity below the residential capacity
    needed to accommodate the remaining need for lower income households, the City will
    identify and if necessary rezone sufficient sites to accommodate the shortfall and ensure "no
    net loss" in capacity to accommodate the RHNA.

4.       REMOVING GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS AS APPLICABLE
State law requires that housing elements address, and where appropriate and legally possible,
remove governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of
housing. In 1993, the City Council assumed the responsibilities of the Planning Commission in
an effort to reduce City costs and streamline the permit review process. In 2003, a series of
zoning ordinance amendments simplified the permit review process for several types of
development, and established a new administrative Minor Conditional Use Permit. Density
bonus regulations were updated in 2007. In 2010, the City created a new Urban Residential land
use designation and zone district that requires 30 units per gross acre and allows structures as
high as 55 feet or four stories. In 2013, the City updated the Zoning Ordinance to:
     •   Establish a ministerial reasonable accommodation procedure;
     •   Remove the CUP requirement for third and fourth stories in the R-14 and R-22 zones
         (respectively);
     •   Remove the Development Review Permit requirement for second dwelling units;
     •   Refine Development Review Permit language; and
     •   Accommodate single room occupancy (SRO) buildings, transitional housing, supportive
         housing, and emergency shelters.
The City will continue to monitor its development process and zoning regulations to identify
and remove constraints to the development of housing, particularly in chapters pertaining to
residential uses.
As the City's vacant and underutilized sites are developed/ re-developed, outlying properties in
hillside areas are being assessed for development potential. These hillside areas often support
coastal sage scrub and grasslands. The effects of development on vegetation habitats must be
fully assessed and mitigation required for removal. The environmental review process will be
streamlined with the MSCP Subarea Plan in place.
Objective 6.0:     Reduce or remove government constraints to housing production and
                   opportunity where feasible and legally permissible.
     Policy 6.1:   Promote efficient and creative alternatives to help reduce government
                   constraints.
     Policy 6.2:   Provide incentives and regulatory concessions for affordable and seruor
                   housing through implementation of the density bonus ordinance.
     Policy 6.3:   Facilitate timely building permit and development plan processing for
                   residential construction.
     Policy 6.4:   Balance the need to protect and preserve the natural environment with the
                   need to provide additional housing and employment opportunities.
     Policy 6.5:   Approve residential uses if they meet use requirements, development criteria
                   and design requirements of the General Plan and Municipal Code.
                                                                                       Page 6 - 15

Program 15:      Farm Worker Housing
   According to the 2009-2011 ACS, no residents of Santee residents were employed in
    farming, forestry, or fishing occupations and the Regional Task Force on the Homeless did
    not identify any homeless farmworkers/ day laborers in Santee in 2012. Although the most
    recent available employment data available from the U.S. Census Bureau indicated that no
    Santee residents were employed in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations and there is
    little potential for this occupational category to expand within Santee, a variety of agricultural
    uses are permitted or conditionally permitted in multiple residential zones. The City will
    review and revise the Zoning Ordinance to address compliance with Sections 17021.5 and
    17021.6 of the Health and Safety Code ..

Program 16:       Monitor Changes in Federal and State Housing, Planning, and Zoning
                  Laws
    State law requires that Housing Elements address, and where appropriate and legally
    possible, remove governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and
    development of housing. While the 2013-2021 Housing Element update did not identify any
    significant governmental constraints to the development or maintenance of housing in
    Santee, the City will continue to monitor its development process and zoning regulations to
    identify and remove constraints to the development of housing. The City will also continue
    to monitor federal and State legislation that could impact housing and comment on, support,
    or oppose proposed changes or additions to existing legislation, as well as support new
    legislation when appropriate. The City will also continue to participate in the SANDAG
    Technical Working Group and Regional Housing Working Group, which monitor State and
    Federal planning, zoning, and housing legislation. Special attention will be given by the City
    in the minimizing of governmental constraints to the development, improvement, and
    maintenance of housing.

5.       PROMOTING EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITY
To make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community,
the housing program must include actions that promote housing opportunities for all persons
regardless of race, religion, sex, family size, marital status, sexual orientation, ancestry, national
origin, color, age, physical or mental disability.
Objective 7.0      Promote equal opportunity for all residents to reside in the housing of their
                   choice.
    Policy 7.1:    Prohibit discrimination in the sale or rental of housing with regard to race,
                   ethnic background, religion, handicap, income, sex, age, sexual orientation,
                   gender identity, and household composition.
    Policy 7.2:    Encourage the development of residential units that are accessible to disabled
                   persons or are adaptable for conversion to residential use by disabled persons.
    Policy 7.3:    Reasonably accommodate persons with disabilities who seek waiver or
                   modification of land use controls and/ or development standards pursuant to
                   procedures and criteria set forth in the Zoning Ordinance.
    Policy 7.4:    Accommodate emergency shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing,
                   residential care facilities, and community care facilities in compliance with State
                   laws and City Zoning Ordinance.
    Policy 7.5:    Collaborate with jurisdictions to explore the merit of a multi-jurisdictional
                   agreement for the provision of emergency shelters.
    Policy 7.6:    Continue active support and participation with the fair housing service
                   provider to further spatial de-concentration and fair housing opportunities.
Program 17:      Equal Housing Opportunity Services
    The City of Santee supports fair housing laws and statutes. To promote equal opportunity,
    the City contracts with the Center for Social Advocacy to provide fair housing services. The
    City participated in a regional assessment of impediments to fair housing choice in 2010.
    The Study identified potential impediments to fair housing in the City's policies or
    administrative procedures related to SB 2 and AB 2634 compliance. In January 2013, the
                                                                                             Page 6 -17
City of Santee Ilousing Element
    City updated the Zoning Ordinance to remove these impediments to allow emergency
    shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, and SRO facilities consistent with State
   law. The City attends monthly Fair Housing Resource Board meetings which are comprised
    of the 18 cities in the County, and the County, and HUD San Diego, to address fair housing
   issues. The City distributes information on fair housing and refers fair housing questions and
    housing discrimination claims to its fair housing service provider.
    As part of its contract with the City, the fair housing service provider will:
         •  Advocate for fair housing issues;
         •   Conduct outreach and education;
         •   Provide technical assistance and training for property owners and managers;
         •   Coordinate fair housing efforts;
         •  Assist to enforce fair housing rights;
         •   Collaborate with other fair housing agencies;
         •   Refer and inform for non-fair housing problems; and,
         •   Counsel and educate tenants and landlords.
    In 2010, the City disbanded the Human Relations Advisory Board and authorized the
    Community-Oriented Policing Committee (COMPOC) to assume the role of the Board.
    Two Board members serve on the COMPOC.
    COMPOC continues to:
         •   Provide a forum for public input regarding issues of discrimination and prejudice in
             the community;
         •   Conduct special studies of discrimination and prejudice within the community at the
             request of the City Council;
         •   Develop a program for crisis intervention in response to occurrences of
             discrimination and prejudice within the community;
         •   Provide referrals to existing agencies to assist individuals in the resolution of their
             complaints of discrimination; and
         •   Prepare and distribute educational and informational materials relating to prejudice
             and discrimination and recommend ways of eliminating such prejudice and
             discrimination.
    As stated, the Board provides agency referrals to assist individuals in the resolution of
    complaints of discrimination. Fair housing related complaints are referred to the Center for
    Social Advocacy and Fair Housing Council.
    Additionally, as part of the CDBG process, the City has continued to explore additional
    opportunities to enhance fair housing in the City. The City utilizes CDBG funds to provide
    tenant/landlord counseling and related housing services to community residents. The City
    has allocated approximately $8,000 toward the program each fiscal year. Additionally, the
    City will provide a link on its website with information about fair housing services.

City of Santee Housing Element
   The San Diego Housing Federation publication "Best Practices for Housing Elements" was used
   as a reference during the preparation of this Element. Certain programs contained therein
   (Accessory Dwelling Units, reductions in parking requirements for affordable housing) have
   already been implemented in Santee, and others (At-Risk properties and affordable housing
   education) are implemented in this Housing Element (Section 6, Programs 4 and 6,
   respectively). The Regional Task Force for the Homeless information was used to provide data
   on the homeless in Section 2. Section 6, Program 11, Supportive Services, addresses service
   providers that provide aid to the homeless or near-homeless in Santee. The San Diego County
   Apartment Association rental data was used in Section 2. The Community Land Trust provided
   information on Community Land Trusts that was not included as a program in this Element;
   however, Community Land Trusts could be eligible for incentives for affordable housing under
   the City's current Density Bonus Ordinance, or the proposed Lot Consolidation Ordinance
    (Section 6, Programs 10 and 13).
2. Agencies and Organizations Requested to Provide Additional Feedback
   Subsequent to the Housing Element workshops, the City contacted advocacy organizations and
    developers in an effort to elicit additional participation. The following is a list of those who were
    contacted with follow-up emails and phone calls.

3. Public Workshop and Hearing on Housing Element-Related Rezones, and Public
   Hearing on the Housing Element Implementation Ordinance
   The City also held a public workshop on November 14, 2012 and a public hearing on January 9,
   2013, both related to the Housing Element. The workshop was to provide information on and
   request authorization to proceed with designating properties for the provision of land to
   accommodate the housing needs of lower income households. The January 9, 2013 hearing was
   both to approve these land use changes and to approve an ordinance implementing programs
   from the previous Housing Element.
   No public comments were received at the November 14 workshop. At the January 9 meeting,
   one comment was received from a property owner at one of the sites proposed for rezoning,
   who supported the proposal. At both meetings, staff presented that all rezonings and Zoning
   Ordinance Revisions recommended were to accommodate the City's current and future housing
   needs. All were approved.
4. Housing Element Survey
   The following survey was published on the front page of the City's website from December 14,
   2012 to January 14, 2013 and received 41 responses. It was publicized in the City's newsletter,
   the Santee Review, and on Facebook and Twitter. The Santee Patch printed a story on the
   survey as well. Responses were used in the preparation of this Housing Element.

Themes in the responses include:
     1.  Approximately 25% of respondents identified that housing in Santee didn't meet their
         needs and that they have trouble finding affordable housing (addressed by Section 6,
         Programs 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, and 16).
     2. Approximately one quarter to one-third of Santee respondents would like to see more
         affordable condominiums and apartments in Santee, along with units for larger families
         (addressed by Section 6, Programs 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 16).
     3.  Twenty-seven percent of respondents identified more financial assistance from the City
         as a way to accommodate affordable housing needs, and also identified that the City
         should promote development of more affordable housing (addressed by Section 6,
         Programs 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 13).
     4. Seniors, the disabled, large families, and the homeless were identified by many as having
         significant unmet needs (addressed by Section 6, Programs 5, 6, 11, 15, and 16).

These parcels are considered underutilized because they are currently vacant or being used for
outdoor storage or fleet storage with limited or no site improvements. The undeveloped and
underutilized IG-zoned parcels have adequate capacity to accommodate an emergency shelter
that could serve at least 26 homeless individuals (identified unsheltered homeless population in
Santee in January-February 2012) or at least one year-round emergency shelter.

        Note: "*" indicates the parcel is located partially or entirely within the Gillespie Field ALUCP Safety Zone 3 or 4. The City will override the Gillespie Field ALUCP on
         these residential sites as appropriate, and as necessary to ensure adequate sites are available during the planning period unless AB 2292 "no net loss" findings can be
        made (Section 6, Policy 5.7). Furthermore, the City will develop and implement a formal ongoing (project-by-project) evaluation procedure pursuant to Government
         Code Section 65863 (Section 6, Program 14). Should an approval of development result in a reduction of capacity below the residential capacity needed to
        accommodate the remaining need for lower income households, the City will identify and rezone sufficient sites to accommodate the shortfall and ensure "no net loss"
        in capacity to accommodate the RHNA.
