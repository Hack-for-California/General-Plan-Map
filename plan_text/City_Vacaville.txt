CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1      RELATIONSHIP TO THE GENERAL PLAN
State law requires the Housing Element to contain a statement of “the means by which
consistency will be achieved with other General Plan elements and community goals” (California
Government Code, Section 65583[c] [6] [B]). The Housing Element is one of seven required
elements of a City’s General Plan. Unlike the other mandatory general plan elements, the
Housing Element, required to be updated approximately every eight years, is subject to detailed
statutory requirements and mandatory review by the Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD), a State agency.
The Housing Element has been a mandatory element of the General Plan since 1969. This
reflects the statutory recognition that the availability of housing is a matter of statewide
importance and that cooperation between government and the private sector is critical to
attainment of the State's housing goals. The regulation of the housing supply through planning
and zoning powers affects the State’s ability to achieve its housing goal of “decent housing and
a suitable living environment for every California family” and is critical to the State’s long-term
economic competitiveness.
The purpose of maintaining internal consistency in the General Plan is to avoid policy conflict
and provide a clear framework for the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing
within the city. The purpose of maintaining internal consistency in the General Plan is to avoid
policy conflict and provide a clear framework for the maintenance, improvement, and
development of housing within the city. The City will continue to maintain General Plan
consistency by reviewing the Housing Element as other elements are updated or amended. The
Housing Element envisions housing development on land designated for such development by
the 1990 General Plan. The Housing Element is also consistent with the overall vision for the
community established by the General Plan, which emphasizes a variety of housing types and
infill development.
1.2      2007-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
This Housing Element updates the 2007-2014 Vacaville Housing Element, which was adopted
in 2010. Policies of the 2007-2014 Housing Element were reviewed and evaluated in preparing
the new housing program. The City's success in implementing the goals of the 2007-2014
Element has been evaluated in Chapter 8.
1.3      HOUSING ELEMENT REQUIREMENTS
To a greater extent than any other part of the General Plan, the contents of the Housing
Element are mandated by State law. The cornerstone of the State-mandated requirements is
the allocation of Statewide housing needs on a regional basis and the adoption by each
community of its share of the projected regional need. The State requires that the Housing
Element contain an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing need for
individuals of all levels of income; a statement of goals, policies, and quantified objectives;
programs to address identified housing needs; and an identification of an adequate number of
                                City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element
                                                   Page 1

1. Introduction
sites for all types of housing (including rental, factory built, and mobile homes). Government
Code Sections 65580 through 65589 set forth requirements relating to the preparation and
content of housing elements. By law, a housing element must contain:
1. An analysis of population and employment trends and documentation of projections and a
     quantification of the locality’s existing and projected housing needs for all income levels.
2. An analysis and documentation of household characteristics, including level of payment
     compared to ability to pay; housing characteristics, including overcrowding; and housing
     stock condition.
3. An inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites
     having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public
     facilities and services to these sites. The land inventory must demonstrate the City’s ability to
     accommodate its fair share of regional housing needs as determined by the Association of
     Bay Area Governments (ABAG).
4. An analysis of potential and actual governmental constraints upon the maintenance,
     improvement, or development of housing for all income levels and for persons with
     disabilities, including land use controls, building codes and their enforcement, site
     improvements, fees and other exactions required of developers, and local processing and
     permit procedures.
5. An analysis of potential and actual non-governmental constraints upon the maintenance,
     improvement, or development of housing for all income levels, including the availability of
     financing, the price of land, and the cost of construction.
6. An analysis of any special housing needs, such as those of the elderly, persons with
     disabilities, large families, farm workers, families with female heads of household, and
     families and persons in need of emergency shelter.
7. An analysis of opportunities for energy conservation with respect to residential development.
8. An analysis of existing assisted housing developments that are eligible to change from low-
     income housing uses during the next 10 years due to termination of subsidy contracts,
     mortgage prepayment, or expiration of restrictions on use.
Eight sections make up the Housing Element: the introduction, housing programs, sections
covering regional context, existing housing, housing need, ability to meet housing need, and an
evaluation of the 2007-2014 Vacaville Housing Element.
1.4      PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
There was a significant amount of public participation efforts made in drafting this Housing
Element update. These efforts have resulted in proposed housing programs, which have been
tailored to address the local housing market and community needs.
Community Outreach
In an effort to educate the public about the Housing Element, the City provided information
regarding the Housing Element on its website: www.cityofvacaville.com. The Housing Element
webpage included the City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) numbers; identified
housing topics that would be addressed in the Housing Element document; provided information
about the ongoing public participation process; included a link to the previous Housing Element
and other Housing Element related websites; provided a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

sheet; and provided contact information for people seeking additional information regarding the
Housing Element. The aforementioned FAQ sheet was available in the handout display located
on the Planning Division counter.
*The Draft Housing Element was posted on the City’s website during the public review period
and interested persons were able to submit comments electronically through an email address
located on the webpage.
Senior Roundtable Presentations
Vacaville has a relatively large and active senior population. To encourage ongoing discussions
between the City and the senior community, the City established the Senior Roundtable in
January 2000 as a community collaborative for senior issues. Almost 50 government and
community organizations are represented. The mission of the Senior Roundtable is to:
•   Identify the vision for seniors in our community in order to help focus the programs of
    participating agencies.
•   Conceptualize and create new programs for seniors and then assist in their development.
•   Provide a forum for networking and dialog among members to promote formal and informal
    support.
On November 21, 2013 and October 16, 2014, the City provided a presentation on the City’s
pending General Plan and Housing Element updates to the Senior Roundtable and solicited
comments, questions, and concerns raised by the senior community. Topics raised at these
meetings included, but were not limited to the following:
•   The need for affordable senior housing.
•   The need for the City to plan and help seniors to “age in place.”
•   The need for smaller, single story homes for seniors.
•   The need for easy and close access to senior social services.
•   The desire for the Housing Element to cross reference other General Plan policies
    supporting senior housing and services.
Stakeholder Interview
To solicit questions, comments, and information about the community’s housing needs from key
stakeholders, the City individually invited representatives from the social services, development,
and housing communities to a facilitated discussion on June 4, 2014. Attendees included
representatives from the following organizations:
•   California Apartment Association (Napa-Solano)
•   Child Start of Napa and Solano Counties
•   Community Action Partnership of Solano County
•   Downtown Vacaville Business Improvement District
•   Legal Services of Northern California
•   Local residential developers, property owners, realtors, and property managers
•   North Bay Housing Coalition

•    On My Own
•    Opportunity House
•    Solano Affordable Housing Foundation
•    Solano Community Foundation
•    Vacaville Community Housing
•    Vacaville Social Services Corporation
Additional people and groups were invited to the meeting, and they will continue to be informed
regarding Housing Element activities. Several issues were discussed, including, but not limited
to:
Location of Affordable Housing
•    Allowing secondary units on larger lots with reduced fees
•    Need for affordable rental and ownership opportunities
•    Redeveloping Brown Street to avoid flood insurance and meet the need for extremely low-
     income housing
•    Perception that there is no available vacant land for affordable housing within city limits
•    Where to locate affordable housing and how to reduce the concentration of low-income
     housing
•    Whether affordable or market-rate housing is appropriate in the downtown, and downtown
     parking concerns
Extremely Low-Income Housing
•    Concerns regarding transients, safety, illegal activity, enforcement, and the upkeep of low-
     income housing
•    Supporting homeless and low-income residents with services as well as housing, including
     services, amenities, and activities near housing
Funding Issues
•    Unavailability of funds for building affordable housing
•    Development fees
•    The pros and cons of an inclusionary housing policy
•    Whether to build housing for low-income residents, or focus on extremely low-income
     residents
•    The difficulty of making new construction “pencil out” at an affordable price
Market-Rate Housing
•    Executive housing for business and job attraction
•    Housing for seniors, including single-story units and cooperatives

•   Existing oversupply of two-bedroom units
•   Need to increase the stock of:
•   Small one-bedroom and studio/efficiency units
•   Family-friendly three- and four-bedroom units
•   Large-lot, single-story single-family houses
•   Small mobile and manufactured homes
•   Small, single-story homes with small yards for seniors (such as those at Maplewood)
•   Community support for mixed-use housing above retail
As a result of the discussions with the Senior Roundtable, the stakeholder meeting, and
subsequent individual meetings with some of the stakeholder members, the City incorporated
housing policies and programs into this document to address many of these issues, including
addressing the need for units with many bedrooms by supporting a proposed development in
the Rocky Hill area, and supporting housing for residents with special needs. Many of the other
issues are already addressed in the existing housing element. Housing policies resulting from
public participation are listed in Section 1.5, below.
Public Meetings
The Planning Commission held study sessions on July 15, 2014 and December 16, 2014 to
review the Housing Element update process, the RHNA, and to request input regarding
proposed housing programs and policies. On April 21, 2015, the Planning Commission held a
public hearing to consider the merits of the Housing Element and voted to recommend that the
City Council adopt the Housing Element. On April 28, 2015, the City Council held an
informational meeting to solicit public comment and input prior to scheduling the Housing
Element for an adoption hearing. The meetings were televised live on the City’s local access
channel (Comcast Channel 26) and can continue to be viewed on the City’s website. In
addition, the staff reports are also available online on the City’s website:
www.cityofvacaville.com. The Housing Element adoption hearing is scheduled for May 12,
2015.
Comment Letter on Draft Housing Element
On March 5, 2015, the City received a comment letter from Legal Services of Northern
California (LSNC). The letter included recommendations on how to improve the Housing
Element. Recommendations were made regarding:
    •   Increasing public participation
    •   Explaining why specific housing policies identified in the 2007-2014 Housing Element
        were not implemented
    •   Expanding the analysis of the housing needs of specific vulnerable populations
    •   Alternative funding sources following the dissolution of redevelopment in California
    •   Providing additional affordability information for specific housing sites Including the cost
        associated with development standards
    •   Including the cost associated with development standards

                                                   Page 5

1. Introduction
As a result of the letter received from LSNC, the City is committed to doing more public
outreach prior to the Housing Element adoption hearing; additional information and clarification
language has been added to the Housing Element; and two new housing policies have been
added, while two additional policies have been amended, to incorporate some of the
recommendations.
1.5      HOUSING POLICIES RESULTING FROM PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
As a result of public input, several policies are being proposed or modified to address specific
concerns and ideas. These polices have been incorporated into Chapter 2, Housing Programs,
and are discussed below:
Guiding Policies
H.1 - G 5       Support the development of permanent, affordable, and accessible housing,
                along transit lines and near services, that allows people with disabilities to live
                independent lives integrated into the larger community.

1.6      INFORMATION SOURCES
The most comprehensive and authoritative source of information on population, housing, and
economic data is the United States Census. Census data within this report is from the Decennial
(2010) Census, except in a few instances where information was available from the 2008-2012
American Community Survey. The source for the majority of the data tables found in this report
is from the Census’ Summary File 3. Summary File 3 presents detailed population and housing
data (such as place of birth, education, employment status, income, value of housing unit, year
structure built) collected from a 1-in-6 sample and weighted to represent the total population.
While the 2010 Census is considered the most reliable source of demographic information,
other more recent sources of data may provide a better snapshot of today’s demographics. To
address this, the City supplemented the Census data with data from other sources when
possible. The additional data sources include:
•    Demographic and housing data provided by the Association of Bay Area Governments
     (ABAG) and the State Department of Finance Economic Development Department.
•    Median Income data provided by the U.S. Office of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
•    Housing market information, including foreclosure data and median sales data was
     purchased from Data Quick Services.
•    Employment and commuter data provided by Metropolitan Transportation Commission (for
     the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area) (MTC).
•    Demographic information from the 2008-2012 American Community Survey.
•    Housing condition information collected by a City windshield survey.
•    Public and nonprofit agencies were consulted for data on special needs groups, the services
     available to them, and gaps in the system.
•    Apartment vacancy and rental rate data was collected from annual City surveys.

CHAPTER 2
HOUSING PROGRAMS
This chapter describes the strategies to be carried out during the fifth cycle of the Housing
Element Update, from January 31, 2015 to January 31, 2023, to meet Vacaville’s housing
needs. The policies and programs listed in this chapter concentrate on providing affordable
housing for extremely low, very low, low and moderate-income families and individuals; housing
for those with above-moderate income seems to need no encouragement. The City’s affordable
housing strategy is to provide a wide range of housing services to benefit households with
incomes at or below 120 percent of median, but to concentrate on helping those in the very-low
and low income categories. The City strives to provide a full continuum of housing services,
such as support services to entities serving the homeless, rental assistance, assistance for first
time homebuyers, housing counseling, and fair housing assistance.
Prior to the dissolution of redevelopment in California, the Vacaville Redevelopment Agency
(Agency) placed 20 percent of its tax increment revenues into a Low and Moderate Income
Housing Fund (LMIHF) as required. During previous Housing Element planning periods,
approximately $52 million of LIHF was used to carry out affordable housing activities. Upon
dissolution, the Agency's affordable housing LIHF cash balance was turned over to the County
Auditor-Controller for distribution to the taxing entities. The City became the Successor Housing
Agency to the former Agency and received approval of its Housing Assets List from the
Department of Finance (DOF). The list included 81 real properties purchased by the former
redevelopment agency with the intention of developing affordable housing and a loan portfolio
consisting of primarily deferred or forgivable loans to individual homebuyers/owners and
affordable housing non-profits.
Senate Bill 341 (SB 341) effective October 13, 2013 dictates how any funds that may be
received by the City, as Housing Successor, must be expended (such as loan repayments or
proceeds from sale of property). This includes targeting expenditures to households earning
80 percent or less of area median income (AMI). 30 percent of funds received must be spent on
housing for households earning 30 percent or less of AMI, 20 percent of funds received must be
spent on housing for households earning between 60 and 80 percent of AMI over a five-year
period.
In 2012, the City approved a Housing Strategy to sell some real properties and develop other
properties as affordable housing as originally intended. Proceeds from any property sales must
be used in accordance with applicable Community Redevelopment Law and SB 341 as
amended by Assembly Bill 1793.
The City will need to identify and seek alternate sources of funding to fill the gap left with the
end of redevelopment. The City hopes it will see this gap partially filled by statewide strategies
such as cap and trade funding for affordable, transit-oriented housing as part of the California
Homes and Jobs Act (SB 391). Without a permanent source of funding for affordable housing,
the City anticipates that public-private partnerships will be created in order to solicit a variety of
layered funding sources in order for affordable housing developments to be financially feasible.
The principal assumption made is that the City will aggressively pursue a wide variety of
resources to meet its housing needs.

2. Housing Programs
Although new construction is not expected to fully address the needs of very low and low-
income households, Vacaville has been very successful in providing very low income housing
units, as shown in Chapter 8 (Evaluation of the Previous Housing Element).In addition, Vacaville
has a very large supply of older apartment units, which typically help provide for lower income
households.
The two major funding sources for supportive housing activities are the HUD Housing Choice
Voucher Program (approximately $85 million during the planning period) and Community
Development Block Grant Funds (approximately $3 million during the planning period). The
programs and annual goals are described in Section 2.4 (Housing Support Services).
The Housing Element goals, policies, and programs are based on the City’s commitment to
affordable housing, available resources, past experience, evaluation of the past Housing
Element, and understanding of the market forces which drive housing development. Existing
successful programs have been carried over from the prior Housing Element, while new
programs have been identified in order to comply with new State statutes, to address new
housing challenges based on the current housing market, and to incorporate feasible programs
suggested by housing and social service stakeholders convened in a June 2014 stakeholder
interview.
Table 1 shows the number of units to be achieved during the period January 31, 2015 through
January 31, 2023. The total new construction goal meets the total housing need determined by
the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). Though City growth policies allow a growth
rate that far exceeds the total housing need as determined by ABAG, the Housing Element
goals for new construction are based upon a more conservative growth rate due to the current
economy and housing market. Should the residential housing market conditions significantly
improve, it is expected that actual construction will exceed the goals. As documented in the
inventory of vacant lands, the City has an ample inventory of residential land. Table 2 provides a
detailed breakdown of the quantified goals.

  17 of these units will be restricted to households with income below 30 percent of the local area median (AMI).
The goal is for 472 new units in the very-low and low-income ranges to be constructed. At least
216 of the units in the very-low and low income category will be restricted to households with
incomes below 60 percent of median. The primary reason why housing can be accomplished at
60 and not 50 percent is because of the funding restrictions for tax-exempt bonds and tax

is 60 percent rather than 50 percent.
Together with new construction, the goal is to construct and acquire/rehabilitate 667 units
affordable to low-income households, with 337 of these units affordable to households earning
below 60 percent of the median household income; 121 of these units affordable to households
earning below 50 percent of the median household income; and 23 of these units affordable to
households earning below 30 percent of the median household income.

2. Housing Programs
The policies and programs address a continuum of housing needs, from homeless, rental
assistance, and first time homebuyers. However, the majority of funding is targeted to very low
and low-income households. The housing program includes policies and programs in four
distinct subject areas.
•    New Construction
•    Rehabilitation and Conservation
•    Housing Support Services
As required by Section 65583 of the Government Code, housing program policies in this section
seek to meet the quantified housing goals set forth in Tables 1 and 2.
As noted previously, it is more appropriate for the Land Use Element of the General Plan to
address residential policies such as land use, growth, density, and design. The Land Use
Diagram, which is a part of the General Plan, provides information on planned land use and
densities for land within the planning area. The zoning map provides more detailed information
for zoning of parcels within the City limits. The Land Use Element also addresses residential
development, residential land supply, and land use controls. The programs in the Housing
Element deal with more fine-grained questions of providing housing and are consistent with
policies contained within the Land Use Element.
2.1      ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR HOUSING PROGRAMS
One of the greatest challenges facing the City in its ability to provide needed housing and
housing services is the loss in 2012 of its Redevelopment Agency and the associated Low-
Income Housing Funds. These funds have been the City of Vacaville’s greatest affordable
housing financing tool. Due to their elimination, many of Vacaville’s affordable housing
programs, listed below and described within this document, have been suspended:
First Time Home Buyer (FTHB) Loan Programs:
•    Down Payment Assistance (DPALs)
•    Shared Equity
•    Section 8 FTHB Match
Rehabilitation Loan Programs:
•    Owner Occupied
•    Owner/Investor
Other Programs:
•    Senior Home Improvement (SHIP)
•    Security Deposit Loans
It is unclear how State legislators intend to address funds to replace those eliminated with
Redevelopment in the upcoming years. The State did return one-time “boomerang”
redevelopment funds to the City, but these were earmarked for other purposes. Housing
advocates are pursuing the 2013 Homes and Jobs Act (SB 391), which would help establish a
permanent, ongoing source of funding dedicated to affordable housing development. The 2014-
15 State budget has been approved with 10 percent of cap-and-trade auction revenues
dedicated to affordable housing equitable transit-oriented development, estimated to be $200 to
$300 million/year starting in 2015, as well as a State general fund allocation for HCD’s Multi-
Family Housing Program (MHP). The elimination of Redevelopment and the Low and Moderate

Income Housing Fund has severely impacted the City of Vacaville's ability to fund new
affordable housing activities. The City will continue to implement the programs in this Housing
Element as funds are available, and will continue to seek out and apply for alternative sources
of funding to support housing development and services.
2.2     NEW CONSTRUCTION
The two types of strategies to be employed are planning policies and housing programs. The
City of Vacaville Community Development Department will be responsible for ensuring the
implementation of planning and building related policies. The City of Vacaville Department of
Housing Services, which also staffs the Housing Authority, will be responsible for carrying out
the housing programs that expand, conserve, and preserve affordable housing and provide
needed housing related services.
The goal during the planning period is to construct 751 housing units affordable to very-low and
low- income households. The goal is to construct 500 moderate-income units. Units with long-
term affordability agreements will include 10 extremely low-income units and 471 very-low/low
income units. Of those 471 very-low/low income units with affordability restrictions, 341 (72
percent) will be affordable to households with incomes below 60 percent of median. Planning
policies such as density bonuses for affordability and gap financing such as rent and mortgage
subsidies will be utilized, when possible, to meet these goals.
The primary sources of funding for new construction activities are HCD and tax-exempt bonds
and tax credits. During the period covered by this Housing Element, the City will apply for and
support the use of HOME funds along with other HCD funding opportunities.
Guiding Policies
H.1 - G 1        Ensure a supply of housing of differing type, size, and affordability in order to
                 meet Vacaville's housing needs for the current and future residents and workers
                 within the community.
H.1 - G 2        In conjunction with policies in the Land Use Element of the Vacaville General
                 Plan, ensure that an adequate supply of developable land is available to meet
                 Vacaville's housing need, particularly for affordable housing.
H.1 - G 3        Remove constraints to the production and availability of housing to the extent
                 consistent with other General Plan policies.
H.1 - G 4        Ensure the development and availability of housing appropriate for special needs
                 groups including, but not limited to, young adults, young families, seniors, people
                 with physical and developmental disabilities and homeless people.
H.1 - G 5        Support the development of permanent, affordable, and accessible housing,
                 along transit lines and near services, that allows people with disabilities to live
                 independent lives integrated into the larger community.
H.1 - G 6        Encourage universal design in new housing developments to support both
                 accessibility for residents with disabilities as well as visitability of friends and
                 neighbors by people with disabilities.

2. Housing Programs
H.1 - G 7      Establish development and construction standards that encourage energy
               conservation in residential areas.
H.1 - G 8      Aggressively participate in all programs, state and federal, private and public,
               suitable for maintaining and increasing the supply of affordable housing.
H.1 - G 9      Ensure the viability of Travis Air Force Base through the provision of an
               adequate supply of affordable housing for military families.
Implementing Policies
H.1 - I 1      Continue to use the Density Bonus provisions in the Land Use and
               Development Code to grant density bonuses above the State-mandated
               minimum in return for an increased share of affordable units.
               Implementation: On an ongoing basis, the Community Development Department
               and the Department of Housing Services will continue to make developers aware
               of the provisions in the Density Bonus ordinance.
H.1 - I 2      Consider an amendment to the Land Use and Development Code to allow
               innovative and affordable housing within new single-family subdivisions.
               This could include provisions that allow duplexes to be built on the larger
               corner lots and secondary living units to be built in conjunction with new
               homes.
               Implementation: In conjunction with adoption of this Housing Element, the
               Community Development Department will request that the Planning Commission
               initiate an amendment to the Land Use and Development Code to allow
               secondary living units to be a permitted use when constructed at the same time
               as a new single family home and to permit duplexes and attached single homes
               to be allowed in residential Planned Developments where the overall density of
               the project is consistent with the underlying zoning and General Plan
               designations. It should be noted that through the Planning entitlement process,
               this program may be implemented prior to adoption of an amendment.
               As provided for in Government Code Section 65583.1, the City has, and
               continues to, apply secondary living units towards its adequate sites requirement.
               In Vacaville, secondary living units are usually occupied by elderly parents or
               young, single adults.
H.1 - I 3      Continue implementing the Economic Development Incentive Program
               which grants a 10 percent reduction in development impact fees for the
               first 100 residential permits issued under this program
               Implementation: The Community Development Department, in coordination with
               affected City departments, will continue to issue permits with development
               impact fees discounted to pre-2014 levels, until all 100 permits have been
               issued.
H.1 - I 4      Review and update the development impact fee structure for residential
               projects.

          Implementation: Following the adoption of the comprehensive General Plan
          Update, expected in early 2015, the City will conduct impact fee studies that will
          include an evaluation of changes to the current fee structure. At this time, the
          City will consider a lower impact fee structure for small single-family starter
          homes as compared to larger move-up and executive homes, as well as a lower
          new impact fee structure for multi-family housing. Adoption of the fee studies
          and updated fees would happen within two years of adoption of the updated
          General Plan.
H.1 - I 5 Assist affordable housing developers to construct 472 new housing units
          affordable to households with incomes below 80 percent of median, with 90
          percent of these units being affordable at 60 percent or below median, and
          6 of these units being affordable to families with incomes below 30 percent
          of median.
          Implementation: Implementation will occur during the 2015-2023 housing cycle
          and includes working with local non-profit entities to mobilize a wide variety of
          funding, negotiate long-term affordability agreements, participate in project
          design, assist with planning and building approvals, monitor the affordability
          agreements, and report to funding sources. The primary source of affordable
          housing funding is tax credits and tax exempt bonds. It is anticipated that the City
          will assist affordable housing projects by providing land from former
          Redevelopment acquisitions.
H.1 - I 6 Give priority to special needs housing and residential care facilities by
          allowing for reduced processing time and streamlined procedures for
          special needs housing land use applications.
          Implementation: The Community Development Department will process special
          needs housing and residential care facilities submittals as quickly as possible;
          priority processing may take the form of prioritizing these projects and/or granting
          concurrent Planning and Building Permit review, as appropriate.
H.1 - I 7 Encourage preferential handling of special needs populations, such as
          domestic violence cases, youth aging out of foster care, the
          developmentally disabled, single parents, etc., in the management plans
          and regulatory agreements of funded projects.
          Implementation: The City will amend its agreements to require that funded
          housing projects include, in their management plans, preferential handling of
          special needs populations.
H.1 - I 8 Consider adopting a Universal Design ordinance incentivizing accessible
          design features in new residential development to support visitability,
          which allows people with limited mobility to stay integrated with the
          community.
          Implementation: Following the adoption of the comprehensive General Plan
          Update, expected in early 2015, the City will conduct a study to determine best
          practices for and feasibility of adopting incentives to encourage Universal Design
          features in new residential development and if feasible, adopt a Universal Design
          ordinance.

2. Housing Programs
H.1 - I 9      Identify sites that are appropriate for military families based at Travis Air
               Force base and work with Air Force housing officials and non-profit
               housing groups to build off-base housing units that are affordable to active
               military families at Travis Air Force Base.
               Implementation: The City owns an 8.4-acre site, donated by the developer of the
               Alamo Place Subdivision. In 2004, a 93-unit affordable apartment and town
               home project was approved for the site. The project approval lapsed and the
               non-profit developer is no longer involved in the project. The site has been zoned
               to Medium Density. The City shall pursue development of this property and other
               appropriate sites.
H.1 - I 10     Continue to implement the Residential Overlay District Ordinance by
               supporting development of apartments on vacant commercial lands, which
               are appropriate sites for multi-family development.
               Implementation: The Community Development Department implements the
               ordinance on a regular basis and will continue to make apartment developers
               aware of the zoning option to request to construct apartments on commercial
               lands as an alternative land use. The Residential Overlay District Ordinance has
               been and will continue to be an effective tool to add multi-family units to the
               City’s housing inventory. To date, several apartment projects have been built as
               a result of implementation of this policy. River Oaks (312 units), Saratoga Phase
               I (108 units), Walnut Grove (117 units), The Commons (208 units), Lincoln
               Corner (134 units) and Northpointe Apartments (312 units) were approved and
               construction is complete. All of these projects were developed at a density at or
               above 20 units per acre.
H.1 - I 11     Work with private and non-profit developers to target subsidies and
               programs to expand the supply of three-bedroom apartments to provide
               affordable multi-family housing for large families and young adult
               households.
               Implementation: Upon adoption of the General Plan, the Community
               Development Department will request that the Planning Commission initiate an
               amendment to the Land Use and Development Code to require new non-senior
               apartment projects of over 50 units to include a minimum of 15 percent three
               bedroom units. If initiated by the Planning Commission, the ordinance
               amendment will be scheduled for public hearings within the first two years of the
               Housing Element cycle. The City will also support the project on Rocky Hill Road
               under discussion as of late 2014 that plans to incorporate three- and four-
               bedroom apartments in a 41-unit affordable housing complex. The Community
               Development Department will work with private and non-profit developers during
               the project review process on an ongoing basis throughout the 2015-2023
               housing cycle, depending on market and developer interest, to target subsidies
               and programs.
H.1 - I 12     Strengthen anti-NIMBY protections including no-net loss housing

           Implementation: Following adoption of the General Plan Update, the Community
           Development Department will request that the Planning Commission initiate an
           amendment to the Land Use and Development Code to set forth specific findings
           and the required analysis needed in conjunction with consideration of rezonings
           of residential land in order to find that the inventory of residential land does not
           fall below the minimum required to meet the City’s housing goals as determined
           by ABAG. On an ongoing basis, the Community Development Department’s
           Planning Division will incorporate project specific conditions of approval as a part
           of the project entitlement process to require identification signs on properties
           approved for multi-family housing developments through specific project
           entitlements and for sites in master planned areas reserved for multi-family
           development.
H.1 - I 13 Implement the Opportunity Hill Master Plan by identifying lands to be
           rezoned to allow up to 65 dwelling units per acre within the Urban High
           Density (RUHD) Residential Overlay District.
           Implementation: In 2008, the City Council adopted the Opportunity Hill Master
           Plan and Design Guidelines. In order to implement the Plan, the City Council
           also will consider a General Plan Amendment to allow up to 65 units per acre
           within the Opportunity Hill Master Plan area as part of the Comprehensive
           General Plan Update, which is expected to be adopted in 2015. The Opportunity
           Hill project will intensify land uses and revitalize portions of the Downtown Area.
           Land use recommendations identified specialty retail, office uses, housing
           opportunities (including live/work units, for-sale, and affordable housing
           component), entertainment and restaurant uses, and a continuation of heritage
           tourism that celebrates Vacaville’s rich history. This project will be an infill project
           and the City has already acquired a significant number of parcels in the area that
           are now vacant. The project will be required to comply with the adopted Master
           Plan design and development guidelines. To support the Master Plan’s goals, the
           updated General Plan includes several policies and actions related to design
           guidelines and standards, parking, development incentives, General Plan and
           Zoning amendments, connectivity, infrastructure, wayfinding, and affordable
           housing. In addition, Action LU-A16.4 in the Land Use Element directs the City to
           amend the Residential Urban High Density Overlay on the Opportunity Hill and
           Depot Street sites to allow up to 65 dwelling units per acre.
H.1 - I 14 Consider an amendment to the Land Use and Development Code and/or the
           Single Family Design Guidelines to include alternative development and
           design standards for small lot subdivisions, specifically for lots smaller
           than 5,000 square feet and for affordable housing developments.
           Implementation: The Community Development Department has coordinated with
           other affected City departments and consulted with residential builders to identify
           potential design and development standards specific to small-lot single family
           projects, requiring such projects to include a significant number of smaller floor
           plans or less than 1,500 square feet which are affordable by design and to
           identify alternative design standards to encourage developers to build homes that
           will be affordable to entry level buyers. The Planning Commission initiated these
           amendments to the Land Use and Development Code and included 6,000-
           square foot lots in the policy. The Land Use and Development Code will be

H.1 - I 15     High Density Residential (RHD) lands identified in the Residential Land
               Inventory shall be required to develop with a minimum density of 20 units
               per acre.
               Implementation: On an ongoing basis, as a part of the discretionary development
               review process, the Community Development Department will require RHD sites
               to be designed with a minimum density of 20 units per acre in order to implement
               the policies of the Housing Element. All recently approved high density projects
               have been constructed with an average density of 20 units per acre density,
               except for projects with density bonuses approved at higher densities.
H.1 - I 16     Continue to monitor changes in State Law related to housing issues and
               initiate amendments to the Land Use and Development Code as needed to
               ensure consistency of local ordinances with State Law.
               Implementation: Most recently, in 2014, the City Council amended the Land Use
               and Development Code to implement SB 2 (Zoning for all Housing Types). On
               an ongoing basis, each year, as a part of the preparation of the status of the
               General Plan report, new State legislation related to housing issues will be
               reviewed and the Community Development Department staff will request the
               Planning Commission to initiate changes to the Land Use and Development
               Code as required to maintain consistency with State Law. Updates to the Land
               Use and Development Code shall include revisions to the City’s Density Bonus
               ordinance to address AB 2222.
H.1 - I 17     Implement California energy conservation standards.
               Implementation: On an ongoing basis, the Community Development
               Department’s Building Division enforces the State energy standards, as adopted
               and amended by the California Building Standards Commission, as a part of the
               building plan check and permitting process for all residential projects. As part of
               the General Plan Update process, the City will adopt an Energy and
               Conservation Action Strategy (ECAS) that includes policies addressing energy
               conservation. This document and its EIR has been recommended for adoption by
               the Planning Commission and will be considered by the City Council in early
               2015.
H.1 - I 18     Implement the California Green Building Standards Building Code.
               Implementation: The most recent version of the California Green Building
               Standards Code (CALGreen), went into effect January 1, 2014. The Community
               Development Department’s Building Division has implemented the changes in
               the Code as they apply to all residential projects, and will continue to implement
               the Code and incorporate future amendments.
H.1 - I 19     Encourage energy-conserving development patterns.
               Implementation: On an ongoing basis, as a part of the development review

           easily accessible by all future residents in the project via pedestrian pathways.
           As part of the General Plan Update process, the City will adopt an Energy and
           Conservation Action Strategy (ECAS) that includes policies addressing energy
           conservation. This document and its EIR has been recommended for adoption by
           the Planning Commission and will be considered by the City Council in early

H.1 - I 20 Encourage energy conservation through energy-reducing landscaping,
           orientation and configuration of buildings, site, and other factors affecting
           energy use.
           Implementation: On an ongoing basis, through the building permit process for
           new development, the Community Development Department enforces the water
           efficiency standards for landscaping. Through the environmental review process,
           energy efficiency is evaluated and where appropriate, mitigation measures are
           required to address landscaping and parking lot shading. As part of the General
           Plan Update process, the City will adopt an Energy and Conservation Action
           Strategy (ECAS) that includes policies addressing energy conservation. This
           document and its EIR has been recommended for adoption by the Planning
           Commission and will be considered by the City Council in early 2015.
H.1 - I 21 Continue to allow manufactured homes on foundations on residential land,
           subject to the same development standards as site-built housing.
           Implementation: The Land Use and Development Code permits manufactured
           homes to be constructed in single family zoning districts, subject to the same
           design review process as a site-built house.
H.1 - I 22 The City of Vacaville, in its capacity as the City’s water and sewer service
           provider, will grant priority for service allocations to proposed
           developments that include housing units affordable to lower-income
           households.
           Implementation: During the review of development entitlements for proposed
           residential projects affordable to very-low and low income households, the
           Community Development Department, in conjunction with the Utilities
           Department, will evaluate wastewater treatment capacity and water allocations
           required to serve the project and give priority for allocations except where
           capacity has already been granted to other approved projects. There are no
           known treatment capacity or water allocation shortfalls which would impede
           residential development during the timeframe of this Housing Element.
H.1 - I 23 The City of Vacaville will conduct an affordable housing impact fee study
           that considers the Community Facilities District fees for multi-family

2. Housing Programs
                 Implementation: A study commissioned by the City in 2014 to analyze the impacts
                 of the Community Facilities Districts (CFDs) on apartment project feasibility found
                 that the sample apartment project evaluated was not feasible under current
                 economic conditions (80 percent of the shortfall was related to project costs or
                 revenue shortfalls unrelated to CFD fees). Within two years after the adoption of
                 the comprehensive General Plan Update, expected in 2015, the City will conduct
                 an affordable housing impact fee study evaluating the fees for multi-family
                 development. The study will compare Vacaville’s requirements for multi-family
                 housing units to those charged by the County and Benicia, Vallejo, Fairfield, and
                 Dixon, and will include CFD requirements along with impact fees, such as traffic,
                 parks, community facilities, and infrastructure. The study will also evaluate how the
                 feasibility and certainty of an affordable housing prototype project would be
                 affected by changes in overall “fee” levels to make Vacaville’s more comparable to
                 other jurisdictions (whether higher or lower). Prior to conducting the study, the City
                 will consider whether these fees create a potential constraint for single-family
                 development in Vacaville and, if so, expand the study to address single-family
                 development as well. Based on the conclusions of this impact fee study, the City
                 will consider actions to mitigate any negative impacts of the Community Facilities
                 District fee.
2.3      REHABILITATION AND CONSERVATION
Conserving and preserving the existing stock of affordable housing is critical to meeting
Vacaville’s housing needs. These efforts include enforcing existing affordable housing
agreements, making funds available for the acquisition and/or rehabilitation of existing housing
units and installing weatherization methods, requiring Housing Quality Standards (HQS) for all
Housing Choice Voucher units, enforcing the new ordinance to encourage property
maintenance and promoting improved quality of life, disallowing condominium conversions
when vacancy is below 3 percent, and preserving federally assisted units which may convert to
market rate.
Beginning in 2006, using Agency Low Income Housing Set-Aside funds and taxable bonds
proceeds in the amount of $18 million, the former City of Vacaville Redevelopment Agency
(Agency) acquired market-rate multi-family residential complexes along Callen Street, Bennett
Hill Drive, and Bennett Hill Court: 18 four-plexes, three duplexes, and one eight-plex. The goal
of these acquisitions is to provide comprehensive neighborhood revitalization through
rehabilitation and new construction of these units for affordable housing. As of 2014, the City is
completing the first of two phases of rehabilitation and new construction. Completion of both
phases will result in the production of 130 affordable rental units with affordability rates at 30 to
60 percent of area median income (AMI). Of these 130 units, 74 will be rehabilitated and 56 will
be new construction. In addition, City has been working with a developer for the future new
construction of (41 units) and rehabilitation of (51 units) of 92 affordable units on Rocky Hill
Road and Meadows Court. See Section 6.3 in Chapter 6 of this document for more information
about these substantially rehabilitated units.

H.2 - G 4      Maintain the total number of affordable units, present and future, at price levels
               affordable to the intended income groups.
Implementing Policies
H.2 - I 1      Continue to enforce housing affordability agreements between the owners
               and the City.
               Implementation: This is ongoing and enforced by the Department of Housing
               Services. Currently there are 126 affordability agreements covering 1,007 units,
               including homes purchased under the City’s Shared Equity Loan Program.
H.2 - I 2      Continue to operate and expand below-market-rate loan programs for the
               acquisition and/or rehabilitation (including installation of weatherization
               measures) of housing occupied by lower-income owners and renters.
               Implementation: This is an ongoing effort by the Department of Housing
               Services. During the planning period, 125 units, including 74 at the Callen Street
               project and 51 at the Rocky Hill project, will be acquired and/or rehabilitated, and
               all will have long-term affordability agreements. Of the 125 units, all will be
               affordable for households with incomes below 60 percent of median.
H.2 - I 3      Continue to operate and expand the HUD funded Housing Choice Voucher
               Program to preserve the stock of existing housing.
               Implementation: A key component of the Housing Choice Voucher Program is
               the requirement that all housing owners participating in the program comply with
               Housing Quality Standards (HQS). The Vacaville Housing Authority (VHA)
               inspects each unit at move-in and annually thereafter to ensure HQS compliance.
               The VHA conducts approximately 1,300 HQS inspections annually. Special
               inspections may also be conducted at the request of the landlord or the tenant.
               At this time there are 1,193 Housing Choice Vouchers. The VHA will apply for
               and accept additional vouchers as they become available.
H.2 - I 4      Continue to enforce the Public Nuisance Ordinance (PNO) to encourage
               property maintenance and to promote improved quality of life in Vacaville’s
               communities.
               Implementation: This ordinance is enforced by the Fire Department Code
               Enforcement Division, which receives and investigates approximately 2,000 calls
               per year regarding the PNO. These calls/cases relate to property accumulations,
               overgrown vegetation, graffiti, etc. Vehicle abatement in the public right-of-way is
               addressed by the Police Department. By working with the responsible party to
               correct the violations, the overall quality of life is preserved and/or enhanced in
               the neighborhood. In addition, participation in the City’s Crime Free Multi-
               Housing Program is encouraged and is a requirement through affordability
               covenants for affordable housing developments.

2. Housing Programs
H.2 - I 5      Continue to enforce and update the Condominium Conversion Ordinance.
               Implementation: Passed in 1982, this ordinance states that no applications for
               conversion will be accepted if the apartment vacancy rate is below 3 percent.
               The Department of Housing Services conducts an annual vacancy survey to
               determine the vacancy rate. On an ongoing basis, the Community Development
               Department enforces the Condominium Conversion Ordinance by accepting
               applications for conversions only when the citywide apartment vacancy rate is
               above 3 percent. In February 2013, the City Council approved an amendment to
               the Condominium Conversion ordinance that prevents the conversion of senior
               apartments if the senior restricted apartment rate falls below 3 percent and
               requires the applicant to fund the vacancy survey.
               Following the planned adoption of the General Plan Update, the Planning
               Commission will consider amending the Land Use and Development Code to
               include provisions to protect existing tenant rights during the conversion process
               including first right-of-refusal for purchase.
H.2 - I 6      Assist in maintaining the affordability of units produced through federal
               and State programs by working with appropriate organizations to identify
               units, which may convert to market- rate units, analyzing the cost of
               keeping the units as affordable, and taking measures to ensure continued
               affordability or providing assistance to residents if the affordability of the
               units is removed.
               Implementation: This is an ongoing program by the Department of Housing
               Services. There are 274 units of subsidized below market rate housing that are at
               risk of conversion to market rate within this Housing Element planning cycle. The
               Housing Services Department will continue its program to maintain the list of “at
               risk” units, maintain contact with owners of at risk units to determine their interest
               in selling, prepaying, terminating or continuing participation in a subsidy program,
               ascertain HUD’s interest in issuing Housing Choice Vouchers for “opt out” units,
               in order to preserve and/or extend affordability, and work with owners, tenants,
               and nonprofit organizations to assist in the nonprofit acquisition of at-risk projects
               to ensure long-term affordability of the development. It is anticipated that the 60
               units at Quail Run that are currently affordable to households earning 80 percent
               of Area Median Income (20 percent of the total units), will be replaced either by
               units that have been rehabilitated with government assistance in exchange for
               affordability restrictions or by newly constructed units with affordability
               restrictions. Vaca Gables (65 units) and Hillside Senior apartments (15 units) are
               owned by a local non-profit affordable housing provider. Department of Housing
               Services staff will continue to communicate regularly with the owner, who is
               committed to providing affordable housing at these complexes in perpetuity.
H.2 - I 7      Support the development of Extremely Low Income rental housing by
               seeking additional funding sources from State and Federal resources.
               Implementation: As housing projects are proposed during the 2015-2023
               housing cycle, the Department of Housing Services will continue to seek out
               additional funding sources to support the development of Extremely Low Income
               rental housing. In 2013, the City accessed $6.2 million of the 2006 Affordable
                                  City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

          Housing Bond proceeds, which will continue to be used to rehabilitate and
          construct new apartments in the Callen Street/Bennett Hills areas. In addition,
          the City has been working with a developer for the future new construction (41
          units) and rehabilitation (51 units) of 92 affordable units on Rocky Hill Road and
          Meadows Court. The City contribution will include a deferred acquisition loan for
          the fair market value of the City-owned parcel, as well as the assumption of
          existing City loans. The project will seek State and Federal financing awards
          from programs directed at Veteran homeless prevention, the developmentally
          disabled, and families.
          In addition, the Department of Housing Services will continue to apply annually
          for the HOME federal grant, as feasible, during the annual application cycle,
          which is typically during the summer months. Funds received from this grant will
          be allocated to the development of housing affordable to extremely low, very low,
          and low-income households. The City also intends to continue applying on an
          ongoing basis for housing funds from HCD sources including the Veteran
          Housing and Homeless Prevention Program, CalHome, the Housing-Related
          Parks Program, and the Multi-family Housing Program (MHP).
H.2 - I 8 As funding permits, continue to Promote Community Viability through
          Comprehensive Neighborhood Revitalization in Target Areas.
          Implementation: The 2009 /2011, City of Vacaville Strategic Plan identifies a
          goal to continue comprehensive neighborhood revitalization activities in targeted
          areas. City efforts to improve the physical and social conditions of targeted
          neighborhoods experiencing a decline in their quality of life are still underway.
          The City has committed funds to The Leaven, a faith-based organization to
          provide supportive services to the children residing in the Opportunity House, the
          recently expanded and rehabilitated local homeless shelter. In addition, the City
          has worked closely with the local non-profit affordable housing provider,
          Vacaville Community Housing, Inc., which will release a Request for Proposals
          for social services at its multi-family units.
          The City transferred 0.94 acres on Rocky Hill Road to the Vacaville Storehouse
          for development of a community garden that will serve nearby tenants of
          affordable housing. The community garden will be located directly north of the
          Rocky Hill Trail project. The Rocky Hill Trail is an unofficial local foot path forged
          through historic railroad right-of-ways connecting Holly Lane to E. Monte Vista
          Avenue. The Rocky Hill trail project included in the Draft General Plan will create
          an alternative safe and secure walking and biking path and open space area that
          connects affordable housing to amenities and increases neighborhood
          walkability.
H.2 - I 9 Continue the Process of Acquiring and Converting Market Rate Multi-family
          Rental Housing Units In The Callen Street/Bennett Hill Drive/Bennett Hill
          Court Revitalization Area for the Purpose of Substantial Rehabilitation and
          Converting the Units to Affordable Housing Units.
          Implementation: In 2006, the former City of Vacaville Redevelopment Agency
          issued taxable housing bonds in the amount of $18 million for the purpose of
          acquiring and converting market rate multi- family rental housing units in the
                           City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element
                                              Page 23
2. Housing Programs
                Callen Street/Bennett Hill revitalization area. A portion of these funds were used,
                along with Low Income Housing Set- Aside funds, to acquire 18 four-plexes,
                three duplexes, and one eight-plex. Since that time, the local homeless facility
                relocated and doubled its capacity from 24 beds to 48 beds used to assist
                homeless families and women in the community. This was accomplished
                through demolition and rehabilitation of one four-plex and one eight-plex owned
                by the City on Bennett Hill Court. This facility location is permanently affordable
                through a deed restriction. On April 13, 2013, the Department of Finance (DOF)
                authorized the City to access $6.2 million of the 2006 Affordable Housing Bond
                proceeds for the purpose of developing affordable housing. The City is utilizing
                these funds to reopen the Callen Street project, which consists of two phases
                of rehabilitation and new construction activity in the Callen Street/Bennett Hill
                areas resulting in a total of 130 affordable rental units with affordability rates at
                30 to 60 percent of area median income (AMI). In March 2014, the Phase 1
                Callen Street/Bennett Hill area began the rehabilitation of 64 units, scheduled
                to be completed in March 2015.
                Phase II of the Callen project includes the demolition and new construction (56
                units) and rehabilitation of (10 units) on Callen Street with affordability levels of
                30 to 60 percent of AMI. In August 2014, the City Council approved the
                disposition, development, and loan agreement with the developer, and the
                Planning Commission approved the Planning applications for the reconstruction
                of these units.
                The Rocky Hill project will include 41 units of new construction and 51 units of
                rehabilitation on Rocky Hill Road and Meadows Court. In November 2014, the
                City Council approved the disposition, development, and loan agreement with
                the developer to transfer land and assume debt in support of the project.
2.4     HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICES
In addition to efforts to preserve and conserve the stock of affordable housing, the Department
of Housing Services provides a variety of support services as well as direct services to meet the
community’s housing needs. These efforts include educating the community about fair housing
and equal housing opportunity, providing housing counseling services, including first-time
homebuyer counseling, and resource information and referral. Support for securing funding,
outreach, education, intake, eligibility determination, and tracking are provided to non-profit
entities that assist the homeless and those in danger of losing their housing. Direct housing
assistance includes rental assistance paid to owners through the Housing Choice Voucher
Program, deep subsidies for rents affordable at below 50 percent of the local area median
income, and loans to assist first time homebuyers.
The two major funding sources for supportive housing activities are the HUD Housing Choice
Voucher Program (approximately $85 million during the planning period and Community
Development Block Grant Funds (approximately $3 million during the planning period). The
programs and annual goals are described below:
During this planning period, it is estimated that 500 emergency vouchers will be provided, 128
households (16 per year) will utilize loans to purchase first homes, and over 600 people (75 per
year) will receive housing support services including housing counseling.

Guiding Policies
H.3 - G 1        Promote equal housing opportunity for all.
H.3 - G 2        Assist in the providing of direct assistance to households in need of housing.
H.3 - G 3        Provide affordable housing homeownership opportunities.
Implementing Policies
H.3 - I 1        Work to ensure that individuals seeking housing in Vacaville are not
                 discriminated against on the basis of age, race, disability, gender, familial
                 status, national origin, or other protected categories.
                 Implementation: This is an ongoing effort through the Department of Housing
                 Services. The Housing Counseling Center, which provided activities such as Fair
                 Housing Month, tenant/landlord counseling, and providing assistance with filing a
                 fair housing complaint, was closed in 2012 when funding was eliminated with the
                 Redevelopment Agency However, the Department of Housing Services recently
                 renewed the certification for the City of Vacaville Housing Counseling Center
                 (VHCC) through U.S. HUD. As a certified Housing Counseling Agency, limited
                 programs have been reopened to ensure that homebuyers receive as much
                 information and education as possible to help them become successful
                 homeowners over the long term.
                 Equal access to housing is protected by State and federal law. Discrimination on
                 the basis of race, ethnic or national origin, religion, or marital status is prohibited
                 by the federal Civil Rights Act of 1968 and by Section 53 of the California Unruh
                 Civil Rights Act. The federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 prohibits
                 discrimination based on age, handicap, and familial status. The Rumford Fair
                 Housing Law (part of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act of 1980)
                 also protects an individual's access to housing.
                 The California Supreme Court ruled that discrimination against children in
                 housing is prohibited under the Unruh Civil Rights Act in its decision, Marina Pt.
                 Ltd. v. Wolfson, (1982) 30 Cal.3d 721. The Fair Housing Amendments Act also
                 prohibits discrimination against children. Mobile home parks and other
                 developments designed specifically for seniors or persons with disabilities are
                 exempt from these provisions against child discrimination.
                 The City of Vacaville will actively promote fair housing opportunities through its
                 Housing Services Department which will provide housing discrimination referral
                 to the appropriate investigative and enforcement entity, home buyer education
                 training, sponsoring, in partnership with others, Fair Housing Workshops and
                 Landlord Training. The City will continue to work closely with local faith-based
                 organizations, local non-profit agencies, Legal Services of Northern California,
                 the California Rental Apartment Association, and the federal Department of
                 Housing and Urban Development to ensure community support for fair housing
                 concerns and provide housing and family resource services each year.

2. Housing Programs
               The City will continue to celebrate Fair Housing Month each April by promoting
               youth and adult education and outreach activities which may include essay,
               poetry, and art contests in the schools and Vacaville Neighborhood Boys and
               Girls Clubs; public service announcements and features on the local television
               cable channel; newspaper articles and editorials; public forums and workshops.
               Other education and outreach activities may include distributing handouts at the
               Senior Center, apartment complexes, to Section 8 participants, and displaying
               posters and handouts in the Housing Services Department lobby in both Spanish
               and English. In addition, all Department of Housing Services publications will
               include the Fair Housing logo.
                To date, no funding source has been identified to directly support Housing
               Counseling activities; however, the Department of Housing Services seeks to
               obtain funding from HUD for Housing Counseling program administration as
               opportunities become available.
               Additionally, the City of Vacaville will continue to prepare an Analysis of
               Impediments to Fair Housing Choice in the City of Vacaville, in accordance with
               24 CFR 91.225(a)(1) regulations as required by the U.S. HUD Community
               Development Block Grant (CDBG) Entitlement program. The last Analysis of
               Impediments was prepared in 2009 to identify impediments to fair housing choice
               within Vacaville and establish actions to overcome the effects of these
               impediments. The City conducted this analysis by evaluating its current fair
               housing profile, identifying impediments to fair housing choice, and assessing
               current public/private fair housing programs and activities. In addition to
               reviewing public policies and actions, the City also contacted local banks and
               mortgage companies to review Home Mortgage Disclosure Act reports and other
               related documents. The Analysis will be updated in 2015.
H.3 - I 2      Provide technical and/or support services to non-profit agencies and other
               entities serving the homeless.
               Implementation: This is an ongoing effort of the Department of Housing
               Services. The City will assist the Vacaville Social Services Corporation, the
               Vacaville Community Welfare Association, and the Community Action
               Partnership of Solano (CAP Solano), as well as others who provide homeless
               services through the provision of technical and/or support assistance, as funding
               allows. As each entity has different needs, the City will provide support in those
               areas that would ensure the ongoing viability of the agency and the services the
               entity provides. Some of these technical and/or support services may include
               providing staff, counseling or meeting space; assisting in the development of
               funding proposals; securing partners for potential projects; participating on
               collaboratives or boards that address the issues of homelessness; provide on-
               site training for program participants or agency staff; and/or determining eligibility
               to receive homeless services. Included in these services is the provision of
               12,000 shelter nights at the homeless shelter in Vacaville, Opportunity House,
               and assisting between ten to twenty families per year with transitional housing.
               The recent expansion and relocation of Opportunity House was made possible
               through the Housing Services Department’s work with Vacaville Community
               Housing (VCH, a local non-profit affordable housing provider), which owned the
               previous shelter and shelter site (Opportunity House), and through a partnership
                                 City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

          with Vacaville Social Services Corporation (VSSC, the local non-profit that
          operates the shelter). Relocation was completed during 2012-2013. Funding for
          the project was secured through upfront cash from VSSC, a $480,000 donation
          from VCH, a capital campaign by VSSC, and a deferred acquisition loan from the
          City for the purchase of City property.
H.3 - I 3 Continue to support the Vacaville Community Welfare Association's
          (VCWA) emergency voucher and other emergency housing related
          programs.
          Implementation: This is an ongoing program by the Department of Housing
          Services in partnership with the VCWA to provide emergency housing through
          motel vouchers. DHS staff have provided outreach, intake, verification, and
          record-keeping services to the VCWA, which uses United Way and Federal
          Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funds to provide approximately 300
          emergency vouchers per year for households to stay overnight at motels, as well
          as emergency food and transportation. The program often bridges the gap
          between moving into a new housing unit, securing space at Opportunity House
          (the emergency shelter), or arranging to stay with family or friends.
          However, funding is no longer available for the emergency housing program. The
          City will continue to provide support for other emergency housing related
          programs and activities through the Vacaville Family Resource Center (FRC),
          which is under the Police Department and receives funds from the VCWA. It will
          continue to provide $200 per month for food and gas vouchers, and to conduct
          screening for the Season of Sharing program. The privately-funded Season of
          Sharing program provides emergency rental assistance to eligible lower-income
          Vacaville households each year. In addition, staff will screen for eligibility for
          utilities assistance on behalf of PG&E.
H.3 - I 4 Continue to operate and expand the HUD Housing Choice Voucher
          Program and other related rent subsidy programs.
          Implementation: This is an ongoing program by the Department of Housing
          Services. The Housing Choice Voucher Program will continue to be administered
          on behalf of the Vacaville Housing Authority (VHA) by the Department of Housing
          Services. The funding level for this program is approximately $10 million per year
          or $85 million during the planning period. This program provides monthly rent
          subsidies for very-low-income households. Seventy-five percent of newly
          admitted households must have incomes below 30 percent of area median.
          Currently the VHA has 1,193 vouchers to assist eligible households.
          In 2011, the VHA was successful in applying for 50 family unification vouchers.
          Family unification vouchers are made available to families for whom the lack of
          adequate housing is a primary factor in the separation, or threat of imminent
          separation, of children from their families or in the prevention of reunifying the
          children with their families; or for youth aging out of foster care. Family unification
          vouchers enable these families to lease or purchase decent, safe and sanitary
          housing that is affordable in the private housing market. The VHA will continue to
          apply for additional Housing Choice Vouchers as additional federal and state
          funding becomes available.

2. Housing Programs
               The VHA continues to implement its Section 8 Homeownership Program, which
               provides homeownership opportunities for eligible lower-income households.
               There are currently 7 households that have been successful in moving to
               homeownership through the mortgage subsidy this program provides.
H.3 - I 5      Continue to provide mortgage subsidies to increase affordability to levels
               below 50 percent of median.
               Implementation: This is an ongoing program by the Department of Housing
               Services. When possible, affordable housing loan repayment or property sales
               proceeds, HOME or other funds will be used to increase affordability to a greater
               degree than might be allowed by other funding sources participating in a project.
               For example, tax- exempt bond and tax credit financing require income levels at
               50 percent and 60 percent of median. When feasible, other funds will be loaned
               in exchange for affordability below 50 percent of median.
H.3 - I 6      Continue to provide First Time Homebuyer opportunities through various
               funding mechanisms including down payment loans and homebuyers
               education activities.
               Implementation: This is an ongoing program implemented by the Housing
               Services Department. The City will continue to provide a CalHOME Down
               Payment Assistance Loan program. This program permits first time homebuyer
               households making up to 80 percent of median income to be eligible for $50,000
               (maximum award). It is estimated that the City will be able to assist 128 first-time
               homebuyers during the reporting period using a variety of funding sources for
               Down Payment Assistance loans.
               The City will also continue to provide homebuyer education through the Housing
               Counseling Program’s Homebuyer Education and Learning Program.
H.3 - I 7      Continue to implement the relocation plan for households displaced as a
               result of local public action.
               Implementation: As needed, this is an ongoing program by the Department of
               Housing Services. The City’s policy is to make every effort to avoid displacing
               households as a result of local public action. However, when households are to
               be relocated, the Department of Housing Services will strive to make the
               relocation a positive experience for the household being relocated. In most
               cases, the purpose of the relocation will be to remove blight and dilapidated
               structures, and to assist households to move from substandard housing to
               decent, safe and sanitary housing.
               Staff will meet with each household facing relocation to determine their needs
               and housing preferences. If appropriate, the household will be offered
               assistance through the Housing Choice Voucher program or relocation benefits
               provided in accordance with State Relocation Law. The assistance will include
               referrals to available housing and payments for moving expenses and relocation.

                                                                            2. Housing Programs
H.3 – I 8  As appropriate, work to ensure that new and rehabilitated affordable units,
           in particular multi-family units, are developed with supportive services,
           such as child care, English as a second language, and job training, nearby
           or as a component of the development.
           Implementation: The Department of Housing Services, in cooperation with the
           Department of Community Development, will evaluate opportunities on an
           ongoing basis. The provision of child care and job training, in conjunction with
           multi-family housing developments, will better serve the residents, improve a
           parent’s ability to find and access employment, and reduce vehicle trips.
           Childcare, when it is affordable and of high quality, can enable a parent to move
           towards economic self-sufficiency.
           The City has committed funds to The Leaven, a faith-based organization, to
           provide supportive services to the children residing in the Opportunity House, the
           recently expanded and rehabilitated local homeless shelter and the surrounding
           neighborhood. The City has also worked closely with the local non-profit
           affordable housing provider, Vacaville Community Housing, Inc., to provide an
           additional neighborhood center to the Vacaville Neighborhood Boys & Girls
           program at the Meadows Drive complex. In addition, the two-phase development
           on Callen Street will include community space where supportive services can be
           provided to the development. The planned development at Rocky Hill Road
           includes a spacious community room for supportive services and neighborhood
           activities.
H.3 - I 9  Continue to provide housing counseling assistance to residents to help
           preserve homeownership.
           Implementation: The Department of Housing Services will continue to provide
           housing counseling first time homebuyer education. This program is currently not
           funded by HUD, however during the planning period; the Housing Services
           Department will seek funding opportunities from HUD in order to expand the
           services provided.
H.3 - I 10 Continue to conduct Code compliance activities to ensure vacant homes
           do not become nuisances and contribute to neighborhood blight.
           Implementation: The City's Public Nuisance Ordinance requires owners of
           vacant buildings to maintain them and to register them with the Fire Department
           Code Enforcement Division if the buildings are anticipated to be vacant for more
           than 30 days. The Code Enforcement Division will continue to identify and
           inspect vacant buildings and require that violations be corrected in a timely
           manner to ensure that vacant properties, especially units in the foreclosure
           process, do not become blighted and undermine neighborhood stability. This
           program is primarily funded by the City’s General Fund.

2. Housing Programs
H.3 - I 11     Continue to address the needs of local military personnel and their
               families.
               Implementation: The City Manager’s Office will continue to participate in the
               Travis Regional Armed Forces Committee (TRAFC) to discuss the needs of
               military personnel and their families.
H.3 - I 12     Continue to activate and operate emergency cooling and warming centers
               at the City’s community centers during times of extreme weather, which are
               available to all City residents. In addition, the City will activate and operate
               emergency shelters during catastrophic events requiring emergency
               evacuations of City residents.
               Implementation: The Community Services Department collaborated with the
               Public Information Officer and Fire Department to develop operational
               protocols/guidelines for activation of the City’s Emergency Shelters. These
               protocols/guidelines are currently being developed and are included in the City’s
               Emergency Operations Plan. The Community Services Department will
               collaborate with the American Red Cross and local Health and Human Service
               agencies to offer new and refresher trainings on shelter activation and
               management, and common shelter clientele needs such as homelessness,
               medical, mental, emotional needs and/or support.
H.3 - I 13     Continue to participate in the Community Action Partnership of Solano
               (CAP Solano) to oversee the development of the Homelessness Continuum
               of Care.
               Implementation: A City staff member participates in the CAP Solano, JPA. The
               City will continue to participate with the CAP Solano, JPA and on the board of
               the Solano County Continuum of Care Collaborative, Housing First Solano.
H.3 - I 14     Collaborate with local faith-based organizations to develop appropriate
               housing and support services to implement a “Housing First” or similar
               type program.
               Implementation: On April 13, 2010, the City Council considered and supported
               the proposed housing programs identified in a Report on Homelessness report,,
               about homelessness in Vacaville. As identified in the report, the City will continue
               to collaborate with local faith-based organizations on developing appropriate
               housing and support services, as it continues to with the Callen Street
               Rehabilitation Project.
H.3 - I 15     Reestablish and collaborate with the Ad-Hoc Homeless Task Force.
               Implementation: The Ad-Hoc Homeless Task Force, a partnership comprised of
               members of the faith-based community, local social service providers, and City
               staff, was disbanded in 2012 due to the elimination of the Redevelopment
               Agency and the Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Fund. The “Report on
               Homelessness” referred to in Program H.3 – I 14 came from this group. The City
               has worked to reunite the group as the “Homeless Roundtable” to work
                                City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

                 October 2014.
H.3 - I 16       Continue to implement the City’s crime free multi-family program.
                 Implementation: The City implemented its Crime-Free Multi-Family Housing
                 Program in 2006. The program is a voluntary partnership between the Vacaville
                 Police Department and local property managers/owners and residents with the
                 goal of promoting safe, crime-free environments for residents. As part of this
                 program, the Vacaville Police Department provides background check
                 information to property managers/owners for their review when considering a
                 rental application. Each property manager/owner determines their own tenancy
                 requirements.
H.3 - I 17       Continue to work with non-profit organizations and social service agencies
                 that provide after school programs for childcare in low-income
                 neighborhoods.
                 Implementation: The City has worked with and supported community
                 organizations in the past, such as the Boys and Girls Club, and will continue to
                 do so. The Housing Services Department will implement this policy, in
                 cooperation with County agencies, on an ongoing basis throughout the 2015-
                 2023 housing cycle, depending on response from non-profit organizations and
                 social service agencies.
PROGRAM EVALUATION
Guiding Policies
H.4 - G 1        Actively evaluate, on a regular basis, the success of housing programs in
                 meeting Vacaville's housing needs.
Implementing Policies
H.4 - I 1        Regularly compile and analyze data relevant to housing need and
                 affordability.
                 Implementation: Annually, as feasible, the Department of Housing Services will
                 conduct a rent and vacancy survey of local apartments to better understand the
                 rental market
                 The Community Development Department and the Housing Services Department
                 will provide an annual report to the Planning Commission and City Council on the
                 annual review of the Housing Element Implementation. This report will be
                 prepared each January and forwarded to the State Department of Housing
                 Services and Community Development by April 1 as mandated by State Law.
                 Vacaville compiles inventories of current development projects, vacant residential
                 lands, conducts rent surveys, and ascertains vacancy rates. The intention of this

2. Housing Programs
               policy is to place such efforts on a more formal and comprehensive basis to
               ensure sound information is available for making sound decisions. Although the
               Annual Vacancy and Rent Survey was suspended due to the elimination of
               Redevelopment in 2012, the City began annual surveys again starting in 2014.
               The Housing Services Department continues to prepare the City’s Five Year
               CDBG Consolidated Plan, Annual Action Plans and Consolidated Annual
               Performance and Evaluation Report, and the Housing Authority continues to
               prepare its Five Year Agency Plan and annual plans.
H.4 - I 2      Evaluate the success of programs in meeting housing needs and goals in a
               regular and comprehensive fashion.
               Implementation: Annual progress reports regarding housing related
               accomplishments are made to the following entities: the City Council and HUD
               for the Housing Choice Voucher Program, the Housing Counseling Program, and
               the Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG); the City Council for
               HOME funds, and other funds administered through HCD programs; and to the
               City Council and Planning Commission. Public hearings are also held, at which
               information is provided about the goals and outcomes of programs administered
               by the Housing Services Department. Reports provided to these various sources
               include the CDBG Consolidated Plan, Annual Action Plan and Consolidated
               Annual Performance Evaluation Report (CAPER), and the Public Housing
               Agency 5-Year Plan and Annual Plan, and the Housing Element, including
               annual status reports.
H.4 - I 3      Include an analysis of the City’s medium density (RMD), high density
               (RHD), and urban high density residential (RUHD) vacant land inventory in
               the Annual Status of the General Plan report.
               Existing law requires each city, county, or city and county to ensure that its
               inventory or programs of adequate sites identified in its housing element can
               accommodate its share of the regional housing need throughout the planning
               period and prohibits a city, county, or city and county from reducing, requiring, or
               permitting the reduction of the residential density for any parcel to a lower
               residential density that is lower than the density used by the Department of
               Community Development in determining compliance with housing element law
               unless the city, county, or city and county makes specified written findings
               supported by substantial evidence. In years when residential approvals and
               construction take place in the RMD, RHD, or RUHD zoning designations, the
               Community Development Department will include an analysis of the vacant land
               inventory in its Annual Report on the General Plan.

CHAPTER 3
REGIONAL CONTEXT: POPULATION AND EMPLOYMENT TRENDS
3.1       POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
Vacaville is located in the Sacramento Valley, mid-point between San Francisco and
Sacramento along Interstate 80 – the major transportation link between these two growing
urban areas. Most new residents commute to jobs outside the City and outside the County to
work, although job growth has increased in recent years. Vacaville, as well as the greater
Solano County area, continues to be an attractive and affordable place of residence for people
employed in the Bay Area.
Tables 3 and 4 summarize Vacaville’s current and projected population based on information
from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) Projections 2013 and the U.S. Census.
Vacaville has a substantial group quarters population housed in two state prisons located within
the City limits. The group quarters population was 8,022 persons in 2010, according to the U.S.
Census. This figure also includes residents in residential care facilities such as convalescent
homes. It should be noted that population data from the Census includes statistics on the total
population. Where possible, City data for household population is used rather than total
population data in order to exclude the prison population.

3. Regional Context: Population and Employment Trends
As shown in Table 4, ABAG projects the City of Vacaville will grow by 23.3 percent, an increase
of 21,572 residents, between 2010 and 2040. This level of growth is consistent with the overall
growth rate projected for Solano County.
3.2      HOUSEHOLD AND AGE CHARACTERISTICS
Household Characteristics
Each household has a distinct lifestyle, family type and size, income level, and housing
preference. As people move through each stage of life, housing needs and preferences also
change. As a result, evaluating the age characteristics and trends of a community are important
in determining existing and future housing needs.
Table 5 provides data on household composition. The percentage of family households declined
slightly from 2000 to 2010. Female households with no husband present (single mothers)
comprise 13.1 percent of all households compared to 12.4 percent in 2000. In 2010, there were
2,282 households consisting of single mothers with children under 18 years old. This is a 3.71
percent decrease from 2000. Table 5 also illustrates an increase in single person households
since 2000. In 2010, there were 2,874 single person households where the householder is age
65 and older. This number represented 9.2 percent of Vacaville’s total households.

Household Income
Household income is the most significant factor affecting housing choice and opportunity, by
determining a household’s ability to purchase or rent housing. While higher-income households
have more discretionary income to spend on housing, lower- and moderate income households
are limited in the range of housing they can afford. Typically, as the income of a household
decreases, the incidence of housing cost burdening and overcrowding increases.

For the purpose of evaluating housing affordability, housing need, and eligibility for housing
assistance, income levels are defined by guidelines adopted each year by the California State
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). For Solano County, the area
median income for a family of four in 2014 was $82,600. HCD has defined the income
categories, found in Table 6, for Solano County, based on the median income for a household of
four persons.

According to the 2006-2010 American Community Service 5-Year Estimate, the median
Vacaville household income was $73,024 and the median family income was $85,563 in 2010.
Table 7 categorizes Vacaville’s households by income category. Incomes increased significantly
between 2000 and 2010, with a 28.3 percent increase in the population earning an above-
moderate income. It should be noted that the cost of living in the region rose fairly equivalently
during that time, with an increase of 26.2 percent on the Bay Area Consumer Price Index.
However, there has also been an increase from 39.3 percent to 47.2 percent in the portion of
households earning an above-moderate income.
Age Characteristics
Based on national housing studies, a population with a high proportion of young adults generally
indicates a need for rental units and first-time homebuyer or first move-up opportunities,
including condominiums, town homes, or small single-family homes. Middle-age residents
typically occupy larger homes and are usually at the peak of earning power. Senior residents
are mostly homeowners and typically occupy single-family homes. However, as the percentage
of seniors in the population grows, and the average age of seniors rises, the demand for smaller
housing or specialized residential developments, including assisted living facilities and active
adult communities, will increase.
Table 8 provides the age characteristics of Vacaville residents in 2000, 2010, and 2012. The
percentage of persons over age 65 has increased from 8.3 percent to 11.1 percent between
2000 and 2012. This increase is consistent with the baby boomers entering retirement age. The
median age for Vacaville increased from 33.9 to 36.6 years between 2000 and 2012.

3.3      JOBS/HOUSING BALANCE
As illustrated in Table 9, the 2010 Census reported that 37.3 percent of Vacaville employed
residents worked in Vacaville. The remaining employed residents commuted to jobs outside of
Vacaville. Those who commute to other cities and counties often choose to live in Vacaville
because of the relative affordability of housing compared to other Bay Area cities and counties.
Table 10 provides countywide data on workers place of employment. In 2000, approximately
58 percent of Solano County workers were employed within the county, down from 61 percent in
1990. Solano County continues to be an attractive community for people employed in the Bay
Area due to affordable housing.
Housing costs, commute distances, and labor costs are among the key factors, which influence
corporate decisions on where to locate. These are among the reasons why corporations have
begun to locate in the North Bay area, away from the major cities, where the already high costs
of housing and the time and expense of commuting are continuing to increase. Vacaville and
Solano County remain an area where housing is more affordable for Bay Area workers. The
City supports a residential growth rate consistent with ABAG projections. However, the City
also recognizes that striving for a healthy jobs housing balance and pursuing economic
development will also result in more and better paying jobs for existing residents and enable
them to better afford housing in the City in which they live.
3.4      EMPLOYMENT TRENDS
ABAG forecasts that Solano County will add 7,000 jobs between 2015 and 2035. Table 11 lists
existing and projected jobs-to-employed residents ratios for Vacaville, the County, and other
Solano cities, and indicates that most communities in Solano County have a high percentage of
residents who commute to work outside their place of residence.
The ratio of jobs to employed residents in Vacaville is projected to increase from 0.77 jobs per
resident in 2015 to 0.85 jobs per resident by 2035. This is less than an ideal ratio of one or more
jobs per employed resident and is not consistent with local policy. Local policy is that the City
will continue to actively pursue economic development opportunities, which should result in
local jobs for existing residents.
According to ABAG Projections 2013, and shown in Table 12, employed residents are expected
to increase between 2015 and 2025 by 7.6 percent, from 41,700 to 44,860 persons, and
continue to increase by an additional 3.2 percent between 2025 and 2035, from 44,860 to
46,300 persons. Based on this data, Solano County will experience a moderately high
percentage of job growth over the next decade. Between 2015 and 2025, Vacaville is projected
to add 3,900 jobs.
Economic development is an important goal for the City, as evidenced by the location of
Genentech, Alza Pharmaceutical, State Compensation Insurance Fund headquarters, and
Travis Federal Credit Union headquarters in Vacaville. Table 13 shows the types of occupations
Vacaville’s residents have been employed in over time. Vacaville continues to focus on
economic development efforts to attract industries and businesses with more and higher paying
jobs. In 2014, ICON Aircraft announced they would be moving their amphibious light sport
aircraft company functions from Los Angeles to Vacaville. The facility will include all company
functions, including aircraft design, manufacturing, sales, training, service, as well as the firm’s
corporate headquarters. Initially this center will employ 150 workers rising to 500 or more as
output increases.

The 2015, 2025, and 2035 figures for employed residents by occupation and selected industries
for Vacaville are shown in Table 13. More than half of Vacaville residents are employed in
managerial, professional, technical, sales, and administrative jobs. Table 11 indicates that there
are fewer jobs in Vacaville than the number of employed residents. Therefore, many residents
are working outside the City.

Based on the data in Table 14, there are 23,293 housing units over 20 years old in Vacaville,
approximately 70 percent of the total housing stock. The last windshield survey of units in target
neighborhoods was conducted in March 2009 to determine the condition of the existing housing
stock. The survey, conducted by City staff that administered a residential rehabilitation program,
concentrated on units located in the City’s five Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
target areas at that time. . Nearly half of the housing units in the target areas were documented
to be in need of rehabilitation. Based on staff experience, the condition of older housing was
estimated using five categories:
1. No Visible Structural Repairs Needed: The housing units in this category showed no
     evidence that structural repairs were necessary. Homes in this category have been
     rehabbed by current homeowners. Examples of modifications made to homes in this
     category would include: newer roof installs, installation of rain gutters, exterior paint
     application, exterior stucco to structure, energy efficient windows, garage door replacement,
     and front yard landscaping. Interiors of homes were not inspected; typically, homes in this
     category appear to have made necessary modifications/repairs to the interiors of the homes.
2. No Visible Structural Repairs Needed; Curb Appeal Related Modifications Needed: The
     housing units in this category meet the same criteria as homes in category # 1. Although
     there are no notable repairs necessary to the structure of the homes placed in this category,
     the homes do need some repairs to exteriors of the homes to improve the curb appeal.

4. EXISTING HOUSING
     Homes in this category require repairs/modifications such as: exterior painting, garage door
     replacement, yard landscaping, fence repairs, and sidewalk and driveway repair. Estimated
     cost to improve curb appeal for homes in this category was between $10,000 and $20,000.
3. Structural Repairs Required Within Three Years if not Addressed: The housing units in this
     category require repairs that may include roof repair, gutter repair/installation, window/door
     repair, tree removal, garage door replacement, landscaping and fence repair, and exterior
     paint. Although not visible from the outside, such units typically may require bathroom and
     kitchen repairs, water heater replacement, and weatherization. Homes in this category show
     various evidences of beginning stages of structural damage. Cost to make visible repairs and
     avoid additional damage to structure was between $15,000 and $30,000.
4. Structural Deficiencies: The housing units in this category would require extensive repairs to
     address current building codes and Housing Quality Standards (HQS). Repairs in this
     category may include roof replacement; window/door replacement; correcting dry rot/termite
     damage; heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) repairs; landscaping and fence
     replacement; drainage improvements; and cracked sidewalks/driveways. Interior
     improvements may include bathroom and kitchen repair, water heater replacement, new
     electrical circuits and wiring, sheet rock replacement, painting, floor covering, and
     weatherization. Estimated cost of repairs for this category was between $30,000 and
     $45,000.
5. Major Structural Deficiencies: The housing units in this category would require repairs that
     may include repairing/replacing leaning porches, sagging roofs, exposed framing, foundation
     replacement, and other obvious deterioration. Interior repairs may include those listed above
     as well as replacement of sub flooring and flooring. Homes in this category require extensive
     repair/modifications to the structure. Cost of repairs was very likely to exceed $45,000.
Table 15 estimates the rehabilitation needs for older homes constructed prior to 1980 in the
CDBG target areas. 2,609 units constructed before 1980 were surveyed. Of the 2,609 units,
894 units required repairs costing under $20,000 to improve curb appeal of the unit. 922 units
required repairs within three years to avoid structural damage. An additional 387 units required
significant repairs to correct structural deficiencies; 17 units had extensive damage to the
exterior and are categorized as having major structural deficiencies. Of the units surveyed,
approximately 51 percent require rehabilitation.
If the results of the survey are applied to the entire housing stock over 20 years old, there are
8,232 housing units in Vacaville in need of repairs to address minor damage and avoid
structural damage likely to occur if not repaired required within three years; 3,454 housing units
with building code and HQS violations, and 151 units with major structural damage.
4.2      HOUSING TYPE
Policies in the General Plan assure a housing mix that provides a variety of housing choices
while maintaining neighborhood identity. Policies also ensure that the residential growth rate
can be accommodated by the provisions of municipal services. The policies in this document
are intended to preserve and enhance the City's reputation as a provider of affordable housing,
while ensuring a mix of well-designed and planned residential development.

Residential growth has been accommodated by the building of numerous subdivisions and
multi-family projects in the 1970s through the early 2000s. From 2000 to 2013, the average
annual growth rate was 356 units per year, as shown in Table 16. The City experienced a
noticeable decrease in the number of single-family residential permits issued following the
economic downturn in the housing market beginning in 2006. Table 16 illustrates a 51 percent
reduction in the number of building permits issued for single-family homes between 2006 and
2008. However, there was a significant increase between 2012 and 2013, with over 3.5 times
the number of permits issued in 2013 than in 2012, before decreasing again in 2014.
Table 17 shows the existing housing mix within the City. In January 2014, the City’s housing mix
was 78.6 percent single family and 21.4 percent multi-family.
Table 18 shows the proportion of owner-occupied and renter-occupied housing units, 2000
through 2012. The percentage of owner-occupied dwellings decreased by 7 percent from 2000
to 2012, while there was about a 7 percent increase in renter-occupied units.
4.3       HOUSING COST AND AFFORDABILITY
The Planning Commission and City Council regularly review and keep up-to-date on housing
affordability issues. The City of Vacaville prepared a comprehensive report on housing
affordability in January 2005 (Housing Affordability in Vacaville, January 2005). The report was
prepared as the housing market neared its peak in terms of the purchase price of homes. Many
Vacaville residents could not afford to purchase a home. In 2004, a family of four, earning the
median income of $73,900, could afford to purchase a $331,000 home based on a 30-year fixed
mortgage at 5.7 percent interest and with a 20 percent down payment. However, the median
price for a home was $380,000, placing home ownership out of reach for many families.

After that time, however, the housing market changed drastically as the nation entered into an
economic recession and then began an increasingly rapid recovery. Based on the information
in Table 19, the median sales prices for homes in Vacaville decreased 50 percent between the
peak of the housing market in 2006 and the low in 2012. While there were several reasons for
the falling housing prices, one main reason was the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage housing
market. The collapse began in 2006 when subprime lending, the interest-only adjustable-rate
mortgage (ARM), and the negative-equity option ARM were no longer able to sustain the flow of
new buyers, and homeowners could not afford their mortgages once their ARM mortgages
adjusted to higher interest rates. The result of this was an exponential increase in the number
of mortgage defaults and foreclosures.

While home prices dropped during the recession, they started increasing again quickly in 2013,
with a 16.4 percent increase between April 2013 and May 2014. 1 As of 2014, a family of four
earning the median income of $82,600 could afford to purchase a $394,420 home based on a
30-year fixed mortgage at 6 percent interest and with a 20 percent down payment. The median
sale price for a home as of June 2014 was $328,750, making homes affordable to households
with moderate incomes.
Housing Affordability by Household Income
Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning a home with the
maximum affordable housing cost to households at different income levels. The Area Median
Income (AMI) provides a benchmark for estimating the affordability of housing and the ability of
newcomers to move into the community. Taken together, this information can generally
demonstrate who can afford what size and type of housing and indicate the type of households
most likely to experience overcrowding or a burden related to housing cost.

4. EXISTING HOUSING
In evaluating affordability, the maximum affordable price refers to the maximum amount that
could be afforded by households in the upper range of their respective income category.
Households in the lower end of each category can afford less in comparison. The maximum
affordable rental and house prices for residents of Solano County are shown in Tables 20 and
22. The affordability of the County housing stock for each income group is discussed below.
HCD has published the 2014 County Area Median Income (AMI) to be $82,600.
Rental Housing
Extremely Low-Income Households: Extremely low-income households are households earning
30 percent or less of the County AMI. As shown in Table 20, these households have monthly
incomes ranging from $1,450 for a one-person household to $2,067 for a four-person
household. The maximum affordable rent for a one- to four-person household ranges from $435
per month to $620 per month.
Very Low-Income Households: Very low-income households are classified as those earning 30
to 50 percent of the County AMI. As shown in Table 20, the maximum affordable rent for a one-
to four-person household ranges from $724 per month to $1,033 per month.
Low-Income Households: Low-income households are classified as those earning 51 to 80
percent of the County AMI. The maximum affordable rent for a low-income household ranges
from $1,138 for one person to $1,625 for a four-person family.
Moderate-Income Households: Moderate-income households earn between 81 and 120 of the
County AMI. The maximum affordable rental prices for moderate-income households range from
$1,734 for a one-person household to $2,478 for a four-person household.

Ownership Housing
Table 22 provides data on housing affordability for the different income categories. It is
extremely difficult for low and very-low income households to enter the “for sale” market,
although, through the City’s first-time homebuyer loan program, a number of program
participants were low and very-low income households.
Rental housing, both single family and multi-family, is the primary source of affordable housing
for these households.

Overcrowding
Overcrowding is typically defined as more than one person per room, based on the Census
Bureau’s definition of “room,” which excludes bathrooms, porches, balconies, foyers, halls, or
half-rooms. Severe overcrowding occurs when there are more than 1.5 persons per room.
Overcrowding can result when there is an insufficient number of adequately sized units within a

community, or when high housing costs relative to income force too many individuals or families
to share housing. Overcrowding can accelerate deterioration of the housing stock.
As illustrated in Table 24, in 2010, overcrowded and severely overcrowded households
represented 2.35 percent of the total households or 727 households in Vacaville. Of the 727
overcrowded households in 2010, approximately 40 percent were renters, while the remaining
60 percent were homeowners. This disproportionate impact on owner households describes the
need to establish priority in policies and programs to increase a variety of housing types and
proactively assist in the development of affordable housing.

To address overcrowding, the City is in the process of amending the Land Use and Development
Code to facilitate construction of secondary dwelling units. Additionally, this Housing Element
includes guiding and implementing policies to increase the supply of multi-family units with three
or more bedrooms, continue to provide assistance though subsidized rental assistance through
the Housing Choice Voucher program, and alleviate housing costs for homeowners through
programs such as down payment assistance and the Section 8 Homeowners Program.
Overpayment
A household is considered to be overpaying for housing (or cost burdened) if it spends more
than 30 percent of its gross income on housing. Severe housing cost burden occurs when a
household pays more than 50 percent of its income on housing. The prevalence of overpayment
varies significantly by income, tenure, household type, and household size. The 2010 U.S.
Census provides data regarding indicators of housing affordability.
Table 25 illustrates to what extent households are overpaying for housing cost by their income
range and whether or not they were overpaying (30+ percent of household income).
Approximately 54 percent of all rental households and 37 percent of all ownership households
were overpaying for housing cost in 2010. Table 26 illustrates the percentage of extremely low,
very low, and low-income households overpaying for housing. Approximately 90 percent of
extremely low-income households, 82 percent of very low income households, 65 percent of
low-income income households, and 26 percent of moderate-income and above households
were overpaying for housing in 2011. To address overpayment, Vacaville will pursue a variety of
programs to expand affordability and increase below-market rate housing (see Sections 4.5 and
4.6).

4.4      HOUSING VACANCY
Vacancy trends are a way of analyzing housing supply and demand. For example, if the housing
demand is greater than the supply, the vacancy rate is likely to be lower and the price of
housing increasing. The 2010 Census reported that 1,722 (5.2 percent) of the 32,814 housing
units were vacant in Vacaville. Table 30 shows distribution of vacant housing units in the City
and Solano County in 2010.
Staff of the former Department of Housing and Redevelopment conducted an annual vacancy
and rent survey until 2011 and the Department of Housing Services completed a vacancy and
rent survey in 2014. The results of these surveys are summarized in Tables 27 through 30.
Table 27 summarizes vacancy survey results from 2000 to 2011 and 2014 and provides
vacancy rates by the number of bedrooms. Vacancy rates reached their peak in 2005, 8 percent
overall, corresponding with the peak of the single-family housing market, and then began an
overall trend of descending with the economy, as more households could no longer afford
ownership and became renters. As of October 2014, the overall vacancy rate was 2.3 percent,
with vacancies for three-bedroom units even lower at 1.5 percent. Rates this low indicate a
market where it is challenging for renters to find housing, particularly housing that is affordable.
In addition to conducting an annual vacancy and rental survey, the former Department of
Housing and Redevelopment conducted an annual vacancy and rental survey addendum for
senior-only housing units until 2011. As part of the 2014 survey, the Department of Housing
Services included information pertaining to senior-restricted units. The vacancy rate for senior-
only apartments has remained very low, with the exception of 2004 and 2005. This time period
corresponds with the peak of the single family housing market. In 2005, the overall vacancy rate

As listed in Table 29, the median rent in October 2011 for a one-bedroom apartment was $950,
and $1,103 and $1,300 for two- and three-bedroom units respectively. Unlike home prices,
which fell significantly during the recession (see Table 19, in this Chapter), between 2000 and
2011, median rents have steadily increased overall, with slight fluctuations from the trend from
year to year. As of October 2014, the median rental rates significantly exceed the affordable
range for very-low-income households ($724-$1,033), and also exceed the affordability range
for most low-income households ($1,138-$1,625).
4.5        BELOW MARKET-RATE HOUSING
“Below market rate housing” is a term used to describe units offered at rents or sale prices
below that which they would command on the open market. In the past, below market-rate units
were produced almost exclusively as a result of direct federal subsidies. With drastic cutbacks
in such programs, it has been left to local governments to find new ways of increasing the
supply of housing affordable to very-low-, low-, and moderate- income households. The

following is a brief description of programs currently at work in Vacaville to provide affordable,
below market rate units.
Public Housing
Although the Vacaville Housing Authority has Article 34 authority to construct public housing, the
City currently does not own or operate any conventional public housing.
Housing Choice (Section 8) Vouchers
The Vacaville Housing Authority (VHA) administers the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development’s (HUD) Housing Choice Voucher program for very-low and extremely-low income
households. The Housing Choice Voucher has no ceilings on rents, but rents must meet a
reasonableness test. The tenant is responsible for paying the difference between the "voucher
payment standard" and the actual rent, and the VHA pays the difference between 30 percent of
the renter's income and the payment standard for which the renter is eligible. As of October
2014, the VHA administers 1,193 vouchers under this program, and there are 4,338 families on
the waiting list.
It should be noted that Housing Choice Voucher assistance is available to only approximately
one in three lower-income households.

Security Deposit Loan Program
The Vacaville Housing Authority (VHA) offers a guarantee program to participants using a
Family Unification Program Housing Choice Voucher who can afford to pay rent but do not
have the necessary funds for a large security deposit. Under this program, eligible applicants
may receive a VHA guarantee from the VHA for an amount not to exceed the Security Deposit
being requested by the landlord, or $1,000, whichever is less. If the landlord agrees to
participate in the program, the participant makes monthly payments towards their Security
Deposit obligation to the landlord. If a payment is missed by the participant, the VHA will make
the payment directly to the landlord.
Other Federally Assisted Housing
Table 31 lists the various rental subsidy programs offered within Vacaville, and the number of
units affected by such programs. One project, Twin Oaks Apartments, contains a total of 45
Section 8 units. The Autumn Leaves project was built with Section 202/8 funds and provides 56
studio and one-bedroom units to elderly and disabled renters. For Section 8 and 202 units,
tenants pay a maximum of 30 percent of their income for rent with eligibility limited to those with
incomes of 50 percent or less of the area median income.
Redevelopment
Prior to the dissolution of Redevelopment Agencies in California in February 2012, 20 percent
Housing Set Aside Funds (Low Income Housing Funds) had been used to subsidize rents of
units for extremely low, very low, low and moderate-income households. Although
redevelopment has been eliminated, the covenants requiring restricted rents continue and
Department of Housing Services staff monitor 126 affordability agreements covering 1,007 units
for compliance each year.
Since the dissolution of Redevelopment, the City has retained the functions/rights as the
“Housing Successor.” The City’s Housing Successor received approval of the Housing Assets
List from the Department of Finance (DOF). Although there is no longer an on-going funding
source for affordable housing preservation/development, the real property assets of the City, as
Housing Successor, will be used to create additional affordable housing opportunities. For
example, a 41-unit, new construction affordable housing apartment complex is currently being
negotiated between staff and a for-profit/non-profit partnership entity to be located on Housing
Successor land.

Emergency and Transitional Shelter
A 48-bed emergency shelter, owned and operated by Vacaville Social Services Corporation
(VSSC), is located in Vacaville. VSSC also administers a transitional housing program that
provides transitional housing to ten to twenty households per year. The Vacaville Community
Welfare Association, as well as local churches, continues to offer limited help and coupons for
overnight accommodation at local motels. The City and other local homeless assistance
providers participate in the Solano County Continuum of Care Collaborative, Housing First
Solano, to oversee the development of the homelessness Continuum of Care.
Emergency Rental Assistance to Prevent Homelessness
Emergency rental assistance to prevent homelessness is provided by Solano County through
the Health and Social Services Department Cal-Works Homelessness Program. Under the
program, households may receive $30 - $60 per night for 16 nights in a motel. The program will
pay the last month’s rent and/or a security deposit for up to twice the monthly rent. This program
also pays utility deposits. It is only available for those enrolled in the Cal-Works (Welfare to
Work) Program.
The City conducts screening for the Season of Sharing and Youth Connections programs. The
two privately funded programs provide emergency rental assistance to eligible lower-income
Vacaville households.
Other Programs
Through the Density Bonus provisions in the Land Use and Development Code, several multi-
family projects were produced. These include Autumn Leaves and Saratoga Apartments. In

addition to these sources of below-market-rate units, Vacaville has also produced units with its
Housing Opportunity Area (HOA) policy and by issuing mortgage revenue bonds.
Mortgage revenue bonds issued by the City since 1982 have helped build 976 apartment units,
including 195 affordable to lower-income households in the Spring Glenn, Hidden Creek, Quail
Run, and Sycamores projects. Also, 71 single-family units, affordable to households with income
between 78 and 117 percent of the area median, were built with funds from bond issues in 1982
and 1984. In 1999 and 2000, tax-exempt bonds and tax credits were utilized to construct 228
affordable senior rental units. In 2014 Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) along with tax-
exempt bonds are planned to finance the construction/rehabilitation of 130 affordable units on
Callen Street/Bennett Hill Court area.
Since 2012, through HOME funded down payment assistance loans 17 eligible low-income first-
time home buyers were provided with $562,061 to purchase a home. In addition, one eligible
first-time home buyer received a $47,560 down payment assistance loan through the CalHOME
program in 2013.
The City also assigns its California Debt Limit Allocation Committee (CDLAC), a per capita
portion of private activity bonds, to California Home Finance Authority in order to participate in
the Mortgage Credit Certificate program.

As shown in Table 32, the City of Vacaville has 1,043 units of subsidized below market-rate
housing, and 274 units are at risk of conversion to market-rent status within the next ten years
(2015 – 2025). The complexes at risk are Quail Run (60 units), Vaca Gables (65 units), Hillside
Seniors (15 units), and Vacaville Depot (134 units).
Of the 769 units due to expire after 2025, 668 are owned by non-profit housing corporations that
are committed to providing affordable housing for Vacaville residents in perpetuity.
The Department of Housing Services has a program to monitor and address at-risk units:
1. A list of “at risk” projects is maintained through the use of existing databases (e.g. HUD,
     State HCD and the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee.)
2. Maintain contact with owners of “at risk” units to determine their interest in selling, prepaying,
     terminating or continuing participation in a subsidy program.
3. Ascertain HUD’s interest in issuing Housing Choice Vouchers for “opt out” units, in order to
     preserve and/or extend affordability.
4. Work with owners, tenants, and nonprofit organizations to assist in the nonprofit acquisition
     of at-risk projects to ensure long-term affordability of the development.
Quail Run had an affordability agreement with the City of Vacaville for 20 percent, or 60, of its
296 units. The restricted units are affordable to households with incomes less than 80 percent of
the local area median income. These units were assisted with Multi-Family Mortgage Revenue
Bonds. It is anticipated that these units will be replaced either by units that have been
rehabilitated with government assistance in exchange for affordability restrictions or by newly
constructed units with affordability restrictions.

The Department of Housing Services consistently works to preserve affordable housing in the
City of Vacaville by leveraging financial resources from State and federal programs in order to
reinvest and rehabilitate existing affordable housing projects nearing the end of the affordability
restrictions extending their subsidy into the future.
Vaca Gables and Hillside Senior apartments are owned by a local non-profit affordable housing
provider. Department of Housing Services staff communicate regularly with the owner who is
committed to providing affordable housing at these complexes in perpetuity. In 2012, the
regulatory agreement for Vacaville Meadows, that restricts rents to affordable rates, was
extended to June 2067. In 2014, the 12 Rocky Hill Villages apartments were incorporated into a
rehabilitation project with 52 additional apartment units (Bennett Hill/Callen) and the regulatory
agreement was renewed and extended to 2069.
Two complexes that were considered at-risk in the previous Housing Element cycle (2007-2014)
are currently stable. Autumn Leaves (56 senior units), which expired in 2010, is still affordable,

with rents subsidized by HUD. Twin Oaks (45 units) was sold to Highlands Properties, which
used tax credits for acquisition and rehabilitation and is therefore required to maintain the units’
affordability.
Cost of Preservation versus Replacement
Generally, the cost of preserving existing units is more cost effective than replacing units
through new construction. However, replacement of these units with units that have been
rehabilitated through federal, State, or local loans may be cost effective in some instances. The
maximum loan amount through the Neighborhood Conservation Program (NCP), a program
which no longer exists, was $45,000 per unit. Each unit that was assisted in this manner is
required to be income and rent restricted for a minimum of 55 years.
Tables 33 and 34 present an analysis of the cost to replace all at-risk units. It is estimated that
the cost to replace all at risk units is $54.5 million. The 60 locally subsidized Quail Run
Apartments would be the most likely units to opt out of renewing its affordability agreement. The
cost to replace the 17 one-bedroom and 43 two-bedroom units is $10.7 million. Below are
projected costs for replacing all at-risk units through new construction.

Resources for Preservation
A variety of programs exist to assist cities to acquire, replace or subsidize at-risk affordable
housing units. The following summarizes financial resources available to the City of Vacaville.
Federal Programs
HOME Investment Partnership – The City of Vacaville utilizes funds from HUD to increase the
supply of decent, safe, sanitary and affordable housing to lower income households. Eligible
activities include new construction, acquisition, rental assistance and rehabilitation. HOME
funds have been used for acquisition and rehabilitation and for new construction projects.
Section 8 Rental Assistance Program – The Section 8 Rental Assistance program provides
rental assistance payments to owners of private, market rate units on behalf of very-low income
tenants. Rental assistance is provided through the Vacaville Housing Authority to 1,193
households through Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers. HUD issued Preservation Vouchers
for the households in the Meadowood, Shasta Terrace, Spring Glenn, and Vacaville Park
apartments, which opted out of their affordability agreements with HUD. It is anticipated that
HUD will issue Preservation Vouchers for the at risk units it subsidized in Vacaville, should the
owners opt out of those agreements.
Section 811/202 Program – Non-profit and consumer cooperatives can receive no interest
capital advances from HUD under the Section 202 program for the construction of very-low
income rental housing for seniors and persons with disabilities. These funds can be used in
conjunction with Section 811, which can be used to develop group homes, independent living
facilities and immediate care facilities. Eligible activities include acquisition, rehabilitation, new
construction and rental assistance.
State Programs
CalHome Down Payment Assistance Program – The City of Vacaville utilizes these funds to
provide assistance in the form of a deferred payment loan as ‘gap’ financing to eligible households
in purchasing their first home. These loans are available for down payment and closing cost
assistance to low income households.
California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) Multi-Family Programs – CalHFA’s Multi-Family
Programs provide permanent financing for the acquisition, rehabilitation, and preservation or
new construction of rental housing that includes affordable rents for low and moderate income
families and individuals. One of the programs is the Preservation Acquisition Finance Program
which is designed to facilitate the acquisition of at-risk affordable housing developments and
provide low-cost funding to preserve affordability.
Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) – This program provides tax credits to individuals and
corporations that invest in low-income rental housing. The LIHTC program creates affordable
housing opportunities when the developer of a project “sells” the tax credits to an investor or
investors who contribute equity to the development in exchange for an ownership position in the
project. The City has worked with various developers on seven tax credit projects, resulting in
the development and rehabilitation of over 450 affordable units. In addition, the Callen
St/Bennett Hill project will use LIHTC for an additional 130 affordable units.
California Community Reinvestment Corporation (CCRC) – The California Community
Reinvestment Corporation is a multi-family affordable housing lender whose mission is to

increase the availability of affordable housing for low-income families, seniors and residents
with special needs by facilitating private capital flow from its investors for debt and equity to
developers of affordable housing. Eligible activities include new construction, rehabilitation and
acquisition of properties. Several projects owned by Vacaville Community Housing were
assisted by loans from CCRC for acquisition and rehabilitation activities.
4.7      FORECLOSURES
Impact on Housing Conditions
According to information provided by Data Quick, a leading company that tracks foreclosures,
the City of Vacaville had 705 homes foreclosed upon in 2008, a 154 percent increase over
2007, when there were only 278 homes foreclosed upon.
When a home is going through the foreclosure process, property owners often vacate the unit
before the lockout period in order to secure new housing. In some cases, these property owners
leave excessive damages to the home during move out. In most cases, these homes are left
vacant and unattended for extended periods of time, leaving them open to vandalism and lack
of maintenance, resulting in neighborhood blight. In August of 2008, the Vacaville City Council
amended an Ordinance to enable the City to require those responsible for the foreclosed
homes, mainly banks and mortgage companies, to maintain the properties and retain local
management if they are out of the area. This has greatly benefited Vacaville and has prevented
the foreclosure crisis from having a significant impact on the quality of the housing stock.
However, due to the abundance of foreclosed homes, which can often be purchased at below
market value, foreclosures have had a significant impact on the new home market. With a
decreased demand for new housing, construction has suffered resulting in stalled construction
projects and fewer permits issued for construction even though there is substantial inventory of
approved residential units.
In response to the current market situation, the City has created and expanded programs to:
•   Counsel homeowners at risk of foreclosure with a goal of preserving home ownership.
•   Assist first time homebuyers in purchasing foreclosed homes.
•   Track notices of default and offering free counseling to property owners early in the
    foreclosure process.
Due to the elimination of redevelopment, the financing for these programs ended and the
programs were discontinued. However, foreclosures have slowed nationwide and in Solano
County as of 2013. According to RealtyTrac, while Solano County had been in the top five
counties in California for foreclosures, as of July 2013 it was no longer in the top five. As of
2013, 1 in 654 Vacaville homes was in foreclosure, compared with 1 in 468 in all of Solano
County and 1 in 799 statewide. 2 As foreclosures have slowed and sales prices have increased,
construction has picked up again, with residential building permits in 2013 issued at over 3.5
times the rate of those issued in 2012 (see Table 16, in this chapter).

CHAPTER 5
HOUSING NEED
Beneath the statutory requirements and guidelines, the underlying intent of a Housing Element
is to set forth a program representing the jurisdiction's best reasonable effort to provide for its
housing needs. The fundamental components of housing need are those factors that shape
demand for housing, such as local and regional population, job and household growth, and
those that determine housing supply, such as available land, allowable densities, and
construction cost.
Because local governments have a responsibility to facilitate improvement and development of
housing for all economic segments of the community, the analysis of housing needs and
affordability examines the housing need for four household-income categories: very-low-, low-,
moderate-, and above-moderate-income. Very low income is defined as a household earning up
to 50 percent of the county’s median income; a low-income household earns 51 to 80 percent of
the median; moderate-income households earn 81 to 120 percent of the median; and above-
moderate income households earn above 120 percent of the median. Federal and state law and
program guidelines refer to very-low- and low-income jointly as “lower-income.”
To judge eligibility for federal and state housing programs, the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the California Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) publish annual income limits. Both HUD and HCD make slight
adjustments in unusually high- and low-income areas and in areas of high housing cost relative
to incomes. Table 6 charts income limits published in February 2014 for Solano County for a
household of four. It should be noted that only a small percentage of households have incomes
at the upper end of each of these income categories, therefore, the complete picture of
affordability is skewed.
The assessment of need in this section considers Vacaville's role in meeting regional housing
demand, including the demand for units affordable by households of all income groups. As
required by the state guidelines, it discusses separately immediate need and need within the
eight-year period of the Housing Element program. Indicators of immediate need are housing
vacancy, waiting lists for affordable housing, overcrowding in existing units, and presence of a
homeless population.
5.1     REGIONAL HOUSING NEED
Housing Needs Determination
As set forth in State Law, the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) process is the
responsibility of the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). The process was initiated
with the appointment of the Housing Methodology Committee (HMC), which was comprised of
elected officials and staff representatives from each Bay Area county. Vacaville’s City Manager
served on this committee along with a County Board Supervisor and Planning staff from Solano
County. The HMC’s work concluded in April 2012 with the ABAG Executive Board’s adoption of
the methodology for allocating the regional housing need to individual cities and counties.
In June 2013, ABAG issued the region’s allocation of 187,990 units for the 2014-2022

5. Housing Need
Francisco Bay Area: 2014-2022. Based upon the adopted methodology, ABAG determined that
Solano County’s share of the regional housing need is 6,977 units. The seven cities of Solano
County and the County of Solano formed a subregion, represented by the Solano County City-
County Coordinating Council, for the purpose of allocating the ABAG-determined housing need
among its member jurisdictions. The allocations were made consistent with the ABAG and MTC
Jobs-Housing Connection Strategy, and based on the assumption that a significant portion of
the RHNA will be planned for in the area’s Priority Development Areas, which are locally
identified areas for growth. All seven Cities and the County accepted the methodology and
allocations of the resulting Solano Subregional Housing Allocation.
Under the Solano Subregional Housing Allocation, Vacaville is required to plan for 1,084 units.
The assigned units, categorized by affordability level, for Vacaville’s regional housing need are
incorporated in Table 35 below. The California Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) allows jurisdictions to credit units constructed since the start of the
projection period toward its RHNA. The projection period for the 2014-2022 RHNA cycle began
on January 1, 2014; therefore, Table 35 includes any new construction completed since January
1, 2014 and the remaining housing need for the remainder of the Housing Element timeframe.

5.2       IMMEDIATE NEED
Low vacancy rates, the number of households on waiting lists for subsidized housing, and
presence of homeless are indicators of immediate need for housing in the community.
Overpayment of rent is also an indicator of immediate need, in particular for low- and very-low-
income households. Vacaville’s vacancy rates are discussed below. Waiting lists for subsidized
housing are discussed in Section 4.5 (Housing Choice (Section 8) Vouchers), presence of
homeless is discussed in Section 5.3 (Families and Persons In Need of Emergency Shelters),
and overpayment of rent is discussed in Section 4.3 (Overpayment).
Vacancy Rates
Low vacancy rates, the number of households on waiting lists for subsidized housing, and
presence of homeless are indicators of immediate need.
The recent nationwide recession had a significant impact on vacancy rates, particularly reducing
the vacancy rates of rental housing, and thus the availability of housing for renters. The
recession caused high unemployment and foreclosure rates, both probable reasons for the
dramatic decrease in vacancy rates experienced in Vacaville, as in other areas. The demand for
                                     City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element
                                                         Page 64

                                                                                  5. Housing Need
rental apartments has increased among both people formerly renting single-family homes and
former homeowners. Renters who face unemployment are no longer able to afford renting a
house, and therefore rent an apartment unit, which is generally less expensive than renting a
house. Former homeowners who experienced foreclosure on their homes rent apartment units
to meet their housing needs.
A common “rule of thumb” is that a 5 percent rental and 2 percent ownership vacancy rate
represent a market with a healthy balance of supply and demand, allowing enough vacancy for
tenant movement between units. The City of Vacaville prepared a citywide survey of apartments
during August and September 2014. According to the results of that survey (also discussed in
detail in Section 4.4), the overall apartment vacancy rate was 2.3 percent, which illustrates a
shortage of apartment units in Vacaville. This is a decrease from the beginning of the previous
housing element planning period in 2009, at which time the overall vacancy rate was 4.0
percent. Vacancy rates have decreased since that time for one-bedroom units from 4.8 to 2.7
percent, for two-bedroom units from 3.3 to 2.0 percent, and for three-bedroom units from 4.1 to
1.5 percent. Historic vacancy rates are shown in Table 27 in Chapter 4 (Existing Housing).
Current vacancy rate data is not available for single-family home rentals; however, based on
discussions with local stakeholders, single-family rentals remain in demand. Single-family
homes typically provide more floor space than apartments and are more desirable for families.
5.3       SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS ANALYSES
For some households, limited income is not the only obstacle to finding adequate housing.
California Government Code Section 65583(a)(7) requires analysis of any special housing
needs, such as those of extremely low income households, families and persons in need of
emergency shelter, the elderly, persons with disabilities, large families, farm workers, and
female-headed families. The needs of these groups should be discussed if they exist in the
community. Unfortunately, even determining whether these needs exist is difficult, because little
information on such groups is kept, and the information available is anecdotal, or based on
client lists of individual service organizations.
Extremely Low Income Households
Extremely low-income households typically comprise persons with special housing needs
including but not limited to persons experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness,
persons with substance abuse problems, and farm workers. Assembly Bill 2634 (Lieber, 2006)
requires the quantification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs of extremely
low-income households.
Extremely low-income is defined as households with income at or below 30 percent of area
median income. The HCD 2014 area median income for Solano County was $82,600 for a four-
person household or $57,800 for a one-person household. For extremely low-income
households, this results in an income of $24,800 or less for a four-person household or $17,400
or less for a one-person household.
Households with extremely low income have a variety of housing situations and needs. For
example, most families and individuals receiving public assistance, such as social security
insurance or disability insurance, are considered extremely low-income households. At the
same time, a minimum wage worker living in a single-person household could be considered an
extremely low-income household with an annual income of approximately $24,800 or less.

Typically, minimum wage earners live in shared households. Examples of occupations with
wages that could qualify a household as extremely low-income are included in Table 36.

 Existing Needs
According to the 2007-2011 American Communities Survey, there were approximately 2,335
extremely low-income households in the City, representing 7.8 percent of the total households.
Most extremely low income households are renters and most experience a high incidence of
housing problems. These problems, relevant to both renters and owners, include overpaying for
rent (defined as cost burden greater than 30 percent of income), overcrowding, and living in
substandard housing. According to the 2007-2011 Comprehensive Housing Affordability
Strategy (CHAS) data, 89.9 percent of all extremely low income households were overpaying for
housing (see Table 26 in Chapter 4).
Projected Needs
The City used available census data to calculate the percentage/number of very low-income
households that qualify as extremely low income households. In accordance with State housing
element law, the City assumes that half of the very low income RHNA are extremely low-income
households. Based on this approach, the projected housing need for extremely low income
households represents 13.3 percent of the City’s RHNA, which equates to a projected need of
144 units for extremely low income households.
Many extremely low income households will be seeking rental housing and will likely face
housing issues including overpayment, overcrowding or substandard housing conditions. Some
extremely low-income households may include those with special needs. To address the range
of needs, the City will employ a detailed housing strategy described below.

Providing for the Needs of Extremely Low Income Households
Housing Choice (Section 8) Vouchers
The Vacaville Housing Authority (VHA) administers the US Department of Housing and Urban
Development’s (HUD) Housing Choice Voucher program for very low and extremely low-income
households. The Housing Choice Voucher has no ceilings on rents, but rents must meet a
reasonableness test. The tenant is responsible for paying the difference between the subsidy
provided by the VHA and the actual rent, and the VHA subsidy is generally the difference
between 30 percent of the renter’s income and the payment standard for which the renter is
eligible. The VHA administers 1,193 vouchers under this program. Of these, 75 percent of
households admitted to the Housing Choice Voucher program must be extremely low-income
households, which typically have fixed incomes such as social security insurance and/or
disability.
In 2010, the VHA was granted 50 family unification program (FUP) vouchers. FUP vouchers are
made available to families for whom the lack of adequate housing is a primary factor in the
separation, or threat of imminent separation, of children from their families or in the prevention
of reunifying the children with their families. FUP vouchers enable these families to lease or
purchase decent, safe and sanitary housing that is affordable in the private housing market.
FUP vouchers can also be used by former foster youth ages 18-21 who left foster care at age
16 or older who are homeless or at risk of being homeless. Since award of the FUP vouchers,
no additional applications have been made by the VHA. However, the VHA continues to analyze
vouchers made available by HUD in order to apply for those that they are eligible for, per its
commitment as identified in Housing Program H.3 - I 4.
The VHA also administers the Housing Choice Voucher Homeownership Program, where a
Voucher holder may utilize Section 8 subsidy towards a mortgage payment instead of rental
assistance. There are currently six households receiving mortgage assistance through this
program.
In addition, HUD has announced the availability of a competitive application process for
vouchers for persons who are disabled but non-elderly. As required by HUD regulations, 75
percent of all vouchers received would be allocated to extremely low-income households. The
VHA applied for funding in 2011 under this program, as well, but like many Housing Authorities,
did not receive an allocation. The VHA will continue to apply for all Housing Choice Vouchers for
which it is eligible as additional funding becomes available. This commitment is identified in
Housing Program H.3 - I 4.
As of October 1, 2014, there were 4,338 families awaiting Housing Choice rental assistance.
The Housing Choice vouchers help address the housing needs of extremely low-income
households in Vacaville.
Other Assisted Housing
Table 31, found in Chapter 4, lists the various rental subsidy programs at work in Vacaville and
the number of units affected. One project, Twin Oaks Apartments, contains a total of 45 Section
8 units. The Autumn Leaves project was built with Section 202/8 funds and provides 56 studio
and one-bedroom units to elderly and disabled renters. For Section 8 and 202 units, tenants pay
a maximum of 30 percent of their income for rent with eligibility limited to those with incomes of
50 percent or less of the area median income.

5. Housing Need
Prior to the dissolution of redevelopment, the 20 percent Housing Set-Aside Funds (Low-Income
Housing Funds) were used to subsidize rents of 1,080 rental units for extremely low-, very low-,
low-, and moderate-income households. This includes 70 units that must be rented to or held
available for extremely low-income households. Although redevelopment has been dissolved,
the units remain restricted as rental units for extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-
income households. The City, as Housing Successor to the former Vacaville Redevelopment
Agency, continues to monitor 126 Affordability Agreements covering 1,007 units for compliance
each year.
The Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) Program is a federal program that allows qualified first-
time homebuyers to take an annual credit against federal income taxes of up to 15 percent of
the annual interest paid on the applicant’s mortgage. This enables homebuyers to have more
income available to qualify for a mortgage loan and make the monthly mortgage payments. The
Value of the MCC must be taken into consideration by the mortgage lender in underwriting the
loan and may be used to adjust the borrower’s federal income tax withholding. The MCC
program has convent restrictions to ensure the affordability of the participating homes for a
period of 15 years. The City of Vacaville participates as an Associate member of the California
Rural Home Mortgage Finance Authority Homebuyers Fund (CHF), (formerly known as the
California Rural Home Mortgage Finance Authority) for inclusion in the Single Family Bond Pool.
By assigning Vacaville’s portion of our state allocated funds to CHF, Vacaville residents have
access to CHF’s "FirstHouse" loan program, which utilizes tax-exempt Mortgage Revenue
Bonds to provide qualifying homebuyers with mortgage loans featuring below-market interest
rates as well as down payment assistance in the form of grants and/or second mortgage loans.
Security Deposit Loan Program
The VHA offers a guarantee program to participants using a Family Unification Program
Housing Choice Voucher who can afford to pay rent but do not have the necessary funds for a
large security deposit. Under this program, eligible applicants may receive a guarantee from the
VHA for an amount not to exceed the Security Deposit being requested by the landlord or
$1,000, whichever is less. If the landlord agrees to participate in the program, the participant
makes monthly payments towards their Security Deposit obligation to the landlord. If a payment
is missed by the participant, the VHA will make the payment directly to the landlord.
With the dissolution of redevelopment in California effective February 1, 2012, the City elected
to retain the functions/rights as the “Housing Successor” to increase, improve, and preserve the
City’s affordable housing stock. Since that time, the housing assets of the former redevelopment
agency were approved by the Department of Finance for transfer to the City. The assets
included real properties and a loan portfolio (primarily deferred or forgivable loans to individual
homebuyers/owners and affordable housing non-profits). Assets did not include the
approximately $3.2 million dollars in 20 percent Set-Aside Funds for affordable housing.
Although there is no funding source for affordable housing, the City will leverage its real
property assets in order to provide affordable housing opportunities. In addition, after following
various required processes, on April 13, 2013, the Department of Finance authorized the City,
as Housing Successor, to access $6.2 million of the 2006 Affordable Housing Bond proceeds
that were issued for the purpose of developing affordable housing. These proceeds are being
used for the Callen Street Rehabilitation/New Construction Project: Conversion to Affordable
Rental Units described below.

Emergency Rental Assistance to Prevent Homelessness
Emergency rental assistance to prevent homelessness is provided by Solano County through
the Health and Social Services Department Cal-Works Homelessness Program. Under the
program, households may receive $30 to $60 per night for 16 nights in a motel. The program
will pay the last month’s rent and/or a security deposit for up to twice the monthly rent. This
program also pays utility deposits. It is only available for those enrolled in the CalWorks
(Welfare to Work) Program.
The City conducts screening for the Season of Sharing and Youth Connections programs. The
two privately funded programs provide emergency rental assistance to eligible lower-income
Vacaville households.
Other Programs
Through the Density Bonus provisions in the Land Use and Development Code, several
multifamily projects were produced. These include Autumn Leaves, Saratoga Apartments, and
Vacaville Senior Manor. In addition to these sources of below-market-rate units, Vacaville has
also produced units with its Housing Opportunity Area (HOA) policy and by issuing mortgage
revenue bonds.
Mortgage revenue bonds issued by the City since 1982 have helped build 976 apartment units,
including 195 affordable to lower-income households, including extremely low-income
households, in the Spring Glenn, Hidden Creek, Quail Run, and Sycamores projects. Also, 71
single-family units, affordable to households with income between 78 and 117 percent of the
area median, were built with funds from bond issues in 1982 and 1984. In 1999 and 2000, tax-
exempt bonds and tax credits were utilized to construct 228 affordable senior rental units.
Callen Street Rehabilitation/New Construction Project: Conversion to Affordable Rental Units
Between 2006 and 2012, the City of Vacaville’s former Redevelopment Agency acquired
market-rate multi-family residential duplexes and four-plexes for a total of 86 apartment units
along Callen Street, Bennett Hill Drive, and Bennett Hill Court in order to convert the properties
to affordable rental units. Following the dissolution of redevelopment on April 13, 2013, the
Department of Finance (DOF) authorized the City, as Housing Successor, to access $6.2 million
of the 2006 Affordable Housing Bond proceeds for the purpose of developing affordable
housing. The City is utilizing these funds to work with a for-profit/non-profit partnership on a two-
phase project of rehabilitation and new construction, which will result in the production of 130
affordable rental units with affordability rates at 30 to 60 percent of area median income.
Families and Persons In Need Of Emergency Shelters
Homelessness in California is a continuing crisis that demands the effective involvement of both
the public and private sectors. Factors that contribute to homelessness include lack of
affordable housing to very low-income persons, unemployment, reductions in government
subsidies, deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill, domestic violence, drug addiction,
dysfunctional families, and lifestyle choice.
Vacaville Homeless Survey
On January 29, 2009, the City of Vacaville Police Department conducted a visual homeless
survey in the areas of Vacaville known to be frequented by homeless persons. During this
visual survey, 34 people were identified as being homeless: 23 males, 9 females, and 2 persons
of unknown gender. Of these 34 persons, 18 were living in hand-constructed temporary

structures. The remaining persons were found either walking around or sleeping in various
locations around the City. Community Action Partnership (CAP) Solano JPA will conduct a
“point in time” survey in January 2015, which will update this 2009 survey information. The
purpose of this count is to survey the homeless, obtain a homeless census, and prepare a
detailed report regarding the homeless in Solano County. The report will include the count and
characteristics and experiences of homeless persons.
The Vacaville Family Resource Center identified 15 homeless clients during 2013 who and
sought their services, including housing. Those clients included nine single individuals and six
single mothers with children. Of these, 13 lived with family and two lived in cars. The Family
Resource Center has recently switched over to a new database system, and as a result, these
numbers may not fully count all homeless individuals served.
Solano County Homeless Plan
Solano County has a 10-year plan addressing homelessness for the 2008 to 2018 time frame.
According to their most recent data (January 2014), Solano County has approximately 406
homeless persons. The County is aware that there may be an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 persons
who are homeless at any point in time and are not captured in the time of this count. Solano
County has 259 beds available in emergency shelters, 320 beds in transitional housing, and
140 beds year round in permanent housing. Even with these 719 beds, Solano County is
looking at a need for over 3,000 homeless persons at any one time in Solano County. Solano
County has ten strategies addressing homelessness:
•   Discharge planning and decrease the number of people of being discharged into
    homelessness by 25 percent.
•   Create new permanent housing beds for homeless and chronically homeless persons.
•   Increase percentage of homeless persons staying in permanent housing over 6 months to
    71 percent.
•   Increase percentage of homeless persons moving from transitional housing into permanent
    housing by 61 percent.
•   Increase percentage of homeless persons becoming employed by 11 percent.
•   Ensure that the Continuum of Care has a functional Homeless Management Information
    System with 90 percent of the shelters and housing projects actively participating.
•   Improve access to mainstream resources by 25 percent.
•   Chronically homeless individuals will be fully engaged in the continuum of services and
    housing available to them.
•   Chronically homeless people will be forced to live on the street until permanent housing or
    affordable housing is available.
•   Ensure sufficient outreach to homeless, at-risk families and non-chronically homeless
    individuals and provide for their basic needs.
•   Further strengthen self-sufficiency supports for homeless people moving out of
    homelessness.

Opportunity House
The City worked with Vacaville Social Services Corporation, which operates the local homeless
facility (in addition to transitional housing), Opportunity House, to relocate to a new location. The
relocation enabled the facility to increase from 24 beds to 48 beds. The relocated facility opened
its doors in October 2012. Opportunity House continues to receive referrals from Child
Protection Services and Solano County Drug Court as well as other service providers through-
out Solano County.
On January 2, 2015, the Opportunity House was serving:
•    Three Child Protective Services Re-unification referral cases
•    One completed Child Protective Services Re-unification referral case (single mother with
     one child)
•    One single father with four children and one single father with one child
•    One single mother with four children, one single mother with two children, one single mother
     with one child, and two single mothers each with one child
•    Five single females
•    One married couple
In addition to providing food and shelter to homeless individuals and families, the facility
implements a three-step program that promotes self-sufficiency. By the time an individual moves
to the third, and final, step of the program, they are employed, seeking affordable housing, have
the knowledge to create and manage a budget, and have a savings fund, typically consisting of
two or three paychecks. At this point, some individuals obtain their own housing, while others
move into the shelter’s transitional housing. The facility also offers youth programming through
The Leaven, which receives funding from the City’s CDBG program.
Mission Solano
Mission Solano is a local non-profit organization that provides coordinated care for homeless
and potentially homeless in Solano County. Mission Solano hosts an emergency shelter and a
transitional care facility. The Community Outreach Center Emergency Shelter provides
immediate care for anyone in need. Any individual can get food, shelter, shower and clothing 24

hours a day, 7 days a week. The Bridge to Life Center is a long-term transitional housing facility
that provides holistic care to those experiencing dependency issues. Specific housing is
available for veterans, single women, and families. Mission Solano provides for an average of
157 people every night.
Other City efforts and Other Social Services to Serve the Homeless Population
Opportunity House relocated from Catherine Street to the current location in October 2012 as a
result of the City Council action adopting two special standard overlay zones (SS-10 and SS-
11), which permit social services facilities, including emergency shelters, homeless shelters,
food banks, and other similar types of facilities, without the need for a conditional use permit.
(For more information regarding these overlay zones, refer to Section 7.1 of this document). The
new location for Opportunity House can accommodate up to 60 beds in a 9,800 square-foot,
two-story building. In addition to providing housing, Opportunity House plans to provide
additional services such as more transitional and alternative housing, more supportive services,
a mentoring program, and volunteer programs. SS-10 and the Special Standard 11 (SS-11)
overlay districts are located contiguously on Callen Street, Bennett Hill Drive, and Bennett Hill
Court (refer to the map in Section 6.5). The relocated and expanded Opportunity House
discussed above is located within an overlay district.
In 2012, a new County social services building was built on the corner of Brown Street and East
Monte Vista Avenue. This location is approximately one-half mile from the SS-10 and SS-11
zone districts. The William J. Carroll Government Center is now complete and contains:
• Community Medical Primary Care Clinic
• Community Dental Clinic
• Child Welfare Services/Older and Disabled Adults Services
• Mental Health-Family Services
• Women, Infants & Children
• Public Health Nurse
• Employee Eligibility
• Cal-Works Eligibility
• Health and Social Service Outreach & Investigation Bureau
In addition to this new Social Services building, a 4,400 square foot, faith-based food and
clothing distribution center was constructed at 1146 East Monte Vista Avenue, within walking
distance of the SS-10 and SS-11 overlay districts (approx. ¼ mile) and a bus stop. The
distribution center is not a homeless shelter or homeless facility; however, in addition to
distributing food and clothing, the center serves prepared meals on-site to homeless individuals
and families twice a week.
Homeless Roundtable
The City Council established the Homelessness Ad Hoc Committee as a part of its annual
Strategic Plan in 2009. This committee was formed initially through the Police Department and
ultimately was transitioned to the Redevelopment and Housing Department of the City. The
group met monthly and coordinated communication between service providers, faith based
groups, and local (City/County and State) government regarding service delivery and
addressing various issues surrounding homelessness in the City of Vacaville. Through these
efforts the group ultimately published a report on homelessness in the community entitled: The
White Paper on Homelessness in Vacaville.

The committee also worked on various issues with nomadic encampments, established an
annual “Project Homeless Connect” events, which remains one of the most successful and well
attended homeless service events in the County. Due to the dissolution of redevelopment by the
State of California, the committee was disbanded in 2012. However, the issues with
homelessness remained in the community, and the homeless population continued to grow due
to various issues including Realignment of the State Prison system, as well as growing issues
with poverty and mental health.
In September of 2014, the City reached out to service and faith based organizations to renew
the dialog. The desire to better coordinate and deliver services to the homeless and needy
became the focus of the conversation, and the City agreed to form the Homelessness Round
Table to coordinate projects, service delivery and to establish a base for coordinating tracking of
resources available to the homeless. The City’s Homeless Resource Guide was updated and
published. The Committee meets monthly and includes members from:
•   City of Vacaville: Police, Fire (Code Enforcement), Housing Services and City Manager’s
    Departments
•   County of Solano: Health and Human Services, Probation and Sherriff’s Offices
•   Faith Based Groups: local churches providing feeding and food bank programs
•   Opportunity House Homeless Shelter
•   Other various members of the community
The group continues to meet in order to implement tracking of services and resources provided
to the homeless and needy families in an effort to better communicate, eliminate duplication of
effort, and manage the limited resources that are available.
 Other Programs Assisting the Homeless Population
To further meet the needs of the homeless and other persons in need, Housing Program H.3 –
I 12 identifies that the City will continue the activation and operation of emergency cooling and
warming centers at the City’s community centers during times of extreme weather. The City will
also activate and operate emergency shelters during catastrophic events requiring emergency
evacuations of City residents.
The Vacaville Community Welfare Association, as well as local faith-based organizations,
continues to offer limited help and vouchers for overnight accommodation at local motels. The
City continues to collaborate with the Community Action Partnership Solano (CAP Solano) to
move people out of poverty and homelessness. The City partners with CAP Solano to apply for
available grant funds as well as community events that are designed to prevent and address
homelessness. The City also refers individuals and families to CAP Solano for resources that
are available to address their specific needs. The City participates in Housing First Solano,
formerly the Continuum of Care, a group made up of representatives from local government
agencies and other organizations who are interested in sharing information and expanding the
services available to homeless and near homeless persons.

5. Housing Need
Senior Residents
The 2010 Census figures indicated that there were approximately 40.3 million persons aged 65
and older (or 13 percent of the US population). 1 The number of elderly persons as a percentage
of total US population is expected to continue to increase due to the aging of the “Baby Boom”
generation, lower birth rates in recent years, and extended life expectancies. It is expected that
persons aged 65 years and older will comprise more than 19 percent of the US population by
2030, and 20 percent by 2050.
As a special needs group, the elderly are in some respects unique. The 2010 Census indicates
that there are 6,076 households (19.5 percent of total households) with householders age 65
and older. The majority of Vacaville’s elderly households are homeowners, with 4,485 elderly
homeowners compared with 1,591 elderly renters, as shown in Table 38. According to the 2008-
2012 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, 8,973 persons age 65 and above live
below the poverty level. Such residents often have fixed incomes that do not keep pace with
increasing housing costs. Past and future construction of senior restricted apartments with
affordability restrictions will assist in fulfilling this housing need.
Senior citizens are identified as a population in need of special housing because of physical
constraints as well as limited incomes. Housing for the elderly should respond to this group’s
need for relatively easy access to shops, services and medical care, and to limitations on
income and mobility. As confirmed by residents and real estate agents attending a June 2014
stakeholder discussion, typically elderly individuals desire small, secure, low-maintenance
homes. However, there are also needs for affordable apartments and congregate care group
facilities. As the baby boomers are now reaching retirement age, the percentage of elderly
persons is expected to dramatically increase in future years.
The special needs of seniors can be met through a range of services, including congregate
care, rent subsidies, shared housing programs, and housing rehabilitation assistance. For the
disabled elderly, housing with architectural design features that accommodate disabilities helps
ensure continued independent living. Elderly with a mobility or self-care limitation also benefit
from transportation alternatives and shared housing options. Senior housing with supportive
services can be provided to assist with independent living.
Mobility impairment may also require a need for a living arrangement that includes health,
meals, cleaning, and/or other services as a part of a housing package. A number of living
arrangements are possible, from senior citizen developments with individual living units, to
congregate care facilities, to 24-hour support services. In recent years, the private market has
responded to this need with construction of new, below market rate, income restricted units as
well as market rate senior restricted apartments and houses, and construction assisted living
facilities and congregate care apartments. One recently constructed project includes an
Alzheimer’s wing.
Large Families
According to the 2010 Census, the average household size in Vacaville was 2.58 people and
the average family size was 3.14 people. Large families are defined as families of five or more
persons. Often, large families live in overcrowded conditions due to the lack of availability of
larger units. Overcrowding is typically defined as more than one person per room, based on the
Census Bureau’s definition of “room,” which excludes bathrooms, porches, balconies, foyers,

halls, or half-rooms. Severe overcrowding occurs when there are more than 1.5 persons per
room. As illustrated in Table 24 (Chapter 4) and Table 39, 12 percent of households in Vacaville
have five or more members, and 1.90 percent of all households are overcrowded (1.01 to 1.50
persons per room), and an additional 0.46 percent are severely overcrowded (1.51 or more
persons per room).
Overcrowding can result when there are not enough adequately sized units within a community,
or when high housing costs force several individuals or family members to share housing. As
illustrated in Table 39, large families make up approximately 13 percent of all rental households
in Vacaville. Currently there are 131 households receiving Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8)
rental assistance that have five or more members and an additional 294 large families on the
waiting list for this program. Of these, 90 families have applied as Vacaville residents and the
remaining 204 families as non-residents. Applicants who live or work in Vacaville receive
preference over those who do not.

The October 2014 Vacancy and Rent Survey documents that of the 4,907 market-rate
apartment units surveyed, only 124 were three-bedroom units. Of these three-bedroom units,
two units were vacant and available for rent, and three units were vacant and unavailable for
rent. In an effort to provide additional housing for large families, the City has a housing program
that encourages developers to provide a component of three-bedroom units within apartment
projects to accommodate large families.
Female-Headed Households
In 2010, 17 percent of all two or more person households in Vacaville were headed by a single
parent (5,288 households). The largest sub-set of this group was the 4,013 households where
the single parent was female (4,013 of the total single parent households, or 75.9 percent). Of
the total two or more person households headed by women, 52.4 percent (2,101 households)
reported children under the age of 18 present in the household (see Table 40).

Single mothers are identified as a special needs group because their level of income is often too
low to pay for housing adequate to meet space and lifestyle needs. In 2010, of all family
households living below the poverty level, 47.25 percent were single mothers with children
under age 18. The special housing needs of this group include low-cost housing that is suitable
for children (outdoor play space or proximity to parks would be preferable) and located near
schools and childcare. These needs can be addressed through continued progress in efforts to
acquire and rehabilitate rental housing, especially units with three or more bedrooms. Some of
these households may receive rental assistance from the Housing Authority. There are 924

female-headed households now receiving Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance, nearly 80
percent of all program participants.
To address both the housing needs and the supportive service needs of female-headed
households, additional multifamily housing should be developed and include childcare facilities
to allow single mothers to secure gainful employment outside the home.
In addition, the creation of innovative housing for female heads of household could include co-
housing developments where childcare and meal preparation responsibilities can be shared.
The economies of scale available in this type of housing would be advantageous to this special
needs group as well as all other low-income households. Limited equity cooperatives sponsored
by non-profit housing developers are another financing structure that could be considered for the
benefit of all special needs groups.
Farm Workers
At one time, much of California’s agricultural production depended primarily on farm workers
who migrated from place to place to pick various crops during the harvest season. Their housing
needs consisted of “temporary shelter” close to their location of employment during harvest
time. In addition, some would require housing at their “home base” during the remainder of the
year.
According to the 2008-2012 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimate, there were 237
Vacaville residents employed within the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, and Mining
industry (Table 13). According to the 2012 USDA Agricultural Census, there are 860 farms in
Solano County. As of the 2007 USDA Agricultural Census, there were 74 agricultural operations
in zip code 95687, 233 in 95688, and 27 in 95696. Vacaville has no known seasonal or migrant
farmworkers (defined by the USDA as employed for less than 150 days), but Solano County has
275 seasonal farm workers in addition to its 219 permanent hired farm workers.
The advent of mechanization in harvesting crops, new planting techniques and changes in the
types of crops grown have substantially reduced the overall number of farm workers and the
proportion of migrant farm workers. Technology, along with urbanization, has decreased
agricultural employment in Solano County and in the City of Vacaville, and therefore the number
of farm workers in the community. Many once active orchards near Vacaville are no longer
maintained due to lack of economic return. Vacaville was once a central fruit-processing center,
but almost all of the fruit processing related businesses have moved elsewhere, making it
uneconomical for farmers to transport their product.
The Land Use and Development Code identifies farm employee housing as “living quarters,
including dwellings, sleeping accommodations and dining facilities, on a permanent foundation,
maintained for occupancy by persons employed principally in farming and related pursuits on
land owned, leased, or rented by the owner, lessee, or tenant of the site on which the farm
employee housing is located.” This definition does not include labor camps, trailer camps, or
other temporary housing. Farm employee housing is permitted without the need of a conditional
use permit or other zoning variance within the Agriculture Zoning District.
Mobility Impaired and Other Individuals with Disabilities
Persons with disabilities face unique problems in obtaining affordable and adequate housing.

Mobility impaired individuals have physical impairments that require special housing design for
self- sufficiency. The impairment could include confinement to a wheelchair, an inability to
negotiate steps, an inability to stoop and reach low places, or an inability to reach high places.
There are two approaches to housing design for mobility impairment: adaptability and
accessibility. Adaptable design is a design concept in which a dwelling unit contains features
that allow for accessibility and use by mobility-impaired individuals with only minor modifications.
An accessible unit has special features installed in the house, such as grab bars and special
cabinets.
According to the 2008-2012 American Communities Survey, there were 8,094 persons with
disabilities in Vacaville, and 3,336 of these persons were age 65 and older (shown in Table 41).
No data was available as to the degree of limitation. As a result of Vacaville’s proximity of Travis
Air Force base, returning disabled veterans are a significant disabled population. Veterans may
not be well integrated with other disability groups and are often reluctant to seek help. 2 The
living arrangement of persons with disabilities depends on the severity of the disability. Many
persons live at home in an independent fashion or with other family members. Others live in one
of the several assisted living or convalescent facilities in Vacaville. To maintain independent
living, persons with disabilities may need special assistance, including special housing design
features, income support for those who are unable to work, and in-home supportive services.
To address the need for adaptability and accessibility of housing by mobility impaired persons,
the California Department of Housing and Community Development has adopted requirements
for rental housing. These regulations implement most requirements of federal law for federally
financed housing projects, plus additional requirements. California law requires that five percent
of dwelling units in a new apartment building, hotel, motel, or lodge include design features for
adaptable use by mobility-impaired persons.
The state requirements address exterior and interior design features, such as walkways leading
to a dwelling unit, the gradient of the access way to the main entry, changes in level, entry
width, threshold height, ramp and landing design, corridor widths, types of door locks and
latches, electrical outlet and switch heights, bathroom configuration and clear space, ability to
install grab bars in bathrooms, knee space under lavatories and sinks, counter top height and
kitchen configuration.
Mental Disabilities
There is also a segment of the population with severe mental disabilities. These residents
require special housing with supportive care. According to the 2008-2012 American
Communities Survey, there were 2,078 persons with some form of cognitive disability residing in
Vacaville (see Table 41). As noted in the previous section on Vacaville’s homeless, mental
disability often is a factor that contributes to homelessness. Residential group home facilities for
mentally ill or mentally disabled individuals, which are a permitted use in single family zoning
districts, are a housing choice for persons that do not require institutionalization. There are also

Developmental Disabilities
A developmental disability is a disability that originates before an individual becomes 18 years
old, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial
disability for that individual. This includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and
autism. According to the North Bay Regional Center, one of the regional nonprofits that contract
with the California Department of Developmental Services to provide or coordinate services and
supports for individuals with developmental disabilities, there are 683 residents in Vacaville who
are developmentally disabled.
The housing needs of developmentally disabled individuals are broad: they may live in group
homes, under the care of family, in institutional settings, or independently in a conventional
housing situation. Much of this housing need is for supportive housing, which is permanent
rental housing linked to a range of support services designed to enable residents to maintain
stable housing and lead fuller lives.
Housing and social service stakeholders confirm that Vacaville’s social and public services that
support disabled, homeless and otherwise in need residents are some of the best in Solano
County. In addition to services that reach the larger community such as mental health, in-home
supportive services, emergency housing, education, transit and family/children’s resources,
services available to Vacaville residents specifically for the developmentally disabled include:

•    North Bay Regional Center
•    Connections for Life
•    Pace Solano
•    UC Davis MIND Institute
•    Independent Living Center of Solano County
•    Chance 4 Change
Several of these services support developmentally disabled adults in living independently.
According to a representative of the non-profit service community, the largest barrier
developmentally disabled adults face is finding adequate housing, described below. 3 According
to the North Bay Housing Coalition, a person receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) in
California had to pay 104 percent of their income ($8,714 per year, on average) to rent a fairly
modest one-bedroom unit, leaving no money to pay for groceries, transportation, clothing, and
other necessities. This has increased from paying only 69 percent of income for rent in 1998.
Additionally, those who have successfully found housing are usually living in dangerous
neighborhoods. 4 Developmentally disabled residents can rarely afford a single-family home on
their own, and often encounter difficulties sharing a home with a roommate.
Housing considered adequate for this population is:
•    Affordable.
•    Accessible and barrier-free.
•    Located in an environment where residents are integrated into a community of neighbors
     with varying abilities.
•    On public transit lines.
•    Close to grocery stores and other services.
•    Small enough to be affordable without requiring a roommate.
The City of Vacaville supports housing for its developmentally disabled residents in the following
ways:
•    The Land Use and Development Code complies with State law to encourage supportive
     housing by allowing supportive housing by right in any zoning designation where other
     residential uses are allowed.
•    The City has developed two overlay districts, SS-10 and SS-11, that allow social service
     facilities without a conditional use permit.
•    The City has included policies in this Housing Element to specifically support and prioritize
     housing for developmentally disabled and other disabled residents:

Guiding Policies
H.1 - I 6       Give priority to special needs housing and residential care facilities by allowing
                for reduced processing time and streamlined procedures for special needs
                housing land use applications.
H.1 - I 7       Encourage preferential handling of special needs populations, such as domestic
                violence cases, youth aging out of foster care, the developmentally disabled,
                single parents, etc., in the management plans and regulatory agreements of
                funded projects.
H.1 - I 8       Consider adopting a Universal Design ordinance incentivizing accessible design
                features in new residential development to support visitability, which allows
                people with limited mobility to stay integrated with the community.
Travis Air Force Base Families
The availability of decent and affordable housing is also a special need for those military
families based at nearby Travis Air Force Base (AFB). Travis AFB is vital to the local economy.
In the past, Travis AFB was rated poorly for availability of off-base affordable housing. This
makes the Base vulnerable during Base Realignments and Closure (BRAC) procedures.
Affordable housing is a key component to the long-term viability of the base as well as the local
economy. Active service members receive a Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) which allows
them to choose to live in off-base housing or in privatized on-base housing. Active military
members who reside in on-base governmental quarters without dependents (dorms) receive
partial BAH.
BAH is based on rental data for the area surrounding the base, as well as the military’s pay
grade, base assignment, and number of dependents. A homeowner’s monthly mortgage
payment is not used in the computation because the monthly cash outlay of a homeowner is not
a good indicator of the economic costs of home ownership. The variables needed to compute
this include such difficult to measure factors as the expected appreciation in the value of the
residence, the amount of down payment, the opportunity costs of interest from down payments,
settlement costs, and the tax savings due to the interest and tax payments deduction.
Therefore, BAH reflects the current rental market conditions not the historical circumstances
surrounding various mortgage loans.
The off-base housing market is difficult for military families to utilize. Developers of new market
rate apartments typically target high-income tenants, and, as stakeholders in a June 2014
meeting indicated, three- and four-bedroom units are in short supply. Between 2001 and 2011,
median rents increased 10.5 percent for one-bedroom units, 13.1 percent for two-bedroom
units, and 18.7 percent for three-bedroom units. The 2014 BAH for a senior airman (typical rank
for someone with four years of service) with dependents is $1,575. The 2014 BAH for a senior
airman without dependents is $1,371. Based on the 2014 Annual Apartment Vacancy and Rent
Survey, the median rent for a one-bedroom unit was $1,085, a two-bedroom unit was $1,300,
and a three-bedroom unit was $1,400 (these amounts do not take into account the cost of
utilities).

5. Housing Need
While the City has General Plan policies that promote the development of housing that is
affordable to Travis AFB personnel, it would be beneficial if the City could identify properties
with potential for affordable housing as well as new housing programs.
Other Special Needs Groups
Persons with Family and Friends in Prison
Families sometimes move to Vacaville to be nearer to incarcerated relatives for daily visitation.
The size of this population, however, is elusive because the California Department of
Corrections will not release data concerning the location of inmates’ families. This makes it
difficult for the City to address this potential low-income housing need.
Vacaville Residents with High End Jobs in Vacaville
Residents who work within the community are another special needs group. Since 1990, more
professional and higher skilled jobs are available within Vacaville. These jobs include those at
the Kaiser Medical Center, Genentech, Alza Pharmaceutical, Travis Federal Credit Union,
California State Prison Solano, California Medical Facility and State Compensation Insurance
Fund. However, many jobs added during the last 10 years are also in the lower-paying service,
manufacturing and retail sectors. Economic Development is a primary goal for the City and the
City is proactive in attracting development with higher-paying jobs, which provide greater
opportunity for Vacaville residents and an ability to afford a wider range of housing.
Young Adult Residents
According to the Census data, the percentage of young adult residents ages 20 to 24 (Table 8,
in Chapter 3) in Vacaville remained relatively the same over the past 10 years, at approximately
7 percent of the total population. Based on national housing studies, a population with a high
proportion of young adults generally indicates a need for rental units, secondary living units, and
first-time homebuyer or first move-up opportunities, including condominiums, town homes, or
small single-family homes. Participants in past focus groups have indicated a concern amongst
Vacaville residents regarding the inability for their young adult children to reside in Vacaville
after graduating from high school, vocational schools, or college. Participants in a stakeholder
discussion in June 2014 referenced the lack of small one-bedroom units and rental housing for
young singles or families starting out on their own, as well as for aging seniors looking to
downsize. To the extent that young adults are primarily low-income residents, their housing
needs are similar to other low-income households.

CHAPTER 6
ABILITY TO MEET HOUSING NEEDS
6.1     INTRODUCTION
The City of Vacaville has the ability to meet its housing needs through new construction on
appropriately designated land identified by the existing 1990 General Plan and its proposed
update, substantial rehabilitation of existing market-rate housing units to be re-designated as
affordable units, and construction of secondary living units on existing single-family home sites.
In addition to having zoned sufficient developable vacant residential land to accommodate
meeting housing needs, the City has adopted several policies and programs to encourage the
development of affordable housing and assist low-income households.
New Construction
Table 21, in Chapter 4, analyzes the ability of very low-, low-, and moderate-income households
to afford a sample of Vacaville’s rental housing options for various unit types and rents. The
sample options include projects that were constructed between the late 1960s and 2014, and
represent a variety of high density, large rental projects. Using HUD-established affordability
guidelines of no more than 30 percent of household income for housing costs, it was found that
market-rate multi-family units are generally affordable for moderate-income households,
sometimes affordable to low-income households, and seldom affordable for very low-income
households. Newer market-rate complexes tend to be more upscale and have much higher
rents than older units.
New construction of units affordable to lower income households is typically accomplished with
subsidies, which in the past included Redevelopment Agency set-aside housing monies.
Without some type of subsidy, it is difficult for the for-profit housing market to accommodate
construction of very low- and low-income units. As an example, the Saratoga Apartments, a
senior-restricted apartment complex, offers rents affordable to very low- and low-income
households, with a portion of the units affordable to extremely low income households earning
less than 30 percent of the median income. All of the units have affordability restrictions. This
project was assisted by the former Vacaville Redevelopment Agency. Lincoln Corner, a 134-unit
apartment project completed in 2007, has affordability restrictions and serves low-income
families. It was also constructed with assistance by the former Vacaville Redevelopment
Agency. Section 6.2, the Land Inventory, explores the land available to construct new housing,
both market-rate and subsidized for affordability.
In addition to zoning sufficient developable residential land, the City has adopted several
policies to encourage the development of affordable housing. Incentives for developers include
density bonuses and, in particular situations, streamlined processing, reductions in design and
infrastructure standards (e.g. reduced parking requirements, reduced street widths), and
deferred payment of development impact fees. These strategies are explained in more detail in
the Housing Program section (Chapter 2) of the Housing Element.
Other Housing Assistance
Beyond the zoning and programs intended to encourage the new construction of housing, the
City has also adopted several other policies to assist extremely low-, very low-, low- and
                               City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element
                                                  Page 83

moderate-income households. Strategies to assist households include rental assistance through
the Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance program, City-issued bond programs, and
working to preserve at-risk units. Further assistance is provided to first time homebuyers
through programs such as the Mortgage Credit Certificate Program and the Single Family
Mortgage Revenue Bond Program, Rent-To-Own Program, and/or the State-funded loan
program for first time homebuyers. These strategies are explained in more detail in Chapter 2
(Housing Programs).
Constraints on Public Subsidy
As discussed in Chapter 2 (Housing Programs), many of the programs the City has used in the
past have lost a significant source of funding with the dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency.
This leads to a shortfall of $52 million, which the City will need to identify and seek alternate
sources of funding to fill. The City hopes it will be at least partially filled by statewide strategies
such as cap and trade funding for affordable, transit-oriented housing as part of the California
Homes and Jobs Act (SB 391). Without a permanent source of funding for affordable housing,
the City anticipates that public-private partnerships will be created in order to solicit a variety of
layered funding sources in order for affordable housing developments to be financially feasible.
Fortunately, as mentioned above, the City does have strategies to encourage the construction
and preservation of housing units affordable to lower-income households other than directly
providing funding to finance new construction. For example, provision of density bonuses and
other incentives contributes to the affordability of housing for low and very low income
households. The City has incorporated State laws regarding density bonuses into the Land Use
& Development Code. There are several projects that used this incentive in the past. The
Autumn Leaves 56-unit senior apartment complex was granted a density bonus in order to allow
a density of 38.9 units per acre. Saratoga Senior Apartments was granted a density bonus to
build at 24 units per acre. Most recently, the 60-unit Senior Manor Apartments was approved
with a density bonus allowing 28 units per acre. The City intends to continue to promote its
density bonus ordinance to potential apartment developers. This will further ensure that
projected housing needs for lower income levels will be met. Other City strategies to promote
the construction of housing affordable for low- and very low-income households are detailed in
Chapter 2.
Although new construction is not expected to fully address the needs of very low- and low-
income households, Vacaville has been very successful in providing very low income housing
units, as shown in Chapter 8 (Evaluation of the Previous Housing Element). In addition, through
rehabilitation and acquisition of existing units, the City expects to add 381 units of lower income
units with affordability restrictions during this Housing Element timeframe. In addition, Vacaville
has a very large supply of older apartment units, which typically help provide for lower income
households.
6.2      INVENTORY OF RESIDENTIAL SITES AVAILABLE FOR HOUSING
CONSTRUCTION
This section addresses the requirements of Government Code Sections 65583 and 65583.2,
requiring a parcel-specific inventory of appropriately zoned, available, and suitable sites that can
provide realistic opportunities for the provision of housing to all income segments within the
community. In order to evaluate the residential land inventory as required by State Housing
                                 City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

Element law, it is necessary to analyze only those lands that have developed or are potentially
developable from January 1, 2014 through October 31, 2022.
In 2014, the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) approved the Regional Housing
Needs Plan (RHNP). Vacaville was assigned a portion of the regional housing need for 1,084
new housing units with affordability distributed among low-income, moderate-income and above
moderate-income categories as shown in Tables 35 (Chapter 5) and 42, below. Very low-
income need is expected to be half of the total low-income need. The City’s share of the
regional housing need will be met through the implementation of a variety of strategies (e.g.
available and appropriately zoned land; units built since 2014, the beginning of the baseline
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) period; secondary living units). However, the
primary method for addressing the adequate sites requirement is identifying available vacant
and underutilized sites that are suitable and appropriately zoned.
Methodology
The City’s evaluation of adequate sites begins with a listing of individual sites by zone and
General Plan designation. The sites suitability analysis will demonstrate these sites are currently
available and unconstrained to provide realistic development opportunities prior to October 21,
2022, the end of the 5th RHNA projection period. To demonstrate the realistic development
viability of the sites, the analysis also discusses: (1) whether appropriate zoning is in place, (2)
the applicable development standards and their impact on projected development capacity and
affordability, (3) existing constraints including any known environmental issues, and (4) the
availability of existing and planned public service capacity levels.
The City’s land inventory was developed with the use of a combination of resources including
the City’s Land Use Database, updated Assessor’s data, field surveys, and review of the City’s
Land Use Element and Zoning Ordinance. The compilation resulted in not only an identification
of sites, but also an estimate of potential development capacity for these sites. The majority of
the land available for residential development is located within specific plan areas, which have
been approved for development, and in newly annexed areas around the periphery of the city.
Figure 1 shows a map of the inventory of sites designated for lower-income, moderate-income
and above moderate-income housing.
The inventory shows that there are adequate vacant lands to accommodate the remaining
housing need for 2015 to October 2022 as determined by ABAG and shown in Table 35 in
Chapter 5. As summarized in Table 42, the total housing need is 1,084 units; however, 146
units have been constructed through December 2014, reducing the remaining need to 938 units.

Sites for Lower-Income Housing
The City recognizes that higher-density residential sites (RHD and RUHD) and commercial sites
with a residential overlay designation (CG (RO), CD (RO), and CO (RO)) provide the potential
for lower construction costs due to the economies of scale created, and are therefore most
suitable for development of housing affordable to lower-income households. Those sites
identified in the inventory as having the greatest potential to accommodate housing affordable to
lower-income households allow densities of at least 20 units per acre. Per Government Code
Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B) the City’s higher-density zoning is consistent with the 20 dwelling units
per acre standard determined by HCD for suburban jurisdictions and therefore is considered
appropriate to accommodate housing for lower-income households.
Table 21, in Chapter 4, provides a sampling of rents charged by apartment complexes within the
city, and indicates which units are affordable to very low-, low-, and moderate-income
households. The listed projects represent apartment complexes of varying age and size located
throughout the city, and support the belief that higher-density residential districts provide the
potential for housing affordable to lower-income households.
Realistic Development Capacity
As indicated in Table 44, the City will be relying primarily on zones that permit residential
development at 20 dwelling units per acre (RHD, RUHD, CG (RO), CD (RO), and CO (RO)) to
accommodate its share of the regional housing need for lower-income units. As shown in
Table 44, the City has the ability to accommodate 1,609 housing units for lower-income
households, which exceeds the RHNA for lower-income households.
To determine a realistic development capacity for each site, the City considered and evaluated
the implementation of its current multi-family development standards and on-site improvement
requirements (e.g. setbacks, building height, parking and open space requirements), to
determine approximate density and unit yields. The City also reviewed actual built yields of the
most recently approved and constructed market-rate apartment projects (Table 43). The results
of this review revealed that the average density for apartment projects constructed in RHD and
CG (RO) zones was 20 dwelling units per acre. The Villas at North Village were also included in
this analysis because the project site is located within the North Village Specific Plan (NVSP),
and the NVSP-RM zone permits high-density development.
To ensure that the City maintains the ability to the meet its fair share of affordable housing for
lower-income households, a housing policy has been identified (Policy H.1 - I 15) that will
require high-density residential lands (RHD and RUHD) identified in the Residential Land
Inventory to develop with a minimum density of 20 units per acre. This housing policy has been
included in the City’s ongoing General Plan Update (GPU) process. As part of the GPU process,
a change to the density range for Residential High Density (RHD) has been proposed. The RHD
density range is being proposed at 20.1 to 24 units per acre. The new General Plan is
anticipated to be adopted in early to mid-2015.
Damiano Lane (Site 1) – This site provides an opportunity for residential development on a site
that is underutilized. This site and the surrounding area are in a state of transition. Over the
years, the City has received several inquiries from developers and property owners about
redeveloping this site. Damiano Lane is a small private lane that serves five single-family
ranchettes. The homes were built in the 1960s when the land was located in the county and was
surrounded by agricultural uses. Most of these sites are owned by family trusts. It has been the

City’s experience that underutilized lands with existing, legal, non-conforming residential uses
are often held in family trusts as a transitional ownership until the family member(s) vacates the
property and the land is sold to development interests.
There have been significant changes to the areas surrounding this site. In the early 1990s, a
Policy Plan and an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was certified for this site and
surrounding properties to encourage multi-family housing within close proximity to commercial
development. The Allison Business Area Policy Plan specifically permits multi-family dwellings
on this site and contains development standards for such a use. An assessment district was
also created to fund infrastructure needed to support such development. The infrastructure has
been completed and has capacity to serve a high density project on the site.
Shortly following the adoption of the Allison Business Area Policy Plan, two large commercial
centers were constructed to the north and northwest of the site. In 2002, a 148-unit, two- and
three-story apartment complex was constructed directly south of the site. In 2008, a Christian
school was constructed directly south of the aforementioned apartment complex. Also in 2008,
the property located directly west of this site was rezoned for another potential apartment
complex (see Site 4). A regional intermodal transit/transportation facility is currently being
planned within the immediate vicinity. The intermodal transit/transportation facility and
contiguous Site 4 have been deemed to be a Priority Development Area (PDA) by the
Association of Bay Area of Governments (ABAG). There is adequate infrastructure to support
the construction of a high-density residential project on this site. The EIR prepared for the
General Plan Update currently underway identifies this site as having a cover type of agriculture
and having the potential to impact Swainson’s Hawk and Burrowing Owl conservation areas.
However, the majority of the site is already developed and the site is largely surrounded by
existing development, which limits the biological resource functions of the site. The General
Plan Update EIR also identifies the site has being subject to a “medium” risk of liquefaction
potential. Potential effects from geologic risks could be mitigated through the preparation of a
soils report prior to development and adherence to applicable building code requirements.

Opportunity Hill Master Plan Area (Site 2) – In April 2008, the City Council adopted the
Opportunity Hill Master Plan and Design Guidelines document. The Opportunity Hill project is
located within the boundaries of the Downtown Residential Urban High Density zoning district
that will revitalize portions of the Downtown Area. Land use recommendations identified by the
Master Plan include retail, office uses, housing opportunities (including live/work units, for-sale,
and an affordable housing component), entertainment and restaurant uses, and a continuation
of heritage tourism that celebrates Vacaville’s rich history. Additional discussion about the
Opportunity Hill Master Plan area is provided in Section 6.2 of this Chapter. In addition, a map
of this area and the Opportunity Hill Master Plan and Design Guidelines document has been
included in Appendix B. Also in 2008, ABAG approved the Downtown Vacaville Area as a PDA
for inclusion in FOCUS, the San Francisco’s Bay Area’s Regional Blueprint Plan, and this PDA
has remained as part of the One Bay Area Sustainable Communities Strategy for the Bay Area,
approved in 2013.

The current density range for the RUHD overlay district is 20.1 to 36 units per acre. When the
City Council adopted the Opportunity Hill Master Plan, they also initiated a General Plan
Amendment to permit up to 65 units per acre to be constructed within this area. For the purpose
of the land use inventory, the realistic development capacity for this area was calculated at 24
units per acre, which is permitted by the existing General Plan, and reflects the upper end of the
density range for the Residential High Density land use designation.
Ulatis Creek crosses the site and therefore development on the site is subject to regulations and
permitting requirements associated with potential riparian impacts. Development along the
creek corridor also has the potential to impact Swainson’s Hawk and Burrowing Owl
conservation areas. Areas adjacent to the creek are subject to “very high” risk of liquefaction
potential, according to mapping prepared for the General Plan Update EIR. Potential effects
from geologic risks could be mitigated through the preparation of a soils report prior to
development and adherence to applicable building code requirements.
Harbison Drive at Ulatis Drive (Site 3) – The 8.9-acre property consists of three parcels
owned by one property owner, and is located within Area 1B of the Allison Business Park Policy
Plan, on the northwest corner of Harbison Drive and Ulatis Drive. The site is currently vacant
and located adjacent to the City’s future regional and intermodal transit/transportation facility. In
November 2008, ABAG approved the Allison Policy Plan Area as a Planned Development Area
(PDA) for inclusion in FOCUS, and it has remained a PDA as part of One Bay Area.
In 2008, the Harbison Drive site was rezoned from Office Commercial (CO) to Office
Commercial with a Residential Overlay (CO (RO)) at the request of the property owner. The
Residential Overlay (RO) District permits 8.1 to 24 units per gross developable acre, and
provides opportunities for multi-family residential uses, including townhouses, condominiums,
and apartments, and may include a mixed-use project with residential units over office. The site
was deemed suitable for residential development based on its reasonable proximity to schools,
parks, commercial uses, other residential developments, and the City’s intermodal
transit/transportation facility. Infrastructure is available to the site.
Historically, multi-family projects constructed in RO zones have averaged 20 units per acre, as
illustrated in Table 45. Residential uses are subject to a Planned Development approval, in
compliance with the development standards for the Residential Overlay (RO) zone district
(Section 14.09.106 of the Land Use & Development Code). An Initial Study and Negative
Declaration were prepared for the project site at the time of its rezoning. The Negative
Declaration concluded that there were no significant environmental constraints on the project
site.
Hillside Lane (Site 4) – This 1.1-acre site is zoned Residential High Density (RHD) and
contains a single-family home. The site is located at the end of a small lane leading to several
small apartment buildings. The site contains slopes that do not exceed 25 percent slope. The
slopes and other potential environmental impacts could be mitigated. A high-density residential
project consisting of 10 units or more would be subject to a Planned Development. There are no
entitlements on this site; however, all infrastructure is available to service the site.

Lagoon Valley Senior Restricted Townhomes (Site 5) – In 2005, the Lower Lagoon Valley
Project Vesting Tentative Map and Planned Development was approved. The project has a
development “footprint” of approximately 862+ acres and consists of:
•   a 412-acre residential community clustered into three residential areas (Villages 1, 2, and 3)
    providing 850 single-family detached homes (including 75 units affordable to moderate-
    income households) and 100 age-restricted (senior) attached townhouses;
•   a 240-acre golf course with a clubhouse and recreational complex;
•   a 50-acre business village providing up to 700,000 sq. ft. of office space;
•   an 11-acre mixed-use town center, including up to 50,000 sq. ft. of neighborhood-serving
    retail and 51 affordable housing units;
•   a 1.5-acre fire station site;
•   an 8-acre park with recreational facilities;
•   a 71-acre open space/biological preserve area;
•   a 17.5-acre church parcel; and
•   a lower landscape berm on approximately 49 acres as well as some buffer space adjacent
    to Interstate 80 along the church parcel.
The Vesting Tentative Map created 850 residential lots ranging in size from 4,000 sq. ft. to over
an acre for some of the custom home lots. Individual lots for the 100-unit, age-restricted to
seniors 55+ years townhouse development and the 75 moderate-income restricted units in the
Town Center were not created with this map; however, the parcels have been created for these
uses. The 100-unit age-restricted (senior) townhouse development is likely to be affordable to
low-income households based on the existing rental rates for senior restricted apartments.
Development and design standards for these projects have been included in the Lower Lagoon
Valley Planned Development. These projects are permitted by the Planned Development and
would be subject to a design review, unless the developer seeks deviations from the
development standards. Deviation from the development standards would require a modification
to the Planned Development.

In addition to the residential lots, other parcels are being proposed for a variety of land uses,
ranging from small landscape buffers to large parcels to be dedicated for public open space.
Some of the more major parcels include: a 52-acre business village parcel, a 10-acre town
center parcel, an 8-acre neighborhood park parcel, a 1.5-acre fire station parcel, a 17.5-acre
parcel as a site for a future church, three parcels totaling 240 acres for the golf course, and two
parcels totaling 69.5 acres to become part of Lagoon Valley Park.
The site is located approximately two miles southwest of developed portions of the City, along
Interstate 80. It is separated from the rest of the City by foothills designated as Open Space.
Due to its location, infrastructure is not currently available to the site. Infrastructure would be
extended to the project site by the developer as part of the development project. The public
improvements plans for the project are nearly complete. An EIR addressing infrastructure and
environmental constraints was prepared and certified for this project. A Statement of Overriding
Considerations was adopted for environmental impacts to visual resources, cumulative traffic,
farmland conversion, operational air quality, and construction noise that could not be mitigated.
The EIR determined that infrastructure could be extended to the site.
Leisure Town Apartments (1) (Site 6) – A 157-unit retirement apartment community, known as
Merrill Gardens, is located adjacent to Site 7. Prior to being purchased by a development group
in 2008, Site 7 was owned by the same healthcare company who owned Merrill Gardens. It is
likely that this site was originally intended to provide land for expansion of the senior community.
The land is zoned for high-density development within an age-restricted community. There are
no known environmental constraints on this site and all infrastructure is available to service the
site. A high-density residential project consisting of 10 units or more would be subject to a
Planned Development. There are no entitlements on this site.
Leisure Town Apartments (2) (Site 7) – This site is located across from Site 6. The land is
zoned for high-density development within an age-restricted community. There are no known
environmental constraints on this site and all infrastructure is available to service the site. A
high-density residential project consisting of 10 units or more would be subject to a Planned
Development. There are no entitlements on this site.
Markham Area Apartments (1) (Site 8) – This 0.31-acre triangular-shaped property is
bordered by Rocky Hill Road and Markham Avenue. The surrounding neighborhood contains
several apartment complexes, including complexes located directly north, west, and south of
this site. The site slopes to the east. The slope does not exceed 25 percent grade. Development
will be required to mitigate drainage and slope related issues. There are no other known
environmental constraints and all infrastructure is available to service the site. There are no
entitlements on this site. Based on a preliminary site plan the City had reviewed for this site, it is
feasible to construct up to six units on this site with the approval of a Planned Development,
which would permit deviations from standard development standards, such as setbacks.
Markham Area Apartments (2) (Site 9) – This 1.42-acre site is owned by the City as Housing
Successor to the former Vacaville Redevelopment Agency. The site slopes from the rear of the
property to the front. The slope does not exceed 25 percent. Development will be required to
mitigate drainage and slope related issues. There are no other known environmental constraints
on this site and all infrastructure is available to service the site. As of October 2014, the City has
entered into a disposition, development, and loan agreement with Trower Housing Partners, to
build 41 units on the site that will be made affordable to low-income military veteran households
and families. The new units will be constructed in tandem with the rehabilitation of 51
apartments on Meadows Court.

North Village Apartments (Northern Site) (Site 10) – This 15-acre site is located within the
North Village Specific Plan (NVSP) area, which has a valid Development Agreement. The NVSP
identifies this site as a high-density apartment site with 255 units. To assist in streamlining the
review and approval process, the adopted NVSP includes multi-family design and parking
standards. The administrative site plan approval process is described in detail in the
governmental constraints section of the element. An EIR addressing infrastructure and
environmental constraints was prepared and certified for this project. Mitigation measures have
been incorporated in the NVSP and Planned Development approval. Future development of this
site will be subject to a Design Review.
Nut Tree Residential (Site 11) – Development of this site would occur as part of the Nut Tree
Ranch Policy Plan and Master Planned Development. The 10-acre site has been approved for a
216-unit apartment complex. The site is located on Nut Tree Road, behind the main Nut Tree
Retail Phase 1 shopping center. Specifically, the project consists of the construction of nine
three-story residential buildings (with patios and balconies) and one clubhouse building (single-
story); 449 parking spaces, including carports, garages, guest parking, and 5 RV stalls;
clubhouse with pool and bocce court; and two open space recreation areas. The project
includes six unit types and floor plans ranging in area from 783 sq. ft. (one bedroom/one
bathroom) to 1,402 sq. ft. (three bedroom/two bathroom unit). A Mitigated Negative Declaration
prepared for the Nut Tree Ranch Policy Plan and Master Planned Development found that all
significant impacts associated with development of the site could be mitigated to less-than-
significant levels.
Southtown Phase 1A (Apartment Site) (Site 12) – This 9.93-acre site is zoned RHD and is
located within the Southtown residential project. The Southtown development is located within
close proximity to Travis Air Force Base, California State Prison at Solano, and the California
Medical Facility – all major employers for the City of Vacaville. The project has a valid
Development Agreement and Planned Development, which designates this site as a high-
density site. The development agreement is valid until 2014. An EIR and mitigation monitoring
program have been created for the Southtown development. Mitigation measures have been
incorporated in the Southtown Planned Development approval. A high-density residential project
at this location would be subject to a staff-level design review, providing the project proposal
was consistent with the development and design standards stated in the Southtown Planned
Development. Infrastructure is available to service the site.
Vaca Villa Town Homes (Site 13) – This 2-acre site contains a recorded final map for a 19-unit
condominium project. The map was recorded in 1983. The site is bordered by Alamo Creek on
the north, and Laguna Creek on the south. Development adjacent to creeks can be difficult due
to required setbacks, potential Indian remains, and biological constraints. Development of this
site may require substantial environmental mitigation. A high-density residential project
consisting of 10 units or more would be subject to a Planned Development.
Vanden Town Home Site (Site 14) – This 8.4-acre site is owned by the City of Vacaville
Redevelopment Agency. Assembly Bill (AB) 1X 26 and AB 1484 require all Housing Successor
properties to be used for affordable housing purposes. Or, if these properties are disposed of for
other purposes, the sale proceeds must be used for affordable housing purposes. City staff has
prepared a Development and Disposition Strategy that provides the framework for selling and/or
developing the Housing Successor properties. This strategy plan proposes that this site be
developed with affordable housing. The site is zoned for medium density residential. The site is
located within close proximity to Travis Air Force Base, California State Prison at Solano, and

Callen Street Rehabilitation Project (Phase Two) (Site 15) – An analysis and map of this
project has been provided in Section 6.3, Substantially Rehabilitated Units, of this Chapter.
Secondary Living Units (Citywide Sites) –Secondary living units are discussed in Section 6.4,
Secondary Living Units, of this chapter.
Other Residential High-Density Lands
The City contains several other underutilized parcels zoned for high-density residential
development. Two of these areas were included in the previous Housing Element as “Downtown
Underutilized Land (Stevenson Area)” and “Downtown Underutilized Land (West/Kendal area).”
The Stevenson area contains 1.81 acres, and the West/Kendal Area consists of 4.09 acres.
Cumulatively, these two sites have the potential to accommodate an additional 79 high-density
units. These areas currently contain single-family homes and duplexes on individual lots, and it
is not anticipated that these areas will be redeveloped within the timeframe of this Housing
Element. These areas have not been included in the sites inventory.
Sites for Moderate-Income Housing
The moderate-income sites inventory includes site identification numbers, which correspond to
the numbers in Figure 1, a name, APNs, acreage, potential buildout capacity, zoning, General
Plan designation, existing use, and any known environmental constraints. As shown in Table
46, the City has the ability to accommodate an additional 579 housing units for households with
moderate income.
Lagoon Valley Moderate Density Site (Site 16) –The Lower Lagoon Valley Project Vesting
Tentative Map and Planned Development was approved with 75 units required to be affordable
to moderate-income households. The income-restricted units will be constructed as part of a
mixed-use development within the Lagoon Valley project. These units shall be deed restricted
as affordable units for a period not less than 30 years. An EIR addressing infrastructure and
environmental constraints was prepared and certified for this project, and mitigation measures
have been incorporated in the project.
North Village Medium Density Residential Sites (Site 17) – This 12.2-acre site is identified as
Planning Area 28 in the North Village Specific Plan (NVSP), which has a valid Development
Agreement and is currently under construction. An EIR addressing infrastructure and
environmental constraints was prepared and certified for this project. Mitigation measures have
been incorporated in the NVSP and Planned Development approval. Future development of this
site will be subject to a Design Review. This site is identified as a medium-density residential
site with the capacity for 98 single-family homes. The minimum lot size for this site is 3,600
square feet. This lot size is comparable to the lots currently being sold in the Sanctuary
Subdivision, Unit 4 of the North Village Development, which are affordable to moderate-income
households. Refer to Table 23 in Chapter 4 for the representative “For Sale” housing
developments.

North Village Medium Density Residential Sites (Site 18) – This 17.3-acre site is identified as
Planning Area 18 in the North Village Specific Plan (NVSP), which has a valid Development
Agreement and is currently under construction. An EIR addressing infrastructure and
environmental constraints was prepared and certified for this project. Mitigation measures have
been incorporated in the NVSP and Planned Development approval.
This site has been approved for 115 medium-density residential lots. The minimum lot size for
this project is 3,600 square feet. This lot size is comparable to the lots currently being sold in the
Sanctuary Subdivision, Unit 4 of the North Village Development, which are affordable to
moderate-income households. Refer to Table 23 in Chapter 4 for the representative “For Sale”
housing developments.
North Village Apartment Site (Southern Site) (Site 19) – This 9.99-acre site is located within
the North Village Specific Plan (NVSP) area, which has a valid Development Agreement. An
EIR addressing infrastructure and environmental constraints was prepared and certified for this
project. Mitigation measures have been incorporated in the NVSP and Planned Development
approval. The NVSP identifies this site as a high-density apartment site with 170 units. As
permitted by section 7.3.3.2 of the NVSP, units were transferred from other areas of the
residential development to this site, increasing the unit count from 170 to 228 units. In
December 2008, a 228-unit apartment complex, known as The Villas at North Village, received
Planning approval, and grading permits were issued. Based on the current rental rates of newer
apartment complexes, this development will likely be affordable to moderate-income
households. See Table 21, in Chapter 4, for representative rental rates for apartment
complexes.

Southtown Core (Site 20) – This 11.3-acre site is located within phase 3 of the Southtown
residential project. The Southtown development is located within close proximity to Travis Air
Force Base, California State Prison at Solano, and the California Medical Facility – all major
employers for the City of Vacaville. The development agreement is valid until 2014. An EIR and
mitigation monitoring program have been created for the Southtown development. Mitigation
measures have been incorporated in the Southtown Planned Development approval. The
Southtown Planned Development approval designates this site for low-medium density
clustered single-family homes. This lot size is comparable to the lots currently being sold in the
Sanctuary Subdivision, Unit 4 of the North Village Development, which are affordable to
moderate-income households. Refer to Table 23 in Chapter 4 for the representative “For Sale”
housing developments.
Sites for Above Moderate-Income Housing
The land inventory for above moderate-income housing is shown in Table 47. The table
includes site identification numbers, which correspond to the numbers in Figure 1, a reference
name, APNs, acreage, potential buildout capacity, zoning, general plan designation, existing
use, and any known environmental constraints. The City has the ability to accommodate an
additional 4,482 housing units for households with above-moderate income.
Opportunity Hill Master Plan Area (Analysis of Non-Vacant and Underutilized Sites)
The City’s land inventory identifies key sites for lower income housing. One identified site,
Site 2, is the Opportunity Hill Master Plan Area. The Opportunity Hill Master Plan Area is located
within the Residential Urban High Density (RUHD) overlay district that currently provides for the
development of high-density residential (up to 36 units per acre) and/or mixed-use development
in the downtown area.
The RUHD overlay district encompasses approximately 250 properties with various land uses.
Existing uses within the Opportunity Hill area include commercial uses (auto parts and service
shops); service uses (a bank, auto insurance office, real estate office, and other office uses);
industrial uses (a steel fabrication shop and glass shop); and public/institutional uses (religious
uses, a gymnasium, and the Vacaville Heritage Council and Solano County Genealogical
Society, both of which currently occupy the Old Town Hall). Refer to Appendix B (Table B-1) for
a detailed list of parcels within the master plan area. The list includes APNs, acreage, realistic
capacities, existing uses, and ownership information.
It is unlikely that many non-residential buildings within the downtown area of Vacaville will be
demolished and replaced with mixed-use buildings, or that residential units will be constructed
on top of existing non-residential units during the timeframe of this housing element. Therefore,
for the purpose of the land use inventory, only the properties permitted to have standalone
multi-family buildings and that have development potential during the timeframe of this housing
element were included. Freestanding townhouse, condominium, and apartment development, or
attached multi-family development as part of a mixed-use project, are allowed in separate
buildings east of Wilson Street and Andrews Park between East Monte Vista Avenue and
Mason Street. Future freestanding residential buildings are subject to the approval of a planned
development or design review.

At the time the Opportunity Hill Master Plan and Design Guidelines document (shown in
Appendix B) was adopted, the former City of Vacaville Redevelopment Agency and the City of
Vacaville, hereby collectively referred to as “the City,” had acquired approximately 5 acres of
land within the Opportunity Hill Master Plan area where freestanding residential buildings are
permitted. The majority of City owned properties are located on three of the six blocks forming
the Opportunity Hill Master Plan Area. Referring to the County Assessor’s parcel map books,
the City owns 2.82 acres of adjoining property on block 130-123. On block 130-203, the City
owns 2.54 acres of contiguous property. All City owned properties are vacant. Previous uses
were demolished and removed.
Recommended development patterns for the Master Plan area include high-density residential
(up to 65 units per acre) on the City owned Opportunity Hill Site with ground floor
commercial/retail along Main Street. The Depot Site is envisioned as high-density residential (up
to 65 units per acre) with ground floor commercial/retail uses facing McClellan Street.
This project will be an infill project. Infill residential projects are subject to the Infill Standards for
Residential Development, which require infill projects to be compatible in design to adjoining
residential uses. However, the Master Plan includes design guidelines that deviate from the
City’s standard residential design guidelines. The purpose of these guidelines is to maintain
downtown Vacaville’s historic character while providing mixed-use and high-density residential
uses. Having adopted design guidelines will assist developers on getting all required
entitlements in an expedited timeframe, while ensuring that downtown maintains a cohesive
aesthetic. Many of the design requirements were adopted as development incentives. A
description of all the various design requirements is provided in the Master Plan document
attached in Appendix B.
In order to facilitate the implementation of the Opportunity Hill Master Plan and Design
Guidelines, a General Plan and Zoning Ordinance amendment will be necessary to allow for the
land uses recommended in the Master Plan (mixed-use/65 dwelling units per acre residential) in
the project area. Program H.1 - I 13 will implement the Opportunity Hill Master Plan by
identifying lands to be rezoned and require a General Plan Amendment to permit up to 65
dwelling units per acre. In addition, the City is currently updating its General Plan. The Adopted
General Plan includes an action (Action LU-A16.4) in the Land Use Element that directs the City
to amend the Residential Urban High Density Overlay on the Opportunity Hill and Depot Street
sites to allow up to 65 dwelling units per acre.
The current RUHD overlay district density range is 20.1 to 36 units per acre. The minimum
density for this overlay district is not proposed to change. By maintaining the minimum default
density for suburban communities identified by HCD, the City can include properties within this
boundary in its inventory of residential sites for lower income households.
Lot Consolidation
The City has a long history of successfully facilitating lot consolidation for the purposes of
accommodating high-density residential rehabilitation and new construction development,
affordable to lower-income households. For example, the City has assisted both a local non-
profit housing corporation, Vacaville Community Housing (VCH) and a private developer, Bay
Development, Inc. (Bay) in the acquisition and rehabilitation of 544 poorly managed,
substandard apartments formerly owned by a patchwork of ownership as shown in Table 48.

The City collaborated with VCH during 1991-2007 to facilitate and accomplish the acquisition of
65 separate parcels from 38 separate owners, which would be operated and managed as
affordable housing. The City and the Agency also participated by providing the funding
mechanisms for the property acquisitions and to rehabilitate the 387 total VCH-owned units.
Funding sources included the City’s Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME), the
Agency’s Low-Income Housing Set-Aside Funds (LIHF), and Agency tax-exempt bonds to
provide loans to the project. This consolidation has resulted in a cohesive neighborhood of
housing that is affordable to households with incomes at or below 60 percent of the area median
income, 50 percent of the area median income, and 30 units restricted to households with
incomes below 30 percent of the area median income. These units will continue to be affordable
until the year 2065 as required by recorded covenants.
During 1998-2005, the private developer, Bay, formed a partnership with VCH. In partnership
with the City and Agency, the partnership acquired and conducted rehabilitation of 157 units
located on 42 separate parcels, previously owned by 15 separate owners, to be operated and
managed as affordable housing. In addition to funding sources secured by the developer which
included private loans, owner contributions, tax credits, and tax exempt bonds, the City’s HOME
Program and the Agency’s LIH Set-Aside funds were used to provide loans to the project. As
with VCH projects above, this consolidation resulted in a cohesive neighborhood of housing that
is affordable to households with incomes at or below 60 percent and 50 percent of the area
median income. The affordability requirements for these units will be in effect for 20 years from
the date of occupancy.
The Agency also has experience with lot consolidation for the purpose of new construction of
affordable housing. In 2001, the City and Agency collaborated with the Bay/VCH partnership to
construct a new multi-family affordable housing complex. The complex was constructed on an
8.29-acre site that was created by consolidating and rezoning 12 separate parcels. The Agency
purchased four lots comprising approximately three acres and Bay purchased the remaining
                                City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

lots. In addition to private financing that was contributed to the project, the City and Agency
provided construction loan financing to the developer using its HOME and LIHF Set Aside.
Rents are restricted until the year 2023 to households with incomes at or below 60 percent of
the area median income and 50 percent of the area median income.
Additional lot consolidation efforts for acquisition and rehabilitation for affordable housing
purposes is demonstrated by the Agency’s latest acquisition. In 2007, using Agency Low
Income Housing Set-Aside funds and taxable bonds monies, the City of Vacaville
Redevelopment Agency acquired several market-rate multi-family residential complexes along
Callen Street: 18 four-plexes, three duplexes, and one eight-plex, totaling 86 units. The goal of
these acquisitions is to substantially rehabilitate/demolish and newly construct these units for
the purpose of providing affordable housing. The outcome will be the revitalization of the
neighborhood in which they are located. (For additional information about the Callen Street
Rehabilitation Project, see Section 6.3 of this document.)
Feasibility Study
A number of development scenarios were studied for the City-owned Opportunity Hill and Depot
Street projects (see Section 4.4-2, “Opportunity Hill Project” and Section 4.4-3, “Depot Street
Project” of the Master Plan). Although current residential market conditions in Vacaville favor the
less dense townhome project scenarios, the goals and objectives of this Master Plan are best
supported by the higher density project scenarios for the Opportunity Hill and Depot Street sites.
The City can take several actions to help encourage higher density residential development in
the Opportunity Hill area. Recommended strategic actions are described in Section 4.4-4,
“Summary of Findings” and Section 4.5, “Supporting Strategies” of the Master Plan. In addition,
the Agency will utilize various methods available to solicit development proposals for the
Opportunity Hill and Depot Street projects and/or portions of the projects that will support the
goals and objectives of this Master Plan. The developer(s) and/or project(s) that provide the
best quality development and fit for the Opportunity Hill area, consistent with this Master Plan
and any other City requirements and conditions will be analyzed.
A project feasibility analysis for the Opportunity Hill and Depot Street projects analyzed three
development scenarios created for each site. These land use scenarios represent a range of
residential densities, commercial, and parking assumptions. The development feasibility
analysis makes assumptions about anticipated construction, legal, financing, architecture, and
engineering costs; property taxes; government fees; and other overhead costs for developers.
The assumptions about development costs are based on the experiences of developers actively
building in Solano, Sacramento, and Yolo Counties. The cost data are also based on the 2007
R.S. Mean Square Foot Construction Costs Manual, which estimates construction costs by type
and region. Beyond construction costs, prevailing financing rates, property taxes, and estimated
government fees were also determined by contacting local lenders, planners, and brokers.
The analysis assumed that 20 percent of new housing units would be sold to low- and
moderate-income households. Half of these units, or 10 percent of the total units, would be sold
to low-income households and the remainder would be sold to moderate-income households. In
many of the higher density scenarios, the calculated price of moderate-income affordable
housing is only slightly lower than the market price. Reducing unit sizes only slightly would
make many of the market-rate two-bedroom units affordable to moderate-income households.
This would allow some units to be sold without resale restrictions or agency oversight.

6. ABILITY TO MEET HOUSING NEEDS
The feasibility study concluded that although the current housing prices and construction costs
in Vacaville favor medium-density townhomes in the downtown area, the City supports the
development of higher density scenarios that inject more pedestrian and retail activity into the
area. A higher density housing development component is also supported due to the use of Low
Income Set Aside Funds for acquisition of many properties in the Opportunity Hill area. The
higher density will help ensure that the affordability requirements of these Set Aside Funds are
met and/or the Fund is reimbursed. Under current market conditions, higher density mixed-use
construction is not economically feasible because the higher construction costs cannot be offset
by sale (or rental) prices. The land inventory focuses on stand-alone high-density buildings, and
does not include mixed-use construction.
Availability of Regulatory and/or Other Incentives
The Master Plan represents the first step in the revitalization of the Opportunity Hill area. The
Master Plan sets forth a set of actions that serve as a focus for continued efforts toward
downtown revitalization. It also provides a framework for priority actions and future
implementation efforts. As each priority action item is implemented, the Agency can move
forward to review additional opportunity sites and steps to advance its downtown revitalization
efforts.
The following is a partial list of objectives identified in the Master Plan. These objectives provide
the guiding framework and are associated with a number of strategies and implementation
actions, as described in Chapter 4, “Strategy for Downtown Development,” and Chapter 5,
“Implementation,” of the Master Plan (attached in Appendix B).
1. Provide opportunities for new high-density affordable housing within the downtown area.
2. Allow an increased density of up to 65 units per acre in the Opportunity Hill area, compared to
   the maximum 36 units per acre currently allowed by the City in the RUHD overlay district.
3. Complete studies and improvements to the Opportunity Hill area infrastructure systems to
   adequately serve the full buildout of the Opportunity Hill area, consistent with the zoning
   change recommendations of this Master Plan.
4. Ensure adequate and convenient parking for new uses that is easily accessible, highly visible,
   and that supports a sense of personal security and safety.
A major goal of the City is to encourage the development of housing to meet the needs of
residents at all income levels and abilities, including public employees, retail workers, active
adults, and persons with disabilities.
In addition to the identifying objectives, the Master Plan recommends several implementation
steps. One suggested implementation task is to determine the best methods to solicit
development proposals from qualified parties or entities to develop the area in different phases
by various developers. This process may involve the City initiating negotiations with individual
developers or conducting a Request for Proposal/Qualifications process as needed. Other
identified implementation priorities identified in the Master Plan include:
1. Develop opportunity sites through solicitation of development proposals.
2. Initiate General Plan amendments and zoning changes to implement the land uses and
    design guidelines recommended in the Master Plan.

3. Complete the infrastructure system plans and improvements to serve the build-out of the
     Opportunity Hill area.
4. Amend the downtown parking zoning ordinances to:
     • expand the downtown parking district that includes the Opportunity Hill area,
     • reduce the number of podium parking spaces required for small residential units between
       650 and 1,050 square feet, and
     • allow on-street parking to count toward commercial parking requirements.
5. Work with the owners of the adjacent opportunity sites in the downtown area to develop
     those sites, including:
     • the proposed mixed-use project at Wilson and Main Streets, and
     • the site located at McClellan and School Streets owned by the Vacaville School District.
Approval of the Master Plan established a project description that would be used for the
purpose of preparing General Plan and Zoning Ordinance amendments for adoption. The action
strategies proposed in this document would initiate City activities that would be brought back to
Planning Commission and City Council for specific adopting actions, including revising the
General Plan to allow higher density residential development and incorporating design
standards into existing zoning categories where appropriate to facilitate development of new
projects. The action steps would also include amending City requirements for parking (parking
standards and/or potential revisions to the adopted Downtown Parking District), preparing City
capital improvement projects for adoption (utility infrastructure, streetscape/landscape
improvements, etc.) and other City projects that would accomplish the action strategies in the
Plan.
Further, staff will be analyzing other implementation strategies identified in the Plan
(infrastructure and parking improvements, public and private financing strategies, improving
pedestrian linkages and connections, and improving signage and wayfinding) in order to
develop recommendations for timelines to complete action items to further facilitate revitalization
of the Opportunity Hill area.
Implementation Financing Tools
Potential funding sources are key components for the implementation of a successful Master
Plan. The following list identifies potential funding sources that may be available or pursued in
implementing the Opportunity Hill Master Plan:
•    Special Assessment District
•    Mello-Roos Community Facilities District
•    Regional, State, and Federal Funding Sources
•    Transportation Development Act
•    Regional Transportation Improvement Program
•    Livable Communities Initiative
•    The Brownfield Economic Development Incentive
•    Vacaville’s Downtown Loan Program
A description of each of these potential financing tools is provided in the Master Plan included in
Appendix B.

Priority Development Area
In November 2008, the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) approved the Downtown
Vacaville Area as a Priority Development Area (PDA), and it is so designated under Plan Bay
Area, the Bay Area’s Sustainable Communities Strategy, created as part of the Bay Area’s
Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) in response to Senate Bill (SB) 375 (the Sustainable
Communities and Climate Protection Act). Plan Bay Area sets a development pattern for the
region, which, when integrated with the transportation network and other transportation
measures and policies, would reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cars and light
trucks, beyond the per capita reduction targets identified by the California Air Resources Board
(CARB). Part of the Plan’s strategy is to direct over two-thirds of all regional growth to the PDAs.
PDAs are infill opportunity areas where the community has committed to developing housing,
amenities, and services in pedestrian-friendly areas served by transit. They are eligible for grant
funds to assist with the costs of planning, infrastructure improvements, and construction.
6.3      SUBSTANTIALLY REHABILITATED UNITS
Government Code Section 65583.1(c) permits jurisdictions to rely on existing units to fulfill up to
25 percent of their residential sites requirement (RHNA) in the Housing Element, pursuant to
specified criteria. The following activities may be eligible:
•   Substantial rehabilitation of substandard rental housing.
•   Conversion of multi-family rental units from non-affordable to affordable.
•   Preservation of at-risk housing.
To qualify, a community must include a housing program committing the local government to
provide units in that income category within the city or county that will be made available
through the provision of committed assistance during the planning period covered by the
element to low- and very low income households at affordable housing costs or affordable rents.
Two rehabilitation projects are described below and demonstrate the City’s progress in
rehabilitating affordable units in the city.
Callen Street Rehabilitation Project
In 2006, using Redevelopment Agency Low Income Housing Set-Aside funds and taxable
bonds monies in the amount of $18 million, the City of Vacaville Redevelopment Agency
acquired market-rate multi-family residential complexes along Callen Street, Bennett Hill Drive,
and Bennett Hill Court: 18 four-plexes, three duplexes, and one eight-plex. These properties,
shown in Figure 2, were retained by the City, as Housing Successor Agency following the
dissolution of redevelopment agencies in 2012. Figure 2 illustrates the location of this project,
and Table 49 identifies the 66 units for Phase Two that are included in the housing sites
inventory for this project.
The overall Callen Street project consists of two phases of acquisition and rehabilitation/new
construction activity in the Callen Street area resulting in the creation of 118 new affordable
rental units. In 2013, the first phase of the Callen Street Rehabilitation development project was
approved. This phase of the project consists of the acquisition and rehabilitation of 52 affordable
rental units on Bennett Hill Drive/Court. Rehabilitation of all 52 units creates permanently
affordable housing for households making less than 60 percent of the area median income. Of
these units, five units are affordable to extremely low-income households.

In 2014, the second phase of the Callen Street Rehabilitation development project was
approved. This phase of the project consists of the acquisition and rehabilitation of 66 rental
units in the Callen Street Area. Rehabilitation of all 66 units creates new permanently affordable
housing for households earning less than 60 percent of the area median income.
Phase One of the Callen Street Rehabilitation Project is not being counted towards the RHNA
due to the timing of financial commitments for the project. Pursuant to Section of 65583.1(2)(B)
of the Government Code, the City is counting the substantial rehabilitation of the 66 units within
Phase Two of the Callen Street Rehabilitation project as new construction to help meet the
RHNA numbers for lower income households. Table 50 lists the State requirements that must
be met in order to count substantially rehabilitated units towards the City’s fair share of housing
needs (RHNA) as it applies to Phase Two of the Callen Street Rehabilitation project.

In 2006, using Redevelopment Agency Low Income Housing Set-Aside funds and taxable

6. ABILITY TO MEET HOUSING NEEDS
following the dissolution of redevelopment agencies in 2012. The properties located within
Phase II of the Callen Street Rehabilitation Project were not obtained by eminent domain, and
the acquired units were previously market rate units.
On April 13, 2013, the Department of Finance (DOF) authorized the Housing Successor Agency
to access $6,200,000 of the 2006 Affordable Housing Bond proceeds for the purpose of
developing affordable housing. Staff reinitiated negotiations with CFY Development, Inc. (CFY)
and Vacaville Community Housing (VCH) who proposed a two-phase project to complete the
acquisition and rehabilitation/new construction of 130 affordable apartments in the Callen
Street/Bennett Hill area. On July 9, 2013, the City Council approved a Disposition,
Development, and Loan Agreement (DDLA) for Phase I securing a $4,355,639 City
commitment, and an Exclusive Negotiating Rights Agreement for Phase II with the partnership.
On August 12, 2014, the City of Vacaville approved the Disposition, Development and Loan
Agreement between the City of Vacaville and Callen Street Investors, L.P. (the legal partnership
of CYA and VCH) for Phase II of the Callen Street project committing an additional $6,905,000.
As previously noted, Phase II of the project consists of acquiring 18 Housing Successor owned
parcels on Callen Street to be rehabilitated and/or demolished/rebuilt to create permanently
affordable rental housing and the construction of a community room for neighborhood activities.
The affordability levels of the 66 the rehabilitated and rebuilt units are as follows:
•    4 @ 30% of AMI ($23,000 per year for family of 4)
•    16 @ 50% of AMI ($38,350 per year for family of 4)
•    45 @ 60% of AMI ($46,020 per year for family of 4)
•    1 Manager’s unit/office and community room
As stated in the DDLA, these units must remain affordable for 55 years and participate in the
Crime-Free Housing Program, including the Crime Prevention through Environmental Design
component of the Program.
Consistent with AB 720, City committed financial assistance to the project for the purpose of
converting market rate rental units to affordable units within the 5th RHNA projection period. This
financial assistance was committed through the aforementioned Disposition, Development and
Loan Agreement between the City of Vacaville and Callen Street Investors, L.P. Phase II of the
Callen Street Rehabilitation project meets the State’s definition conversion, and results in a net
increase of 66 affordable units.
Meadows Court Rehabilitation Project
In October 2014, as Housing Successor to the Vacaville Redevelopment Agency, the City
entered into a Disposition, Development, and Loan Agreement with Community Development
Partners in partnership with Vacaville Community Housing as Trower Partners to substantially
rehabilitate 51 two-bedroom apartments on Meadows Court, shown in Figure 3. In combination
with the partner project, the Rocky Hill Markham Area Apartments (identified under Sites for
Lower-Income Housing as Site #10) will provide eight units affordable to households with
extremely low incomes, 19 units to households with very low incomes, and 63 units to
households with low incomes, for a period of 55 years. The Meadows Court Rehabilitation
project is not being counted towards the RHNA because these units were designated as
affordable housing units in 2005. This project consists of rehabilitating and preserving existing
affordable housing units.

6.4      SECONDARY LIVING UNITS
The passage of AB 1866 (effective July 2003) requires local governments to use a ministerial
process for secondary living unit applications. This legislation intends to facilitate the production
of affordable housing for people including, but not limited to, students, the elderly, in-home
health care providers, the disabled, and others, at below market prices within existing
neighborhoods. Consistent with AB 1866, the City permits second units by right in all single-
family residential zones. However, permit approval is subject to a planning staff level review of
the site and building plans to ensure compliance with height, setbacks, maximum floor area, and
parking requirements. Depending on workload, the administrative plan check process can be
completed within four weeks.
The development standards for secondary living units are as follows:
A. The lot shall contain an existing, detached single-family residence.
B. Either the primary dwelling or the secondary living unit shall be occupied by the owner of the
    residential lot. If neither of the units are occupied by the property owner, the approval of the
    secondary living unit shall terminate immediately and the unit shall not be rented, leased, or
    occupied as a separate dwelling. A document, in a form acceptable to the Director, shall be
    recorded prior to the issuance of any building permits for the secondary living unit which
    specifies the owner occupancy requirement.
C. The residential lot on which a secondary living unit has been constructed cannot be
    subdivided to create separate ownership for the primary dwelling or the secondary living
    unit.
D. An existing garage may not be converted for the purposes of constructing a secondary living
    unit.
E. Secondary living units shall have only one bedroom, and be limited in size based on the
    following:
    1. For units attached to the primary dwelling unit, the secondary living unit shall not exceed
        50 percent of the living area of the primary dwelling or 800 square feet, whichever is less;
    2. For units detached from the primary dwelling unit, the secondary living unit shall not
        exceed 50 percent of the living area of the primary dwelling unit or 1,200 square feet,
        whichever is less;
    3. Regardless of the size of the primary dwelling unit, no secondary unit shall be
        constructed which is less than 150 square feet.
F. The design of the secondary living unit shall be architecturally integrated with the design of
    the primary dwelling and with the general neighborhood area by utilizing similar exterior
    materials and design features and may be subject to Design Review as determined by the

     additional paving within the front yard area. No additional driveways shall be permitted,
     except for corner lots.
In Vacaville, secondary living units are permitted in all residential zoning districts with the
exception of the MHP zoning designation. However, they are prohibited on lots containing a
guesthouse, converted garage, or more than one existing single-family residence. The Land
Use and Development Code dictates specific development standards regarding building size,
parking, setbacks, and lot coverage. These development requirements can be found in Chapter
14.09.122, Land Use Permits and Approvals, Secondary Living Units, of the Land Use and
Development Code. While the City’s development requirements for secondary living units are
constraints that may limit the number and size of second units constructed in the City, they are
fully compliant with the law expressed in AB 1866.
A check of City building permit records dating back to 2000 indicates that three to five building
permits for secondary living units were typically issued annually, not including the second
dwelling units constructed in the Southtown residential project. The Southtown residential
project has a Development Agreement and Planned Development that requires that second
dwelling units be constructed on the larger lots within the subdivision. Second dwelling units
were approved on 39 lots. This constitutes approximately 20 percent of the total number of units
in Southtown phases 1 and 1A. Between 2006 and 2009, 13 of the approved second dwelling
units were constructed. Additional second dwelling units may be required in subsequent phases
of development.
Although the recent recession has affected the number of secondary living units the City has
issued permits for, the City has a long-standing history of issuing three to five permits for
secondary living units annually. Considering the requirement for second dwelling units in the
Southtown residential project and the number of second dwelling units constructed annually in
past years, in concert with local housing needs and development trends and adoption of new
incentives, the City is projecting that 21 secondary units will be approved and constructed
during the current planning period. As provided for in Government Code Section 65583.1, the
City has applied 21 secondary living units towards its adequate sites requirement (see Table
44).
6.5      POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT CONSTRAINTS
Sites identified for residential development in the Land Inventory were analyzed to determine
their relationship to public facilities, services, and existing or potential physical constraints to
potential development. The short- and long-term development viability of the vacant and
underutilized sites in the inventory is directly linked to the availability and capacity of public
facilities and services. Total capacity for water and sewer facilities to accommodate the City’s
share of the regional housing need is addressed in the 2007 Infrastructure, Facilities, and
Services Status Report and in the 2004 Municipal Service Review / Comprehensive Annexation
Plan.
Infrastructure, Facilities, and Services Status Report (2007)
The Infrastructure, Facilities, and Services Status Report is prepared at the direction of the City
Council pursuant to the Planned Growth Ordinance (PGO), which is contained within Division
14.05 - Planned Growth of the Land Use & Development Code. The report evaluates the
existing levels and capacities of public services, facilities, and infrastructure and the ability of
planned services, facilities, and infrastructure to support potential levels of construction during

the next five years. The report is informational and used as a part of the decision-making
process by the City Council regarding making determinations for allocations and phasing plans
per the provisions of the PGO. Due to the depressed economy, adequate public facilities,
services, and infrastructure remain available to serve the current inventory of new residential
allocations, as described in the 2007 Report. Therefore, the City Council has deferred preparing
a new report, and the 2007 Report is considered current. The next report will be created
following adoption of the General Plan Update, tentatively scheduled to occur in early- to mid-
2015.
This report examines the following specific areas: transportation facilities, water supply and
water distribution facilities, wastewater treatment capacity, drainage and flood control facilities,
fire services, police services, and review of City’s housing mix compared to General Plan goals.
Transportation Facilities – The Transportation analysis identifies three intersections currently
operating at LOS D or below and 20 intersections which have the potential to operate at LOS D
or below within five years. Mitigation measures and potential improvements to achieve
acceptable levels of service are identified for each intersection. The City has completed capital
improvements to the Hume/Davis intersection and Davis Street south of Hume Way, improving
the operating LOS in this area. Other near-term priorities for capital projects include interim and
long-term improvements at the Vaca Valley Parkway/Interstate 505 intersection and the
construction of the California Drive overcrossing.
Water Supply and Treatment – The City has ample water supplies to serve the existing and
projected growth for the next five years. The City’s Water Supply Assessment was prepared to
document adequate water supply to serve 20 years of projected growth. Existing and planned
water treatment facilities and reservoirs have capacity to serve existing and planned growth.
Wastewater Treatment Facilities – The Easterly Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) has
capacity for 15 million gallons per day. As flows continue to increase in the future, the City will
set priorities for use of available plant capacity through the Easterly Wastewater Treatment
Allocation Plan, which is reviewed periodically as a part of this report. Existing treatment plant
capacity is adequate to accommodate planned residential, commercial, and industrial growth.
Drainage and Flood Control Capacity – The City of Vacaville has historically experienced
urban flooding within the urban reaches along Alamo and Ulatis Creeks. During the December
2002 and December 2005 storms, Alamo Creek overtopped its banks and flooded established
neighborhoods within the City. The Peabody/Tulare area, the Southwood area located west of
Peabody Road, and the area along North Alamo Drive all experienced significant flooding during
the December 2005 flood event when waters reached several feet in depth and caused millions
of dollars in property damage.
The City has conducted several studies to identify effective mechanisms for reducing flooding in
the City’s urban areas. Based on these studies, the City has completed the following projects to
reduce flood risk within the City of Vacaville:
•    High flow by-pass channel along Alamo Creek: Designed to lower water surface elevations
     during storms with a return frequency of less than 10 years.
•    Detention basin near Southwood Park: Designed to mitigate for increased flows resulting
     from development within the Alamo Creek Watershed.

•   Detention basin off Laguna Creek: Designed to reduce peak flows in Alamo Creek during
    10-year storm events.
Although the projects listed above have aided in reducing flooding during small storm events,
they did not provide significant relief during moderate to large storm events. In recognition of
this problem, the Solano County Water Agency (SCWA) initiated the Ulatis System Drainage
Study (USDS), which updated the hydrologic and hydraulic modeling of the Ulatis Creek system
and modeled flooding based on the December 2002 and December 2005 storms. This study
identified and evaluated flood control improvements, including the effectiveness of regional
detention basins located upstream of the City. In 2009, two storm water detention basins
adjacent to Encinosa Creek were constructed on City-owned property located in an
unincorporated portion of Solano County adjacent to the western limits of the City. The purpose
of the proposed project was to increase the detention capacity along the creek systems that
convey storm water runoff through the City of Vacaville, thus reducing the flooding potential.
Fire Services – The Fire Department is implementing the following programs to assist in
meeting response time goals:
A. Opticom has been installed along the Alamo Drive corridor to reduce travel time to
    emergencies in south Vacaville and Lagoon Valley
B. Installation of a pre-alert system in all new fire stations to reduce response times to
    emergencies; retrofitting of existing fire stations with a pre-alert system in phases, beginning
    with Station 71.
C. Developer-funded construction of additional fire stations for new development. Station 75,
    located within the Southtown development, is currently in design phase, with construction
    scheduled to occur in 2015.
D. Funding for on-going fire services for new development through public safety Community
    Facilities Districts. The City has adopted Community Facility Districts 10 – Cheyenne at
    Brown’s Valley CFD, 11 – Southtown CFD, and 12 – Infill CFD to help fund fire and police
    services.
Police Services – The Police Department meets performance goals for traffic enforcement and
response times for Priority 2 calls. Average response time for Priority 1 calls is 6 minutes and 22
seconds, longer than the 6 minute goal. Funding of on-going police services for new residential
development through public safety Community Facilities Districts will assist in achieving this
goal. The average clearance rates for violent crimes and property crimes exceed the national
average but are somewhat lower than the Vacaville established benchmark.
In addition, the Crime Free Multi-Housing Program, the revised alarm ordinance, the community
safety ordinance, citywide sweeps, and the addition of a second crime suppression team (CST)
should have an impact on improving Priority 1 call response times and reducing calls for
service.
Housing Mix Review – As of June 1, 2012, the City’s housing mix was 61 percent low-density
residential, 18 percent moderate-density residential, and 21 percent high-density residential. At
buildout of the 1990 General Plan, the housing mix is projected at 60 percent low-density
residential, 18 percent moderate-density residential, and 22 percent high-density residential.
These numbers include the ultimate density buildout of underutilized residential high-density
sites. The buildout of the General Plan housing percentages are consistent with General Plan

policies requiring an approximate housing mix of 60 percent single family, 20 percent moderate
density and 20 percent apartments.
Noise – The General Plan identifies the most significant source of noise in Vacaville as
Interstate 80, running northeast/southwest through the center of the city. Noise from the freeway
is pervasive and is generally the dominant noise source within 1/2 mile of its location.
Secondary sources of noise in the community include Interstate 505 and local arterial streets.
Aircraft using the Nut Tree Airport are a source of noise to the undeveloped and industrial
properties near the ends of the runway. Likewise, trains on the Southern Pacific railway east of
Vacaville generate noise that will affect future residences in the south and southeast planning
sectors (General Plan Figure 1-1). The trains will not produce a constant, daily noise impact, as
they will pass this area infrequently throughout the day; however, they will produce peak noise
events with each passing. It should also be noted that rail traffic may increase in the coming
years with an anticipated emphasis on passenger rail for vehicle trip reduction purposes.
Municipal Service Review
The City’s Municipal Service Review (MSR) was updated in 2014, and finds that Vacaville is in a
position to accommodate its previous levels of growth because developable land is available at
reasonable prices compared to the Bay Area, and public services and facilities are available or
planned with known financing mechanisms to serve anticipated growth. Although the following
factors may act as constraints to development, the City has adequate infrastructure capacity
and/or is implementing measures to provide adequate capacity:
•   The City’s fire response time standard of 7 minutes 90 percent of the time is not met in new
    partially built out areas. However, a new fire station, Station 75, is planned to serve Vanden
    Meadows and Southtown to help meet response standards in those areas.
•   New residential developments are required to include acreage for new parks through
    Development Agreements. The City is considering updating the Park Development Impact
    Fee, creating a citywide park and facility tax, operating on a “pay-to-play” basis for
    programs, and reevaluating shared cost contracts in the City’s General Plan Update.
•   The City anticipates completion by 2015 of improvements to wastewater collection system
    facilities that are expected to approach or reach capacity within five years.
•   New streets are installed at the expense of developers with new construction, as conditions
    of approval for development for direct impacts.

CHAPTER 7
CONSTRAINTS ON THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING
Section 65583(a)(5) of the California Government Code requires analysis of potential and actual
governmental and non-governmental "constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, or
development of housing for all income levels." This section describes those constraints, and
Section 6 includes policies relevant to the reduction or elimination of the constraints identified.
7.1      GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING
Land Use Controls and Growth Management
The City implements the General Plan’s land use policies through its Land Use & Development
Code and zoning map as well as policy plans, and redevelopment plans. Vacaville’s General
Plan contains policies that emphasize maintaining Vacaville's single-family environment while
encouraging a mix of housing types in new projects and coordinating the approval of such
projects with the availability of needed infrastructure.
Two City land use actions could potentially be considered restraints in that they seek to control,
beyond the extent of usual land use and zoning measures, the type and amount of residential
growth.
Housing Mix Policy (Land Use Element Policy 2.5 - G 2)
The first potential restraint measure is the General Plan housing mix policy, which specifies that
there should be the following “approximate” housing mix:
1. 60 percent standard single-family-detached units;
2. 20 percent moderate density units (zero-lot-line single-family units, mobile homes, duplexes,
    triplexes and townhouses); and
3. 20 percent apartment-type units (garden apartments, condominiums).
As part of the General Plan Update, to be completed in 2015, the City of Vacaville is considering
replacing the housing mix targets above with the following approximate housing mix:
1. 75 percent single-family housing.
2. 25 percent multi-family attached housing.
The current and proposed policy provides a broad goal for residential development but is not
itself a constraint to the development of affordable housing. A test to determine whether this
policy is a constraint is whether it is determined that there is an inadequate inventory of lands to
meet the City’s share of the regional housing need, especially for low and very-low income
units. Another factor in determining whether it has been a constraint is whether there has
actually been construction of affordable units.

                                                  Page 117

7. Constraints on the Production of Housing
Multifamily development is very cyclical. During much of 1990s, there was little multifamily
construction because of private market constraints such as tax laws, availability of financing,
stagnant rents and stable vacancy rates. These constraints, in concert with perceived local
governmental constraints, have been the primary factors that have limited multifamily
construction during the past decade. In the early 2000s, the private market experienced a
renewed interest in developing new multifamily units. This renewed interest was limited to a few
short years due to the historically low interest rates, which drove the need for more single-family
developments. As shown in Chapter 6, “Ability to Meet Housing Needs,” there is more than an
adequate inventory of lands, including for apartments, to satisfy Vacaville’s housing need.
Planned Growth Ordinance
The second potential restraint measure is the City’s Planned Growth Ordinance (PGO), adopted
in 1991 and revised in 2000. The PGO was originally adopted following rapid residential growth
that occurred in the 1990s. As a result of the rapid growth, water, sewer, streets, and schools
were operating at or beyond capacity. The PGO is structured to ensure that new residential
development has adequate infrastructure and public services in place to serve the new housing
units and future residents.
The PGO, as amended in 2000, is based upon maintaining an inventory of 1,000 units within
approved and unbuilt projects which have building permit allocations and are eligible to be
issued building permits at any time. This actually allows a growth rate much higher than
required by the housing need assigned for Vacaville. Vacaville’s housing need for the 2015-
2023 planning period is 1,084 units, which is 136 units per year over the 8-year timeframe of the
Housing Element.
There is a process set forth in the PGO regarding the allocation process. As the inventory falls
below 1,000 units, new projects are added to the inventory when a Final Map is recorded or, for
multifamily projects, when the City Council approves an allocation following the approval of a
Planned Development. When the inventory exceeds 1,000 units, the City Council has the
flexibility to grant additional allocations on a case-by-case basis, provided that municipal
infrastructure and services can accommodate the additional residential growth. In addition,
projects consisting entirely of affordable units for low and/or very low-income units are exempt
from the building permit allocation process and can proceed with building permit issuance at any
time after project approval. The ordinance also contains provisions that allow a project to be
granted allocations outside of the normal process if there is adequate public infrastructure and a
public benefit. The City Council has considered several requests for special allocations since
2000 and has never denied a request. Implementation of the PGO has been suspended since
2010 due to the low levels of residential development resulting from the economic recession,
and due to limited staff resources.
Nearly every year since the establishment of the PGO, the number of approved allocations or
the number of units eligible to build in a given year has exceeded the actual number of permits,
sometimes by as much as 100 percent. The PGO has had no impact on the timing of new
affordable residential development units because the ordinance permits these units to be
approved and constructed without any restrictions from the PGO.
Prior to amendment in 2000, the PGO required a builder to submit an annual request for
building permit allocations. The allocations request was accompanied by a fee that cost
approximately $150 per unit. A request had to be submitted by September in the prior year. It is
possible that this old process posed a constraint because a builder might have to wait a year in
                                 City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

order to request an allocation and there was an additional cost involved. There is no longer an
annual reservation process, thus this potential constraint has been removed.
Building Codes and Enforcement
The City of Vacaville implements the California Building Code. While building code requirements
have, over the years, greatly improved the safety and energy efficiency of homes, it is
undeniable that modern codes require the construction of more costly dwelling units than codes
used twenty, thirty, or forty years ago. The City considers the Building Code a “minimum”
standard for building construction. While it may lead to increased costs of construction, reducing
building code requirements may lead to long-term health and safety risks, particularly in a
seismically active area like Vacaville.
The Fire Department Code Enforcement Division works closely with all City departments in
order to resolve health, safety, and public nuisance problems that adversely affect the quality of
life for Vacaville residents. Code Compliance enforces the City of Vacaville Municipal Code as it
applies to property maintenance, property nuisances, and other violations in residential and
commercial districts.
Health and Safety Code 17980(b)(2) requires local governments to give consideration to the
needs for housing as expressed in the Housing Element when deciding whether to require
vacation of a substandard building or to repair as necessary. The City gives preference to the
repair of the building over condemning it, whenever the repairs are economically feasible.
Development Fees
The justification for requiring buyers of new homes to pay through their mortgages for the partial
cost of parks, schools, arterial streets, and other infrastructure that in the pre-Proposition 13
period was financed by taxes and assessments is widely debated. Where the land supply is
constricted, fees are not compensated by lower raw land values as economic theory would
suggest. Because virtually all jurisdictions have somewhat similar fee packages, it can be
argued that housing prices in a metropolitan area include an "average fee" component whether
the amount is collected by local governments or not. Fees saved that can effectively be included
in sales prices are a windfall to the seller of a house built prior to enactment of fee requirements,
or to the land seller or builder of house. The residential housing market impacts sales prices for
new homes to a much greater degree than development fees.
In 1992, as required by State law (Assembly Bill 1600), Vacaville completed a comprehensive
development impact fee study. Through this study, the costs for infrastructure needed to serve
future growth were identified and the fees were adopted based upon future growth projections,
infrastructure needs and infrastructure costs. It is expected that the fee study will be updated
within the next two years.
Vacaville’s development fees are comparable to other cities with needs to build infrastructure to
serve future development. As of July 2013, typical fees for single-family units range from
$31,261 to $35,224 for dwellings between 1,000 and 1,400 square feet, and $33,673 to $37,645
for dwellings between 1,600 and 2000 square feet. Fees for a typical 2,500-square-foot home
are between $36,481 and $38,245, fees for a typical 3,000-square-foot home are $38,841, and
fees for a 3,500 square foot home are $39,389. School impact fees and County fees are not
included in these estimates. Set by State law, the Vacaville Unified School District school
impact fee is $2.05 per square foot for residential development and $0.33 per square foot for
nonresidential development, while the Travis Unified School District school impact fees are

7. Constraints on the Production of Housing
$4.91 per square foot for residential development and $0.47 per square foot for nonresidential
development. This is actually about half of what was collected several years ago, because of
changes in State law that limit the amount that can be collected. However, in some instances,
developers have agreed to provide further mitigation where school impacts are not fully
mitigated by the standard fee.
Fees for apartments are significantly less than for single-family development. Estimated building
and development fees for the Quinn Crossing Project, a 222-unit standard apartment project,
averaged $20,170 per unit. This average includes the office, recreation building, and carports.
This project was exempt from the Community Facility District fee, which would have resulted in
an additional $600 per unit charged on an annual basis. See the next section for more
information about Community Facility Districts.
The cost of development fees is a necessary component of new construction. Without adequate
development impact fees, the City would be unable to serve future growth with adequate
municipal services. These fees can add considerably to the cost of residential development, but
these fees are necessary in order to provide municipal services and infrastructure for new
development. It should be noted that the City has no control over fees assessed by other local
agencies, such as the school districts or Solano County. In Vacaville, fees controlled by the City
make up less than 30 percent of the total fees charged to residential development.
Community Facility Districts for Police and Fire Services
The 2007-2009 Strategic Plan emphasizes the need to maintain and improve public safety for
the community. Historically, the City’s General Fund revenues have been used as the primary
source of funding for police and fire protection services. However, as City access to funding
sources has continued to decline due to State takeaways, the City has been tasked with the
need to establish new funding sources to continue to provide public safety services. The
formation of community facilities districts (“CFDs”) is a funding source that mitigates the added
cost of providing public safety services for new development and helps avoid any degradation of
public safety services to current residents.
Funding for public safety services is limited to general fund sources, and by law cannot be
supported by impact fees. Impact fees are one time charges tied to the issuance of building
permits and can only be used for capital improvements needed to mitigate the specific impacts
of development. Further, impact fees cannot be used for the ongoing costs associated with
staffing and related non-capital equipment. Because of this, the City has had to look to
generating other sources of recurring revenue for services and equipment associated with
supporting new development.
The City has been utilizing CFDs as a tool to assess new residential development for the direct
costs associated with police and fire services. Currently the City has 12 CFDs. Examples of
residential developments where CFDs have been approved are: Gentry-Meadowlands, North
Village, Southtown, Reynolds Ranch (Cheyenne), Lagoon Valley and Portofino. In newly
annexed areas, the participation in the CFD has been negotiated as a requirement in the
projects’ Development Agreements. These annexation areas and areas of future annexation are
not proposed to be a part of the proposed infill CFD, as the costs and issues associated with
such areas are different than infill areas already located within the City.
The City commissioned Bay Area Urban Economics (BAE) to analyze the impacts of CFDs on
apartment project feasibility. BAE found that the sample apartment project evaluated in the
                                City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

study was not feasible under current economic conditions. While the CFD requirement was
found to contribute to the project shortfall, 80 percent of the feasibility gap was found to be
related to other project costs or revenue shortfalls. Therefore, the CFD does represent a cost for
developers, and the CFD could be considered to be a constraint to development. To address
this potential constraint, the City has identified a new housing policy, Policy H.1 – I 23, that
states the City will conduct an affordable housing impact fee study that considers the
Community Facilities District fees for multi-family developments. The report prepared by BAE is
contained in Appendix C.
Local Development Standards
Development standards for Vacaville are set by the Land Use & Development Code and the
2013 California Building Code (CBC), as amended by the Vacaville Municipal Code, adopted in
2014. The ordinance includes these specific additions to the CBC: minimum requirements for
shaft enclosures in factory-built chimneys; information regarding the schedule of permit fees;
minimum Class B fire rating requirement for wood roofing and siding materials; concrete paving
requirements for driveways; and minimum requirements for the repair of structural elements.
None of these requirements constitute a significant constraint on housing development. In
adopting the 2013 California Building Code, the City amended its Municipal Code to remove
language regarding front door locking mechanisms that is not consistent with State standards; in
removing this language, the City reduced cost burdens for residential builders. A more detailed
discussion regarding zoning standards is provided below. In addition, Appendix A lists the
applicable sections from the Land Use & Development Code and other City documents. The
Land Use & Development Code was completed in 1998 and was written to provide flexibility in
applying standards to projects. Through a planned development, the Planning Commission has
the ability to permit flexibility in various standards including setbacks, building height,
landscaping, parking and design.
Analysis of Zoning District Standards
The Vacaville Land Use & Development Code has established seven categories of residential
zoning, all tied to General Plan density ranges. There are also two Overlay Districts related to
residential development. The Land Use & Development Code contains the development
standards for each district:
•   Rural Residential (RR): 0.4 to 1 unit per acre (2.5 to 10 acres)
•   Residential Estate (RE): 0.5 to 3 units per acre
•   Residential Low Density (RL): 3.1 to 5 units per acre
•   Residential Low-Medium Density (RLM): 5.1 to 8 units per acre
•   Residential Medium Density (RM): 8.1 to 14 units per acre
•   Residential High Density (RH): 14.1 to 24 units per acre
•   Residential Overlay District (RO): Commercial zoned parcels may be placed in this district,
    which permits densities allowed in the Medium and High Density districts
•   Residential Urban High Density Overlay District (RUHD): Parcels in the Downtown
    Commercial district may be placed in this district, which permits mixed use or residential

7. Constraints on the Production of Housing
Single-Family Residential Districts
Density ranges are further defined through specific lot size suffixes. For example, the
Residential Low Density (RL) districts permit minimum lot sizes of 5,000 square feet, 6,000
square feet, 8,000 square feet, and 10,000 square feet. The RLM, RE, and RR zones also have
similar suffixes. These districts primarily support single-family dwellings. The RM District is a
transitional district that supports small lot single-family, court homes, townhouses and attached
single-family. In some instances, the RM district can also support apartments. This is especially
true when the site has been granted a density bonus for providing affordable housing or housing
for seniors.
Single-family districts require front setbacks varying between 15 and 50 feet; side yards
between 0 and 30 feet; and rear yards between 15 and 40 feet. Maximum building heights are
between 30 and 40 feet. These zones require two enclosed parking spaces for each home.
Garage conversions are permitted, however the site must still be capable of accommodating on-
site parking spaces.
Multi-Family Residential Districts
The RM, RH, RO and RUHD Districts are intended for higher density multifamily development,
including rental apartments, condominiums, and mixed use. As previously discussed, the RM
district can also support multi-family construction.
The Residential Medium (RM) Density district provides for attached multi-family housing, such
as duplexes, townhouses, and apartments, as well as for single-family detached housing on
small lots. The allowed density ranges from 8.1 to 14.0 units per gross developable acre.
However, the density can be increased with the approval of a density bonus. As shown in
Table 51, Vacaville has had two apartment complexes constructed in RM zones with a density
bonus. The density bonus increased the permitted density from maximum 14 units per acre.

The RM district requires a minimum project area of 7.5 acres. The maximum site coverage for
this zone is 40 percent. This district was established to reserve appropriately located areas for
medium density, single- and multi-family residential development.
The Residential High (RH) Density district provides for higher density multi-family housing,
including townhouses, condominiums, and apartments. The allowed density ranges from 14.1 to
24.0 units per gross developable acre, with a minimum project area of 5.0 acres. The maximum
site coverage for this zone is 40 percent. This district was established to reserve appropriately
located areas for high density, multi-family residential development. As shown in Table 42 in
Chapter 6, the City has approximately 83 acres of vacant and/or underutilized land zoned for

high density development, or that is zoned with a residential overlay that permits high density
development. The City’s General Plan Update, expected in early 2015, may result in a change
to the density range of the RH Density district. However, to ensure the City’s land inventory of
multi-family sites remains adequate to meet the RHNA, Policy H.1- I 15 (adopted as Policy H.1-I
16 in the 2007–2014 Housing Element) requires that all RHD sites identified on the land
inventory will be required to develop at a minimum of 20 units per acre.
The Residential Overlay (RO) district requires residential projects to comply with the
development standards of the RM or RH zoning district, depending on the nature of the
proposed project. Projects in the RO district must consist of attached units. Development
standards regarding parking, density, site coverage, open space and recreation areas, building
height, and required yards are determined by the applicable zoning district. If a residential
project is proposed in conjunction with a non-residential use, such as a part of a mixed-use
project, the development standards are determined by a planned development. Development
standards for the RUHD district are shown in Table 52.
The Residential Urban High Density (RUHD) Overlay district, which permits 24.1 to 36 units per
acre, provides for the development of high density residential or mixed use development in the
downtown area. The overlay applies to the Downtown Commercial areas and to those General
Commercial areas shown in Figure B-1 of Appendix B, Residential Urban High Density Overlay.
Freestanding townhouse, condominium, and apartment development, or attached multi-family
development as part of a mixed use project, are allowed in separate buildings east of Wilson
Street and Andrews Park between E. Monte Vista Avenue and Mason Street, subject to the
approval of a planned development or design review; freestanding multi-family structures are
not allowed in the Main Street Vacaville Historic District.
There are two examples of mixed-use projects that have recently been constructed in the RUHD
overlay district. In 2003, the Vasquez Deli mixed-use project was approved and constructed at
620 East Main Street. The ±5,900-square-foot building includes a 2,800-square-foot deli on the
first floor and three (3) apartment units (2,800 ± square feet) and a 257-square-foot office
space (for the deli) on the second floor. The project required a Planned Development because it
did not include the construction of additional parking. Parking to serve the site is available in a
public lot located behind the deli.
In 2007, two existing commercial buildings on Main Street were approved and remodeled as
mixed-use buildings. Each building contains a 1,450-square-foot, ground level, commercial
space and two one-bedroom units on the top floor. One parking space for each unit has been
provided behind the buildings and is accessible from Elizabeth Street.
In 2008, the City Council initiated a General Plan Amendment to allow up to 65 units per acre
within the Opportunity Hill Master Plan area, and the General Plan Update, expected in early
2015, will incorporate this density increase into the RUHD Overlay, which includes both the
General Plan’s Opportunity Hill and Depot Street opportunity sites. The Opportunity Hill Master
Plan area is located within the RUHD Overlay Boundary where freestanding residential
buildings are permitted. For more information about the Opportunity Hill Master Plan Area refer

      Davis and McClellan Streets.
   2. In the CG district, the minimum yard shall be 20 feet. The following exceptions shall apply to mixed use projects:
      i. The decision-maker may approve a reduction of a required front yard adjoining a non-arterial street by no more than 5 feet,
      subject to the finding that the lesser setback would be compatible with the surrounding area and consisting with existing
      building setbacks in the surrounding area.
      ii. The required yard shall be increased by 1 foot for every 2 feet of building height above 20 feet when adjoining a street.
   3. For Residential Only Projects in the CD district, the minimum yard shall be 10 feet. In the CG district, the minimum yard shall
   be 20 feet.

Parking Standards
On September 23, 2014, the City Council amended the Land Use and Development Code to
include parking requirements for studio apartments. Studio apartments are required to provide
one parking space. This is less than the required 1.5 parking spaces required for one bedroom
units. Parking requirements for multi-family dwellings in the Land Use and Development Code
are shown in Table 53.
The Planning Commission may reduce the parking requirement for senior or subsidized multi-
family developments. Parking costs can be a significant cost in urban areas with higher land
costs where parking structures are needed in order to provide on-site parking for multi-family
projects. However, in Vacaville, the cost of providing parking for multifamily projects is not
identified as a constraint because land costs are relatively more affordable than in urban areas
and parking structures are not required.

Landscaping Standards
Landscaping requirements vary. Landscaping by developers is not required for single-family
projects of 3 or fewer units. Front yard and corner lot street side yard landscaping is required to
be installed for all units in projects of four or more units. Landscaping must comply with the
Water Efficient Landscape Requirements, which encourage the use of plants which have a low
water usage need. A yard tree is typically required in single-family districts. For multi-family
districts, 20 feet of landscaping is required along street frontages, ten feet is required next to a
property line. Parking lots are required to have a shade plan which allows 50 percent of the lot
to be shaded within ten years. The impact of the City’s landscaping requirements is typical of
most suburban cities and is not considered to be a constraint to residential development.
Other Development Standards
The RH, RO and RUHD zones require a private patio, balcony or yard for all units. A common
open space recreational area is required for projects of ten or more units and is to include
facilities such as picnic areas, tot lots, sports courts, swimming pools, clubrooms and other
similar facilities of a size commensurate with the size of the project. Standards for setbacks may
be adjusted through a planned development
Appendix A provides a list of standard conditions placed on residential projects, including
subdivision standards. These standards are fairly typical and do not pose constraints. Copies of
these standards are available upon request.
The Residential Design Requirements for New Single Family Development also contain
standards for subdivision and single-family design. These standards allow private roadways to
serve single-family development and these roadways can have a 20-foot width with reduced
standards such as sidewalks on only one side of the street. There are no adopted residential
design requirements for multi-family developments.
Provision for a Variety of Housing Types
The City of Vacaville’s Land Use and Development Code encourages a variety of housing
types, including community care facilities, emergency shelters and transitional housing, farm
worker housing, lodging houses, manufactured housing, multi-family housing, and secondary
living units as follows:

7. Constraints on the Production of Housing
Community Care Facilities
The Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Lanterman Act) sets out the rights and
responsibilities of persons with developmental disabilities. The Lanterman Act impacts local
zoning ordinances by requiring the use of property for the care of six or fewer disabled persons
to be classified as a residential use under zoning. More specifically, a State-authorized, certified
or licensed family care home, foster home, or a group home serving six or fewer disabled
persons or dependent and neglected children on a 24-hour-a-day basis is considered a
residential use that is to be permitted in all residential zones. No local agency can impose
stricter zoning or building and safety standards on these homes.
The City of Vacaville Land Use and Development Code identifies “residential care facilities” (six
or fewer occupants) for the elderly and disabled as a permitted use in all residential zoning
districts. Residential care facilities providing intermediate care and/or alcohol and drug
treatment are permitted in the RR, RE, RL, and RLM zoning designations. Such facilities are
often established in existing single-family homes and house individuals with low or very-low
incomes.
The City requires a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) for residential care facilities serving seven or
more persons. Community care facilities serving seven or more residents are a conditional use
in the RL, RLM, RM, RH, CD, CG, CN, CO, and CS zoning designations. These types of
facilities typically house elderly individuals or other persons that require assistance and cannot
live independently. The purpose of the CUP process is not to deny such facilities; it is to ensure
that the design and proposed operation of the facility is compatible with neighboring homes and
uses. Vacaville has six commercial care facilities, four of which have the capability of serving
patients with Alzheimer’s disease and other memory-related conditions.
Transitional and Supportive Housing
Transitional Housing (per Health and Safety Code 50675.2(h)) is defined as buildings
configured as rental housing developments, but operated under program requirements that call
for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible
program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less than six
months.
Transitional housing programs provide extended shelter and supportive services for homeless
individuals and/or families with the goal of helping them live independently and transition into
permanent housing. Some programs require that the individual/family be transitioning from a
short-term emergency shelter. The length of stay varies considerably by program but is
generally longer than two weeks and can last up to 60 days or more.
In many cases, transitional housing programs will provide services for up to two years or more.
The supportive services may be provided directly by the organization managing the housing or
by other public or private agencies in a coordinated effort with the housing provider. Transitional
housing/shelter is generally provided in apartment style facilities with a higher degree of privacy
than short-term homeless shelters; may be provided at no cost to the resident; and may be
configured for specialized groups within the homeless population such as people with substance
abuse problems, homeless mentally ill, homeless domestic violence victims, veterans or
homeless people with AIDS/HIV.
Supportive Housing (per Health and Safety Code 50675.14(b)) is defined as housing with no
limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target population as defined in subdivision (d) of
                                 City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

Section 53260, and that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive housing
resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her
ability to live and, when possible, work in the community.
SB 2 required that transitional and supportive housing types be treated as residential uses and
subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the
same zone. As a result, the City revised the Land Use and Development Code (LUDC) to
explicitly permit both transitional and supportive housing types within residential zones. These
uses are permitted by right in the SS-10 and SS-11 zoning overlay districts, and the LUDC is in
the process of being revised to allow transitional and supportive housing in all districts where
residential uses are permitted, subject only to the same restrictions as other residential uses.
City Council voted to support these amendments to the LUDC at their January 13, 2015
meeting, and the amendments will have their second reading on January 27, 2015.
Emergency Shelters
California Health and Safety Code (Section 50801) defines an emergency shelter as “housing
with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six
months or less by a homeless person. No individual or households may be denied emergency
shelter because of an inability to pay.” In late 2008 and early 2009, the City Council adopted two
special standard overlay zones (SS-10 and SS-11) which permit social services facilities, which
include emergency shelters, homeless shelters, food banks, and other similar types of facilities,
without the need for a conditional use permit. Cumulatively, these zones include 20 parcels
(2.13 acres) and are located within the Residential High Density zoning district. There are no
special development standards for homeless shelters, transitional, or supportive housing.
These uses are subject to the design and development standards applicable to the residential
zoning district.
In 2012, Opportunity House, the City’s homeless facility, relocated into a larger facility at 267
Bennett Hill Court, which is located within the SS-10 special standards overlay zoning district.
For more information regarding Opportunity House and the social services available within the
nearby area, see Section 5.3 in Chapter 5 of this document. Social services facilities continue to
be permitted with a conditional use permit in the Downtown Commercial, General Commercial,
and Neighborhood Commercial zoning districts. This is typical of many suburban communities.
These commercial districts make up the majority of the City’s commercial land area.
Farm Employee Housing
Most farm worker households are monolingual and Spanish speaking, so many farm worker
families tend to live in close proximity in a supportive community environment. Local service
providers believe most farm workers live in lower-rent mobile home parks and apartments.
While the special housing needs of the farm worker population are similar to that of other lower
income residents, there is an emphasis on larger units (with three or more bedrooms), access to
social services which serve their specialized needs (including ESL, naturalization, and health
services) and access to transportation routes to outlying agricultural (employment) sites.
To the extent that farm workers are primarily low-income residents, their housing needs are
similar to other low-income households. Because most of the heads of households speak only
Spanish, the City of Vacaville, the Vacaville Housing Authority, and local social services
providers employ bilingual staff and use outreach methods and materials designed to reach
Spanish speaking residents to inform households of affordable housing opportunities,

7. Constraints on the Production of Housing
particularly the Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance program, and subsidized rental units
located throughout the city. It should be noted that, within the city, there is no active agriculture
that would create a demand for farm worker labor.
Farm employee housing is permitted without the need of a conditional use permit or other
zoning variance within the Agriculture Zoning District.
Lodging houses
The Land Use and Development Code defines a lodging house as “a dwelling in which lodging
or lodging and meals are provided for compensation for more than three but not more than
15 persons other than members of the resident family. Lodging house does not include hotels,
motels, bed and breakfast inns, or residential care type facilities.” These types of facilities
typically provide room and board to individuals with low or very-low incomes. Lodging houses
are permitted within the RM and RH zoning districts.
Manufactured Homes and Mobile Home Parks
The Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 offers an affordable home
ownership option to many low- and moderate-income households. In accordance with State law,
the City of Vacaville Land Use and Development Code permits certified mobile homes in all
zoning districts that allow single-family dwellings. The same development regulations that apply
to single-family dwellings also apply to mobile homes, including the provision of covered parking
and permanent foundation. Mobile homes that are not certified under the National Mobile Home
Construction and Safety Act of 1974 may only be placed in mobile home parks.
Mobile home parks are conditionally permitted in all of the City’s residential zoning districts, with
the exception of the Manufactured Housing Park zoning district, which permits them by right.
The Manufactured Housing Park zoning district includes regulations to ensure that new,
expanded, or reconstructed mobile home parks are located and established in a manner that is
compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods and commercial areas. The minimum site
area for a mobile home park is 10 acres. A maximum of ten mobile home spaces per gross
developable acre is permitted. Each development is required to contain a common open space
recreation area for the residents.
Additionally, any subdivision of an existing mobile home park or conversion of an existing
mobile home park to another land use is subject to the provisions of the Government Code
related to mobile home park closure, commencing at Section 65863.7.
Permit Processing Time
Because most of Vacaville's residential development occurs in large, planned subdivisions,
plan-checks are fairly straightforward and lengthy delays are not normally encountered. Such
delays do occur from time to time depending on the complexity of the project, or when
unexpected issues arise during plan check. The City of Vacaville prides itself on excellent
customer service and this is evidenced by the timely review of development applications,
subdivision maps and building permit requests.
City processing of residential developments is governed by federal, State and local regulations.
For residential projects the City must adhere to the State Subdivision Map Act; State Planning,
Zoning and Development Law; and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The
timeframes for public review and permit processing outlined in regulations, as well as the

regulations adopted to implement them, impact the cost and time associated with permit
processing and approval. In addition, obtaining environmental clearances from the State
Department of Fish & Wildlife (DFWS) and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)
is required for many projects. Because of a federal requirement that the City prepare a Habitat
Conservation Plan, development proposals within areas denoted as habitat for the California
Red Legged Frog or Vernal Pool Shrimp must receive clearance from USFWS. In addition,
normal pre-construction surveys for burrowing owls or Swainson’s hawk can sometimes affect
the plan check review timelines.
Staff level review of residential projects normally consists of a Design Review application, while
Planning Commission approvals may include Design Review or Planned Development
applications, in addition to the required environmental and map applications.
The Community Development Department coordinates the City’s development review process
with other City departments and outside affected agencies. This is accomplished through the
Department’s Project Review Committee (PRC), which meets on a weekly basis. PRC is
comprised of staff from each City department who review development applications and
determine the appropriate project conditions of approval. For complex projects, Staff
encourages the applicant to attend these meetings to provide an introduction to the project and
its scope. The PRC also reviews applications to determine completeness and to determine
whether a project meets City standards and requirements. Through the PRC, projects are
reviewed in an efficient manner and potential issues are identified at an early stage in the
development review process.
The country-wide economic downturn and the dissolution of the City’s Redevelopment Agency
has affected staffing in the Community Development Department. While staffing has decreased,
the number of non-residential projects has not, and this affects the processing of residential
projects. The approximate timelines identified below reflect reduction in staffing and the
remaining staff’s ongoing workload. Please note that new residential subdivision projects are
typically reviewed by the Planning Commission and sometimes by the City Council.

Plan Amendment, Zone Change, and a Planned Development can go through a single review

and hearing process. For projects requiring an Environmental Impact Report (EIR),
approximately six months can be added to the timeline for a project. EIRs are not typically
required for individual residential projects. The City generally relies on area plan EIRs and, in
some instances, a Mitigated Negative Declaration, which does not require any additional
processing time. All recently approved apartment projects required a Mitigated Negative
Declaration.
As a part of the project review process, it is the City’s standard practice to hold informal
neighborhood meetings for most development applications. These meetings allow City staff and
the builder to meet with residents, and identify and resolve neighborhood issues prior to the
formal public hearing process, eliminating the risk of a continued public hearing because of new
issues that might arise at a public hearing.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
As part of the update of the Housing Element in 2001, the City conducted a comprehensive
review of its zoning laws, policies, and practices for compliance with fair housing laws. The City
has not identified any zoning or other land-use regulatory practices that could discriminate
against persons with disabilities and impede the availability of such housing for these
individuals. The City does not impose special permit procedures or requirements that could
impede the retrofitting of homes for accessibility. The City’s requirements for building permits
and inspections are the same as for other residential projects and are straightforward and not
burdensome. City officials are not aware of any instances in which an applicant experienced
delays or rejection of a retrofitting proposal for accessibility to persons with disabilities.
Procedures for Ensuring Reasonable Accommodations
To provide exception in zoning and land use for housing for persons with disabilities, the City of
Vacaville utilizes either a variance or encroachment permit processes to accommodate requests
such as special structures or appurtenances (e.g., access ramps or lifts) needed by persons
with physical disabilities. While both variance and encroachment permit applications may be
handled through an administrative procedure, the standard used to evaluate such deviations
conflicts with laws applicable to housing for persons with disabilities.
On September 23, 2014, the City Council amended Chapter 14.09.074, Residential Districts
Development Standards, of the Land Use and Development Code to exempt construction
projects related to accessibility retrofitting from setback requirements. In addition, accessibility-
retrofitting projects are subject to administrative design review. This process includes minimal
review by the Community Development Director and includes the following criteria:
•   The request for reasonable accommodation will be used by an individual with a disability
    protected under fair housing laws.
•   The requested accommodation is necessary to make housing available to an individual with
    a disability protected under fair housing laws.
•   The requested accommodation would not impose an undue financial or administrative
    burden on the City.
•   The requested accommodation would not require a fundamental alteration in the nature of
    the City's land-use and zoning program.

Efforts to Remove Regulatory Constraints for Persons with Disabilities
The City does not impose additional zoning, building code, or permitting procedures other than
those allowed by State law. The City allows residential care facilities of six of fewer persons by
right, as required by State law. A Conditional Use Permit (CUP) or other special permitting
requirements do not apply to such homes. The City does require a CUP for residential care
facilities of more than six persons in all residential and commercial zones that allow for
residential uses. However, such permits only consider the City’s design review requirements.
The City does not impose additional zoning, building code, or permitting procedures other than
those allowed by State law. There are no City initiated constraints on housing for persons with
disabilities, and no such constraints are caused or controlled by the City.
The City also allows residential retrofitting to increase the suitability of homes for persons with
disabilities in compliance with accessibility requirements. Further, the City works with applicants
who need special accommodations in their homes to ensure that application of building code
requirements does not create a constraint.
Information Regarding Accommodation for Zoning, Permit Processing, and Building Codes
The City of Vacaville implements and enforces the 2013 California Building Code. The City
provides information to all interested parties regarding accommodations in zoning, permit
processes, and application of building codes for housing for persons with disabilities.
Building Codes
The City of Vacaville provides reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities in the
enforcement of building codes and the issuance of building permits through retrofitting or
converting existing buildings and construction of new buildings that meet the shelter needs of
persons with disabilities. The City implements the 2013 California Building Code. The City has
adopted amendments to the California Building Code to (a) match the current practice of the
City Council adopting building fee schedules; (b) adopt certain parts of model codes not
adopted by the State of California, for administrative purposes; (c) provide greater safety from
fireplace fire damage; (d) provide greater fire safety of wood shake and shingle roof material;
(e) require reinforcing steel in driveway slabs.
7.2      NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE PRODUCTION OF
         HOUSING
Availability of Urban Services
The availability of services constitutes a constraint primarily for new growth areas beyond the
current City limits. The only remaining large growth areas within the City limits are Lagoon
Valley, North Village, and Southtown. Lagoon Valley is a future community of 1,025 units,
located in the southwest quadrant of the City; North Village is a community of approximately
2,200 units, located in the northeast quadrant of the City; and Southtown is a community
comprised of approximately 1,500 units located in the southeast quadrant of the City.
Infrastructure has been constructed for the first phases of North Village and Southtown, and
construction of houses is under way. Lagoon Valley and the remaining phases of North Village
and Southtown all require significant infrastructure; however, assessment districts have been
created for each of these projects to finance the installation of needed improvements. Brighton
Landing, a smaller growth area on the east side of Vacaville, has an approved Specific Plan
with capacity for about 770 single-family homes. It would require new infrastructure that would

need to be coordinated with future development to the north and south, outside the City limits, in
the “East of Leisure Town Road Growth Area” planned for in the City’s pending updated
General Plan.
Chapter 5, “Public Facilities, Institutions and Utilities,: of the General Plan includes analysis of
existing capacity and projected needs, and policies to ensure orderly development. Vacaville
has water entitlements to provide water for all lands within the current City limits, as well as for
additional growth areas beyond the existing City limits. Due to differing elevations, pump
stations and reservoirs are required to serve some development areas, such as Lagoon Valley.
The Easterly Wastewater Treatment Plant is currently capable of treating 15 million gallons per
day.
Vacaville has a sufficient residential land inventory to accommodate its share of the regional
housing need allocation (RHNA) without the need to rezone any properties or annex additional
lands. The City has sufficient water and wastewater capacity to accommodate its RHNA.
Land and Construction Costs
Based on interviews with local developers, there are three major cost components related to
constructing new housing units: the cost of contraction materials and labor, city and county fees,
and land costs. Prior to the economic downturn in the mid-2000s, land cost was the most
variable cost in residential development because it varied considerably depending upon the site.
Construction costs include both “hard” (e.g., labor and material costs) and “soft” costs (e.g.,
architectural and engineering services, development fees, construction financing, and
insurance). Although the cost of construction financing has recently declined, it remains a
significant part of the total cost of residential development.
Construction costs vary widely according to the type of development, with multi-family housing
generally less expensive to construct than single-family homes. However, wide variation within
each type exists, depending on the size of the unit and the amenities provided, such as
fireplaces, swimming pools, and interior fixtures, among others. The typical construction price of
an average 1,800-square-foot single-family home in the area, built by a public builder, is
estimated to be approximately $220,000, including materials, labor, permits, financing, and
administration.
In addition to construction costs, the price of land is also one of the largest components of
housing development costs. Land costs may vary depending on whether the site is vacant or
has an existing use that must be removed. Similarly, site constraints such as environmental
issues (e.g., lack of proper drainage, soil stability, seismic hazards, or flooding) can also affect
the cost of land.
Availability of Financing / Cost of Financing
Maximum affordable purchase prices for different household income ranges are shown in
Table 54. It can be difficult for very low, low, and moderate income first-time homebuyers to
acquire sufficient savings and income to pay for a down payment, closing costs, monthly
mortgage, and tax and insurance payments. Although they have remained fairly low in recent
years, mortgage interest rates will continue to play a major role in determining the affordability of
housing. As of March 2014, the United States is experiencing historically low interest, as low as
5 percent. Interest rates and availability of financing in Vacaville are no different than in the

or rehabilitation loans.
A variety of federal, state, and local programs exist to provide homebuyers with below-market-
rate mortgages, either by insuring loans, purchasing them on the secondary mortgage market,
or making them directly. The effectiveness of these programs usually depends on their income
and sales price ceilings and how competitive market-rate loans are. Generally, when interest
rates are low, there is little incentive to use these programs. Interviews with local developers,
realtors, and mortgage bankers indicate that Federal Housing Administration, Veteran’s
Administration, and California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) loans are being used for the
most part for townhouses, condominiums, and smaller, older single-family homes. Even for
financing the purchase of these units, price limits are too low to allow broad use of the
programs. Prior to Redevelopment Agency dissolution, a combination of below market rate
loans funded by the Redevelopment LIHF assisted over 528 families to purchase their first
homes. The City still continues to provide the CalHOME first-time homebuyer loan program, and
is currently pursuing reinstating the City’s Housing Counseling program to provide counseling
services to first-time homebuyers to lessen some burden. The City will pursue other State and
federal funding sources for first-time homebuyer loans.
Due to market conditions, the construction of rental units has also decreased dramatically. A
key funding source for the development of affordable rental units has been tax exempt bond
financing and tax credits. However, due to market conditions, investors are less interested in tax
exempt vehicles. In addition, with the exception of senior apartments, the vacancy rate has
been relatively high.

 7.3     ENERGY CONSERVATION
Development of California’s Energy Standards
The State of California pioneered the development of energy conservation legislation, mainly as
a result of the 1973 energy crisis. In 1974, the legislature adopted the Warren-Alquist State
Energy Resources and Development Act, which established the Energy Resources
Conservation and Development Commission (California Energy Commission). The Energy
Commission was delegated the authority to adopt standards and regulations encouraging
energy conservation in new buildings and rehabilitation of existing buildings.
The State building requirements that address energy conservation are included in Title 24 of the
State Building Code. The State of California presently requires local governments to recognize
and address energy conservation measures in the preparation of housing elements. Title 20 of
the California Administrative Code, section 1406 gives local governments the authority to adopt
more stringent standards and provides for documentation on energy savings and cost
effectiveness.
Some of the methods, designs, or technologies required by State energy conservation
standards could increase the cost of housing production and rehabilitation, but these expenses
are necessary to protect public health, safety, and welfare, and to meet statewide energy goals.
Energy efficiency can greatly reduce the impact of residential development and provide long-
term cost savings for residents. The standards of Title 24 offer a great deal of flexibility for
individual builders to achieve energy savings.
Energy Conservation Programs
Local utility companies, in conjunction with State and federally funded initiatives, offer a number
of programs to promote energy-efficient homes. Listed below are some of the programs that are
currently active.
•   California Advanced Homes Program (CAHP) – The CAHP is sponsored by PG&E and
    administered by TRC Solutions. The CAHP is a comprehensive residential new construction
    concept with a focus on sustainable design and construction, green building practices,
    energy efficiency, and emerging technologies. Incentives are available to builders of single-
    family homes that are at least 15 percent more efficient than required by Title 24. Additional
    incentives are also available for Energy Star, Green Program Participation, Compact Home,
    kW Reduction, and New Solar Home Partnership Tier II level participation. Additionally, the
    CAHP requires that all appliances provided by the builder be Energy Star qualified. PG&E
    will help prospective buyers locate homes that meet the Energy Star specifications.
•   California Multi-Family New Homes (CMFNH) – The CMFNH program is sponsored by
    PG&E and administered by TRC Solutions to facilitate and encourage energy-efficient
    design in multi-family housing through design assistance, cash incentives, and Energy Star
    marketing benefits.
•   Energy Efficiency for Multi-Family Properties – PG&E offers rebates to multi-family
    property owners and managers of existing residential dwellings that contain two or more
    units when they implement specified measures to increase energy efficiency. The program
    encourages the installation of qualifying energy-efficient products in individual tenant units
    and in the common areas of residential apartment buildings, mobile home parks, and
    condominium complexes.

•    New Solar Homes Partnership – The New Solar Homes Partnership (NSHP) provides
     financial incentives and other support for installing eligible solar photovoltaic (PV) systems
     on new residential buildings that receive electricity from qualifying utility companies. The
     California Energy Commission implements the New Solar Homes Partnership in
     coordination with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) as part of the overall
     California Solar Initiative. The incentives for NSHP will decline over time as it reaches its
     megawatts capacity goals, and this program will end no later than December 31, 2016.
Residential Energy Efficiency Standards
The Energy Commission issued the current building energy standards in 1998, with an update
in 2013. The standards for residential buildings incorporate different requirements for low-rise
buildings (three or fewer stories) and high-rise buildings (four or more stories). Any building,
building addition, or alteration that increases the heated or cooled floor area of a building must
comply with the State Energy Conservation Standards. Enforcement of the standards is carried
out during the building permit process by building departments.
The State standards require new residential buildings, alterations, and additions to existing
buildings to meet or exceed a specific set of energy conservation requirements. Because
energy use depends partly upon weather conditions, which vary considerably throughout the
state, the Energy Commission has created 16 different “climate zones.” Each climate zone
represents a distinct microclimate in the state. The energy conservation requirements are
tailored for each climate zone. The City of Vacaville is located in Climate Zone 12.
There have been several residential subdivisions constructed in Vacaville with energy efficiency
features beyond what is mandated by State Law. The 47-unit Ventana project was constructed
with roof-mounted solar panels on all homes and was Vacaville’s first solar home community.
The 31-unit Sterling Chateau single-family residential subdivision is also a solar home
community-featuring roof mounted solar panels. Other projects have followed the lead of the
developers of these two projects and offered solar packages as an option to new homebuyers.
Compliance Methods
There are two compliance methods available to builders and designers of residential structures.
The prescriptive method involves selection of prescribed compliance features from a list of
alternative component packages. Each climate zone has four packages to choose from and
each offers a different combination of energy conservation requirements. Parameters of the
building, such as the insulation R-values of the walls and ceilings, percentage of glazing, the
solar heat gain coefficient of the glazing, thermal mass area, and heating and cooling equipment
efficiencies are required to meet specific minimums for each package.
The computer performance method requires the use of an Energy Commission-approved
computer program. The computer program actually models the energy performance of the
structure two ways. The energy budget is calculated for the structure through the use of a
selected set of standard parameters set forth by the Energy Commission. The structure is then
modeled with the parameters proposed by the designer. The predicted energy budget of the
proposed design may not exceed the calculated energy budget of the structure modeled with
the standard parameters of the Energy Commission. This method involves the most effort to
demonstrate compliance; however, it does offer the greatest flexibility for design.
When using the computer performance method, additional compliance credit can be obtained
for improvements in the quality of design, installation of heating and cooling ducts, and

construction of less-leaky building envelopes. The compliance credit options require installer
diagnostic testing and certification, as well as independent diagnostic testing and field
verification by a certified Home Energy Rater.
Mandatory Energy Conservation Requirements
There are also mandatory energy conservation requirements that must be met by all new
residential structures and by additions and alterations to existing structures. A condensed
summary of these is listed on the mandatory measures checklist, or MF-1 form, submitted at the
time of plan review to the City’s Building Division.
Adoption of Local Conservation Ordinances
The City of Vacaville implemented the California Green Building Standards Code in 2010, as
mandated by law.
Conservation Policies for Subdivisions
It is unlikely that all developers will consistently take the initiative to incorporate conservation
features into their projects during the planning and design phases of development unless they
are cost-effective and buyers demand the features. The City’s single-family design guidelines
represent a logical place to include design guidelines for energy conservation. The types of
policies that help to promote energy conservation are:
•    Location of retail uses near new residential subdivisions.
•    Providing access to schools, recreation facilities, and other public and private services that
     would reduce the need for automobile trips.
•    Use of landscaping to help reduce the energy needs of residences (such as the use of
     deciduous shade trees).
•    Policies to encourage building orientation that reduces east-west surface areas and,
     therefore, the amount of summer heat gain.
•    Use of shaded south glazing to take advantage of winter insolation.
•    Encouragement of solar energy by ensuring that new subdivisions allow for solar access to
     individual dwelling units. Solar access for passive and active solar systems (such as solar
     water heaters) must be protected for these systems to operate properly. The City can
     ensure solar access by establishing design guidelines that require a zone of unimpeded
     solar access for each residential building to make use of passive and/or active solar
     systems.
•    Examination of the City’s Zoning Ordinance to determine if building height, setback, and
     yard area requirements allow for sufficient solar access
Revisions to the City’s Subdivision and Zoning Ordinances can evolve over a period of time
sufficient to allow planners, land developers, and builders to acquire sensitivity to solar potential
and other energy conservation measures.
Energy and Conservation Action Strategy
Since the last Housing Element cycle, the City of Vacaville has prepared and published a Draft
Energy and Conservation Action Strategy (ECAS) in parallel with its General Plan Update. The
ECAS includes several measures to increase green building, renewable energy, and energy
conservation in all types of development in Vacaville, such as measures to reduce energy use

through solar orientation, work with PG&E to develop an Alternative Energy Development Plan,
and mandate the use of energy-efficient appliances in new development. The ECAS will be
considered for adoption by the City Council in 2015.
7.4       PRIORITY FOR WATER AND SEWER PROVIDERS
Per Chapter 727, Statues of 2004 (SB 1087), upon completion of an amended or adopted
housing element, a local government is responsible for immediately distributing a copy of the
element to area water and sewer providers. In addition, water and sewer providers must grant
priority for service allocations to proposed developments that include housing units affordable to
lower-income households. Chapter 727 was enacted to improve the effectiveness of the law in
facilitating housing development for lower-income families and workers.
Local public and/or private water and sewer providers must adopt written policies and
procedures that grant a priority for service hook-ups to developments that help meet the
community’s share of the regional need for lower-income housing. In addition, the law prohibits
water and sewer providers from denying, conditioning the approval, or reducing the amount of
service for an application for development that includes housing affordable to lower-income
households, unless specific written findings are made.

CHAPTER 8
EVALUATION OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
Between 2007 and the end of 2013, Vacaville constructed 1,523 residential dwelling units. The
total units produced during this timeframe were short of the total goal due to an unforeseen
slowdown in new residential construction as a result of the economic recession. In addition, the
dissolution of Redevelopment in 2012 eliminated the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund
(LMIHF), a major funding source for affordable housing development, decreasing affordable
housing production.
Table 55 provides a snapshot summary comparing the Association of Bay Area Government’s
(ABAG) designated housing need, the goals adopted in the prior Housing Element, and actual
new housing construction, acquisition/rehabilitation and conservation/preservation. Table 56
provides a detailed analysis of the new construction accomplished by affordability categories
during the Housing Element timeframe.
Table 57 provides a detailed evaluation of all quantified goals that were adopted in the prior
Housing Element. In addition to the new construction/rehabilitation of affordable units, 1,193
units were conserved and/or preserved through Housing Choice Vouchers, including 50
vouchers awarded to the Vacaville Housing Authority from 2007 to 2014 under the Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)’s Family Unification Program. During this period, the
following activities also took place:
•    365 multi-family units were improved in exchange for 55-year affordability agreements
     through a $3 million Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Loan. A portion of the CIP funds
     were used to fully rehabilitate 12 affordable units in 2009.
•    In exchange for a loan increase from the former LMIHF, five multi-family units that were
     previously restricted to low-income households were restricted to very-low income
     households at Senior Manor.
•    2727 single-family homes for low- and moderate-income families were rehabilitated with no
     deed restrictions.
•    The former Vacaville Redevelopment Agency acquired 86 substandard units, which will be
     included in a planned rehabilitation/new construction project and transferred to a non-
     profit/for-profit partnership for ownership and management; these units will be permanently
     affordable.
•    Through Down Payment Assistance Loan programs, 166 low-income families were able to
     purchase their first homes.
•    The local homeless facility relocated and doubled its capacity from 24 beds to 48 beds to
     assist homeless families and women in the community. This facility location is permanently
     affordable through a deed restriction.
•    The City monitored 126 existing affordability agreements covering 1,007 units restricted to
     affordable rents for households earning 30 to 120 percent of Area Median Income (AMI).
•    1,193 affordable units were preserved through the Housing Choice Voucher rental subsidy
     program.

8. EVALUATION OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
8.1     CONSTRUCTION AND ACQUISITION
Guiding Policies
H.1 - G 1      Ensure a supply of housing of differing type, size, and affordability in order to
               meet Vacaville's housing needs for the current and future residents and workers
               within the community.
H.1 - G 2      In conjunction with policies in the Land Use Element of the Vacaville General
               Plan, ensure that an adequate supply of developable land is available to meet
               Vacaville's housing need, particularly for affordable housing.
H.1 - G 3      Remove constraints to the production and availability of housing to the extent
               consistent with other General Plan policies.
H.1 - G 4      Ensure the development and availability of housing appropriate for special needs
               groups including young adults, young families, seniors, disabled and homeless.
H.1 - G 5      Establish development and construction standards that encourage energy
               conservation in residential areas.
H.1 - G 6      Aggressively participate in all programs, state and federal, private and public,
               suitable for maintaining and increasing the supply of affordable housing.
H.1 - G 7      Ensure the viability of Travis Air Force Base through the provision of an
               adequate supply of affordable housing for military families.
Implementing Policies
H.1 - I 1      Continue to use the Density Bonus provisions in the Land Use & Development
               Code to grant density bonuses above the State-mandated minimum in return for
               an increased share of affordable units.
               Implementation: On an ongoing basis, the Community Development Department
               and the Department of Housing & Redevelopment will continue to make
               developers aware of the provisions in the Density Bonus ordinance.
               Implementation Evaluation: During the timeframe of the Housing Element, the
               City has made developers aware of the provisions in the Density Bonus
               ordinance. However, no development applications with density bonus requests
               were submitted.
H.1 - I 2      The Planned Growth Ordinance shall continue to provide exemptions for the
               constructions of dwellings affordable to very low- and low-income households.
               An exemption will allow a project to go through the building permit process
               without going through the building permit allocation process.
               Implementation: On an ongoing basis, the Community Development Department
               shall make builders of affordable projects aware of the provisions in the Planned
               Growth Ordinance. The Lincoln Corner affordable apartments are an example
               where affordable units were given preference for construction under the Planned
                              City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

          Growth Ordinance. Any future amendment of the ordinance shall maintain the
          exemption for low and very-low income projects.
          Implementation Evaluation: Implementation of the Planned Growth Ordinance
          (PGO) has been suspended since 2010, primarily due to the low levels of
          residential development resulting from the economic recession. Through
          December 31, 2014, permits may be issued for any residential lot approved for
          construction.
          The main goal of the PGO is to produce a manageable, orderly, and reasonable
          rate of growth based upon the ability of the City to provide adequate public
          services, facilities and infrastructure, while maintaining an adequate inventory of
          approved residential allocations through an annual review process. Deed-
          restricted affordable residential projects will continue to be exempt from the
          PGO.
H.1 - I 3 Consider an amendment to the Land Use & Development Code to allow
          innovative housing within new single family subdivisions. This could include
          provisions that allow duplexes to be built on the larger corner lots and secondary
          living units to be built in conjunction with new homes.
          Implementation: In conjunction with adoption of this Housing Element, the
          Community Development Department will request the Planning Commission to
          initiate an amendment to the Land Use and Development Code to allow
          secondary living units to be a permitted use when constructed at the same time
          as a new single family home and to permit duplexes and attached single homes
          to be allowed in residential Planned Developments where the overall density of
          the project is consistent with the underlying zoning and General Plan
          designations. If initiated, the ordinance amendment will be scheduled for a public
          hearing before the Planning Commission by May 2011. It should be noted that
          through the Specific Plan or master plan process, this program may be
          implemented prior to adoption of an amendment.
          Considering the requirement for second dwelling units in the Southtown
          residential project and the number of second dwelling units constructed annually
          for the past nine years, in concert with local housing needs and development
          trends, and adoption of new incentives, the City is projecting that 30 secondary
          units will be approved and constructed during the current planning period. As
          provided for in Government Code Section 65583.1, the City is applying
          secondary living units towards its adequate sites requirement. In Vacaville,
          secondary living units are usually occupied by elderly parents or young, single
          adults.
          Implementation Evaluation: The Planning Commission initiated this amendment
          on February 19, 2013. The amendment will be updated following the adoption of
          the new General Plan, which is scheduled to occur in 2015. However, on
          November 19, 2013, house plans were approved for the remaining 34 lots within
          the Southtown Phase 1 residential subdivision. Of these remaining 34 lots, four
          lots were approved with a house plan (Plan 5) that includes an attached
          secondary living unit. This approval is consistent with the adopted Southtown
          Development Agreement, which includes various Planning entitlements.

8. EVALUATION OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
H.1 - I 4      Consider implementation of a program to allow payment of development impact
               fees for new residential construction to be deferred and paid prior to the City’s
               approval of occupancy.
               Implementation: The Community Development Department, in coordination with
               affected City departments shall evaluate the feasibility of the implementation of a
               new program to allow builders of new affordable and/or market-rate residential
               units to pay City development impact fees prior to approval of occupancy instead
               of prior to permit issuance. The study will consider the potential benefits to the
               City through housing production, financial considerations of deferring collection
               of the fees and the administrative process for implementation. Community
               Development Department and Economic Development staff will complete the
               study by summer 2010 and if it is determined to be feasible, a proposal will be
               forwarded to the City Council for consideration by May 2011.
               Implementation Evaluation: On January 14, 2014, the City Council adopted
               Resolution 2014-004, authorizing the Economic Development Incentive Program,
               a temporary housing incentive program, and Resolution 2014-006, which
               suspended increasing development impact fees in 2014. The temporary
               residential housing incentive program reduces fees associated with home
               building by 10 percent. A maximum of 100 permits will be issued at this
               discounted rate, with 25 permits allowed per developer.
               The goal of these resolutions is to stimulate the creation of new housing and to
               create opportunities for new and varied levels of housing inventory throughout
               the City. As of July 15, 2014, two residential developers are actively participating
               in this incentive program, and will likely max out the permitted 25 permits allowed
               per developer. Other developers, with approved house plans, have expressed
               interest in participating in this program. The City anticipates issuing all 100
               discounted permits.
H.1 - I 5      Review and update the development impact fee structure for residential projects.
               Implementation: Following the comprehensive General Plan update, initiated by
               the City Council in March 2010, the City will initiate a comprehensive effort to
               review development impact fees through a process and parameters mandated by
               State Law. Adoption of the fee studies and updated fees would happen within
               two years of adoption of the updated General Plan. The impact fee studies will
               include an evaluation of changes to the current fee structure to consider a lower
               impact fee structure for small single family starter homes as compared to larger
               move-up and executive homes.
               Implementation Evaluation: The new General Plan is scheduled for adoption in
               2015. The impact fee studies that will occur following the adoption of the new
               General Plan will include an evaluation of changes to the current fee structure. At
               that time, the City will consider a lower impact fee structure for small single-
               family starter homes as compared to larger move-up and executive homes, as
               well as a lower new impact fee structure for multi-family housing.

H.1 - I 6 Evaluate and update the General Plan residential land use classifications and
          consistent zoning districts.
          Implementation: The City Council initiated a comprehensive General Plan
          Update in March 2010. During the update, the residential land use categories
          and definitions will be analyzed and updated. Consideration shall be given to the
          citywide housing mix, infrastructure capacities and environmental constraints. An
          alternative option to be considered for the single family classifications will be the
          designation of compatible zoning districts that are at the high end of the density
          range allowed per the General Plan.
          Implementation Evaluation: The General Plan Update process is currently
          underway. The new General Plan is scheduled for adoption in early 2015, and
          includes the following new zoning designations:
          •   Residential High Density. The minimum density required in this designation
              increased from 14.1 to 20.1 units per acre. This change was necessary to
              comply with the minimum default density for accommodating lower-income
              households identified by State Housing Element law (AB 2348 (Mullin)). The
              minimum density is 20.1 units per acre, and the maximum allowed density
              remains 24 units per acre.
          •   Residential Medium High Density. This designation was added to fill in the
              gap between the existing Residential Medium Density designation, which
              allows 8.1 to 14 units per acre, and the revised Residential High Density
              designation, which allows 20.1 to 24 units per acre. The minimum density is
              14.1 units per net acre, and the maximum density is 20 units per net acre.
          •   Mixed Use. This new designation allows different but compatible uses,
              including residential uses, to be located in close proximity to each other.
          •   Opportunity Hill. As described in the Opportunity Hill Master Plan, changes
              to the General Plan and Land Use and Development Code will allow
              residential development of up to 65 units per acre in the Opportunity Hill area.
H.1 - I 7 Assist affordable housing developers to construct 527 new housing units
          affordable to households with incomes below 80 percent of median, with 74
          percent of these units being affordable at 60 percent or below median, and 10 of
          these units being affordable to families with incomes below 30 percent of
          median.
          Implementation: This is an ongoing effort by the City of Vacaville Redevelopment
          Agency. Implementation includes working with local non-profit entities to mobilize
          a wide variety of funding, negotiate long-term affordability agreements,
          participate in project design, assist with planning and building approvals, monitor
          the affordability agreements, and report to funding sources. The primary funding
          source for this activity will be the Redevelopment Low Income Housing Fund
          (LIHF). It is anticipated that $12 million of LIHF will be used to develop 527 units.
          The City has already made great headway to achieve these goals. The 60-unit
          Senior Manor (also known as the Lawrence Drive Apartments), four Habitat for
          Humanity houses and ten Lincoln Corner Apartments were completed during the
                          City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

               timeframe for this Housing Element. All of these projects are affordable to
               households earning below 60 percent of median income.
               Implementation Evaluation: The February 1, 2012 elimination of Redevelopment
               in California, including the Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Fund (LMIHF),
               has severely impacted the City of Vacaville's ability to fund new affordable
               housing activities. However, the local homeless facility completed its relocation
               and expansion during this period, growing its capacity from 24 beds to 48 beds
               used to assist homeless families and women in the community. In addition, in
               exchange for a loan increase from the former LMIHF, 5 multi-family units that
               were previously restricted to low-income households were restricted to very-low
               income households.
               Also, on April 13, 2013, the Department of Finance authorized the City Housing
               Successor to access $6.2 million of the 2006 Affordable Housing Bond proceeds
               for the purpose of developing affordable housing. The City is utilizing these funds
               to reopen the Callen Street/Bennett Hill project, which consists of two phases of
               rehabilitation and new construction activity in the Callen Street and Bennett Hill
               areas, resulting in the production of 130 affordable rental units with affordability
               rates at 30 to 60 percent of AMI.
H.1 - I 8      Identify sites that are appropriate for military families based at Travis Air Force
               base and work with Air Force housing officials and non-profit housing groups to
               build off-base housing units that are affordable to active military families at Travis
               AFB.
               Implementation: The City owns an 8.4-acre site, donated by the developer of the
               Alamo Place Subdivision. Upon dedication to the City, this parcel was intended
               to provide affordable housing to military members. In 2004, a 93-unit affordable
               apartment and town home project was approved for the site. The project
               approval lapsed and the non-profit developer is no longer involved in the project.
               The site has been zoned Medium Density. The City shall pursue development of
               the property.
               Implementation Evaluation: With the elimination of Redevelopment in California,
               including the LMIHF, the City of Vacaville did not fund this activity during the
               reporting period. Elimination of the LMIHF will seriously impede the City of
               Vacaville’s ability to meet any future housing goals/obligations.
H.1 - I 9      Continue to implement the Residential Overlay District Ordinance by supporting
               development of apartments on vacant commercial lands, which are appropriate
               sites for multi-family development.
               Implementation: The Community Development Department implements the
               ordinance on a regular basis and will continue to make apartment developers
               aware of the zoning option to request to construct apartments on commercial
               lands as an alternative land use. The Residential Overlay District Ordinance has
               been and will continue to be an effective tool to add multi-family units to the
               City’s housing inventory. To date, several apartment projects have been built as
               a result of implementation of this policy. River Oaks (312 units), Saratoga Phase
               I (108 units), Walnut Grove (117 units), The Commons (208 units), Lincoln

           Corner (134 units) and Northpointe Apartments (312 units) were approved and
           construction is complete. All of these projects were developed at a density at or
           above 20 units per acre.
           Implementation Evaluation: The Land Use and Development Code continues to
           permit Residential Overlay districts within commercially zoned lands. However,
           with the elimination of Redevelopment, including the LMIHF, future activity will be
           impacted. The elimination of redevelopment agencies will seriously impede the
           City of Vacaville’s ability to meet its housing goals/obligations.
H.1 - I 10 Expand the supply of three-bedroom apartments to provide affordable multi-
           family housing for large families and young adult households.
           Implementation: In conjunction with adoption of this Housing Element, the
           Community Development Department will request the Planning Commission to
           initiate an amendment to the Land Use and Development Code to require new
           non-senior apartment projects of over 50 units to include a minimum of 15
           percent three bedroom units. If initiated by the Planning Commission, the
           ordinance amendment will be scheduled for public hearings by May 2011.
           Implementation Evaluation: The Planning Commission chose not to initiate this
           program at their February 19, 2013 meeting, pending additional information. The
           Planning Commission would like to be sure that this requirement does not
           become a financial burden on multi-family developments. The program will be
           taken back to the Planning Commission for further consideration following
           adoption of the General Plan Update, scheduled to occur in 2015. However,
           discussion has begun on a future project in the Rocky Hill Road area that plans
           to incorporate 3- to 4-bedroom apartments in a 41-unit affordable housing
           complex.
H.1 - I 11 Strengthen anti-NIMBY protections including no-net loss housing development
           capacity requirements.
           Implementation: In conjunction with adoption of this Housing Element, the
           Community Development Department will request the Planning Commission to
           initiate an amendment to the Land Use and Development Code to set forth
           specific findings and the required analysis needed in conjunction with
           consideration of rezonings of residential land in order to find that the inventory of
           residential land does not fall below the minimum required to meet the City’s
           housing goals as determined by ABAG. On an ongoing basis, the Community
           Development Department’s Planning Division will incorporate project specific
           conditions of approval as a part of the project entitlement process to require
           identification signs on properties approved for multi-family housing developments
           through specific project entitlements and for sites in master planned areas
           reserved for multi-family development. If initiated by the Planning Commission,
           the ordinance amendment will be scheduled for public hearings by May 2011.
           Implementation Evaluation: The Planning Commission chose not to initiate this
           program at their February 19, 2013 meeting, pending additional information from
           City Staff. The program will be taken back to the Planning Commission for further

H.1 - I 12     Amend the Land Use and Development Code and Zoning Map to identify Special
               Standard Overlay zones that permit Social Services Facilities without a
               conditional use permit.
               Implementation: In 2008 and 2009, the City Council adopted Special Standard
               Overlay Zones in the Callen Street and Bennett Hill Court area that permit the
               development of homeless facilities, transitional housing and related support and
               social services without a conditional use permit. The Vacaville Redevelopment
               Agency owns land in the area which is zoned as Residential High Density.
               Approval was granted to convert existing structures to accommodate a 48-bed
               homeless facility.
               This project will replace and increase the capacity of the existing 24-bed
               Opportunity House homeless facility. The new project will have capacity to serve
               the homeless population documented in the most recent January 29, 2009
               homeless survey. In addition, the Redevelopment Agency owns additional lands
               within the Special Standards Overlay zone, which have the capacity to
               accommodate additional future facilities and programs.
               In conjunction with adoption of this Housing Element, the Community
               Development Department will request the Planning Commission to initiate an
               amendment to the Land Use and Development Code to permit Social Services
               Facilities in the Special Standard Overlay zones (SS-10 and SS-11) located in
               the Callen Street and Bennett Hill Court area If initiated by the Planning
               Commission, the ordinance amendment will be scheduled for public hearings by
               May 2011.
               Implementation Evaluation: The City Council approved Ordinance 1875 on
               September 23, 2014 amending the Land Use and Development Code to permit
               Social Services Facilities, including Emergency Shelters, Transitional Housing
               and Supportive Housing, in the Special Standard Overlay Zones (SS-10 and SS-
               11) without the need of a conditional use permit. The Land Use and Development
               Code will also be revised to ensure that Transitional Housing and Supportive
               Housing are subject to the same restrictions as other residential uses. City
               Council voted to support these amendments at their January 13, 2015 meeting,
               and the amendments will have their second reading for adoptions on January 27,

               Community Development Department will request the Planning Commission to
               initiate an amendment to the Land Use and Development Code to:

           September 23, 2014 amending the Land Use and Development Code definition
           of “Social Service Facilities” to include transitional and supportive housing. The
           Land Use and Development Code will also be revised to ensure that Transitional

           Implementation: In 2008, the City Council adopted the Opportunity Hill Master
           Plan and Design Guidelines. In order to implement the Plan, the City Council also
           initiated a General Plan Amendment to allow up to 65 units per acre within the
           Opportunity Hill Master Plan area. The Opportunity Hill project will intensify land
           uses and revitalize portions of the Downtown Area. Land use recommendations
           identified specialty retail, office uses, housing opportunities (including live/work
           units, for-sale, and affordable housing component), entertainment and restaurant
           uses, and a continuation of heritage tourism that celebrates Vacaville’s rich
           history. This project will be an infill project and the Redevelopment Agency has
           already acquired a significant number of parcels in the area that are now vacant.
           The project will be required to comply with the adopted Master Plan design and
           development guidelines. The Opportunity Hill General Plan and Zoning
           Amendments will be considered with the Comprehensive General Plan Update,
           which was initiated by City Council in March 2010. The Comprehensive General
           Plan Update will occur over a two-year timeframe.
           Implementation Evaluation: The change in General Plan designation for this
           project is currently underway as part of the Comprehensive General Plan
           Update, anticipated to be completed in 2015. After the dissolution of
           Redevelopment in 2012, the properties were transferred to the City as Housing
           Successor to the former Redevelopment Agency. Future activity will be impacted
           by the elimination of redevelopment agencies in the State of California, which
           included the elimination of the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund. The
           elimination of redevelopment agencies will seriously impede the City of
           Vacaville’s ability to meet its housing goals/obligations.
H.1 - I 15 Consider an amendment to the Land Use & Development Code and/or the Single
           Family Design Guidelines to include alternative development and design
           standards for small lot subdivisions, specifically for lots smaller than 5,000
           square feet and for affordable housing developments.
           Implementation: The Community Development Department will coordinate with
           other affected City departments and consult with residential builders to identify
                            City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

               potential design and development standards specific to small-lot single family
               projects and request the Planning Commission to hold a public study session to
               review the potential changes and to consider initiating amendments to the Land
               Use and Development Code and/or Single Family Design Guidelines. The
               purpose of the review will be to identify standards to require such projects to
               include a significant number of smaller floor plans or less than 1,500 square feet
               which are affordable by design and to identify alternative design standards to
               encourage developers to build homes that will be affordable to entry level buyers.
               The Planning Commission will hold a study session and consider initiating
               amendments by December 2012 following completion of the comprehensive
               General Plan Update currently underway.
               Implementation Evaluation: The Planning Commission initiated this amendment
               at their February 19, 2013 meeting. The Planning Commission included 6,000-
               square foot lots into this policy. The Land Use and Development Code will be
               updated following the adoption of the new General Plan, scheduled to occur in
               early 2015.
H.1 - I 16     High Density Residential (RHD) lands identified in the Residential Land Inventory
               shall be required to develop with a minimum density of 20 units per acre.
               Implementation: On an ongoing basis, as a part of the discretionary development
               review process, the Community Development Department will require RHD sites
               to be designed with a minimum density of 20 units per acre in order to implement
               the policies of the Housing Element. All recently approved high density projects
               have been constructed with an average density of 20 units per acre density,
               except for projects with density bonuses approved at higher densities.
               Implementation Evaluation: The General Plan Update process is currently
               underway. The new General Plan is scheduled for adoption in 2015.
H.1 - I 17     Continue to monitor changes in State Law related to housing issues and initiate
               amendments to the Land Use and Development Code as needed to ensure
               consistency of local ordinances with State Law.
               Implementation: Most recently, in 2008, the City Council repealed and replaced
               Chapter 14.09.116 of the Land Use and Development Code relating to the
               Density Bonus. The new Ordinance was written to comply with State Law (SB
               1818 and SB 435). Following the adoption of the Density Bonus Ordinance, a
               new Assembly bill was adopted (AB 2280), which makes a number of changes to
               density bonus law. In conjunction with adoption of the Housing Element, the
               Community Development Department staff will request the Planning Commission
               to initiate an amendment to the Density Bonus Ordinance in order to amend the
               current local regulations to be consistent with State Laws. On an ongoing basis,
               each year, as a part of the preparation of the Status of the General Plan report,
               new state legislation related to housing issues will be reviewed and the
               Community Development Department staff will request the Planning Commission
               to initiate changes to the Land Use and Development Code as required to
               maintain consistency with State Law. If initiated by the Planning Commission, the
               ordinance amendment will be scheduled for public hearings by May 2011.

           Implementation Evaluation: The City continues to monitor changes in State law.
H.1 - I 18 Implement California energy conservation standards.
           Implementation: On an ongoing basis, the Community Development
           Department’s Building Division enforces the state energy standards, as adopted
           and amended by the California Building Standards Commission, as a part of the
           building plan check and permitting process for all residential projects.
           Implementation Evaluation: The Community Development Department’s Building
           Department continues to enforce energy conservation standards as part of the
           permitting process for all residential projects. As part of the General Plan Update
           process, the City is proposing a climate action plan that includes policies
           addressing energy conservation. This document, along with the new General
           Plan, is scheduled for adoption in early 2015.
H.1 - I 19 Implement the California Green Building Standards Building Code.
           Implementation: The California Green Building Standards Code, adopted in July
           2008, went into effect January 2010. The Community Development Department’s
           Building Division has implemented the changes in the Code as they apply to all
           residential projects.
           Implementation Evaluation: The Community Development Department’s Building
           Division has implemented the changes in the Code as they apply to all residential
           projects. The updated Building Code can be found in Division 14.20
           (Construction and Fire Standards) of the City’s Municipal Code.
H.1 - I 20 Encourage energy-conserving development patterns.
           Implementation: On an ongoing basis, as a part of the development review
           process, the Community Development Department will promote neighborhood
           design with pedestrian and bicycle oriented circulation to reduce automobile trips.
           As an example, the Southtown Master Plan incorporates a neighborhood center
           comprised of a central park and neighborhood commercial center which is easily
           accessible by all future residents in the project via pedestrian pathways.
           Implementation Evaluation: The California Green Building Standards Code,
           adopted in July 2008, went into effect January 2010. The Community
           Development Department’s Building Division has implemented the changes in
           the Code as they apply to all residential projects. The updated Building Code can
           be found in Division 14.20 (Construction and Fire Standards) of the City’s
           Municipal Code.
H.1 - I 21 Encourage energy conservation through energy-reducing landscaping,
           orientation and configuration of buildings, site, and other factors affecting energy
           use.
           Implementation: On an ongoing basis, through the building permit process for
           new development, the Community Development Department enforces the water
           efficiency standards for landscaping. Through the environmental review process,
                          City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

8. EVALUATION OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
               energy efficiency is evaluated and where appropriate, mitigation measures are
               required to address landscaping and parking lot shading.
               Implementation Evaluation: The Community Development Department’s Planning
               Division continues to encourage and to evaluate energy conservation measures
               with new development applications. In addition, the City is proposing a climate
               action plan as part of the General Plan Update process, currently underway,
               which includes policies addressing energy conservation. This document, along
               with the new General Plan, is scheduled for adoption in 2015.
H.1 - I 22     Continue to allow manufactured homes on foundations on residential land,
               subject to the same development standards as site-built housing.
               Implementation: The Land Use and Development code permits manufactured
               homes to be constructed in single family zoning districts, subject to the same
               design review process as a site-built house.
               Implementation Evaluation: The Land Use and Development code permits
               manufactured homes to be constructed in single-family zoning districts, subject to
               the same design review process as a site-built house.
H.1 - I 23     The City of Vacaville, in its capacity as the City’s water and sewer service
               provider, will grant priority for service allocations to proposed developments that
               include housing units affordable to lower-income households.
               Implementation: During the review of development entitlements for proposed
               residential projects affordable to very-low and low income households, the
               Community Development Department, in conjunction with the Utilities
               Department, will evaluate wastewater treatment capacity and water allocations
               required to serve the project and give priority for allocations except where
               capacity has already been granted to other approved projects. There are no
               known treatment capacity or water allocation shortfalls which would impede
               residential development during the timeframe of this Housing Element.
               Implementation Evaluation: On April 13, 2013, the Department of Finance (DOF)
               authorized the City, as Housing Successor Agency, to access $6.2 million of the
               2006 Affordable Housing Bond proceeds for the purpose of developing affordable
               housing. The City is utilizing these funds to reopen the Callen Street/Bennett Hill
               areas, which consists of two phases of rehabilitation and new construction
               activity in the Callen Street and Rocky Hill Strategy Areas resulting in the
               production of 130 affordable rental units with affordability rates at 30 to 60
               percent of area median income. In 2013 and the first half of 2014, the Community
               Development Department received applications for both phases of the project.
               However, there was no need to grant priority for service allocations to
               developments that include affordable housing units as there were no treatment
               capacity or water allocation shortfalls during the reporting period.
H.1 - I 24     The City will consider developing a more formalized reasonable accommodation
               procedure that will provide an administrative exception process in zoning and
               land use matters for housing for persons with disabilities.

           Implementation: In conjunction with adoption of this Housing Element, the
           Community Development Department will request the Planning Commission to
           initiate an amendment to the Land Use and Development Code as needed to
           allow a process for reasonable accommodation for housing with persons with
           disabilities. The process may include minimal review by the Planning Director
           and may include the following criteria: the request for reasonable accommodation
           will be used by an individual with a disability protected under fair housing laws;
           the requested accommodation is necessary to make housing available to an
           individual with a disability protected under fair housing laws; the requested
           accommodation would not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on
           the City; the requested accommodation would not require a fundamental
           alteration in the nature of the City's land use and zoning program. In addition, the
           amendment would include provisions to allow accessible ramps for disabled
           persons to be located within required setback areas on lots zoned as single
           family residential. If initiated by the Planning Commission, the ordinance
           amendment will be scheduled for public hearings by May 2011.
           Implementation Evaluation: The City Council approved Ordinance 1875 on
           September 23, 2014 amending the Land Use and Development Code to permit
           exempt accessibility retrofitting to be exempt from setback requirements when
           consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines. The City
           plans to adopt a more formalized reasonable accommodation procedure during
           the 2015-2023 housing cycle as part of the implementation of the comprehensive
           General Plan Update, expected in 2015.
H.1 - I 25 Amend Section 14.09.128.080 (Required Off-Street Parking Designated) of the
           Land Use and Development Code to include parking requirements for studio
           apartments.
           Implementation: In conjunction with adoption of this Housing Element, the
           Community Development Department will request that the Planning Commission
           initiate an amendment to the Land Use and Development Code to include
           parking requirements for studio apartments. If initiated by the Planning
           Commission, the ordinance amendment will be scheduled for public hearings by
           May 2011.
           Implementation Evaluation: The City Council approved Ordinance 1875 on
           September 23, 2014 amending the Land Use and Development Code to include
           parking requirements for studio apartments.
H.1 - I 26 Consider implementation of a program to provide subsidies to partially fund the
           Public Safety Community Facilities District (CFD) costs for affordable multi-family
           housing with long term affordability agreements.
           Implementation: The Community Development Department and the Department
           of Housing & Redevelopment, in coordination with affected City departments,
           shall evaluate the feasibility of the implementation of a new program that would
           provide subsidies to partially fund the ongoing Public Safety Community District
           costs for affordable multi-family housing projects with long-term affordability
           restrictions. The Community Development Department and Department of
           Housing & Redevelopment will study the financial impacts to both the City and
                           City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

               potential developers of affordable housing. If subsidies are determined to be
               feasible, a proposal will be forwarded to the City Council for consideration by
               May 2011.
               Implementation Evaluation: The source of funding for this activity was the
               Redevelopment Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Fund (LMIHF) that was
               eliminated on February 1, 2012 when Redevelopment was eliminated in
               California. Future activity will be impacted due to elimination of the LMIHF and
               will seriously impede the City of Vacaville’s ability to meet its housing
               goals/obligations.

Guiding Policies
H.2 - G 1      Maintain Vacaville’s housing stock in sound condition.
H.2 - G 2      Preserve and protect historical and architectural resources.
H.2 - G 3      Take action to preserve existing housing and neighborhoods.

               affordable to the intended income groups.
Implementing Policies
H.2 - I 1      Continue to enforce housing affordability agreements between the owners and
               the City/Redevelopment Agency.
               Implementation: This is ongoing and enforced by the Department of Housing &
               Redevelopment. Currently there are 103 affordability agreements covering 967
               units, including homes purchased under the City’s Shared Equity Loan Program.
               During the planning period, it is expected that the Department will annually
               monitor up to 200 agreements covering 1,500 units.
               Implementation Evaluation: With the elimination of the Redevelopment Agency,
               the funding source for this activity was also eliminated. However, the City of
               Vacaville elected to become the housing successor to the former Redevelopment
               Agency and continues to monitor existing and new affordability agreements.
               Currently, the Department of Housing Services Department monitors 126
               agreements covering 1,007 units.
H.2 - I 2      Continue to operate and expand below-market-rate loan programs for the
               acquisition and/or rehabilitation (including installation of weatherization
               measures) of housing occupied by lower-income owners and renters.
               Implementation: This is an ongoing effort by the Department of Housing &
               Redevelopment. During the planning period, 150 units will be acquired and/or
               rehabilitated, and all will have long-term affordability agreements. Of the 150
               units, 120 will be affordable for households with incomes below 60 percent of
               median. 10 units will be affordable for households with extremely low incomes

          below 30 percent of median. Approximately $2.5 million of Redevelopment LIHF
          will be used for owner occupied rehabilitation, and $13.5 million will be used for
          rental acquisition and/or rehabilitation over the planning period of this Housing
          Element. Of the $13.5 million of the LIHF for acquisition and/or rehabilitation, $1
          million will be used to subsidize 10 units, which will be affordable for households
          with income below 30 percent of the area median income.
          In addition, the Department of Housing and Redevelopment will apply to State
          HCD for approximately $3 million of HOME funds and will assist non-profit
          owners to apply for approximately $20 million of tax-exempt bond, tax credit, and
          private financing. Approximately $65,000 per year of CDBG funds are used for
          the administration of the rehabilitation programs. To date, 74 rental units have
          been acquired and/or rehabilitated. During the planning period, 90 owner-
          occupied units will be rehabilitated.
          Of the 90 single-family homes, 50 will be owners with very-low incomes below 50
          percent of median, 20 will have low incomes below 80 percent of median and 20
          will have incomes below 120 percent of median.
          Implementation Evaluation: With the elimination of the Redevelopment Agency,
          the funding source for this activity was also eliminated. However, during the
          reporting period the following activities were executed:
          • 27 Owner-Occupied Rehabilitation loans.
          • 2 Owner-Investor Rehabilitation loans.
          • 17 First Time Home Buyer/Rehabilitation loans with recipients between 30
               and 120 percent of AMI.
          In May 2009, the City and Agency’s non-profit affordable housing partner,
          Vacaville Community Housing (VCH), submitted a request for assistance to
          address financial and property issues that were revealed as part of significant
          organizational changes that gave the non-profit the ability to better assess its
          housing stock and fiscal position. A $3 million, 0%, 55-year loan was funded over
          three years to perform necessary capital improvements to various affordable
          housing properties. Improvements included rehabilitation of 12 units of affordable
          housing that were previously vacant.
H.2 - I 3 Continue to operate and expand the HUD funded Housing Choice Voucher
          Program to preserve the stock of existing housing.
          Implementation: A key component of the Housing Choice Voucher Program is
          the requirement that all housing owners participating in the program comply with
          Housing Quality Standards (HQS). The Department of Housing &
          Redevelopment, which provides staffing for the Vacaville Housing Authority
          (VHA), inspects each unit at move-in and annually thereafter to ensure HQS
          compliance. Special inspections may also be conducted at the request of the
          landlord or the tenant. Information regarding the rehabilitation loan programs is
          provided to owners, who are encouraged to participate.
          At this time there are 1,143 Housing Choice Vouchers. The VHA will apply for
          and accept additional vouchers as they become available.

8. EVALUATION OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
               Implementation Evaluation: The Vacaville Housing Authority (VHA) increased its
               available vouchers by 50, for a total of 1,193 authorized Housing Choice
               Vouchers, to provide rental assistance to extremely low- and very-low-income
               senior, disabled, and “working poor” households each month. In 2011, the VHA
               was selected to receive funding in the amount of $381,894 to support the 50
               additional vouchers for the Family Unification Program. The Family Unification
               Program vouchers support families for whom the lack of adequate housing is the
               primary factor in separation, or the threat of imminent separation, of children from
               their families, and youths 18 to 21 years old who left foster care at age 16 or
               older and lack adequate housing. The VHA also conducted approximately 1,299
               Housing Quality Standards inspections on an annual basis, which ensures the
               habitability and preservation of the Housing Choice Voucher units.
H.2 - I 4      Continue to enforce the Public Nuisance Ordinance (PNO) to encourage property
               maintenance and to promote improved quality of life in Vacaville’s communities.
               Implementation: This ordinance is enforced by the Department of Housing &
               Redevelopment. The Department of Housing & Redevelopment receives and
               investigates approximately 2,000 calls per year regarding the PNO. These
               calls/cases relate to property accumulations, overgrown vegetation, abandoned
               vehicles, etc. By working with the responsible party to correct the violations, the
               overall quality of life is preserved and/or enhanced in the neighborhood. The City
               established the Neighborhood Team (a multi-disciplinary approach) to respond to
               concerns about and take action to reverse neighborhood decline and prevent
               blight. Some of the Neighborhood Team’s activities have included coordinating
               with public safety efforts such as Neighborhood Watch, Neighborhood Forums,
               Neighborhood Clean Up and Spruce Up Days, installation of landscaping and
               entryway features, multi-disciplinary approaches to enforcement of serious
               offenders, and encouraging participation in the City’s Crime Free Multi-Housing
               Program.
               Implementation Evaluation: In 2012, the Code Enforcement Program was
               merged into the Fire Department. In 2013, the Fire Department Code
               Enforcement Division resolved 561 graffiti cases and 439 occupied property
               cases, inspected 38 vacant buildings/homes, ensured 814 undeveloped lots met
               weed abatement requirements, addressed 14 cases involving homeless
               encampments, and addressed 19 cases involving the keeping of chickens within
               City limits. The Vacaville Police Department is responsible for addressing
               vehicular abatement occurring within the public right-of-way. In 2013, the Police
               Department resolved 1,250 vehicular abatement cases. With the elimination of
               the Redevelopment Agency, the funding source for the Neighborhood Team was
               also eliminated. However, the implementation efforts of this former group are still
               underway. Affordability covenants for affordable housing developments continue
               to require participation in the City of Vacaville Police Department’s Crime Free
               Multi-Housing Program. Other multi-family and mobile home park owners
               participate on a voluntary basis
H.2 - I 5      Continue to enforce the Condominium Conversion Ordinance.
               Implementation: Passed in 1982, this ordinance states that no applications for
               conversion will be accepted if the apartment vacancy rate is below three percent.
                               City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element
                                                 Page 156

                                                   8. EVALUATION OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
          The Department of Housing and Redevelopment conducts an annual vacancy
          survey to determine the current vacancy rate. On an ongoing basis, the
          Community Development Department enforces the Condominium Conversion
          Ordinance by accepting applications for conversions only when the citywide
          apartment vacancy rate is above 3 percent. In conjunction with the adoption of
          this Housing Element, the Community Development Department will request the
          Planning Commission to initiate an amendment to the ordinance to include
          provisions to protect existing tenant rights during the conversion process
          including first right-of-refusal for purchase. In addition, in order to conserve
          affordable housing for seniors on a fixed income, consideration will be given to
          include provisions in the ordinance to require the annual vacancy survey to
          separately document the vacancy rate for senior-restricted apartments and
          preclude conversions of senior units when the senior apartments vacancy rate is
          below 3 percent. If initiated by the Planning Commission, the ordinance
          amendment will be scheduled for public hearings by May 2011.
          Implementation Evaluation: In February 2013, the City Council approved an
          amendment to the Condominium Conversion ordinance that prevents the
          conversion of senior apartments if the senior restricted apartment rate falls below
          3 percent. The Condominium Conversion Ordinance is part of the Land Use and
          Development Code. The Land Use and Development Code will be updated
          following the adoption of the new General Plan, scheduled to occur in 2015.
H.2 - I 6 Assist in maintaining the affordability of units produced through federal and state
          programs by working with appropriate organizations to identify units which may
          convert to market-rate units, analyzing the cost keeping the units as affordable,
          and taking measures to ensure continued affordability or providing assistance to
          residents if the affordability of the units is removed.
          Implementation: This is an ongoing program by the Department of Housing and
          Redevelopment. There are two complexes which have affordability agreements
          with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) which
          terminate during this planning period. The first, Autumn Leaves is an age-
          restricted complex and has an affordability agreement which expires in 2010. All
          56 units have project based Section 8 assistance. It is highly unlikely that this
          complex will terminate its agreement. The project was constructed under the
          HUD 202 program and is owned by a private, non-profit housing corporation. If
          the present owner entity does sell the complex, it will be sold to another non-
          profit entity. At that time, DHR would work with the current and/or new owner to
          ensure that the units continue to remain permanently affordable. The second
          complex, Twin Oaks, has 45 units. Their affordability agreement expires in
          October, 2013. At this time, there is no information available to determine the
          likelihood that Twin Oaks will terminate their agreement. However, historically
          when properties terminate affordability agreements with HUD, HUD has offered
          what is called a Preservation Voucher for each affected tenant to ensure the
          continued affordability of their housing. In these cases, DHR (as the Vacaville
          Housing Authority, or VHA) has been invited to accept and administer these
          vouchers. Should Twin Oaks terminate their affordability agreement and should
          HUD extend a similar invitation, the VHA will accept and administer any such
          vouchers.

8. EVALUATION OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
               Implementation Evaluation: In 2010, Autumn Leaves, a senior housing
               community, renewed its project-based Section 8 affordability agreement under
               the HUD 202 program. The present owner entity intends to maintain affordability
               indefinitely. If the present owner entity does sell the complex, it will be sold to
               another non-profit entity. At that time, the Department of Housing Services would
               work with the current and/or new owner to ensure that the units continue to
               remain permanently affordable. In 2013, Twin Oaks apartments qualified for a
               FHA pilot program under the California Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)
               program, securing $4.2 million for rehab on 45 affordable housing units. The
               affordability requirements under the LIHTC program will extend an additional 35
               years.
H.2 - I 7      Support the development of Extremely Low Income rental housing by seeking
               additional funding sources from State and Federal resources.
               Implementation: The Department of Housing and Redevelopment will continue to
               seek out additional funding sources to support the development of Extremely
               Low Income rental housing. The Department of Housing and Redevelopment will
               apply for development funding from the new National Housing Trust Fund when
               the program becomes available in 2010.
               In addition, the Department of Housing and Redevelopment will continue to apply
               annually for the HOME federal grant, during the annual application cycle, which
               is typically during the summer months. Funds received from this grant will be
               allocated to the development of housing affordable to extremely low, very low,
               and low-income households.
               Implementation Evaluation: On April 13, 2013, the Department of Finance (DOF)
               authorized the City, as Housing Successor Agency, to access $6.2 million of the
               2006 Affordable Housing Bond proceeds for the purpose of developing
               affordable housing. The City is utilizing these funds to reopen the Callen Street
               project, which consists of two phases of rehabilitation and new construction
               activity in the Callen Street and Bennett Hill areas resulting in the production of
               130 affordable rental units with affordability rates at 30 to 60 percent of area
               median income. This project is using additional funding from State Tax Credits.
H.2 - I 8      Continue to Promote Community Viability through Comprehensive Neighborhood
               Revitalization in Target Areas.
               Implementation: The draft 2009/11 City of Vacaville Strategic Plan identifies a
               goal to continue comprehensive neighborhood revitalization activities in targeted
               areas. This project will continue Neighborhood Team efforts to improve the
               physical and social conditions of targeted neighborhoods experiencing a decline
               in their quality of life.
               Implementation Evaluation: With the elimination of the Redevelopment Agency,
               the funding source for the Neighborhood Team was also eliminated. However,
               the implementation efforts of this former group are still underway. During the past
               year, the City of Vacaville committed funds to The Leaven, a faith-based
               organization to provide supportive services to the children residing in the
               Opportunity House, the recently expanded and rehabilitated local homeless
                                City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

          shelter. In addition, the City has worked closely with the local non-profit
          affordable housing provider, Vacaville Community Housing, Inc., which will
          release a Request for Proposals for social services at its multi-family units.
          Vacaville Community Housing, Inc. recently completed a $3 million capital
          improvement rehabilitation project through a loan provided by the former City of
          Vacaville Redevelopment Agency.
          The City also is in the process of transferring 0.94 acres on Rocky Hill Road to
          the Vacaville Storehouse for development of a community garden that will serve
          nearby tenants of affordable housing. The community garden will be located
          directly north of the Rocky Hill Trail project. The Rocky Hill Trail is an unofficial
          local foot path forged through historic railroad right-of-ways connecting Holly
          Lane to E. Monte Vista Avenue. The Rocky Hill trail project will create an
          alternative safe and secure walking and biking path and open space area that
          connects affordable housing to amenities and increases neighborhood
          walkability.
H.2 - I 9 Continue the Process of Acquiring and Converting Market Rate Multi-family
          Rental Housing Units In The Callen Street/Bennett Hill Drive/Bennett Hill Court
          Revitalization Area for the Purpose of Substantial Rehabilitation and Converting
          the Units to Affordable Housing Units.
          Implementation: In 2006, the City of Vacaville Redevelopment Agency issued
          taxable housing bonds in the amount of $18 million for the purpose of acquiring
          and converting market rate multi-family rental housing units in the Callen Street,
          Bennett Hill Drive/Bennett Hill Court revitalization area. A portion of these funds
          were used, along with Low Income Housing Set-Aside funds, to acquire 17 four-
          plexes, three duplexes, and one eight-plex. With acquisitions complete, the
          Agency is soliciting responses to a request for Qualifications/Request for
          Proposals (“RFQ/RFP”) for the rehabilitation and management of 58 of the 82
          multi-family housing units on 16 separate Agency-owned parcels.
          Bond proceeds are expected to be used to conduct a portion of the rehabilitation
          portion of the project. Eight of the units not included in the RFQ/RFP at this time
          are to be rehabilitated for the purpose of relocating and expanding the
          Opportunity House Shelter (see Chapter 2 for more information). The Agency is
          seeking a partnership with a non-profit organization that will promote the
          substantial rehabilitation of eight additional Agency-owned units to provide
          transitional, supportive, and/or other affordable housing opportunities in the
          neighborhood. For more information regarding the Callen Street Rehabilitation
          project, see Section 6.5 in Chapter 6.
          Implementation Evaluation: In 2012, prior to the elimination of Redevelopment
          Agencies, Vacaville Redevelopment Agency completed the acquisition of 1718
          four-plexes, 3 duplexes, and one eight-plex using Low and Moderate Income
          Housing Funds and Affordable Housing Bond proceeds. Since that time, the local
          homeless facility relocated and doubled its capacity from 24 beds to 48 beds
          used to assist homeless families and women in the community. This was
          accomplished through demolition and rehabilitation of one four-plex and one
          eight-plex on Bennett Hill Court/Drive. This facility location is permanently
          affordable through a deed restriction. On April 13, 2013, the Department of
                          City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

               Finance (DOF) authorized the City to access $6.2 million of the 2006 Affordable
               Housing Bond proceeds for the purpose of developing affordable housing. The
               City is utilizing these funds to reopen the Callen Street/Bennett Hill project,
               which consists of two phases of rehabilitation and new construction activity in the
               Callen Street and Bennett Hill areas resulting in the production of 130 affordable
               rental units with affordability rates at 30 to 60 percent of area median income. In
               March 2014, Phase 1 Bennett Hill/Callen project began the rehabilitation of 64
               units in the Rocky Hill and Bennett Hill area, scheduled to completed in March
               2015.
               Phase II Bennett Hill/Callen includes the demolition/ new construction and
               rehabilitation of 66 units on Callen Street with affordability levels of 30 to 60
               percent of AMI. In August 2014, the City Council approved the disposition,
               development and loan agreement with the developer, and the Planning
               Commission approved the Planning applications for the reconstruction of these
               units.
8.3     HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICES
Guiding Policies
H.3 - G 1      Promote equal housing opportunity for all.
H.3 - G 2      Assist in the providing of direct assistance to households in need of housing.
Implementing Policies
H.3 - I 1      Work to ensure that individuals seeking housing in Vacaville are not
               discriminated against on the basis of age, sex, family structure, national origin, or
               other arbitrary factors.
               Implementation: This is an ongoing effort through the Department of Housing
               and Redevelopment’s Housing Counseling Center programs, consisting of many
               different activities such as Fair Housing Month, tenant/landlord counseling, and
               providing assistance with filing a fair housing complaint.
               Equal access to housing is protected by state and federal law. Discrimination on
               the basis of race, ethnic or national origin, religion or marital status is prohibited
               by the federal Civil Rights Act of 1968 and by Section 53 of the California Unruh
               Civil Rights Act. The federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 prohibits
               discrimination based on age, handicap and familial status. The Rumford Fair
               Housing Law (part of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act of 1980)
               also protects an individual's access to housing.
               The California Supreme Court ruled that discrimination against children in
               housing is prohibited under the Unruh Civil Rights Act in its decision, Marina Pt.
               Ltd. v. Wolfson, (1982) 30 Cal.3d 721. The Fair Housing Amendments Act also
               prohibits discrimination against children. Mobile home parks and other
               developments designed specifically for seniors or persons with disabilities are
               exempt from these provisions against child discrimination.

                                         8. EVALUATION OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
The City of Vacaville will actively promote fair housing opportunities through its
Housing Counseling Center programs, various financial assistance initiatives,
and affordable housing/neighborhood revitalization programs. The City’s HUD-
certified Housing Counseling Center will continue to provide information and
referral to landlords, tenants, homeowners, potential homeowners and people
experiencing homelessness on a wide variety of topics including landlord/tenant
disputes, finding and securing housing, housing discrimination (including referral
to the appropriate investigative and enforcement entity), foreclosure prevention
counseling, reverse mortgage certification, home education training, etc. to
individuals in need of services. The Housing Counseling Center will actively
promote fair housing education by sponsoring, in partnership with others, Fair
Housing Workshops, Landlord Training and Tenant Credit Repair Workshops.
Housing Counseling staff will continue to work closely with local faith-based
organizations, local non-profit agencies, Legal Services of Northern California,
the California Rental Apartment Association, and the federal Department of
Housing and Urban Development to ensure community support for fair housing
concerns and provide over 3,000 housing and family resource services each
year.
The City will continue to celebrate Fair Housing Month each April by promoting
youth and adult education and outreach activities which may include essay,
poetry, and art contests in the schools and Vacaville Neighborhood Boys and
Girls Clubs; public service announcements and features on the local television
cable channel; newspaper articles and editorials; public forums and workshops.
In addition, all Department of Housing and Redevelopment publications will
include the Fair Housing logo.
The primary funding for these services are the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, through its CDBG and Housing Counseling programs
(approximately $50,000 per year), and the Redevelopment LIHF (approximately
$75,000 per year).
Implementation Evaluation: Due to the elimination of Redevelopment, the
supportive funding for the Housing Counseling Center programs was eliminated
and the Center was closed in 2012. The Department of Housing Services
recently renewed the certification for the City of Vacaville Housing Counseling
Center (VHCC) through the US Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD). As a certified Housing Counseling Agency, limited programs have been
reopened to ensure that homebuyers receive as much information and education
as possible to help them become successful homeowners over the long term.
In 2009 an Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice in the City of
Vacaville was prepared in accordance with 24 CFR 91.225(a)(1) regulations as
required by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Entitlement program. The
analysis identifies impediments to fair housing choice within Vacaville and
establishes actions to overcome the effects of these impediments. The City
conducted this analysis by evaluating its current fair housing profile, identifying
impediments to fair housing choice, and assessing current public/private fair
housing programs and activities. In addition to reviewing public policies and
actions, the City also contacted local banks and mortgage companies to review

H.3 - I 2      Provide technical and/or support services to non-profit and agencies and other
               entities serving the homeless.
               Implementation: This is an ongoing effort by the Department of Housing and
               Redevelopment. The City will assist Vacaville Social Services Corporation,
               Vacaville Community Welfare Association, The Salvation Army, and the Solano
               County Continuum of Care Consortium, as well as others who provide homeless
               services through the provision of technical and/or support assistance. As each
               entity has different needs, the City will provide technical support in those areas
               that would ensure the ongoing viability of the agency and the services the entity
               provides. Some of these technical and/or support services may include providing
               staff, counseling or meeting space; assisting in the development of funding
               proposals; securing partners for potential projects; participating on collaboratives
               or boards that address the issues of homelessness; provide on-site training for
               program participants or agency staff; and/or determining eligibility to receive
               homeless services. Included in these services is the provision of 54,000 facility
               nights at the homeless facility in Vacaville, Opportunity House, and assisting
               between five to ten families per year with transitional housing.
               Implementation Evaluation: The February 1, 2012 elimination of Redevelopment
               in California, including the Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Fund (LMIHF),
               has severely impacted the City of Vacaville's ability to fund new affordable
               housing activities including those targeted to the homeless. However, the local
               homeless facility completed its relocation and expansion during this period,
               growing its capacity from 24 beds to 48 beds used to assist homeless families
               and women in the community through assistance from the former
               Redevelopment Agency. The expansion and relocation was made possible
               through the City’s Department of Housing Service’s work with Vacaville
               Community Housing (VCH, a local non-profit affordable housing provider), which
               owned the previous facility and facility site (Opportunity House), and through a
               partnership with Vacaville Social Services Corporation (VSSC, the local non-
               profit that operated the facility). Relocation was completed during 2012-2013.
               Funding for the project was secured through upfront cash from VSSC, a
               $480,000 donation from VCH, a capital campaign by VSSC, and a deferred
               acquisition loan from the City for the purchase of City property. The new facility
               opened its doors in October 2012. In addition, the City continues to participate on
               collaboratives and boards that address the issues of homelessness such as the
               Housing First Continuum of Care and CAP Solano JPA.
H.3 - I 3      Continue to support the Vacaville Community Welfare Association’s (VCWA)
               emergency housing program.
               Implementation: This is an ongoing program by the Department of Housing and
               Redevelopment. The partnership between the City and VCWA to provide
               emergency housing through motel vouchers will continue during the upcoming
               Housing Element period. DHR staff will provide outreach, intake, verification, and
               record-keeping services to the VCWA, which uses United Way and Federal
               Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funds to provide 300 emergency
                               City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

          vouchers per year for households to stay overnight at motels. The program often
          bridges the gap between moving to a new housing unit, securing space at
          Opportunity House (the emergency shelter), or arranging to stay with family or
          friends.
          The City will also provide support for other emergency housing related programs
          and activities. It will conduct screening for the Season of Sharing and Youth
          connections programs. The two privately funded programs provide emergency
          rental assistance to approximately 250 eligible lower-income Vacaville
          households each year. In addition, staff will screen for eligibility for utilities
          assistance on behalf of PG&E.
          Implementation Evaluation: VCWA no longer has funding for the emergency
          housing program. VCWA provides the Vacaville Family Resource Center (FRC),
          which is under the Police Department, $200 per month for food and gas
          vouchers. FRC staff assesses the family or individual’s needs and provides the
          voucher accordingly. The FRC provides assistance to approximately 96
          families/individuals per year.
          The FRC staff also screens for the Seasons of Sharing program. Last year,
          2013, the FRC assisted 41 families in receiving $23,405 of rental assistance
          funds. The FRC also assists low-income families with basic needs (food, utilities,
          rental assistance). Last year 2013 the FRC assisted 115 families through Solano
          Youth Connection (County Grant), 62 families through the Kaiser Grant, and 60
          families through First 5 Grant. In addition, FRC staff assists families with Low
          Income Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) applications. Yearly, the FRC
          staff submits approximately 120 HEAP applications and about 90 percent receive
          assistance.
H.3 - I 4 Continue to operate and expand the HUD Housing Choice Voucher program and
          other related rent subsidy programs.
          Implementation: This is an ongoing program by the Department of Housing and
          Redevelopment. The Housing Choice Voucher Program will continue to be
          administered on behalf of the Vacaville Housing Authority (VHA) by the
          Department of Housing and Redevelopment. The funding level for this program
          is approximately $10 million per year or $75 million during the planning period.
          This program provides monthly rent subsidies for very-low-income households.
          Seventy-five percent of newly admitted households must have incomes below 30
          percent of area median. Currently the VHA has 1,143 vouchers to assist eligible
          households.
          In 2009 and again in 2010, VHA applied for 50 family unification vouchers.
          Family unification vouchers are made available to families for whom the lack of
          adequate housing is a primary factor in the separation, or threat of imminent
          separation, of children from their families or in the prevention of reunifying the
          children with their families. Family unification vouchers enable these families to
          lease or purchase decent, safe and sanitary housing that is affordable in the
          private housing market. As required by State law, if the City U.S. Department of
          Housing and Urban Development (HUD), if VHA receives these additional
          housing vouchers, 75 percent, or 38 vouchers, will be allocated to extremely low-
                          City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element
                                            Page 163

               income households. The VHA will continue to apply for additional Housing
               Choice Vouchers as additional federal and state funding becomes available.
               The VHA has also implemented a “Section 8 Homeownership” Program to
               provide homeownership opportunities for eligible lower-income households.
               Implementation Evaluation: The Vacaville Housing Authority (VHA) increased its
               available vouchers by 50, for a total of 1,193 authorized Housing Choice
               Vouchers to provide rental assistance to extremely low- and very-low-income
               senior, disabled, and “working poor” households each month. In April 2011, the
               VHA was successful in receiving 50 additional Family Unification Program
               vouchers from HUD, which are currently being administered. The VHA continues
               to implement its Section 8 Homeownership Program. There are currently 7
               households that have been successful in moving to homeownership through the
               mortgage subsidy this program provides.
H.3 - I 5      Continue to provide mortgage subsidies to increase affordability to levels below
               50 percent of median.
               Implementation: This is an ongoing program by the Department of Housing and
               Redevelopment. When possible, LMIHF and HOME funds will be used to
               increase affordability to a greater degree than might be allowed by other funding
               sources participating in a project. For example, tax-exempt bond and tax credit
               financing require income levels at 50 percent and 60 percent of median. When
               feasible, LIHF and/or HOME funds will be loaned in exchange for affordability
               below 50 percent of median.
               Implementation Evaluation: On April 13, 2013, the Department of Finance (DOF)
               authorized the City, as Housing Successor, to access $6.2 million of the 2006
               Affordable Housing Bond proceeds for the purpose of developing affordable
               housing. The City is utilizing these funds to reopen the Callen Street/Bennett Hill
               project, which consists of two phases of rehabilitation and new construction
               activity in the Callen Street and Rocky Hill Strategy Areas resulting in the
               production of 130 affordable rental units with affordability rates at 30, 50, and 60
               percent of area median income. In addition, in exchange for a loan increase from
               the former LMIHF, 5 multi-family units that were previously restricted to low-
               income households (households earning less than 80 percent of AMI) were
               restricted to very low income households (households earning less than 50
               percent of AMI).
H.3 - I 6      Continue to provide First Time Homebuyer opportunities through various funding
               mechanisms including down payment loans, shared equity loans, the
               Neighborhood Stabilization Program, and homebuyers education activities.
               Implementation: This is an ongoing program implemented by the Department of
               Housing and Redevelopment. The City will continue to provide a Down Payment
               Assistance Loan program using Redevelopment Low-Income Housing Funds.
               This program permits first time homebuyer households making up to 120 percent
               of median income to be eligible for $15,000 (maximum award). The City will also
               continue to provide Shared Equity loans to households making up to 100 percent
               of median income, with a maximum loan amount of $50,000 for first time
                               City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

          homebuyers. In addition, through the Neighborhood Stabilization Program,
          households will be able to apply for down payment loans to purchase foreclosed
          homes, contingent upon funding. It is estimated that the City will be able to assist
          375 first-time homebuyers during the reporting period using $3.5 million of LIHF
          and revolving loan fund repayments.
          The City will also continue to provide homebuyer education through the Housing
          Counseling Program’s Homebuyer Education and Learning Program.
          Unfortunately, until the issue with the Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund
          (ERAF) is resolved, many of Vacaville’s affordable housing programs, including
          the First Time Homebuyers program, have been suspended.
          Implementation Evaluation: Until the dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency,
          the City continued to fund First Time Homebuyer loans with its Low and
          Moderate Income Housing Fund monies, HOME funds, and Neighborhood
          Stabilization Funds. Since dissolution, the city has continued to fund down
          payment assistance loans with funds obtained from an HCD funded Cal HOME
          grant for low-income Vacaville residents to purchase their first homes. In 2013,
          the City funded 12 such loans, totaling $379,072. Three of these households had
          incomes under 80 percent of AMI. During 2013, the City also coordinated a
          number of first-time homebuyers workshops that were attended by 87 potential
          homebuyers. This activity had been suspended due to the elimination of the
          Redevelopment Agency and its Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Fund
          (LMIHF), however, was recently re-started. A Homebuyer Education and
          Learning Program course was held in November, 2014 with 7 participants and
          additional courses are scheduled through the end of the 2014 calendar year.
          Prior to the dissolution of Redevelopment, the Agency originated 166 Down
          Payment Assistance Loans, Neighborhood Stabilization Program loans, Shared
          Equity Loans and HOME First-Time Homebuyer loans.
H.3 - I 7 Continue to implement relocation plans for households displaced as a result of
          local public action.
          The City’s policy is to avoid displacing households as a result of local public
          action. However, when households are to be relocated, the Department of
          Housing and Redevelopment will strive to make the relocation a positive
          experience for the household being relocated. In most cases, the purpose of the
          relocation will be to remove blight, dilapidated structures and to assist
          households to move from substandard housing to decent, safe and sanitary
          housing.
          Staff will meet with each household facing relocation to determine their needs
          and housing preferences. If appropriate, the household will be offered assistance
          through the Housing Choice Voucher program or relocation benefits provided in
          accordance with State Relocation Law. The assistance will include referrals to
          available housing and payments for moving expenses and relocation.
          Implementation Evaluation: Five households were relocated in accordance with
          relocation plans during the planning period and were provided with relocation
          benefits in accordance with State Relocation Law. One household retained their
          Housing Choice Voucher program assistance when they moved.

8. EVALUATION OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
H.3 - 1.8      As appropriate, work to ensure that new and rehabilitated affordable units, in
               particular multi-family units, are developed with supportive services, such as
               child care, English as a second language, and job training, nearby or as a
               component of the development.
               Implementation: The Department of Housing and Redevelopment, in
               cooperation with the Department of Community Development, will evaluate
               opportunities on an ongoing basis. The provision of child care and job training, in
               conjunction with multi-family housing developments, will better serve the
               residents, improve a parent’s ability to find and access employment, and reduce
               vehicle trips. Childcare, when it is affordable and of high quality, can enable a
               parent to move towards economic self-sufficiency.
               Implementation Evaluation: During the past year, the City of Vacaville committed
               funds to The Leaven, a faith-based organization to provide supportive services to
               the children residing in the Opportunity House, the recently expanded and
               rehabilitated local homeless facility. In addition, the City has worked closely with
               the local non-profit affordable housing provider, Vacaville Community Housing,
               Inc., which will release a Request for Proposals for social services at its multi-
               family units. In addition, the two phase development on Callen Street will include
               community space where supportive services can be provided to the
               development.
H.3 - I 9      Continue to provide housing counseling assistance to residents to help preserve
               homeownership and rental tenancy.
               Implementation: The Department of Housing and Redevelopment will continue
               to provide a wide range of housing counseling services, including landlord/tenant
               rights and responsibilities; foreclosure prevention counseling and workshops;
               credit counseling and workshops; reverse mortgage counseling and certification;
               and intake and referral for emergency facility, food, transportation, and rent
               assistance to households of which 90 percent will have incomes below the local
               area moderate income level. This program is funded by HUD and the local
               Redevelopment LIHF, which will provide approximately $375,000 during the
               planning period of this Housing Element.
               Implementation Evaluation: Due to the elimination of Redevelopment, the
               supportive funding for the Housing Counseling Center programs was eliminated
               and the Center was closed in 2012. The Department of Housing Services
               recently renewed the certification for the City of Vacaville Housing Counseling
               Center (VHCC) through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
               Development (HUD). As a certified Housing Counseling Agency, limited
               programs have been reopened to ensure that homebuyers receive as much
               information and education as possible to help them become successful
               homeowners over the long term.
H.3 - I 10     Continue to conduct Code compliance activities to ensure vacant homes do not
               become nuisances and contribute to neighborhood blight.

           Implementation: The City's Public Nuisance Ordinance requires owners of vacant
           buildings to maintain them and to register them with the Department of Housing
           and Redevelopment’s Code Compliance Division if the buildings are anticipated
           to be vacant for more than 30 days. The Neighborhood Services Division will
           continue to identify and inspect vacant buildings and require that violations be
           corrected in a timely manner to ensure that vacant properties, especially units in
           the foreclosure process, do not become blighted and undermine neighborhood
           stability. This program is primarily funded by the City’s General Fund. It is
           estimated that $525,000 of the LIHF will be used for this program during the
           planning period of this Housing Element.
           Implementation Evaluation: In 2012, the Code Enforcement Program was
           merged into the Fire Department. In 2013, the Fire Department Code
           Enforcement Division resolved 561 graffiti cases and 439 occupied property
           cases, inspected 38 vacant buildings or homes, ensured 814 undeveloped lots
           met weed abatement requirements, addressed 14 cases involving homeless
           encampments, and addressed 19 cases involving the keeping of chickens within
           city limits. The Vacaville Police Department is responsible for addressing
           vehicular abatement occurring within the public right-of-way. In 2013, the Police
           Department resolved 1,169 vehicular abatement cases.
H.3 - I 11 Continue to address the needs of local military personnel and their families.
           Implementation: The Housing and Redevelopment Department and City
           Manager’s Office will continue to participate in the Travis Regional Armed Forces
           Committee (TRAFC) to discuss the needs of military personnel and their families.
           Implementation Evaluation: The City continues to work closely with Travis Air
           Force Base to help meet the needs of local military personnel and their families.
H.3 - I 12 Continue to activate and operate emergency cooling and warming centers at the
           City’s community centers during times of extreme weather, which are available to
           all City residents. In addition, the City will activate and operate emergency
           shelters during catastrophic events requiring emergency evacuations of City
           residents.
           Implementation: The Community Services Department will collaborate with the
           Public Information Officer and Fire Department to develop operational
           protocols/guidelines for activation of the City’s Emergency Shelters. These
           protocols/guidelines will be developed by June 2010 and added to the City’s
           Emergency Operations Plan. The Community Services Department will
           collaborate with the American Red Cross and local Health and Human Service
           agencies to offer new and refresher trainings on shelter activation and
           management, and common shelter clientele needs such as homelessness,
           medical, mental, emotional needs and/or support.
           Implementation Evaluation: The City continues to activate and operate
           emergency cooling and warming centers during times of extreme weather.

H.3 - I 14     Collaborate with local faith-based organizations to develop appropriate housing
               and support services to implement a “Housing First” or similar type program.
               Implementation: On April 13, 2010, the City Council considered and supported
               the proposed housing programs identified in a report, the “Report on
               Homelessness,” about homelessness in Vacaville. As identified in the report, the
               City will collaborate with local faith-based organization to develop appropriate
               housing and support services. Specifically, the Redevelopment Agency intends
               on renting two properties, comprised of eight rental units, to a local faith-based
               organization, at a subsidized rate for the purpose of creating transitional housing
               for homeless individuals and families. The two properties are located on Callen
               Street and are part of the Callen Street Rehabilitation Project, discussed in detail
               in Section 6.5 of this document. The properties are located within the SS-11
               zoning overlay district, which permits transitional housing without the need for a
               Conditional Use Permit.
               Implementation Evaluation: The City continues to collaborate with local faith-
               based organizations to develop appropriate housing and support services.
H.3 - I 15     Continue working with local faith-based organizations to create a Nomadic
               Shelter Program.
               Implementation: On April 13, 2010, the City Council considered and supported
               the proposed housing programs identified in a report, the “White Paper,” about
               homelessness in Vacaville. As identified in the White Paper, the Community
               Development and Housing and Redevelopment Departments will continue to
               collaborate with local faith-based organizations to ensure appropriate land use
               designations exist and develop operational protocols/guidelines for a Nomadic
               Shelter Program.
               Implementation Evaluation: In 2011 it was determined that local faith-based
               organizations were not in a position to provide support for a Nomadic Shelter
               program. The proposal may be revisited in the future.
H.3 - I 16     Continue to collaborate with the Ad-Hoc Homeless Task Force.
               Implementation: The Ad-Hoc Homeless Task Force is a partnership comprised of
               members of the faith-based community, local social service providers, and City
               staff. The group was originally formed to facilitate the relocation of approximately
               20 homeless individuals who ha[d] created a “tent city” on private property. The
               relocation of these individuals became imperative once the site started to be
               prepared for development. During meetings to plan the relocation, the Task
                               City of Vacaville Adopted Housing Element

             Force began discussing other issues related to homelessness within Vacaville.
             The group agreed to continue meeting on an ad-hoc basis to address service
             gaps. The “White Paper” referred to in Programs H4- I 14 and H4- I 15 came
             from this group. See section 5.3 - Special Housing Needs Analysis, for more
             information regarding this group.
             Implementation Evaluation: Due to the elimination of Redevelopment Agency
             and the Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Fund, the Ad Hoc Task Force was
             disbanded in 2012. However, the City has reunited the group as the “Homeless
             Roundtable” to work collaboratively with homeless services providers on
             identified issues.
8.4     PROGRAM EVALUATION
Guiding Policies
H.4 - G 1    Actively evaluate, on a regular basis, the success of housing programs in
             meeting Vacaville's housing needs.
Implementing Policies
H.4 - I 1    Regularly compile and analyze data relevant to housing need and affordability.
             Implementation: Annually, the Department of Housing and Redevelopment will
             conduct a rent and vacancy survey of local rental units to better understand the
             rental market and to determine whether or not apartment units may be converted
             to condominiums. In addition, a windshield survey will be conducted once every
             5 years to determine the condition of the existing housing stock and assess the
             need for rehabilitation.
             The Community Development Department and the Department of Housing and
             Redevelopment will provide an annual report to the Planning Commission and
             the Housing and Redevelopment Commission on the annual review of the
             Housing Element Implementation. This report will be prepared each January and
             forwarded to the State Department of Housing and Community Development.
             Vacaville compiles inventories of current development projects, vacant
             residential lands, conducts rent surveys, and ascertains vacancy rates. The
             intention of this policy is to place such efforts on a more formal and
             comprehensive basis to ensure sound information is available for making sound
             decisions. Every five years, the Department of Housing and Redevelopment
             prepares a Redevelopment Implementation Plan which progress is reported
             every 2.5 years. In addition, the Department of Housing and Redevelopment
             prepares the City’s Five Year CDBG Consolidated Plan, the Redevelopment
             Agency’s Annual Housing & Community Development Report, and the Housing
             Authority’s Five Year Agency Plan and annual action plan for each entity.
             Implementation Evaluation: The City of Vacaville prepared the Annual Vacancy
             and Rent Survey, with the most recent survey conducted in October 2011.
             Although this activity was suspended due to the elimination of Redevelopment in
             2012, the City began annual surveys again in 2014.

8. EVALUATION OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
               The City continues to prepare its Five Year CDBG Consolidated Plan and Annual
               Action Plans and the Vacaville Housing Authority continues to prepare its Five
               Year Agency Plan and Annual Plans as required. The City will also prepare the
               annual housing report required by SB 341 as amended by AB 1793.
H.4 - I 2      Evaluate the success of programs in meeting housing needs and goals in a
               regular and comprehensive fashion.
               Implementation: Annual progress reports regarding housing related
               accomplishments are made to the following entities: HUD for the Housing Choice
               Voucher Program, the Housing Counseling Program, and the Community
               Development Block Grant Program; HCD for housing provided with
               Redevelopment Low Income Housing Funds, HOME funds, and other funds
               administered through HCD programs; and to the City Council, Planning
               Commission, and Housing and Redevelopment Commission. In addition,
               progress in meeting the goals of the Redevelopment Implementation Plan are
               prepared for the Redevelopment Agency every two and one-half years. The last
               progress report was prepared in March 2010.
               Implementation Evaluation: During the reporting period, the Department of
               Housing Services provided updates to the City Council (also acting as the
               Housing Authority Board), and its funding sources, including monitoring the
               success of its programs in meeting its goals by providing at least annual
               reporting to its funding sources, including the California State Housing and
               Community Development Department and HUD. Public hearings were also held
               where information was provided about the goals and outcomes of programs
               administered by the Department. Reports provided to these various sources
               include the CDBG Consolidated Plan, Annual Action Plan and Consolidated
               Annual Performance Evaluation Report (CAPER), and the Public Housing
               Agency 5-Year Plan and Annual Plan.
               In addition, during the planning period, the City Council reviewed an annual
               report, the Status of the General Plan Report, and forwarded it to the State
               Department of Housing and Community Development as required by State Law.
H.4 - I 3      Include an analysis of the City’s medium density (RMD), high density (RHD), and
               urban high density residential (RUHD) vacant land inventory in the Annual Status
               of the General Plan report.
               Existing law requires each city, county, or city and county to ensure that its
               inventory or programs of adequate sites identified in its housing element can
               accommodate its share of the regional housing need throughout the planning
               period and prohibits a city, county, or city and county from reducing, requiring, or
               permitting the reduction of the residential density for any parcel to a lower
               residential density that is lower than the density used by the Department of
               Housing and Community Development in determining compliance with housing
               element law unless the city, county, or city and county makes specified written
               findings supported by substantial evidence.

                                       8. EVALUATION OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
Implementation Evaluation: Due to the economic recession that took place within
the timeframe of the 2007-2014 Housing Element, residential development was
greatly impacted. No new residential construction took place in the RMD, RHD or
RUHD zoning designations.

1 Introduction
1.1     Purpose of the Opportunity Hill Master Plan and
        Design Guidelines
The Opportunity Hill Master Plan and Design Guidelines (Master Plan) sets
the vision and action strategies for the revitalization of the East Main Street
and Bush Street areas (the Opportunity Hill area). The collective work of the
City of Vacaville (City), business owners, and active citizens of Vacaville
has made the downtown area what it is today—a successful and vital
center for Vacaville. As part of the ongoing revitalization of downtown
Vacaville, the City of Vacaville Redevelopment Agency (Redevelopment
Agency) has strategically assembled two opportunity sites just east of the
historic Main Street district to target for new mixed-use infill development
and revitalize the eastern part of the downtown area. The two sites, known
as the Opportunity Hill project and Depot Street project, are planned for
a mix of new residential, office, commercial, and entertainment uses (see       Downtown Vacaville Town Square
Figure 1-2, “Project Context Map”).
                                                                                               Opportunity Hill Area
As in many other cities, regional and commercial centers located in the                          (East Downtown Area)
suburban locations and along freeways compete for the downtown area’s
retail businesses. However, downtown areas provide a different kind of
shopping experience than suburban and highway commercial centers
by attracting visitors to their fine restaurants, specialty shops and services,
cultural amenities, and entertainment venues.
This Master Plan builds on the plans, traditions, and collective energy that
have boosted the vitality of downtown Vacaville and serves as a blueprint
for the Opportunity Hill area. The Master Plan provides a guiding framework
and specific action-oriented steps for the continued revitalization of the
downtown area.
                                                                                Opportunity Hill Project
                                                                                Depot Street Project

                                                                                                   Chapter I / Introduction
                                          1.2     Project Context
                                          REGIONAL CONTEXT
                                          The City of Vacaville is located in north, central Solano County, along
                                          Interstate routes 80 (I-80) and 505 (I-505), between Sacramento and San
                                          Francisco (see Figure 1-1, “City and Regional Context Map”). Vacaville is
                                          approximately 27 square miles in size and is bordered by rolling hillsides,
                                          fruit orchards, and fertile farmland. The City’s proximity to major highways
                                          provides easy local and regional access to the downtown area.
                                          Vacaville has one of the largest shopping districts in the region including
                                          the commercial centers along I-80 and the Vacaville Premium Outlets. It is
                                          home to several successful biotechnology companies—Genentech, Alza,
                                          and Novartis. Vacaville is also centrally located for day trips to destinations
                                          such as Lake Tahoe, the Napa and Sonoma Valleys, San Francisco, and the
                                          beaches of Northern California. Affordable housing, quality schools, and
                                          a wide array of youth activities and community events make Vacaville a
                                          family-friendly destination and a desirable place to live.
                                          HISTORIC CONTEXT
                                          The area now encompassed by the City of Vacaville was originally
                                          settled as farm land and was one of several land grants presented by
                                          the Mexican government to Juan Felipe Peña and Manuel Cabeza
                                          Vaca in 1841. In 1851, William McDaniel purchased one square mile of
Historic context: Vacaville’s Downtown    land from Manuel Vaca to create the township of Vacaville. The City of
Main Street, circa 1880–1900              Vacaville was incorporated in 1892 and quickly evolved to become an
(Source: Images of America—Vacaville,     agricultural producer of fruit and nut products shipped throughout the
by Jerry Bowen)                           nation. Vacaville also served as a roadside stop on the major highway to
                                          Sacramento and was known for the Nut Tree restaurant, which catered to
                                          travelers journeying between the San Francisco Bay Area, the Sacramento
                                          Valley, and Lake Tahoe.
                                          Vacaville’s greatest rate of growth occurred between 1960 and 1990,
                                          partly due to the expansion of the Basic Vegetable Products Company,
                                          the construction of Travis Air Force Base, and the construction of the
                                          California Medical Facility and California State Prison. Although the Basic
                                          Vegetables site and the Nut Tree Restaurant have since closed, Vacaville
                                          today has a more diversified economy than ever and is one of the fastest
                                          growing areas in the nation.
Old Town Vacaville today, with new        LOCAL CONTEXT AND EXISTING CHARACTER
and old buildings juxtaposed, still feels
and looks like a small town               Vacaville is easily accessed from the I-80 freeway gateways at Monte Vista
                                          Avenue, Mason Street, and Davis Street. The downtown area is defined
                                          by Monte Vista Avenue on the north, I-80 on the south, Depot Street on
                                          the east, and West Street on the west. The Main Street Historic District is
                                          a five-square-block area of downtown Vacaville lining Main Street and
                                          Merchant Street. The Opportunity Hill area is located downtown, east of
                                          the Main Street Historic District, and is defined in this Master Plan as the
                                          area bounded by the Old Town Hall near Davis Street on the west, Depot
                                          Street on the east, Monte Vista Avenue on the north, and Mason Street in
                                          the south (see Figure 1-2, “Project Context Map”).
                                          Although new commercial centers have developed around the highways
                                          outside downtown Vacaville, much of the original character of the
                                          downtown area has been preserved. Old Vacaville still feels and looks
The Town Square, framed by offices        like a small town and residents take pride in the character, the family-
and restaurants, serves as a central      friendly destinations, entertainment, and numerous community events
gathering place for the community         that downtown Vacaville has to offer.

    The Redevelopment Agency’s Contribution to Downtown Improvements
    The Opportunity Hill project is one of several action plans and projects
    identified by the Redevelopment Agency (Agency) in its Downtown Area
    Economic Development Strategy. Downtown Vacaville is located in the
    Vacaville Community Redevelopment Area. This redevelopment area
    includes the historic downtown area and Opportunity Hill; it also includes
    the areas extending from the Putah South Canal and I-80 on the west to
    Browns Valley Road and East Monte Vista Avenue on the east, and to
    Vaca Valley Parkway on the north (see Figure 1-3, “Redevelopment Area
    Map”). In 1982, when the Redevelopment Agency was formed, downtown
    Vacaville was described as “a classic redevelopment area, characterized
    by older housing stock, a distressed downtown area, vacant parcels,
    deteriorating trailer parks along former U.S. Highway 40 (now Monte Vista
    Avenue), and an underutilized vegetable dehydrating plant.”
    Since its formation 25 years ago, the Redevelopment Agency has
    actively invested in revitalizing downtown Vacaville and has brought a
    new renaissance to the downtown area. Many successful downtown
    area projects have been realized due to these efforts including: the
    completion of the Town Square, development of the Ulatis Creekwalk,
    and improvements to Andrews Park with the addition of a playground
    and the Georgie Duke Sports Center, to support outdoor community
    events and entertainment. Other successful projects include funding for
    streetscape, public art, and infrastructure improvements, increases to the
    number of parking spaces in the downtown area, and the formation of
    the Downtown Vacaville Business Improvement District (DVBID) in 1999.

Chapter I / Introduction
1.3     Master Plan Organization
This Master Plan is organized into the following six chapters:
      •   Chapter 1, “Introduction,” describes the purpose and organization
          of the Master Plan; the regional, historic, and local context; and
          summarizes the planning process for the Opportunity Hill area.
      •   Chapter 2, “Existing Conditions, Assets, Opportunities, and
          Challenges,” summarizes the existing site conditions and identifies
          the key opportunities and challenges for Opportunity Hill.
      •   Chapter 3, “Vision,” presents the community vision for downtown
          Vacaville, as described by participants in the planning process,
          and summarizes these concepts as a series of goals.
      •   Chapter 4, “Strategy for Downtown Development,” presents the
          strategic framework for revitalization efforts in the Opportunity
          Hill area. The strategic framework highlights the major land uses
          that will continue to build on the success of downtown Vacaville.
          This chapter introduces the opportunity projects anticipated to
          have the most significant impact on transforming the character
          of the east downtown area. Supporting strategies that assist in the
          development of the primary land uses and opportunity projects
          are also presented.
      •   Chapter 5, “Implementation,” summarizes recommendations for
          realizing the goals and strategies described in the Master Plan.
          This chapter is organized into discussions of top-priority actions
          and potential financing tools.
      •   Chapter 6, “Design Guidelines,” provides direction on the quality
          of development desired for the Opportunity Hill area.
1.4     Planning Process
The initial planning process for the Opportunity Hill area was led by the
Redevelopment Agency who conducted community meetings to gather
input on the vision, issues, and opportunities for Opportunity Hill. EDAW was
hired by the Agency to assist with an additional public outreach meeting
and the development of the Opportunity Hill Master Plan and Design
Guidelines. Preparation of the Master Plan was coordinated with water
infrastructure studies prepared by Nolte Associates and sewer infrastructure
studies conducted by West Yost Associates. One of the key objectives of
the planning process was to facilitate community consensus on a shared
vision for the Opportunity Hill area and to determine the steps needed
to transform Opportunity Hill into a vibrant, mixed-use area of downtown
Vacaville. The planning process used to develop the Master Plan is briefly
presented in the phases described below.
      •   Phase 1: Project Initiation and Existing Conditions Analysis
          This phase involved a site visit; an analysis of existing site conditions,
          including the streetscape pattern and urban form; a review of
          relevant planning policies and documents; and the preparation
          of project base maps. It also included several meetings with the
          City’s project team and a meeting with the DVBID to understand
          local concerns and visions for the downtown area.

                                     • Phase 2: Testing of Site Development Scenarios
                                       Three different land use scenarios, based on different housing and
                                       circulation configurations, were developed for the two project
                                       sites to test the development potential of each site.
                                     • Phase 3: Downtown Visioning Meeting and Site Analysis
                                       EDAW and the Redevelopment Agency co-facilitated a public
                                       visioning workshop on September 10, 2007. The purpose of the
                                       workshop was to confirm the community’s vision for downtown
                                       Vacaville. Building and site design options and place-making
                                       elements were presented to the public. The community members
                                       who were in attendance at the community meeting expressed
                                       an overwhelming preference to develop housing and mixed uses,
                                       bring more cultural arts and entertainment facilities downtown,
                                       and to make the downtown area more pedestrian- and bicycle-
                                       friendly.
                                     • Phase 4: Prioritization of Development Strategies
                                       This phase focused on identifying fundamental design concepts
                                       and economic development strategies for the Opportunity Hill
                                       area. A concept diagram was created to highlight key sites for
                                       opportunity projects and to identify concepts for organizing the
                                       sites.
                                       After the community meeting, the site scenarios were reviewed
                                       by a panel of developers experienced in mixed-use development
                                       in the Sacramento and Bay Area markets. In addition, a pro forma
                                       analysis was performed for each site scenario to evaluate the
                                       impact of different land use combinations and parking strategies
                                       on land values.
                                     • Phase 5: Opportunity Hill Master Plan and Design Guidelines
A public visioning workshop was held
on September 10, 2007 to confirm the   The last phase of the project consisted of refining the strategies

2 Existing Conditions, Assets,
        Opportunities, and Challenges
Downtown Vacaville is already a popular and vibrant community
destination, as exemplified by the well-attended events held regularly
in Andrews Park and the success of the downtown area businesses.
This chapter of the Master Plan describes the existing conditions, assets,
opportunities, and challenges for the Opportunity Hill area.
2.1     Existing Conditions
Information on existing land uses, pedestrian circulation, parking and
traffic, and infrastructure conditions in the Opportunity Hill area were
studied or surveyed and are briefly presented in this section.
                                                                                View of the School Street site
Land Uses
      • Existing Land Uses
          Existing land uses in the Opportunity Hill area are commercial uses
          (auto parts and service shops, an antique shop, a deli, and a thrift
          store); service uses (a bank, auto insurance office, real estate
          office, and other office uses); industrial uses (a steel fabrication
          shop and glass shop); public/institutional uses (religious uses,
          a gymnasium, a homeless facility, and the Vacaville Heritage
          Council and Solano County Genealogical Society, both of which
          currently occupy the Old Town Hall). Refer to Figure 2-1, “Existing   Opportunity House homeless facility
          Land Uses.”
      • General Plan Designations
          General Plan land use designations for the Opportunity Hill area in
          the Vacaville General Plan are represented in Figure 2-2, “General
          Plan Map.” The General Plan designates the Opportunity Hill area
          as General Commercial, in a large area that includes portions
          of the Depot Street site north of Ulatis Creek; Urban High Density,
          on the Depot Street site north of School Street; Public Park and
          Open Space, at Andrews Park and in the portion of Opportunity
          Hill occupied by Ulatis Creek; and School, on the parcels north       Auto body shop adjacent to the New
          of School Street (currently occupied by the Vacaville School          Hope Christian Fellowship church
          District).
      • Zoning Designations
          Zoning designations for the Opportunity Hill area (see Figure
          2-3, “Zoning Map”) are Downtown Commercial (CD), General
          Commercial (CG), and Community Facilities (CF). The Opportunity
          Hill area is also located within the Residential Urban High Density
          Overlay, which allows development of residential units in the
          downtown area at a density of up to 36 dwelling units per acre
          (du/ac).
Pedestrian Circulation
          The pedestrian circulation study for the Opportunity Hill area        The Ulatis Creekwalk trail, a unique
          (see Figure 2-4, “Pedestrian Circulation”) located sidewalks and      pedestrian circulation feature in
          pedestrian paths, identified where they did not exist, and identified Downtown Vacaville
          the main traffic intersections shared by traffic and pedestrians.
          Sidewalks proved to be continuous in this area, except at vacant
          parcels along Wilson Street and Bush Street.

Diagonal parking on Main Street               The Opportunity Hill Water System Analysis—Phase 1 study,
                                              prepared by Nolte Associates (October 2007), found existing
                                              water mains on East Main Street, Catherine Street, Mason Street,
                                              Davis Street, McClellan Street, and Bush Street. In general, the
                                              Opportunity Hill area is served with water mains that are 12-inch
                                              diameter and smaller including 4-inch and 8-inch water mains on
                                              Wilson Street, Catherine Street, McClellan Street, and Bush Street.
                                              The existing water system is illustrated in Figure 2-5, “Existing Water
                                              System.” The existing 4-inch and 8-inch water mains are insufficient
                                              to provide adequate fire flow at General Plan buildout.

                                              mains that have substandard diameters (less than 8 inches). The

                                              existing collection mains, however, two sewer segments, segments

                                              for replacement because they were in poor physical condition
                                              and had substandard diameters.

2.2    Assets and Opportunities
Downtown Vacaville possesses many existing assets that will be instrumental
in shaping its future. These assets are described below (see Figure 2-7,
“Opportunities and Constraints Diagram”).
     •  Historic Amenities
        In 1984, the Main Street Vacaville Historic District (Historic District)
        was established to help stimulate economic activity and growth
        in the area while preserving the unique variety of structures in the
        downtown area. Buildings in the Historic District were constructed
        between 1890 and 1935. The historic landmarks and structures in
        the Historic District make the community a unique location to live,
        work, and play. Local residents and business owners take pride in
        preserving the old-town character of the downtown area.
     •  Public Amenities
        The newly completed Town Square, the Ulatis Creekwalk, and
                                                                                 Preservation of the variety of historic

        as downtown hubs for community activities and gatherings.
                                                                                 for residents and business owners
        The downtown area is also supported by a library, senior center,
        gymnasium, museum, and art gallery.
     •  Pedestrian-Scale Urban Form
        The pedestrian-scale, tree-lined streets, and compact
        development pattern create a pleasant and comfortable
        ambiance for Downtown Vacaville. Generous sidewalks, quaint
        alleyways, a sense of enclosure created by the rhythm of two- and
        three-story buildings, street trees, street furniture, and public art
        along Main Street contribute to the pedestrian-friendly character
        of the downtown.
     •  Retail Commercial, and Entertainment Hub                                 A new public library located adjacent

        One of the strengths of downtown Vacaville lies in the synergy           serves as a community amenity
        and variety of community, retail, business, recreational, and
        entertainment uses. Specialty retail shops and many different
        restaurants line Main Street. These one-of-a-kind retail and
        entertainment establishments distinguish the downtown area
        from other suburban retail centers.
     •  Scenic Views
        The scenic views surrounding the downtown area are another key
        asset. Downtown Vacaville is well located for views to the hills,
        Andrews Park, Ulatis Creek, and the Historic District. The Opportunity
        Hill project benefits from its raised topographic location and
        proximity to many of the downtown area’s amenities, allowing
        the opportunity to take advantage of these scenic views.
     •  Committed Leadership and Diverse and Engaged Community
        Downtown Vacaville also benefits from the dedicated work and
        leadership of the City, the DVBID, and the active involvement of
        the local community—all committed to ensuring the continued
        success of the downtown area. The support, enthusiasm, and
        stewardship of the community will be instrumental in ensuring the
        implementation of the Opportunity Hill Master Plan and Design
        Guidelines.

                                             While downtown Vacaville has many positive attributes, it also has room to
                                             develop and improve (refer to Figure 2-7, “Opportunities and Constraints
                                             Diagram”). Some of the challenges of the downtown area are described
                                             below.

Chapter 2 / Existing Conditions, Assets, Opportunities, and Challenges
    •   Permanent Entertainment and Restaurant Uses
        A goal of the Redevelopment Agency, echoed during community
        meetings and developer interviews, is to facilitate more
        entertainment and restaurant uses downtown to further promote
        the area as a community and visitor destination.
    •   Parking
        Parking presents a special challenge to the community. An
        inventory of parking does exist, however, parking can be a
        challenge during special events and peak flows of activity.
        Downtown merchants have expressed concerns that convenient
        parking is needed in the downtown to vie with suburban locations      More restaurant establishments such
        that have abundant and convenient parking. The community has          as the Creekside Bar and Grill support
        also expressed concerns regarding providing adequate parking          the role of the downtown area as an
        for new development in the Opportunity Hill area.                     entertainment destination
        There is a need to ensure adequate parking for future development
        in the Opportunity Hill area and to conveniently accommodate
        the special events in the downtown. Parking solutions will need
        to balance these concerns against the goal to promote higher
        density infill development and the preservation of the character
        of the downtown area. The creation of too much parking will
        detract from the special character of the downtown landscape.
    •   Traffic Noise
        Traffic noise may also present a challenge to developing attractive
        residential developments in downtown Vacaville, especially if

    •   Signage and Wayfinding
        Currently it is difficult to find downtown Vacaville unless one is
        familiar with the City and the local street pattern. A successful and
        well-designed signage and wayfinding program will help visitors
        find the downtown area and inform them when they have arrived.
        Signs should attract and help direct visitors from the freeway, to
        the main arterial streets, to the Downtown, and then to find the
        main commercial streets, stores, and parking areas they seek.
        Freeway Signage: Signs along I-80 identifying the historic
        downtown main street are small and few. Once the signs are
        noticed, travelers can easily miss the freeway exits and may have
        difficulty finding the downtown area.                                 Entry monumentation along Davis

        other primary entries into the downtown area (from Mason Street,
        Depot Street, Monte Vista Avenue, Cernon Street, and Parker
        Street) are obscure and need to be more visibly marked.

3.1     Vision for the Opportunity Hill Downtown Area
The collective work and vision of the City of Vacaville, business owners,
residents, and active citizens have made downtown Vacaville what it is
today and will continue to shape its future development. The vision for
the Opportunity Hill area builds on the plans, traditions, and energy that
have boosted the vitality of the downtown area. The vision statement
adopted by the Redevelopment Agency in its Downtown Area Economic
Development Strategy (1991) states:
          Downtown Vacaville is to serve the residents of the Vacaville            A mix of uses along the street

    associated with a number of strategies and implementation actions, as
    described in Chapter 4, “Strategy for Downtown Development,” and
    Chapter 5, “Implementation.”
    Objective 1: Provide Design Guidelines and Standards for Opportunity Hill
                 Support development in the Opportunity Hill area while
                 maintaining downtown Vacaville’s historic character.
    Objective 2: Improve Parking
                 Ensure adequate and convenient parking for new uses that
                 is easily accessible, highly visible, and that supports a sense
                 of personal security and safety.
    Objective 3: Investigate Additional Resources to Provide Mixed-Use
                 Development Incentives
                 Investigate resources to facilitate attracting new mixed-
                 use development that promotes the economic viability of
                 the downtown with new jobs and office, entertainment,
                 and retail businesses by providing economic incentives for
                 reinvestment.
    Objective 4: Initiate Changes to the Legal Framework (City General Plan
                 and Zoning Amendments)
                 Allow an increased density of up to 65 du/ac in the
                 Opportunity Hill area, compared with the up to 36 du/ac

4 Strategy for Downtown Development
4.1    Strategic Framework
This section describes the strategic framework guiding the redevelopment
of the Opportunity Hill area. The revitalization of the Opportunity Hill
area will require a series of progressive, concentrated, and well-defined
strategies that build on one another to support change in the downtown
area. The strategic framework is the “big picture” vision to support a
comprehensive strategy of programs, policies, and improvements for
downtown development that is intended to be versatile to respond to
changes in market conditions, retail demand, and community needs.
To create this strategic framework, the Opportunity Hill area’s economic,
social, and physical development opportunities and constraints were
assessed in the context of the overall function of downtown Vacaville. The
strategic framework defines these actions in three different components
that together help structure and prioritize the actions required to ensure
the implementation of the Master Plan.
      • Primary land uses—the land uses most important to achieving the
          vision and goals for the Opportunity Hill and downtown area (see
          Section 4.3, “Primary Land Uses”). The function of primary land
          uses is to define the strategic role of downtown Vacaville in the
          community and the region. The primary land uses are those uses
          that work together to drive the economic, social, and cultural
          activities that help make downtown Vacaville a mixed-use, small-
          town urban destination for shopping, living, and working. The
          strategies identified by this Master Plan are potential actions the
          City may take to achieve the combination of unique land uses
          that support downtown Vacaville.
      • Opportunity projects—sites that can accommodate additional
          development in the immediate future within the primary land
          use categories (see Section 4.4). During the initial site analysis, a
          number of opportunity projects in the Opportunity Hill area were
          identified as appropriate for redevelopment efforts. Two Agency-
          owned sites—the Opportunity Hill site and the Depot Street
          site—were identified as primary opportunity projects. In addition,
          three secondary opportunity projects were identified—the School
          Street site, the Main and Wilson Streets site, and the Mason and
          Wilson Streets site. Opportunity projects are identified in Figure 4-2,
          “Strategic Framework Concept Diagram,” and further described
          and analyzed in Section 4.4, “Opportunity Projects.”
      • Supporting strategies—actions that support the primary land
          uses and opportunity projects (see Section 4.5). The function of
          supporting strategies is to identify the additional programs and
          action steps to carry out the overall vision for downtown Vacaville.
          These supporting strategies and actions help ensure the success of
          the opportunity projects. Supporting strategies are composed of a
          range of policy considerations and design guidelines that support
          both the implementation of the immediate redevelopment
          project and the ongoing downtown revitalization efforts.

4.2     Strategic Framework Concept Diagram
The strategic framework concept diagram (Figure 4-2) graphically
represents the strategic vision for Opportunity Hill. This framework diagram
provides a conceptual depiction of future land uses in downtown
Vacaville, building relationships to the street, major pedestrian connections,
and desired streetscape relationships and character. The strategic
framework concept diagram also emphasizes opportunities for principal
transportation, pedestrian circulation, parking, signage, and open space
networks that link the Opportunity Hill development sites to the surrounding
downtown context.
The strategic framework concept diagram serves as a visual blueprint or
“road map” for improving Opportunity Hill and is not considered a legally
binding entitlement to land use and development of sites in the project
area. The strategic framework concept diagram illustrates the relationship
of the Opportunity Hill project to the overall context of downtown Vacaville
and suggests several strategic concepts, briefly described in this section.
Districts
The downtown area can be described as one overall, interconnected
district. The Opportunity Hill area is envisioned as an extension of the
Historic District that extends east-west from Parker Street to Depot Street.
The downtown area is also related to and supported by the surrounding
areas and districts:
      • thriving residential neighborhoods located west of Cernon Street;
      • neighborhood centers including a Lucky supermarket northeast
          of the project area on Monte Vista Avenue;
      • a small residential district south of Mason Street between Davis
          Street and Parker Street that is gradually transitioning into a mixed-
          use area, with small single-family homes being converted into
          professional offices, small specialty stores, and live/work homes
          for artists and crafts persons;
      • the Brenden theater entertainment and retail district located
          immediately south of the downtown area on Davis Street; and
      • several larger office buildings as well as the Hampton Inn Hotel
          located just south of the downtown area on Mason Street.
Circulation
The circulation system consists of a street hierarchy that includes major
arterial streets, collector streets, and local interior streets. The arterial
and collector streets—Depot Street, Mason Street, Monte Vista Avenue,
and Cernon Street—carry through traffic to the periphery of the historic
downtown area. Local interior streets are organized in a historic grid
pattern; these slower, pedestrian-oriented streets provide access to the
storefront shops while directing major through traffic to arterial streets on
the periphery. Convenient parking access is provided from the arterial
streets to avoid burdening the main street with heavy traffic.

                                                                       Chapter 4 / Strategy for Downtown Development
                                       Mixed-Use Opportunities
                                       A major concept for development in downtown Vacaville is to encourage
                                       higher intensity mixed-use infill development on opportunity project sites
                                       with housing, office, and retail projects that support the role and function
                                       of the downtown area as a specialty shopping destination.
                                       Ground Floor Commercial Opportunities
                                       Not all streets in downtown Vacaville need to include ground floor
                                       commercial uses. Such uses should be concentrated within the easily
                                       walkable retail core along Main Street, School Street, Merchant Street,
Mixed-use development with office
                                       Dobbins Avenue, and Parker Street. Shoppers typically will walk for only
uses on the upper floors and cafes
                                       three or four blocks. The Main Street retail core should extend from Cernon
and restaurants on the ground floor
                                       Street and terminate at McClellan Street. Catherine Street, Bush Street,
frame the Town Square Plaza
                                       and portions of Kendal Street, Parker Street, and Cernon Street can support
                                       offices or residential frontages with front stoop and porch entries.
                                       Pedestrian Connections
                                       Pedestrian connections throughout the downtown area are intended to
                                       support and enhance the lifestyle of residents and downtown users. Streets
                                       and sidewalks, plazas, parks, and small gathering places are intended to
                                       be comfortable, green places that support the pedestrian experience.
                                       Wide sidewalks allow outdoor dining and direct access to shop entries
                                       and storefronts along the central retail spine of Main Street and include
                                       streetscape amenities—street trees, seating, and lighting.
Ground floor commercial uses with
                                       Improvements to School Street are envisioned with the extension of the
storefront facades and wide sidewalks
                                       pedestrian plaza being east to McClellan Street. The Ulatis Creekwalk
contribute to the pedestrian ambiance
                                       is also planned to extend east to McClellan Street and is envisioned to
of the downtown area
                                       eventually extend and connect to the Citywide trail system across I-80.
                                       Parking Opportunities
                                       The strategic framework concept diagram also provides recommendations
                                       on some, potential opportunity locations for parking structures in the
                                       downtown area that provide access from arterial and collector streets.
                                       Future parking structures should be designed with ground-floor retail
                                       uses, where appropriate, and provide districtwide parking in order to
                                       encourage higher intensity development in the downtown area. Parking
                                       locations should be easily accessible and include highly visible and well-
                                       defined signage from the major arterial streets.
Future downtown parking structures     Gateway Features and Landmarks
should be designed with retail uses on
the ground floor                       The primary entries into the downtown area are opportunities to provide
                                       attractive downtown signage, wayfinding information, or public art as
                                       gateway features or landmarks to enhance the visibility and identity of
                                       downtown Vacaville.

4.3    Primary Land Uses
Primary land uses are those uses that are most important for achieving the
overall vision and goals for improving the Opportunity Hill area. These land
uses are based on City and regionwide trends and the unique conditions
in downtown Vacaville. These primary land uses are expected to have the
greatest impact in redefining the role of downtown Vacaville in the City
and the region. The following six primary land uses have been identified.
1.   Downtown housing is increasingly in demand and supports a
     thriving City center environment. Housing in the downtown area
     helps to extend activity into the evenings and supports other retail
     uses, restaurants, and specialty stores with a local customer base.
     Downtown housing markets include active-adult baby boomers,
     young and older professionals without children, retirees, affordable
     housing, and artisans seeking live/work type housing in an active
     urban setting that is close to shopping, entertainment, and cultural
     events.
2.   Restaurant and entertainment uses are a key component of downtown
     Vacaville. Adding new restaurant and entertainment uses promises
     to draw additional visitors and vitality to the area. Restaurants, live
     theater, music, and arts venues will have a positive impact on the
     area, reinforcing downtown as a destination.
3.   Civic, cultural and recreational activities attract a high number
     of visitors and provide possibilities for “trip-chaining” and multiple
     purchases in the downtown area. Downtown Vacaville serves a
     major role as the civic and cultural heart of the community. Existing
     public plazas, the central park, the Ulatis Creekwalk, and sidewalk
     environment provide the setting for formal and informal gatherings,
     events, and ceremonies.
4.   Specialty retail uses in the downtown area are distinct from “big-box”
     retail chain stores in large commercial centers along the freeways
     or neighborhood grocery shopping in suburban centers. Specialty
     retail activities support downtown Vacaville’s role as a shopping
     destination. The downtown area should continue to strengthen its
     position in the region as a destination for specialty shopping.
5.   Office uses, especially professional uses, employ a significant number
     of people throughout the region and draw people to downtown
     Vacaville. Office workers support local restaurants and retail stores
     at lunchtime and after work. In addition, office visitors can easily fulfill
     their shopping needs downtown during business trips. These office
     uses help create a vibrant mixed-use center.
6.   Heritage tourism in downtown Vacaville is one of the best-kept
     secrets in the San Francisco Bay Area. Vacaville’s rich historical past
     and small-town, historic character contribute to its continued success
     in creating a specialty retail destination. Downtown Vacaville should
     continue to showcase its history through museums, historic walking
     tours, community events, and preservation of its architectural heritage.
     Downtown signage, marketing information, and promotional events
     should reflect this rich heritage and encourage new visitors to explore
     the area’s unique assets. All new buildings in the downtown area
     should be designed to fit with the historic character and contribute
     to the historic, pedestrian-scaled environment in the downtown.

    4.4      Opportunity Projects
    This section describes the primary and secondary opportunity projects for
    the Opportunity Hill area. Two primary opportunity projects are studied in
    detail in this Master Plan: the Opportunity Hill project and the Depot Street
    project. These project sites were chosen for their strategic locations within
    the Opportunity Hill area and their potential role to serve as catalysts for
    additional new development and investment in downtown Vacaville.
    Three secondary opportunity projects have also been identified in this
    Master Plan: the School Street project and two private development
    projects, the Mason and Wilson Streets site and the Main and Wilson Streets
    site (see Figure 4-2). The two private development sites are currently being
    considered by the City. The School Street site will issue development plans
    of its own. These secondary opportunity projects provide opportunities
    for redevelopment in the near term and should continue moving ahead
    through the development review process. These project designs must be
    consistent with the overall vision for the downtown and this Master Plan.
    Project Recommendations
    A number of development scenarios were studied for the Agency-owned
    Opportunity Hill and Depot Street projects (see Section 4.4-2, “Opportunity
    Hill Project” and Section 4.4-3, “Depot Street Project”). Although the current
    residential market conditions in Vacaville favor the less dense townhome
    project scenarios, the goals and objectives of this Master Plan are best
    supported by the higher density project scenarios for the Opportunity Hill
    and Depot Street sites.
    The City may take several actions to help encourage higher density residential
    development in the Opportunity Hill area. Recommended strategic actions
    are described in Section 4.4-4, “Summary of Findings” and Section 4.5,
    “Supporting Strategies.” In addition, the Agency will utilize various methods
    available to solicit development proposals for the Opportunity Hill and
    Depot Street projects and/or portions of the projects that will support the
    goals and objectives of this Master Plan. The developer(s) and/or project(s)
    that provide the best quality development and fit for the Opportunity Hill
    area, consistent with this Master Plan and any other City requirements and
    conditions will be analyzed.
    4.4-1     FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS
    A project feasibility analysis for the Opportunity Hill and Depot Street projects
    analyzed the three development scenarios created for each site. These land
    use scenarios represent a range of residential densities, commercial, and
    parking assumptions. The parking ratio assumptions utilized for the analysis
    are lower than the City’s parking standards for residential uses of two spaces
    per unit for one and two bedroom units and two parking spaces for three
    or more bedroom units. The City’s parking standards were assumed for the
    commercial component of the analysis by using a combination of on-site
    and on-street parking spaces to meet this demand. The lower parking ratios
    utilized are strategies found in urban infill environments to achieve higher
    residential densities and encourage mixed-uses consistent with the vision
    of the Opportunity Hill Master Plan. A static pro forma evaluation of the
    scenarios on their returns at the first year of full occupancy was analyzed. This
    methodology allows planners to test the ways that adjusting the sites’ zoning
    and development standards would affect underlying land values, assuming
    a reasonable developer profit of 10% (The feasibility analysis assumes a
    developer profit of 10% based on conversations with local developers. This
    is a relatively conservative estimate. A higher profit threshold was used in
4-8                                 OPPORTUNITY HILL MASTER PLAN AND DESIGN GUIDELINES

Chapter 4 / Strategy for Downtown Development
this analysis because higher density for-sale development in downtown
Vacaville is untested).
The development feasibility analysis makes assumptions about anticipated
construction, legal, financing, architecture and engineering costs; property taxes;
government fees; and other overhead costs for developers. The assumptions
about development costs are based on the experiences of developers actively
building in Solano, Sacramento, and Yolo Counties. The cost data are also
based on the 2007 R.S. Mean Square Foot Construction Costs Manual, which
estimates construction costs by type and region. Beyond construction costs,
prevailing financing rates, property taxes, and estimated government fees were
also determined by contacting local lenders, planners, and brokers.
The feasibility analysis also makes assumptions about development revenues.
In general, it assumes above-average pricing for any residential and
commercial project because of its proximity to downtown, Ulatis Creek, and
available amenities. Leasing rates for such potential projects are relatively
high compared to rates for other, more antiquated retail in downtown
Vacaville. At the same time, assumptions about capitalization and vacancy
rates are relatively conservative at 8% and 10%, respectively. Each of the
scenarios assumes that the commercial component would operate under
separate ownership as a commercial condominium with a homeowners’
association. The commercial condominium could either be sold by the
developer or held as revenue property.
Revenues from townhome and condominium sales for the Opportunity Hill
and Depot Street projects are assumed to be well in excess of prevailing
home prices for existing townhomes and condominiums. Existing townhomes
and condominiums are older units and are not comparable in quality to new
products expected in downtown Vacaville. The analysis assumes that new
townhomes and condominiums would command a price premium because
of their ideal downtown location with immediate access to entertainment,
recreation, shopping, and services.
The analysis also assumes that 20% of new housing units would be sold to low-
and moderate-income households. Half of these units, or 10% of the total
units, would be sold to low-income households and the remainder would
be sold to moderate-income households. Although assumptions were made
for the purposes of the analysis, further Agency review will be needed on
a project specific basis to determine if the number of affordable housing
units is adequate to meet the requirements of State Redevelopment Law
(the funding source utilized to acquire much of the land in the Opportunity
Hill area). In many of the higher density scenarios, the calculated price of
moderate-income affordable housing is only slightly lower than the market
price. Reducing unit sizes only slightly would make many of the market-rate
two-bedroom units affordable to moderate-income households. This would
allow some units to be sold without resale restrictions or agency oversight.
4.4-2     OPPORTUNITY HILL PROJECT
Overview
The Opportunity Hill project site, located at the northeast corner of Wilson
Street and East Main Street, is owned by the Redevelopment Agency and is
approximately 1.4 acres in size (see Figure 4-2). Three land use alternatives were
prepared for the Opportunity Hill site, proposing different mixes of residential
densities and including varied assumptions about commercial space. The
Opportunity Hill site was evaluated using a mixed-use townhome scenario,
a mixed-use condominium scenario, and a hybrid (mixed-use condominium
and townhome) scenario. The development program for each scenario is
shown on the following pages (refer also to Figures 4-3, 4-4, and 4-5).

     Development Feasibility
     The mixed-use townhome scenario (Site Scenario 1; see Figure 4-3) would
     generate the highest return of the land use alternatives. Site Scenario 1
     would have an estimated development cost of approximately $12.8
     million and revenues of $14.9 million. The project would benefit from lower
     construction costs and less expensive parking (i.e., tuck-under parking
     versus podium parking).
     The mixed-use condominium scenario (Site Scenario 2; see Figure 4-4)
     would be burdened by high podium parking costs, more expensive
     construction, and internal building circulation. This prototype shows
     projected development returns of only 2% of cost with no residual land
     values.
     The mixed-use townhome and condominium scenario (Site Scenario 3;
     see Figure 4-5) would generate slightly higher returns than Site Scenario
     2, estimated at 7% of total costs. If home prices increased by 5% above
     development costs, this scenario would be feasible.

4.4-3 DEPOT STREET PROJECT
Overview
The Depot Street site, located on McClellan Street between Bush Street and
the terminus of East Main Street, is mostly owned by the Redevelopment
Agency and is approximately 2.2 acres in size (see Figure 4-2). Three land
use scenarios were evaluated for the Depot Street site, proposing different
mixes of residential densities and varied assumptions about commercial
space. The Depot Street site was evaluated using a mixed-use townhome
scenario, a mixed-use condominium scenario, and a mixed-use mansion
home scenario. The program for each site scenario is shown on the
following pages (refer also to Figures 4-6, 4-7, and 4-8).

                                      Chapter 4 / Strategy for Downtown Development
     Development Feasibility
     The Depot Street site scenarios (Site Scenarios 4-6; see Figures 4-6, 4-7,
     and 4-8) generated results similar to those of the Opportunity Hill project.
     The lower density alternatives (see Site Scenarios 4 and 6) are viable
     under current market conditions. The two scenarios would have lower
     construction costs and parking scenarios, with projected returns on costs
     of 16% for Site Scenario 4 and 28% for Site Scenario 6.
     4.4-4 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
     Although the current housing prices and construction costs in Vacaville
     favor medium-density townhomes in the downtown area, the City supports
     the development of higher density scenarios that inject more pedestrian
     and retail activity into the area. A higher density housing development
     component is also supported due to the use of Low Income Set Aside Funds
     for acquisition of many properties in the Opportunity Hill area. The higher
     density will help ensure that the affordability requirements of these Set
     Aside Funds are met and/or the Fund is reimbursed. Under current market
     conditions, higher density mixed-use construction is not economically
     feasible because the higher construction costs cannot be offset by sale
     (or rental) prices. The high construction costs of podium parking can also
     contribute to the challenge of building a financially feasible project.
     The higher density alternatives are preferred despite the underlying
     economics. Although the lower density alternatives are economically
     viable at this time, the Agency may choose to hold on to the properties
     until residential market conditions improve and home prices justify
     higher density construction. As an incentive for a developer to initiate
     a higher density alternative despite current market conditions, the City
     should consider changing the zoning for the project area to heights and
     densities beyond those suitable to current market conditions. Because
     redevelopment at the Opportunity Hill and Depot Street projects would be
     infill projects, the City may also consider allowing lower parking standards
     for smaller two-bedroom units, as recommended below.
     Smaller Units and Lower Parking Standards
     The City may consider lower parking standards that limit the number
     of podium parking spaces if a project with small unit sizes is proposed.
     Although the three development scenarios used for the Opportunity Hill
     and Depot Street projects used a lower parking ratio assumption than the
     current City standard and used small unit sizes ranging between 800-1,200
     square feet for one, two and three-bedroom condominium units, the
     mixed-use, high-density residential projects were challenged by the high
     construction costs of podium parking under the current market conditions.
     The high costs of podium parking can adversely affect the economic
     viability of a project. Smaller units often generate higher values on a
     per-square-foot basis and fulfill a need among empty-nester households
     and entry-level homebuyers. Smaller units would also be affordable to
     moderate-income households without requiring an additional housing
     subsidy. One-bedroom and two-bedroom units ranging from 650 to 1,050
     square feet would be marketable with a single designated parking space.
     Two and three bedroom units ranging from 1,050 to 1,200 square feet
     could be marketed with 1.5 parking spaces per unit.
     This lower parking ratio is generally acceptable because downtown-area
     residents may be singles or couples without children. The active-adult baby
     boomers are continuing to grow as a housing market throughout the United
     States. Smaller units in downtown Vacaville may also be suitable to buyers,
     both young and old, desiring a more urban and green lifestyle choice not
     offered in other housing locations in the community. Downtown housing

is close to services such as grocery shopping, restaurants, entertainment
facilities, and transit, reducing the need for an additional car.
4.4-5 SECONDARY OPPORTUNITY PROJECTS
In addition to the two sites owned and initially targeted for development
by the Redevelopment Agency, three additional opportunity sites are
under preliminary discussions with the City of Vacaville: the Main and
Wilson Streets site, the Mason and Wilson Streets site, and the School
Street site. The secondary opportunity sites are not analyzed as part
of this Master Plan; rather, they will have their own separate planning
processes. However, all new projects occurring in the Opportunity Hill
area, including the secondary opportunity sites, shall be subject to the
standards and design guidelines of this Master Plan.
The Main and Wilson Streets Project
The Main and Wilson Streets site is privately owned. It is an approximately
0.70-acre site proposed for a mixed-use high-density project at 56 du/ac. The
proposal and design are in keeping with the overall vision for downtown
Vacaville and this Master Plan. The proposed mixed-use project would
create a retail face along Main Street and would add attractive
residential units in support of the overall land use strategy outlined
above.
The Mason and Wilson Streets Project
The major portions of this site are owned by the Redevelopment Agency.
Several small homes on Catherine Street are not currently owned by the
Agency, making it less efficient to redevelop this site to its fullest intensity
and highest and best use.
This site is currently being discussed for potential redevelopment as a
two-story office use with surface parking on the remainder of the block.
Although a higher intensity, mixed-use development pattern may be
considered more in keeping with the vision identified in this Master Plan,
an office use that meets the Design Guidelines outlined in Section 6 will
promote visual appeal and provide a connection to the development
on the south side of Mason Street. An office use is also in keeping with
the overall land use strategy of downtown Vacaville by providing
employment opportunities in the area.
The School Street Project
The School Street site includes approximately five acres of land owned
by the Vacaville School District and another 0.8 acre of land currently
owned by the City. Although the School Street site is not analyzed in
detail in this Master Plan, it has been recognized and identified by
the community as a potential opportunity site. It is also envisioned as
a mixed-use development site, with ground-floor commercial spaces
fronting School Street and a higher density residential housing community
occupying the remainder of the site.
The Vacaville School District and the City should discuss the best solutions
for developing the site that ensure its successful contribution to the
downtown landscape. When the School District conducts its own studies
for potential development of the site, additional ways that the City and
the School District may work together to develop the site to its fullest
potential may be identified.

     4.5      Supporting Strategies
     Several strategies, programs, and actions would provide support for the
     primary land uses and successful development of the opportunity sites in
     the Opportunity Hill area. The supporting strategies comprise a range of
     development actions, policy changes, and improvements. The supporting
     strategies are linked with the implementation of the opportunity sites in
     the Opportunity Hill area and would help ensure that new development
     can be implemented successfully. This coordinated approach ensures the
     long-term success of each new development opportunity and the success
     of the downtown revitalization as a whole.
     The suggested supporting strategies that the City, Agency, and/or
     developer may take are as follows:
            • D1. Design Guidelines and Standards
            • D2. Parking Improvements
            • D3. Investigate Incentives for Mixed-Use Development
            • D4. Changes to the Legal Framework (City General Plan and
                    Zoning Amendments)
            • D5. Improvement of Linkages and Connections
            • D6. Infrastructure Updates
            • D7. Signage and Wayfinding Improvements
            • D8. Affordable Housing
     Each of these supporting strategies, including objectives and proposed
     actions, is described below.
     D1. Provide Design Guidelines and Standards for Opportunity Hill
     Objective:     Support development in the Opportunity Hill area while
                    maintaining downtown Vacaville’s historic character.
     The historic urban form, tree-lined streets, pedestrian-friendly atmosphere,
     and mix of uses contribute to downtown Vacaville’s unique character and
     charm. These historic design elements must be preserved to ensure that
     the downtown area maintains this distinctiveness. Chapter 6 outlines and
     provides specific design guidelines for improvements to the Opportunity
     Hill area. Additional incentives to promote mixed-use development
     and residential infill development are discussed under Strategy D3. The
     guidelines outlined for the Opportunity Hill area are consistent with the
     design guidelines for downtown Vacaville and cover building design and
     site layout, landscaping, signage, and streetscape elements.
     Action:        a. Adopt the Opportunity Hill Master Plan and Design
                       Guidelines for use by City staff in reviewing
                       development projects.

Chapter 4 / Strategy for Downtown Development
D2. Improve Parking
Objective:       Ensure adequate and convenient parking for new uses that
                 is easily accessible, highly visible, and supports a sense of
                 personal security and safety of users.
Parking is arguably one of the most important requirements for successful
downtown redevelopment because today’s retail shoppers and residents
are conditioned by their suburban experiences. However, streets and
parking lots that replicate the form and abundance of suburban parking
can destroy the historic character of the downtown setting. Parking needs
to be provided in a clear, evenly distributed supply and includes on-street
parking with off-street options, both publicly and privately owned. The City
identified a downtown parking feasibility analysis as part of their 2007-2009
Strategic Plan. The study has been initiated and will analyze the parking
needs for future development in the Opportunity Hill area.
Employees should be encouraged to park away from store entrances. On-
street parking is critical because it is the most convenient type of parking
and provides the steady turnover of shoppers for coffee shops, specialty
food stores, and the like. Off-street parking entries need to be highly visible
from the street, but should not dominate the streetscape. Parking should
be user friendly, with clear signage directing customers to the lots; should
be well lit for personal safety; and should provide a more sophisticated
comfortable setting.
Downtown residential parking in higher density, mixed-use projects in small
towns is also problematic. The expense of structured residential parking
can greatly affect housing development costs and ultimately, project
feasibility. Strategies and design solutions for residential, mixed-use projects
should consider reducing parking requirements because of downtown’s
central location, access to transit, and the typical family size and lifestyle
of urban users (singles, couples, retirees, and active adults).
Downtown Vacaville is on the threshold of development intensity and
parking demand that should be resolved with development of districtwide
parking structures. However, the costs of parking structures is still financially
infeasible. The strategic framework concept diagram (Figure 4-2) provides
recommendations for parking structure locations when financing becomes
more realistic in the future.
To alleviate potential parking issues, the Master Plan recommends
expanding the downtown parking district to include the opportunity
projects and the eastern boundary of downtown Vacaville. Within the
parking district, targeted strategies can be implemented that allow for
more flexible requirements and ways to meet parking requirements. By
increasing the area of the parking district, the City would allow new
development projects to take advantage of its downtown parking
strategies.
The following goals for parking improvement may be considered by
the City for the Opportunity Hill area and are consistent with ongoing
downtown revitalization efforts:
      •   Complete a parking study for the development of a potential
          public parking structure(s) serving the downtown area that may
          include parking spaces designated for business employees and
          residents.
      •   Expand the existing parking district(s) to cover the full downtown
          area, including Opportunity Hill.

                                       Chapter 4 / Strategy for Downtown Development
          •   Revise the parking standards to allow the following:
              •    one parking space per efficiency or studio unit versus the
                   current standards of 1.5 per unit,
              •    1.5 parking spaces for one- and two- bedroom units versus the
                   current standard of two per unit, and
              •    consider allowing the following reduction to the number
                   of podium parking spaces required in residential podium
                   developments with small unit sizes (defined to be one- and
                   two-bedroom units ranging between 650-1,050 sf and three
                   bedroom units that are 1,200 sf or less):
                   •    one parking space for one and two bedroom units, and
                   •    1.5 parking spaces for three bedroom units.
          •   Allow on-street parking to count toward parking for commercial
              and visitor parking in residential projects.
          •   Allow the use of tandem parking arrangements to meet parking
              requirements in residential projects
          •   Allow for a discount in parking requirements in shared parking
              arrangements for projects participating in improvement costs
              within the parking district.
     Actions:         a. Complete the parking analysis that considers the future
                          parking demand of the Opportunity Hill area.
                      b. Expand the downtown parking district to include the
                          Opportunity Hill area.
                      c. Amend the provisions for downtown parking in the
                          zoning ordinance to allow more flexibility in meeting
                          parking requirements.
     D3. Investigate Resources to Provide Mixed-Use Development Incentives
     Objective:       Attract new mixed-use development that promotes the
                      economic viability of the downtown area with new jobs,
                      offices, entertainment, and retail businesses by providing
                      economic incentives for redevelopment.
     The major goal of this Master Plan is to allow for increased intensity of
     mixed-use development projects in downtown Vacaville, specifically in
     the Opportunity Hill area. Development incentives can help to promote
     new infill development by reducing project costs and making higher
     intensity mixed-use projects more feasible.
     Development incentives may include:
          •   reducing governmental constraints—simplifying the permit
              approval processes, using allowable CEQA exemptions for urban
              infill housing, reducing development fees, and changing land use
              controls;
          •   financial assistance for development costs—land write-downs,
              reductions in infrastructure and street improvement costs
              reductions, and parking district programs; and
          •   technical assistance—streamlining the application process and
              grant writing.

Chapter 4 / Strategy for Downtown Development
Action:        a. Identify alternative resources in order to facilitate mixed-
                    use development incentives.
               b. Initiate a financial analysis to adopt mixed-use
                    development incentive strategies for the Opportunity Hill
                    area.
D4. Initiate Changes to the Legal Framework (City General Plan and
     Zoning Amendments)
Objective:     Allow an increased density of up to 65 du/ac in Opportunity
               Hill, compared with the up to 36 du/ac currently allowed by
               the City in the downtown area.
Zoning at heights and densities beyond those suitable to current market
conditions can provide developer flexibility. As a result, a developer may
become willing to initiate a higher density alternative despite current
market conditions. The City should initiate changes to the Vacaville General
Plan and the Zoning Ordinance (along with the necessary environmental
documents) as an incentive to development.
Action:        a. Initiate General Plan amendments and zoning changes
                    to implement the Master Plan-recommended land
                    use and design guidelines to allow future private
                    development to proceed in the Opportunity Hill project
                    area.
D5.    Improve Linkages and Connections
Objective:     Promote efficient linkages for automobile, bus, bicycle, and
               pedestrian circulation in the downtown area.
Attractive and efficient pedestrian, bicycle, transit, and auto connections
are crucial to the success of projects in downtown Vacaville. Creating
clear, visible connections to the downtown area from surrounding
neighborhoods and the region enables visitors, residents, and workers to
access all the retail shops, public events, and places that the downtown
area has to offer. The City is already engaged in achieving this objective,
especially with the notable achievement of developing the Ulatis
Creekwalk. The City has already incorporated the action to extend the
Creekwalk to Depot Street in its Capital Improvement Plan (CIP).
Pedestrian Amenities: Pedestrian amenities should be extended through
the downtown area and Opportunity Hill, first along Main Street and School
Street, which have the greatest potential for additional retail uses.
Improved Bike Trail Systems: The City of Vacaville may study the potential to
improve the bike trail linkages from the downtown to other neighborhood
areas, in connection with planned improvements to the Ulatis Creekwalk.
School Street Improvements: School Street has the opportunity to become
an extension of the pedestrian plaza space from Andrews Park to Depot
Street. School Street can be designed as a mixed-use slow street, with
wide decorative paving for pedestrians, while still allowing auto access to
future storefronts and parking along the street. The street can be closed
off with bollards during civic events, allowing activities such as outdoor
dining and gatherings to spill out into the street or to extend down along
the Creekwalk. School Street can also be easily accessed from Main Street
across existing pedestrian bridges.

                                      Chapter 4 / Strategy for Downtown Development
     Plazas and Gathering Places: In addition to the opportunity to extend the
     Andrews Park pedestrian plaza and Ulatis Creekwalk, new developments in
     the Opportunity Hill area can also include opportunities for additional small
     plazas and gathering places. Gathering spaces can be accommodated
     at project entries and on the wider sections of sidewalks along retail street
     frontages. However, new gathering places should not be too large and
     compete with the Town Square or Andrews Park. Additional small plaza
     spaces can be created at the terminus of School Street, at corner entries,
     or by widening sidewalks to allow for outdoor dining along Main Street.
     Action:       a. Adopt a streetscape design plan or transportation plan
                       to be implemented through the CIP.
     D6. Complete Infrastructure Improvements
     Objective:    Complete improvements to infrastructure systems to
                   adequately serve the full buildout of the Opportunity Hill
                   area, consistent with the zoning change recommendations
                   of this Master Plan.
     The City’s engineering consultants for the Opportunity Hill area have
     already prepared studies assessing the capacity of the existing water
     and wastewater infrastructure systems in the downtown area to serve
     General Plan buildout of the Opportunity Hill area at an increased density
     of 65 du/acre (recommended by this Master Plan) for the Opportunity
     Hill and Depot Street opportunity projects. The results of these studies are
     summarized here.
     The Phase 2 water service analysis, performed by Nolte Associates, Inc.
     (December 2007), recommends replacing the existing 4-inch and 8-inch
     water mains on Wilson Street, Catherine Street, McClellan Street, and
     Bush Street with 12-inch water mains to supply adequate fire flow to the
     Opportunity Hill project sites. The construction costs (in 2007 dollars) for the
     above improvements to the project are estimated at $615,000.
     The Phase 2 wastewater service analysis for the Opportunity Hill area,
     performed by West Yost Associates (December 2007), determined and
     recommended that two sewer segments (identified in Figure 2-8, “Sewer
     Study Map,” in Chapter 2) be replaced because they have substandard
     diameters and are in poor physical condition. The construction costs (in
     2007 dollars) for these improvements are estimated to range between
     $210,000 and $240,000, depending on the construction method used, field
     conditions, and various other economic factors.
     To serve the potential new projects in Opportunity Hill, the City should move
     ahead with plans for infrastructure improvements and develop financing
     mechanisms that help pay for needed repairs.
     Actions:      a. Update the CIP to allow planning and construction of
                       needed infrastructure improvements.
                   b. Implement the financial mechanisms required for a
                       developer to be reimbursed for the improvements.

Chapter 4 / Strategy for Downtown Development
D7. Improve Signage and Wayfinding
Objective:      Improve signage and wayfinding into and around the
                downtown area.
For downtown Vacaville to be successful, people must be able to easily
find the downtown area and comfortably access and move around its
many streets and sidewalks to find the parking areas and stores they seek.
The current sign programs should be finalized and should address how to
help identify the downtown area, including the Opportunity Hill area. Signs
should help direct visitors from the highway to the main arterial streets, to
the downtown area, to parking lots, and to the main commercial streets
and public facilities. A well-designed signage program would be consistent
with the historic character of the downtown area and contribute to the
overall branding of “Old Town” Vacaville as a unique destination.
The signage program should be coordinated with the streetscape
elements along Main Street and the entry gateway features on Davis
Street. Wayfinding within and around downtown Vacaville would be
enhanced by coordinating and extending the downtown streetscape
design into the Opportunity Hill area. A system of street trees, sidewalks,
lighting, streetscape furniture, crosswalks, and paving patterns would help
highlight the City’s unique downtown setting and contribute to its overall
visibility and special character.
Freeway Signage: Currently it is difficult to find downtown Vacaville unless
one is familiar with the City and the local street pattern. Signs along I-80
identifying the historic downtown main street are small and few and
can easily be missed. The City’s current Gateway Plan signage program
(approved by the City Council in 1999) should consider improvements to
the wayfinding and directional signage from I-80 and through the local
street systems leading into the downtown area.
Downtown Signage: Signage at most primary entries to the downtown
area should be attractive. While the downtown arch on Davis Street is
particularly effective as a landmark, most approaches to downtown are
obscure. A coordinated wayfinding and signage program should be
created that helps to more visibly mark the downtown area from all other
approaches (Mason Street, Depot Street, Monte Vista Avenue, Cernon
Street, and Parker Street). Wayfinding elements may include special
landscape planting, street paving at crosswalks, additional landmarks
and monuments, and signs, coordinated with the overall historic theme
of downtown Vacaville. The City is working on the Downtown Sign Plan
Design. The Downtown Sign Plan (adopted by the Planning Commission
in resolution number 04-012) provides a unified, clear pedestrian- and
vehicle-oriented signage system throughout the City through a common
theme and color scheme. The plan applies to all public directional signs in
the downtown area as well as to other areas of Vacaville.
Actions:        a. Finalize and adopt a sign program or plan addressing
                   wayfinding and identification signage for downtown
                   Vacaville.
                b. Initiate any recommended amendments to the Sign
                   Ordinance regulating development by private tenants.

     D8. Provide Affordable Housing
     Objective:   Provide opportunities for new high-density affordable housing
                  within the downtown area.
     A major goal of the City is to encourage the development of housing to
     meet the needs of residents at all income levels and abilities, including
     public employees, retail workers, active adults, and persons with disabilities.
     Redevelopment law requires that 20% of redevelopment tax increment
     revenues be set aside to increase, improve, and/or preserve the supply
     of affordable, low-income, and moderate-income housing within the
     redevelopment project area. Portions of the Opportunity Hill project area
     were purchased with 20% set-aside funds and are appropriate locations
     to meet the City’s Housing Element and redevelopment goals.
     Actions:     a. Pursue public-private partnerships with housing
                     providers and developers to construct affordable
                     housing in the downtown area.
                  b. Continue to pursue grants and other affordable-housing
                     program opportunities to meet these goals.

5 Implementation
This chapter describes the different actions or measures that the City
may pursue to implement the Master Plan. This chapter describes the
recommended redevelopment process for the Opportunity Hill area,
implementation priorities and strategies, and potential financing tools for
the project, based on the recommended actions described in Chapter 4,
“Strategy for Downtown Development.”
5.1      Redevelopment Proposal Process
The Opportunity Hill Master Plan and Design Guidelines represents the
first step in the revitalization of the Opportunity Hill area. The Master
Plan sets forth a set of actions that serve as a focus for continued efforts
toward downtown revitalization. It also provides a framework for priority
actions and future implementation efforts. As each priority action item
is implemented, the Agency can move forward to review additional
opportunity sites and steps to advance its downtown revitalization efforts.
A key implementation step that the Agency should consider is determining
the best methods to solicit development proposals from qualified parties
or entities to develop the area in different phases by various developers.
This process may involve the Agency initiating negotiations with individual
developers or conducting an RFP/RFQ process as needed.
Implementation Priorities
1.     Develop opportunity sites through solicitation of development
       proposals.
2.     Initiate General Plan amendments and zoning changes to implement
       the land uses and design guidelines recommended in this Master
       Plan.
3.     Complete the infrastructure system plans and improvements to serve
       the build-out of the Opportunity Hill area.
4.     Amend the downtown parking zoning ordinances to:
       • expand the downtown parking district that includes the
            Opportunity Hill area,
       • reduce the number of podium parking spaces required for small
            residential units between 650 and 1,050 square feet, and
       • allow on-street parking to count toward commercial parking
            requirements.
5.     Work with the owners of the adjacent opportunity sites in the
       downtown area to develop those sites, including:
       • the proposed mixed-use project at Wilson and Main Streets,
       • the proposed office project at Mason and Wilson Streets, and
       • the site located at McClellan and School Streets owned by the
            Vacaville School District.

    Continued Revitalization Efforts
    As part of the ongoing implementation process, the City should update its
    downtown revitalization strategies and continue to review and implement
    priority actions over time. The Opportunity Hill Master Plan and Design
    Guidelines is one part of an overall downtown revitalization effort. To help
    ensure that the community’s vision is achieved, the following guiding
    principles should be considered.
          • Build on Strengths
             Downtown Vacaville has a number of assets and strengths: its
             historic character, its civic and cultural functions, Andrews Park
             and Ulatis Creek, unique stores, and entertainment venues and
             restaurants that make it a destination. New projects and programs
             should continue to support and build on these existing strengths
             and the role of the downtown area in the community.
          • Concentrate on High-Priority Actions
             Not all actions and improvement projects are equal. Given
             limited resources—staff time, financing funds, and community
             acceptance to implement projects—the City should identify and
             concentrate efforts on a limited number of priority projects, such
             as changes to the legal framework and strategies to address
             future parking demands. Priority projects should be “doable” with
             available funding sources and contribute to the overall success
             of downtown Vacaville. Identify high-priority actions given limited
             resources.
          • Develop a Realistic Timeframe
             Not all action steps identified in this Master Plan can (or should)
             be undertaken immediately. The five highest priority actions,
             identified as implementation priorities above, offer a guide for
             staging revitalization efforts over time.
          • Identify Roles and Responsibilities
             The dedication, commitment, and accountability provided by
             lead organizations and staff are key to successful implementation.
             The Vacaville Housing and Redevelopment Agency and
             Community Development Department are the key organizations
             for determining the next action steps. The Downtown Vacaville
             Business Improvement District and the Vacaville Public Works
             Department can also play an important role in championing
             ongoing revitalization efforts and actions.
          • Establish Measurable Performance Indicators
             To determine the success of each action, it is necessary to create
             measurable performance indicators. These indicators provide
             the community and City Council with objective measures on
             the progress of each project or program as it is completed.
             Easily measurable outcomes help create realistic goals and
             objectives.
          • Monitor and Evaluate Ongoing Progress and Set New Priority
             Actions
             As high-priority projects and programs for the Opportunity Hill area
             are completed, the City should reassess its downtown revitalization
             strategies and identify new high-priority projects. This ongoing
             process of setting priorities and implementing new actions will
             help the community achieve its vision for the downtown area.

5.2     Implementation Financing Tools
Potential funding sources are key components for the implementation
of a successful Master Plan. Some potential financial resources explored
were determined not to be viable alternatives for the City of Vacaville
such as Project Area Development Impact Fees and Quimby Act Park
Fees. Other local funding sources such as General Funds, the City’s Gas
Tax funds, and Community Development Block Grant funds have already
been committed for other projects.
The following list identifies other potential funding sources that may be
available or pursued in implementing the Master Plan:
Redevelopment Funds (Tax Increment Financing) and Low Income Set-
Aside Funds
The Opportunity Hill area is within the Vacaville Community Redevelopment
Area, managed by the Vacaville Housing and Redevelopment Agency.
This redevelopment area will sunset in 2013, so these resources are limited.
However, a total of 20% of the tax increment received in a redevelopment
area must be spent on the development and conservation of affordable
housing and placed into a low-income set-aside fund. This money is to
be used to provide for low- and moderate-income housing. Some of the
Agency-owned properties in the project area were acquired using the
low-income set-aside fund. Purchase prices for Agency-owned properties
shall be fair market value in accordance with State Redevelopment Law
and other applicable requirements of the funding sources used by the
Agency for the acquisition of the sites.
Property-Based Business Improvement District
Property-based business improvement districts (PBIDs) allow local property
owners to tax themselves for specific activities clearly detailed in their PBID
service plans. PBIDs are self-assessed and self-governed by the affected
property owners. A PBID is an enhancement of city services and may not
be used to replace services already provided by the City. PBIDs normally
become a means to improve business conditions by acting as a collective
marketing and maintenance district, although they can support capital
improvements as well. A PBID can earmark monies for capital improvements
consistent with the district’s adopted management plan. (The formation of
a PBID is contingent on interest among property owners in paying for the
physical improvements and service improvements envisioned.) Normally,
forming a PBID can take anywhere from one to two years.
Business Improvement District
A business improvement district (BID) is similar to a PBID; however, rather
than assessing property owners, it assesses the owners of businesses
located within the district. The DVBID was formed in 1996 and represents
approximately 550+ business owners located in the Downtown Vacaville
area that also includes the Opportunity Hill area. Since its formation
the DVBID has been active in enhancing, promoting, and preserving
Downtown Vacaville by representing the issues affecting its members,
promoting the downtown and various special events, helping to facilitate
business retention and development, and continuing to work with the City
to enhance the Downtown environment.
Improvement programs typically funded by a BID can include parking
district, streetscape improvements and maintenance, public events
coordination, business retention and development, and joint marketing
efforts.

    Special Assessment District
    Special assessment districts can pay for both capital facilities and city
    services, including the operation and maintenance of public facilities
    within a district. The formation of a special assessment district requires a
    majority vote from property owners within the special assessment area, with
    their vote weighted based on their proportionate share of the total annual
    assessment. The majority of special assessment districts are formed within
    planned greenfield developments and not within existing neighborhoods.
    This is partially because of state constitutional requirements imposed in
    the late-1990s by Proposition 218, which mandates public notification
    of property owners, conformance to clear administrative and reporting
    requirements, and a majority vote of property owners, weighted by their
    proportionate share of the assessment. Nevertheless, a special assessment
    district could support the operation and maintenance of services in the
    Opportunity Hill area (such as landscape maintenance) in addition to
    paying for street improvements and infrastructure improvements.
    The formation of a special assessment district is contingent on the
    magnitude of cost to each property owner and the political support for
    forming a special assessment district. As an example, if property owners
    were asked to pay half of the estimated $7.7 million in costs for street work,
    each property would pay approximately $40 per linear foot of frontage per
    year for 10 years, meaning that a property owner with 50 feet of frontage
    could pay $2,000 per year for 10 years (assuming a bond rate of 6.5% and
    bond administrative costs of 2% of the loan with a term of 10 years).
    Possible applications of the special-assessment-district include a parking
    district, or special assessment districts for streetscape improvements and
    maintenance or infrastructure improvements.
    Mello-Roos Community Facilities District
    Mello-Roos districts are similar to special assessment districts except that
    they must be approved by a two-thirds majority of noticed voters (not
    proportionate to their assessment). Mello-Roos districts are not special
    assessments, but a special tax used to pay for public facilities and/or
    services. Many practitioners feel that the Mello-Roos proceedings provide
    more flexibility in allocating district costs than special assessment districts.
    The City currently has a Community Facilities District (CFD) for infill
    development for the purpose of funding ongoing police and fire services.
    Although not all small, infill projects are required to participate in this CFD,
    the recommended higher-density development in the Opportunity Hill
    area may be required to annex into this CFD during the development
    review process.
    Possible applications of the Mello-Roos district include parking district
    improvements, streetscape improvements, infrastructure improvements,
    and operations and maintenance.
    Park Impact Fees
    The City charges a park impact fee to new development. These funds
    must be spent within the planning area of the proposed development.
    Through a park impact fee, new development would help pay to acquire
    and build planned park space within the project area.
    Possible applications of Quimby Act fees include acquisition of parks or
    public open space, park development, and/or improvements.

Regional, State, and Federal Funding Sources
The City may have the opportunity to pursue federal, state, and regional
funding sources to fund improvements detailed in this Master Plan.
Federal funds described are distributed through the State Transportation
Improvement Program and through the Metropolitan Transportation
Commission’s (MTC’s) Regional Transportation Improvement Program.
The Bay Area will receive an injection of transportation-related funds
generated from Proposition 1A and 1B bonds. These funds will augment
existing transportation-related improvement programs, focused primarily
on capital improvements related to roadways and public transportation.
Metropolitan Transportation Commission
Through federal funding programs, the MTC has developed regional
funding programs to promote smart growth and improve air quality. The
programs available are described below.
         Transportation Development Act
         The Transportation Development Act provides two funding
         sources for public transportation—the Local Transportation Fund
         and the State Transit Assistance fund. Locally, these funds are
         distributed to the MTC. Transportation Development Act funds
         distributed to the MTC can be used for improvements along
         public-transportation corridors. Furthermore, a small portion of the
         Local Transportation Fund (2%) is directed toward pedestrian and
         bicycle improvements.
         Possible applications of Transportation Development Act funds
         include planning and engineering, bicycle lanes, and pedestrian
         improvements.
         Regional Transportation Improvement Program
         The Regional Transportation Improvement Program is the regional
         plan to fund transportation improvements. It identifies a number
         of federal and state transportation programs that will be used in
         transportation capital improvement projects. These include federal
         distributions such as those from the Transportation Enhancement
         Activities Program, the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality
         Improvement Program, and the Regional Surface Transportation
         Program.
         Possible applications of Regional Transportation Improvement
         Program funds include planning and engineering, capital financing,
         operation and maintenance of streetscape improvements, and
         bicycle lane and bicycle path improvements in the downtown
         area.
         Recreation Trails Program
         The California Department of Parks and Recreation administers
         the Recreation Trails Program, which finances trail improvements in
         cities and counties. Cities must match at least 12% of the planned
         capital improvement costs. This is a competitive program with a
         small annual budget of approximately $5 million statewide.
         Possible applications of Recreation Trails Program funds include
         enhancements to the Ulatis Creekwalk and improvements to
         bikeways and pedestrian trails in the downtown area.

             Livable Communities Initiative
             The Livable Communities Initiative provides funding for planning
             activities and capital improvements that facilitate public
             transportation ridership and alternative means of transportation.
             Eligible capital activities or capital project enhancements of
             demonstration projects include property acquisition, restoration or
             demolition of existing structures, site preparation, utilities, building
             foundations, walkways, and open spaces that are physically and
             functionally related to mass transportation facilities. The Initiative
             can also be used for site design improvements including sidewalks,
             aerial walkways, and bus access. The Federal Transportation
             Administration administers this program.
             Possible applications of Livable Communities Initiative funds
             include planning and engineering, capital financing, operation
             and maintenance of streetscape improvements, infrastructure
             improvements, transit-oriented developments in the downtown
             area, and projects related to improving bus routes and bus
             connections downtown.
    California Housing and Community Development Sources
    The California Department of Housing and Community Development
    manages a number of housing and community development activities
    that support redevelopment and affordable housing in urban infill areas.
    The following are programs that Vacaville could access to implement the
    Master Plan.
             The Multi-family Housing Program
             The Multi-family Housing Program provides deferred loans for
             acquisition, rehabilitation, and new construction of housing, and
             the conversion of nonresidential structures to rental housing.
             Possible applications of this program include infrastructure
             improvements, transit-oriented development, affordable housing,
             and conversion of underutilized commercial and industrial
             buildings to residential uses.
             The Brownfield Economic Development Incentive
             The Brownfield Economic Development Incentive (BEDI) is a
             competitive grant program to stimulate and promote economic
             and community development. BEDI assists cities with the
             redevelopment of abandoned, idle, and underused industrial
             and commercial facilities where expansion and redevelopment is
             hindered by real or potential environmental contamination.
             Possible applications of this program include purchasing property,
             infrastructure improvement, and environmental remediation, and
             business/development financing that spur economic benefits.
             BEDI projects must increase the economic opportunity for persons
             of low-and moderate-income or stimulate and retain businesses
             and jobs that lead to economic revitalization.

Vacaville’s Downtown Loan Program
Vacaville’s Downtown Loan Program may be a potential funding source
for development in the Opportunity Hill area. The Downtown Loan Program
is designed to stimulate building improvements and seismic upgrades for
commercial properties in the Downtown Economic Development area.
The current program consists of Design Assistance Grants, Façade Loans,
and Building Loans. An analysis of this program is currently underway and
may be modified.

6 Design Guidelines
The purpose of these design guidelines is to direct the quality and character
of future development. The guidelines are intended to ensure that new
developments in the Opportunity Hill area are consistent with the historic
themes and architecture of Downtown Vacaville and are consistent with
the City’s goals and objectives for downtown revitalization and the vision
and goals of this Master Plan. Conformance with the design guidelines will
ensure that new development projects within the Opportunity Hill area
enhance the downtown environment and establish quality standards for
site planning, architecture, and landscape design.
The design guidelines describe and illustrate approaches to site, building,
and landscape design that are appropriate for the Opportunity Hill area.
The design guidelines provide an explanation for each design element
and standards that provide a framework for project review. The design
guidelines are required actions. However, exceptions to the design
guidelines may be permitted through the City’s Design Review Process so
long as the intent of the guideline is upheld. All developments within the
Opportunity Hill area shall be subject to the City’s Design Review Process
and the approval of the Director of Community Development.
6.1      Site Design
This section of the Design Guidelines provides direction for the site design
of new development or renovation of existing structures. The design of the
streetscape should address the relationship between buildings and the
public realm by providing amenities such as street trees, street furniture,
landscaping, and paving. These elements contribute to a more pleasant
and pedestrian-friendly downtown environment and support public
activity and interaction.
Building Orientation
Building orientation is an essential element of site design that helps to
define pedestrian access and the relationship to the street. Buildings in
the historic downtown area are oriented to create a continuous street
wall along the major pedestrian streets—Main Street, Merchant Street,
Parker Street, Mason Street, and Dobbins Avenue, with parking located
behind the buildings. Historic buildings are rectangular, approximately
20–40 feet wide, and placed perpendicular to the front property lines.
Newer, contemporary buildings have larger office floor plates and are
typically oriented east-west on the lots. Contemporary building patterns
with deeper setbacks and parking located in front of the buildings shall
be avoided. New buildings in the Opportunity Hill area should be oriented
to access and use solar energy, to the extent possible, except when this
creates issues of neighborhood incompatibility with the development
pattern in the historic downtown district.
Guidelines
The guidelines for building orientation are as follows:
      •  The orientation of buildings shall follow traditional and historic
         development patterns of downtown Vacaville, in which buildings
         are parallel to lot lines and the street.                            Traditional development pattern—
                                                                              buildings are oriented parallel to lot
      •  Parking areas shall be easily accessed and located to the side or    lines and form a continuous street wall
         rear of the buildings.                                               along the main street

                                                                                            Chapter 6 / Design Guidelines
                                             •   Primary building entries shall be oriented to the major pedestrian-
                                                 oriented streets—Main Street, School Street, McClellan Street,
                                                 Wilson Street, and Catherine Street.
                                             •   Secondary building entries shall be oriented to parking or service areas.
                                        Building Setbacks and Build-To-Lines
                                        A build-to-line is generally used in urban or downtown settings to define
                                        locations where the building façade should be located within a certain
                                        distance of the public right-of-way. The street wall may be varied to
                                        create usable outdoor public space such as entries, outdoor dining areas,
                                        sidewalk seating, public plazas, and other amenities in the public realm.
                                        The design intent of setbacks and build-to-lines in the context of the
                                        Opportunity Hill area is to ensure that buildings are pulled forward toward
                                        the sidewalk and street to create a well-defined building edge or street,
                                        consistent with the historic development pattern of downtown Vacaville.
                                        The building setback line and sidewalks widths should be of sufficient width
                                        to support activity between the building and the edge of the sidewalk
                                        and the street.
                                        Guidelines
                                        The guidelines for building setbacks and build-to-lines are as follows:
                                             •   Buildings shall be sited to the front of the property line and behind
                                                 the sidewalk in the downtown area, to the extent feasible (see
                                                 Figure 6-1, “Build-to-line Diagram” for locations where build-to-
                                                 lines shall be required).
Buildings located along a build-to-line
create a well-defined building edge          •   Façades that front onto a public street shall be built parallel to the

Chapter 6 / Design Guidelines
6.2 Streetscape Design
This section of the design guidelines provides direction on streetscape
design. Components of streetscape design include streets and paths; street
trees; pedestrian street furniture; plazas, parks, and outdoor gathering
spaces; parking; signage and graphics; building and site lighting; and
service areas and utilities.
Landscaping
Landscaping helps foster an attractive and comfortable downtown
environment. Well-designed landscaping in the downtown area also helps
to reinforce the historic character of the public realm, provide for safety
and security of residents with “eyes on the street,” improve air quality, and
help reduce heat gain on paved surfaces.
Landscaping of the public realm in the Opportunity Hill area consists of
street trees, flowers and shrubs in parking islands and the Town Square
Plaza, Andrews Park, and the extension of Ulatis Creekwalk.
The landscaping of private and semi-private areas of projects in the
Opportunity Hill area is also critical in maintaining an attractive and
functional environment for downtown users. Landscaping in yards, patios,
private plazas, and courtyards within new projects should be well designed
with high-quality materials and details. Well-maintained landscaping within
each site helps preserve property values and contributes to the character
and quality of life for residents and downtown users.
Guidelines
The guidelines for landscaping are as follows:
      •  Plant species shall be selected that are suitable to the Vacaville   Landscaping, placed along the public
         climate and complement the existing plant palette established        right-of-way, enhance the pedestrian
         for the Vacaville Downtown Historic District (refer to the “City of  experience along the street
         Vacaville Downtown Street Tree List”).
      •  Use of low-water and low-maintenance landscaping materials is
         encouraged.
      •  Minimize the area of impervious surfaces of pavements, sidewalks,
         and parking through the use of landscaping, permeable paving
         materials, and landscaped open space.
      •  The full growth of landscaping shall be anticipated so that trees
         and shrubs do not conflict with lighting and roofs.
      •  Deciduous shade trees and shrubs shall be planted, where
         appropriate, to shade the west and south sides of buildings and      The use of low-water, low-maintenance
         shade paved areas to reduce heat transmission and be consistent      landscaping materials is encouraged
         with City shading requirements..
      •  Irrigation controls shall be adequately screened from view, to the
         satisfaction of the Director of the City’s Community Development
         Department with landscaping materials or other attractive site
         materials.

                                       Streets and paths should be designed to provide efficient circulation
                                       through the downtown. Bicycle and pedestrian facilities are encouraged
                                       to promote walking, bicycling, and bus transit.

Plazas, Parks, and Outdoor Gathering Spaces
Plazas and small public gathering places should serve as focal points for
development. Opportunities to create small plaza spaces may exist in the
Opportunity Hill area by continuing the existing pedestrian plaza along
School Street; providing an end cap to School Street on the Depot Street
site; on East Main Street near the pedestrian bridge; and at the north end of
Wilson Street. These small plaza spaces can help define the eastern edge of
downtown Vacaville, serve as visual focal points to the Ulatis Creek spine,
and draw visitors to the north-south pedestrian connection on Wilson Street
from East Main Street to Mason Street. These outdoor gathering spaces
can be easily created by widening the sidewalk, placing building entries
next to the sidewalk, and extending pedestrian paths along the creek.
Guidelines
The guidelines for plazas, parks, and outdoor gathering spaces are as follows:
       •   Parks, plazas, courtyards, and entry plazas shall include landscape
           elements such as ornamental plants, public art, seating,
           streetscape furniture, and water features to create a visually
           interesting, comfortable, and functional outdoor environment for
           the pedestrian.                                                        Plazas serve as landscaped outdoor

           the context of the downtown environment. Hardscape materials
           shall be selected to endure the weather conditions in Vacaville.
           Use of high-quality paving materials, such as brick, set stone, or
           interlocking paving materials consistent with existing materials in
           the downtown area, is recommended.
       •   The color of the plaza paving materials shall be consistent with those
           used in the downtown area. The use of red brick colors is appropriate.
Pedestrian Street Furniture
Street furniture—pedestrian kiosks, benches, transit shelters, newspaper racks,
trash cans, and café tables—should be selected and installed to encourage
strolling, window shopping, and casual social interaction. Well-designed
street furniture enhances the appeal and vitality of the downtown area.
Guidelines
The guidelines for pedestrian street furniture are as follows:
       •   Street furniture shall be attractive, functional, easy to maintain,
           high quality, and vandal resistant.                                    Street furniture placed in relationship

       •   Seating is highly encouraged. A variety of seating alternatives is
           possible including benches, seat walls, and café tables.
       •   Street furniture shall be compatible with the quality of selections
           currently used in the downtown area.
       •   Flowering pots, landscaping, and colorful banners on lampposts
           in the historic downtown shall be extended into the Opportunity
           Hill area to create a festive, downtown commercial atmosphere.

Signage and Graphics
Signage should be used for information, direction, and wayfinding and
should not advertise specific products. Signs should relate in placement
and size to other site and building elements. Signage should enhance
the character and attractiveness of streets in the downtown area, while
minimizing the appearance of clutter.
Guidelines
The guidelines for signage and graphics are as follows:
     •   Signage shall be modest in scale and appearance and
         complement, not overpower, the building structure. Signs shall
         also not obscure important architectural elements such as
         windows, cornices, or decorative details.
         •   The materials and colors of signage shall be compatible with
             those of the building as well as adjoining buildings.
         •   Signs shall be professionally designed and fabricated with
             high-quality materials such as metal, stone, and wood.
     •   Signs shall be wall mounted, projecting, combined with awnings,
         or placed on windows consistent with the historic character of
         downtown Vacaville.

             building shall be designed to relate to each other in size, color,
             lettering style, and/or building placement.
     •   All other signage standards shall be established by the City’s Sign
         Ordinance, and the number of signs used shall be consistent with
         the ordinance.
     •   Animated, moving, flashing, blinking, reflecting, and revolving signs
         that detract attention from the buildings and historic character of

6.3 Building Design
The guidelines for building design address the exterior of buildings and
their relationship to the surrounding built context. Building styles in historic
downtown areas are often various turn-of-the century Victorian, Spanish
Colonial, and Tudor styles. However, no matter what the building style may
resemble, buildings should complement the community setting and should
contribute to historic character and public realm of the downtown area.
Figures 6-2 and 6-3 are examples that apply the building design guidelines
that follow in this section. These figures illustrate various design features
to help describe the intent of the guidelines in ensuring new building
designs in the Opportunity Hill area complement the historic architecture
in downtown Vacaville.
Building Height, Massing, and Scale                                              New or infill buildings should be
The size and scale of buildings should be compatible with existing               designed to be pedestrian friendly
development in the historic downtown area and should ensure a human-             and compatible with the character of
scaled environment. To ensure compatibility with existing development            the historic downtown
in the historic downtown area, new development should appear similar
in massing and scale. New buildings and additions to existing buildings
should generally fall within the height range of existing buildings along
each block. Larger scale buildings containing blank, uninteresting, and
unappealing street walls should be avoided. Most commercial buildings
in the historic downtown area are one or two stories high with a high floor-
to-ceiling measurement (typically 15 feet or more). Building parapets on
one-story commercial buildings create the illusion of higher buildings and
help to create the sense of street enclosure along the commercial street.
Guidelines
The guidelines for building height, massing, and scale are as follows:
      •   Larger-than-average buildings on the same block should break
          up the mass of the structure with articulation of the structure into
          smaller components to maintain the traditional human scale.
          Architectural treatments such as building setbacks, cornice lines,
          parapets, and header and sill details on upper-story windows, as
          well as bay windows shall be used to break up the massing of
          building façades.
                                                                                 A variety of architectural features such
      •   Appropriately scaled doors, windows, awnings, and detailing can        as articulated entries and window
          reduce the appearance of mass.                                         openings break up the building mass
                                                                                 along the street

                                    Buildings should be constructed with high-quality materials that are
                                    durable and enhance the building character, particularly on the ground
                                    floor, where people are most likely to come in contact with the building
                                    and can easily see and touch the materials.

                                    The guidelines for materials, finishes, and textures are as follows:
                                          •  Use of materials commonly found in the historic downtown area
                                             is encouraged. Stucco, brick, stone, terracotta, and tiles are
                                             common in historic downtown Vacaville.

                                          •  Contrasting accent colors are required for architectural details,
                                             awnings, and entrances.
                                          •  Colors shall be selected with consideration for the orientation of

Façade Rhythm
Building façades create the interface between the building face and the
public realm of the street. Historically, commercial districts have consisted
of buildings that are one or two stories high and repeat a consistent rhythm
along the street. This pattern creates a regular rhythm of smaller, 20- to
40-foot building widths and 30- to 45-foot-high street walls. In larger towns,
the downtown building heights may be higher—three to four stories. The
pattern and rhythm of architectural elements such as window openings,
commercial display windows, frequent building entries, ornamentation,
awnings, and canopies also contribute to the historic urban streetscape.
Guidelines
The guidelines for façade rhythm are as follows:
      •  Building openings such as windows and doors shall maintain the
         proportions and spacing of openings on the block. The rhythm of
         commercial street façades is typically divided into 20- to 40-foot-
         wide increments.
      •  Buildings on wider lots shall maintain the rhythm of the front
         façades by breaking the building’s façade into small increments
         of window displays and entries.
                                                                                  Doors, windows, cornice lines, and

         definition to the building and break its elements down to a more
         human scale. Building proportions used in new construction or
         additions shall be consistent and compatible with the proportions
         of buildings in the Historic Main Street District (see figure 6-4 for an
         illustration of these concepts).
      •  Doors, windows, floor heights, cornice lines, signage, and awnings
         shall be appropriately scaled to reduce the mass of buildings
         experienced by the pedestrian.
      •  A building façade facing the street shall be lined with windows,
         entries, and openings that provide indoor and outdoor views to
         the public rights-of-way and sidewalks.
      •  Windows, doorways, and storefront entries shall repeat the rhythm
         of historic buildings in downtown Vacaville.

Roof Forms and Parapets
Historically, building roofs in downtown Vacaville used flat roofs, or pitched
or arched roofs hidden behind a parapet. Parapets are often capped with
a cornice and provide space for wall-mounted signs. Residential buildings
are generally provided with steep-sloped roof forms and articulated with
dormers, parapets, and varying shapes and heights.
Guidelines
The guidelines for roof forms and parapets are as follows:
     •   Variation of roof lines and a variety of roof forms, including flat
         roofs or sloped roof forms, is appropriate in Opportunity Hill area.
     •   Free form and geometric roof shapes shall not be permitted.
     •   In general, sloped roofs shall be steeply pitched with multiple        Example of a flat roof form similar to
         shapes and variations. Use of dormers, special corner design           buildings in the historic downtown
         elements, and varying roof heights to break down the massing of
         the roof form is appropriate.
     •   Roof equipment shall be screened from view on public streets
         and/or integrated into the roof design.
     •   Roof materials in view of the public streets shall be of high quality,
         solid materials such as tiles, metal, and terracotta.
Windows, Bays, And Storefronts
The placement of windows and doors along a street frontage is one of the
best methods of creating visual interest in a building. Storefront windows at
the street level can be used to allow pedestrians to see into the structure
and improve the visual surveillance of the area outside of the building.
Guidelines
The guidelines for windows, bays, and storefronts are as follows:
     •   Windows, entries, and doors shall occupy the wall surface in the
         ground-floor retail spaces along all major pedestrian streets—Main
         Street, McClellan Street, and School Street. Retail display windows
         and entries shall occupy at least 60% of the ground-floor building
         façade.
                                                                                Building with a variety of roof forms,
     •   Buildings shall follow the historic use of windows, in which windows
                                                                                shapes, and heights
         were rectangular and vertically placed on the building façade.
     •   Headers, trims, and sills of windows of new buildings shall be
         well articulated in design, dimensions, and patterns of historic
         downtown architecture. Building façades of the Historic District
         follow a consistent pattern of building lines at each floor level,
         along the eaves of roofs, at the building base on the ground level,
         and following common window sill heights
     •   Storefront windows shall be made of clear glass to allow pedestrians
         to see into the structure and allow interior users to see out onto the
         street. Mirrored or dark-tinted glass is not allowed. Interior-lighted
         storefronts in the evening hours provide additional lighting to the    Maintain the transparency of windows

                                            with the pattern of historic retail buildings in downtown Vacaville.
                                            Historic storefront windows include larger retail window displays
                                            and entries with overhanging awnings, a tile base, and a transom
                                            with a sign frieze above. Retail storefronts extend the length of the
                                            building façade and are approximately 40–50 feet in width. Wider
                                            buildings (100 feet wide or more) shall break up the façade length

Residential Doorways and Entrances
Residential doorways and entries in downtown Vacaville should be
clearly visible to pedestrians, with a defined relationship to the street and
sidewalk. Recessed entries, entry stoops, and entry porches help break
up the massing of a building façade and help make the entry threshold
immediately apparent to pedestrians. Raised stoops and porches help
provide a small separation and sense of privacy between the private
residence and the public realm along the sidewalk. Decorative features
such as awnings, canopies, lighting, and signage can also be used to
clearly define and articulate the entryway.
Guidelines
The guidelines for residential doorways and entrances are as follows:
     •   Primary residential entries shall be located on major sidewalks to
         provide clear and visible pedestrian access.
     •   The size of the entry shall be proportional to the building.
     •   New buildings in the downtown area shall include details such as
         sidelights, transoms, columns, and pediment trim that are often
         inset and embellished on traditional entries.

     •   Residential mixed-use projects, townhomes, and apartments shall
         provide multiple entries, stoops, and/or porches along the streets
         whenever possible. Multiple entries to ground-floor flats and
         townhomes improve the sense of safety and security along the

                                         Canopies, Awnings, and Arcades
                                         Canopies, awnings, arcades, and other overhangs are traditional
                                         elements of commercial design that articulate the building façade and
                                         create variety and interest at the street level. They also provide space for
                                         signage, shade windows during the summer to reduce energy use, and
                                         provide weather protection for pedestrians.
                                         Guidelines
                                         The guidelines for canopies, awning, and arcades are as follows:
                                              •  Use of canopies, awnings, arcades, and overhangs is encouraged
                                                 over window displays and entries along the public sidewalk on
                                                 the ground floor of commercial buildings.

                                                 for the size, shape, and placement of the building, unless a unique
                                                 architectural style encourages something different.
                                              •  Canopies and awnings shall fit within individual bays or structural
                                                 divisions of the building façade rather than extending beyond a
                                                 single bay, unless the building structure dictates an alternative
                                                 placement.

     OPPORTUNITY HILL MASTER PLAN AND DESIGN GUIDELINES
                                        ADDENDUM #1
                                             April 9, 2008
Introduction
This addendum provides the revisions to the Opportunity Hill Master Plan and Design Guidelines
in response to comments received from the Planning Commission on March 18, 2008 and City
Council and Redevelopment Agency on April 8, 2008. The following changes will be incorporated
into the Plan:
     1. Include a small specialty grocery use into the plan;
     2. Examine the feasibility of a parking structure in conjunction with a parking master plan for
         the downtown area;
     3. Add a map and incorporate the comments received from the Solano Transportation
         Authority discussing the connectivity of the project area to transit including the City Coach
         transfer station and Davis Street park-and-ride lot; and
     4. Encourage the use of the Design Guidelines contained in the plan for existing and future
         projects and developments in the existing downtown areas.
The Opportunity Hill Master Plan and Design Guidelines was unanimously approved by the City
Council and Redevelopment Agency on April 8, 2008, with the inclusion of the following revisions
recommended by the Planning Commission and City Council/Redevelopment Agency:
Revisions
Based on the comments received during the Planning Commission and City Council and
Redevelopment Agency, the following are revisions to the Opportunity Hill Master Plan and
Design Guidelines. Additions to the original text in the document are underlined and deletions are
indicated with a strike-through font.
Page number        Section Number           Addition or Revision
Grocery Use
4-7                4.3 Primary Land         4. Specialty Retail uses in the downtown area including specialty
                   Uses                     retail and small specialty grocery uses are distinct from “big box”
                                            retail chain stores in large commercial centers along the freeways or
                                            neighborhood grocery shopping in suburban centers. Specialty retail
                                            activities including a grocery use are encouraged in the downtown to
                                            support downtown Vacaville’s role as a shopping destination
                                            experience. The downtown area should continue to strengthen its
                                            position in the region as a destination for specialty shopping.
Parking Structure
4-27               4.5 Supporting           D2. Improve Parking
                   Strategies               Downtown Vacaville is on the threshold of development intensity and
                                            parking demand that should be resolved with development of

                                   districtwide parking structures. However, the costs of parking
                                   structures is still may still be financially infeasible. The feasibility of
                                   providing a public parking structure in conjunction with a parking
                                   master plan for the downtown should be examined. The strategic
                                   framework concept diagram (Figure 4.2) provides recommendations
                                   for parking structure locations when financing becomes more
                                   realistic in the future.
                                   The following goals for parking improvement may be considered by
                                   the City for the Opportunity Hill area and are consistent with ongoing
                                   downtown revitalization efforts:
                                   •    Complete a parking study and parking master plan for the
                                        development of a potential public parking structure(s) serving
                                        the downtown area that may include parking spaces designated
                                        for business employees and residents.
Transit Connections
4-29           D5. Improve         Transit Systems:
               Linkages and        The Opportunity Hill area is adjacent to existing transportation sites
               Connections         and City Coach bus transit routes that currently run adjacent to the
                                   Historic Downtown Main Street and Opportunity Hill area. The
                                   existing City Coach transit routes that serve the downtown area and
                                   currently run on Depot Street, Mason Street, Dobbins Avenue,
                                   Merchant Street, Monte Vista Avenue, and Cernon Street can also
                                   serve the Opportunity Hill area. The location of additional transit
                                   stops should be studied for the Opportunity Hill area. Figure 4.9,
                                   “Transportation Sites,” shows the proximity of the project area to
                                   existing transportation sites including the bus transfer station at
                                   Monte Vista Avenue and Cernon Street and park and ride lots on
                                   Davis Street; and the adjacent City Coach transit routes 5, 6, and 8.
Design Guidelines
6-1            6 Design Guidelines These design guidelines have been created to compliment the
                                   existing downtown and to extend the hometown feel that it generates
                                   eastward through the Opportunity Hill area. In recognizing the
                                   importance of the complimentary quality and character desired, the
                                   City should encourage the use of these guidelines for existing and
                                   future projects and developments to follow in the existing downtown
                                   areas. In addition, the City may determine that extending these
                                   guidelines to apply throughout Downtown Vacaville may be
                                   beneficial.

                                              Draft Memorandum
      To:        Tyra Hays, City of Vacaville
                 Fred Buderi, City of Vacaville
      From: Matt Kowta, Principal
      Date:      April 15, 2014
      Re:        Apartment Project Financial Feasibility Analysis
      Current City of Vacaville policy requires that new apartment projects annex into an existing
      Community Facilities District (CFD) and then pay an annual special tax for each apartment
      unit, which provides the City with revenue to supplement annual General Fund revenues that
      are used to finance Police and Fire/Emergency Medical Services. The maximum allowed
      special tax varies by location. The maximum allowable special tax in CFD number 11 was set
      at $1,313.26 per multifamily unit in 2006/2007. The maximum allowable special tax in CFD
      number 12 was set at $748 per multifamily unit in 2007/2008. In any year, the maximum
      allowable special tax can increase over the base year values in accordance with the change in
      the Consumer Price Index. Currently, the City levies a special tax of $500 per multifamily unit.
      This special tax can be viewed as a $500 per unit increase to a given apartment complex’s
      annual operating costs.
      The City of Vacaville has received feedback from multifamily housing developers that the
      requirement for multifamily projects to annex into a Community Facilities District and pay the
      ongoing annual special tax is too onerous and is blocking developers’ ability to develop
      multifamily rental projects that are financially viable. In response to these concerns, the City
      of Vacaville retained BAE to prepare a development pro-forma, to model the effects of the CFD
      requirement on project feasibility.
      This memo presents the pro-forma that BAE prepared to analyze the impacts of the CFD
      requirement on apartment project feasibility, and then discusses the results, including the
      impact of the CFD requirement on overall project feasibility.
      Methodology
      As mentioned above, the tool used to evaluate the impact of the CFD requirement on project
      feasibility is a pro-forma financial model. This is a type of financial worksheet that developers
      use to estimate costs to develop a real estate project and then compare the costs to the

revenues that the completed project would generate. Developers typically use a pro-forma
analysis to make an initial determination as to whether a project would be capable of
generating a sufficient profit in order to make the project worth undertaking. If the initial pro-
forma analysis produces favorable results, the developer will typically prepare a much more
complicated cash flow model that accounts for the timing of expenditure outflows and revenue
inflows in a much more fine-grained fashion. Although less detailed, the pro-forma analysis is
adequate to illustrate the impact of the CFD requirement on overall project feasibility.
In terms of physical characteristics, this analysis is loosely based on the Quinn Crossing
apartment project, currently under construction at 5085 Quinn Road. This was done because
the City had recently computed City permit and impact fees for the project; thus providing key
data that would be needed to model the costs of developing a similar apartment project in
Vacaville.
Assumptions
Numerous assumptions about development costs, the revenue-generating potential of the
completed project, and the operating costs for the completed project are necessary in order to
construct the pro-forma model. One of the most significant development cost assumptions is
the “hard” construction cost. This is the cost that a developer would have to pay a contractor
to build the apartment building. To establish this assumption, BAE consulted with a
multifamily housing developer active within the Bay Area, including a project that is under
development elsewhere in the North Bay area. BAE also consulted the RS Means construction
cost estimating service, which provided online access to construction cost estimates for 3-
story apartment buildings in the Solano County area. Based on those references, plus BAE’s
prior experience, the pro-forma assumes a construction cost averaging $130 per habitable
square foot of apartment space. BAE used a cost assumption of $1,500 per uncovered
parking space and $2,500 per covered (carport) parking space. Total parking requirements
were computed based on the City of Vacaville Zoning Ordinance parking standards for
multifamily apartment projects. An additional allowance equal to $5.00 per square foot of site
area is added for on and off-site site improvements. This can include expenditures for items
such as grading, utility installation, frontage improvements, site landscape/hardscape
improvements, and drainage/stormwater improvements as well as required off-site
improvements.
As mentioned previously City permit and impact fees are a significant cost component and BAE
utilized the permit and fee information from the Quinn Crossings apartment project to
establish this assumption. This requires that the pro-forma assume the same number and
size of residential units as the Quinn Crossing project. BAE obtained Vacaville Unified School
District and Solano County impact fee schedules and used those schedules to estimate the
additional fees that would be paid to agencies outside the City of Vacaville. Additional cost
components include the “soft costs” that represent items such as architecture and
engineering, and developer overhead. Construction financing costs represent a significant
cost item. BAE based the construction financing cost assumptions on loan terms that are
                                                  2

typical for real estate development projects of this type, with the interest rate tied to current
U.S. Treasury bond yields plus a “spread” which along with the up-front fees charged to the
developer, accounts for the additional risk associated with lending on a construction project
versus investing in treasury bonds. The assumed loan interest rate and loan fees are
representative of what a developer could expect to pay to obtain a construction loan from a
commercial bank. Finally, the pro-forma incorporates the assumption that a developer will not
be willing to undertake the project unless there is the potential to earn a profit sufficient to
justify the risk. A typical threshold for this type of pro-forma analysis is gross profit equal to
10% of total project development costs.
In order to estimate the value of the completed project, BAE utilized the capitalized value
approach. Using this approach, a capitalization rate is applied to the project’s estimated
annual net operating income. The apartment rental rate assumptions drive the operating
income calculations. Apartment rental rates vary by size, configuration, and quality of unit. In
order to establish assumptions for rents, BAE surveyed currently renting apartment complexes
in Vacaville, targeting newer projects or relatively recently remodeled projects that offer units
in the same size ranges as those assumed for the pro-forma exercise. BAE estimated
apartment rents per square foot of livable area would range between about $1.40 per square
foot up to about $1.90 per square foot, with the lowest rents per square foot applying to the
largest units, and the highest rents per square foot applying to the smallest units. In a pro-
forma analysis, it is necessary to allow for periodic turnover of apartment units, and rental
income must be reduced accordingly. The pro-forma assumes a stabilized average vacancy
rate of five percent. Operating income is further reduced by project operating costs, which
includes normal ad-valorem property taxes, administration, insurance, utilities for common
areas, maintenance, capital reserves, etc. BAE estimated the annual operating costs for the
apartments at about 30 percent of gross scheduled rents, or about $5,500 per unit, per year.
The 30 percent ratio is a typical assumption within the multifamily housing industry, and the
resulting $5,500 per unit annual cost is also reasonable. The pro-forma assumes that the City
would continue to levy the police and fire CFD special tax at the current level of $500 per unit,
per year, rather than the applicable maximum allowable special tax. This is included in
addition to the $5,500 annual per unit operating cost.
The pro-forma is structured to solve for the “residual land value”. Residual land value is the
price that the developer could afford to pay for the land, after accounting for all other costs
and revenues, including the need to achieve the minimum profit threshold.
Findings
The pro-forma printout listing all of the base assumptions and calculations is attached as
Exhibit 1. As shown the residual land value is minus $15 per site (land area) square foot. This
means that the project could not be feasibly built, unless the developer was able to acquire
the land for free and also received a subsidy equal to about $6.7 million. Based on these
findings, the project is not feasible under current economic conditions.
                                                   3

The next question is what impact the CFD levy has on overall project feasibility. Without the
$500 per unit annual CFD levy, the residual land value would be minus $11. Put another way,
the required subsidy would be reduced by about $1.7 million, to about $5 million; however,
the developer would still need to acquire the site without cost. Alternatively, if the CFD levy
remains in place, the project rents would need to increase by about 4.2 percent in order to
offset the effect of the levy. On a larger one-bedroom unit currently assumed to rent for about
$1,500 per month, the monthly rent would need to increase by about $63 dollars to offset the
effect of the CFD levy. Or, if City permit and impact fees were reduced by about one-third, this
would also offset the effect of the CFD levy.
While a 4.2 percent increase in market rents would be necessary to offset the impact of the
CFD levy, a total rent increase of about 22 percent would be necessary to provide for project
feasibility while allowing for a nominal $5 per square foot residual land value. This information
can help to put the impact of the CFD levy in perspective. In other words, based on the project
characteristics and economic assumptions used in the pro-forma, the CFD levy accounts for
20% of the shortfall in project feasibility. The remaining 80% of the feasibility gap is related to
other project costs or revenue shortfalls.

State law requires that a General Plan include both a Conservation Element and an Open
Space Element. The State-mandated Conservation Element is concerned with the
conservation of natural resources, including plants and animal wildlife, water bodies and
watersheds, forests, soils, minerals, and energy conservation. Since most natural resources
are located in open space land, the City of Vacaville General Plan combines these two
elements into one.
The purpose of the Conservation and Open Space Element is to ensure the comprehensive
and long-range preservation and management of open space lands in and around the city for
the protection of natural resources and as a scenic resource. The recreation amenities of open
space lands are addressed in the Parks and Recreation Element. This Conservation and Open
Space Element also addresses the protection of cultural resources, including paleontological
resources, archaeological resources, historic resources, and Native American cultural
resources. Lastly, this Element addresses air quality because clean air is an important natural
resource and a vital component of a healthy environment.
This Element is divided into the following sections:
     Biological Resources
     Agricultural Resources
     Cultural Resources
     Scenic Resources
     Greenhouse Gases
     Energy Conservation
     Air Quality
     Water Resources
     Military Installations
     Mineral Resources
Each of these sections is divided into the following two subsections:
       Background Information: Provides background information about the various
        resources within Vacaville.
       Goals, Policies, and Actions: A list of goals, policies, and actions that provide
        guidance to the city related to decisions affecting the open space and resources
        addressed in this Element.
Requirements for the Conservation Element are established in Government Code Section
65302[d]. General Plans are to address “the conservation, development, and utilization of
natural resources including water and its hydraulic force, forests, soils, rivers and other
                                                                                         COS-1

waters, harbors, fisheries, wildlife, minerals, and other natural resources.” Water as a
hydraulic force, commercial fisheries, and harbors are not issues in Vacaville’s Planning
Area, and therefore are not addressed in this Element.
The State-mandated Open Space Element is concerned with the management of open space
resources. Open space is defined as any parcel or area of public or private land or water that
is essentially unimproved and undeveloped. Government Code Section 65560 describes six
categories of open space:
     Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources
     Open Space for the Managed Production of Resources
     Open Space for Outdoor Recreation
     Open Space for Public Health and Safety
     Open Space in Support of the Mission of Military Installations
     Open Space for the Protection of Native American Sacred Sites
The types of open space in each of these categories and where they are addressed in this
General Plan are identified in Table COS-1. Although the Government Code establishes
what topics must be included in the Open Space Element, it does not dictate a specific
organization for the Element.
Located at the transition zone between the Sacramento Valley to the east, and the Coast
Ranges to the west, Vacaville features a rich diversity of plant and animal species and
habitats, which are the physical locations or types of environments in which an organism or
biological population lives or occurs. As shown in Figure COS-1, in addition to agricultural
areas, the city contains three broad natural community types – a distinctive group of
different organisms that inhabit a common environment, interact with each other, and are
relatively independent of other groups – that encompass a wide range of habitats. The
distinction between the following natural community types and agriculture is based on soil
types, land form, and land use.
       Valley Floor Grassland and Vernal Pool Natural Community. This community
        includes areas that currently support, or have historically supported, vernal pool
        habitats surrounding grasslands. This community includes known wetlands,
        including in the areas around Interstate 505 that are subject to various business park
        policy plans.
       Inner Coast Range Natural Community. This community consists of ridges and
        valleys within the Inner Coast Range that contain a number of plant communities,
        including grassland, oak woodland, oak savanna, and mixed chaparral/scrub brush.

           Riparian, Stream, and Freshwater Marsh Natural Community. This community
            occurs within the other natural communities and encompasses all freshwater, aquatic,
            marsh, and riparian habitats. Alamo Creek and Ulatis Creek, two major riparian and
            stream habitats in Vacaville, have well-developed riparian plant communities, but the
            majority of the areas in Vacaville are dominated by non-native species. Although the
            riparian habitat within the city is narrow and characterized by a mix of native and
            non-native trees and shrubs, it provides important habitat linking the Vaca Mountains
            to the valley floor.

significant portion of the Vacaville area. It offers critical contributions to the natural
environment, including important foraging and nesting habitat for many species, such as the
Swainson’s hawk and burrowing owl.
As a result of these diverse communities, varied and abundant wildlife occurs within and
around the city. Since this diversity of natural communities and fauna includes many
endangered, threatened, special-status, or otherwise sensitive species and habitats, Vacaville
has implemented policies and actions to protect and conserve key areas and the overall
natural environment, and is currently participating in the countywide HCP effort, as
described below. In addition, in 1989, Vacaville adopted Resolution 1989-J-5, which
approved the City’s Creekways Policy. The Creekways Policy document addresses public
access, open space, and drainage management along creeks.
Vacaville is a member agency for the Solano HCP. The HCP effectively shifts endangered
species regulations compliance from the federal and State level, including the federal and
State Endangered Species Acts, to the local level under the authority of a well-regulated,
regional plan. The federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) protects listed animal species
from “take,” which is broadly defined as to “harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill,
trap, capture, or collect, or attempt to engage in such conduct.” Plants are legally protected
under the ESA if take occurs on federal land or from federal actions, such as issuing a
wetland fill permit. The federal ESA is administered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). The California Endangered
Species Act (CESA) also protects listed species from “take.” The State and federal lists of
threatened and endangered species are generally similar; however, a species present on one
list may be absent from the other. CESA regulations are also somewhat different from the
federal ESA in that the State regulations include threatened and endangered plants on non-
federal lands within the definition of “take.” The California Department of Fish and Wildlife
(CDFW) administers CESA.
The HCP addresses 37 threatened and endangered species, many of which occur in and
around Vacaville, such as the Swainson’s hawk, burrowing owl, vernal pool fairy shrimp,
and California tiger salamander. The HCP will implement conservation measures to ensure
the protection of these species and their habitat within the HCP area. In addition, the HCP
conservation actions provide significant benefit for an additional 35 species identified as
“Special Management Species.” Special Management Species include species that may be
considered by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) – California legislation
that requires environmental review for projects anticipated to result in adverse impacts to the
environment – to be threatened or endangered, but insufficient information is available on
their status to receive the protections and assurances provided through federal HCP
regulations. Table COS-2 includes the threatened and endangered species and Special
Management Species addressed in the Solano HCP that are known or could potentially occur

present in the Vacaville area that are not addressed in the Solano HCP.
Goal COS-1         Protect and enhance habitat for sensitive species and natural
                   communities.
Policies
Policy COS-P1.1     Support the Solano County Water Agency and federal and State
                    agencies’ efforts to prepare and implement the Solano Habitat
                    Conservation Plan (HCP).
Policy COS-P1.2     Manage natural open space lands, where feasible, in a manner consistent
                    with wildlife protection.
Policy COS-P1.3     Protect the existing wildlife movement corridors within the designated
                    Vacaville-Fairfield Greenbelt area and create new wildlife corridors,
                    including creek corridors and utility easements, where feasible, to enable
                    free movement of animals, to minimize wildlife-urban conflicts, and to
                    establish open space linkages.
Policy COS-P1.4     Continue to protect mature trees and existing native non-agricultural
                    trees.
Policy COS-P1.5     Require new development proposals to provide baseline assessments
                    prepared by qualified biologists. The assessment shall contain sufficient
                    detail to characterize the resources on, and adjacent to, the development
                    site. The assessment shall also identify the presence of important and
                    sensitive resources, such as wetlands, riparian habitats, and rare,
                    threatened, or endangered species affected by the development.
Policy COS-P1.6     Require that new development minimize the disturbance of natural
                    habitats and vegetation. Require revegetation of disturbed natural habitat
                    areas with native or non-invasive naturalized species.
Policy COS-P1.7     Encourage new development to incorporate native vegetation into
                    landscape plans.
Policy COS-P1.8     Prohibit the use of invasive, non-native species, as identified by the State
                    or County Department of Agriculture or other authoritative sources, in
                    landscaping on public property or in common areas in private
                    developments.

Policy COS-P1.9   Require that new development include provisions to protect and preserve
                  wetland habitats that meet one of the following conditions:
                    The wetlands contribute to the habitat quality and value of
                     reserve/preserve lands established or expected to be established in
                     perpetuity for conservation purposes.
                    The wetlands are contiguous to riparian or stream corridors, or other
                     permanently protected lands.
                    The wetlands are located within or contiguous to other high value
                     natural areas.
Policy COS-P1.10 Where avoidance of wetlands is not practicable or does not contribute to
                  long-term conservation of the resources, require new development to
                  provide for off-site mitigation that results in no net loss of wetland
                  acreage and functional value within the watersheds draining to the Delta
                  or Suisun Marsh.
Policy COS-P1.11 Require that, as appropriate, new policy plans or specific plans contain a
                  resource management component and associated funding mechanisms
                  that includes policies to protect preserved natural communities.
Policy COS-P1.12 Until the Solano Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) is adopted, comply
                  with all of the Avoidance, Minimization, and Mitigation Measures listed
                  in the Draft Solano HCP (see Appendix A for a list of the Avoidance and
                  Minimization Measures that are applicable to Vacaville). In addition,
                  require that development projects provide copies of required permits, or
                  verifiable statements that permits are not required, from the California
                  Department of Fish and Wildlife (2081 Individual Take Permit) and US
                  Fish and Wildlife Service (Section 7 Take Authorization) prior to
                  receiving grading permits or other approvals that would permit land
                  disturbing activities and conversion of habitats or impacts to protected
                  species. In cases where environmental review indicates that such
                  permits may not be required, the Community Development Director may
                  establish time limits of not less than 45 days from the submission of an
                  adequate request for concurrence response from an agency. If the agency
                  has not responded, or requested a time extension of no more than 90 days
                  to complete their assessment, within the established time frame,
                  applicable grading permits or other authorizations may be provided,
                  subject to other City requirements and review. However, the City’s
                  issuance of grading permits or other authorizations does not absolve the
                  applicant’s obligations to comply with all other State and federal laws
                  and regulations.

Goal COS-2      Preserve and restore Vacaville's creeks.
Policies
Policy COS-P2.1  Discourage undergrounding of creeks and encourage daylighting of
                 existing culverted creeks.
Policy COS-P2.2  Protect existing stream channels and riparian vegetation by requiring
                 buffering or landscaped setbacks and storm runoff interception.
Policy COS-P2.3  Require creekway and riparian area protection during construction, such
                 as providing adequate setbacks from the creek bank and riparian areas,
                 and creekway and riparian area restoration after construction.
Policy COS-P2.4  Implement the City’s Creekways Policy in all new development
                 approvals to balance recreation and conservation within creekway areas.
                 Integrate creeks with trails and other recreational open space, and
                 encourage public access along creek corridors where compatible with
                 protection of the creek’s natural resources and flood control functions.
Policy COS-P2.5  Encourage restoration and expansion of riparian and floodplain habitat
                 within channelized streams and flood channels where feasible, such as

                     from creeks and protection of the creeks and associated riparian habitats
                     during construction, and restoration after construction. As part of this
                     ordinance, implement programs to limit invasive non-native species from
                     becoming established or expanding within the city, and evaluate public
                     access along creekways to ensure protection of habitat resources and to
                     ensure public safety within creek setback areas. Update the City’s
                     Creekways Policy to be consistent with the creek protection ordinance.

                     creeks.
Like most cities in Solano County, Vacaville was built on agricultural land. Whereas the
city’s economy once thrived on agriculture, the city has since become urban and diversified.
The economic importance of agriculture within Vacaville has diminished, as illustrated by
the very few remaining agricultural acres within the city limit. However, given the
importance of agriculture in the region, agriculture still contributes to Vacaville’s economy
and culture.
A significant amount of agricultural land exists immediately outside of the Vacaville city
limit and within the Planning Area. The State Department of Conservation (DOC) maps and
categorizes farmland within the State. Within the Planning Area, the DOC identifies prime
farmland, farmland of statewide importance, unique farmland, and grazing land; these
classifications are described as follows:
  Prime Farmland has the best combination of physical and chemical features able to
    sustain long-term agricultural production. Prime farmland has the soil quality, growing
    season, and moisture supply needed to produce sustained high yields. Land must have
    been used for irrigated agriculture production at some time during the four years prior to
    the mapping date.
  Farmland of Statewide Importance is similar to prime farmland, but with minor
    shortcomings, such as steeper slopes or less ability to store soil moisture. Land must have
    been used for irrigated agricultural production at some time during the four years prior to
    the mapping date.
  Unique Farmland consists of lesser quality soils used for the production of the State’s
    leading agricultural crops. This land is usually irrigated, but may include non-irrigated
                                                                                        COS-15

CITY OF VACAVILLE
VACAVILLE GENERAL PLAN

   orchards or vineyards as found in some climatic zones in California. Land must have
   been farmed at some time during the four years prior to the mapping date.
  Grazing Land is the land on which the existing vegetation is suited to the grazing of
   livestock.
The majority of agricultural land within the Planning Area is classified as prime farmland.
Table COS-3 lists the number of acres within the Planning Area in each classification. As
shown in Figure COS-2, most of the prime farmland is located on the eastern side of the
Planning Area. Throughout the western and southern limits of the Planning Area, the
agricultural land is predominantly grazing land, with the exception of prime farmland along
Vaca Valley Road, west of the city limit and between Cherry Glen Road and Interstate 80.
In addition, the Vacaville Planning Area includes lands protected under Williamson Act
contracts, a State incentive to retain prime agricultural land and open space in agricultural
use. These contracts preserve land in agricultural use for ten years and are adopted by land
owners on a voluntary basis in exchange for tax benefits. According to Solano County, as of
December 2009, there are approximately 27,000 acres of agricultural lands under Williamson
Act contracts within the Vacaville Planning Area, including 1,200 acres within the Sphere of
Influence. These numbers include both lands currently held in active contracts and those that
have filed for non-renewal.
Goal COS-3          Support Solano County efforts to preserve existing agricultural lands
                    located in the Planning Area.
Policies
Policy COS-P3.1       Maintain a compact urban form and locate new development to minimize
                      the loss of agricultural and open space resources.
Policy COS-P3.2       Support the preservation of land under Williamson Act contracts within
                      the Vacaville Planning Area.
Policy COS-P3.3       Encourage the continued agricultural use of land within the Planning
                      Area that is currently being used for agricultural purposes.
Policy COS-P3.4       Work cooperatively with non-profit organizations, such as land trusts, to
                      preserve agricultural land in the Planning Area, as shown on Figure LU-

Action COS-A5.1 Research the formation of an agricultural co-operative for specialty crops
                     to make use of economies of scale and thereby minimize the barriers to
                     providing local crops to Vacaville residents.
Paleontological Resources
Vacaville lies in a geological transition zone between the Sacramento Valley to the east and
the Coast Ranges to the west. The deposits underlying the Vacaville area comprise a variety
of rock types dating from various geologic periods, with certain formations containing
fossils, some of which may be paleontologically significant. Fossils are the preserved
remains of ancient organisms. Mineralized organisms are the most commonly known type of
fossils and usually consist of hard material such as bone, shell, and wood. Many common
fossils have shapes that can look very bone-like and are usually preserved after being quickly
buried in sediment.
Archaeological Resources
Solano County is known for having had a relatively high population density in prehistoric
times. The Patwin peoples controlled the area west of the Sacramento River to the crest of
the Coast Ranges. The Patwin lived by hunting, fishing, and gathering, and inhabited semi-
permanent villages, the remnants of which have been found in the hills around Vacaville.
The California Historical Resources Information System identifies dozens of recorded
prehistoric archaeological resources in the Vacaville area. These resources consist of the
following: habitation sites, containing evidence of resource procurement and social
organization; burial sites; bedrock mortars, representing use of technology in food
processing; and isolated stone tools, found in contexts other than typical archaeological sites.
Historic Resources
The town of Vacaville was established in 1851, and by the end of that year had a population
of 580. During the mid to late 19th century, livestock and wheat production were the
principal economic products in the county. The completion of nearby railroads in the late
1860s provided a way for ranchers to get their crops to market, but the higher cost of rail
transport coupled with increased competition led to the decline of the area’s wheat industry
during the 1880s. Subsequently, Solano County farmers turned to other crops, most of
which, like vineyards and row crops, required irrigation. While rail transport had contributed
to the decline of wheat production, the ease of access it provided gave a boost to produce

farming. By the 1890s, Vaca Valley and the foothills of the Vaca Mountains were covered
with orchards encompassing almost all of the available non-irrigated land, and in 1892,
Vacaville was formally incorporated.
After peaking in the mid-1910s, fruit production in the Vacaville area declined due to
drought and soil depletion, competition during the Great Depression, and overproduction for
the World War I war effort. In the mid-20th century, new employers arrived in the area,
resulting in explosive growth in Vacaville. The now defunct Basic Vegetable Products
company located a 1,000-worker onion dehydrating facility in Vacaville, and in 1942, Suisun
Air Base (now Travis Air Force Base) was established just to the south of Vacaville.
The Vacaville area contains over 200 identified historic resources, including the Peña Adobe,
Will H. Buck House, Vacaville Town Hall, the site of the First Vacaville Buddhist Church,
Pleasants/Hoskins Ranch district, and Vaca Adobe, which are all listed in the National
Register. In addition to the Pleasants/Hoskins Ranch district, the City has identified the
following five other historic districts, each as an aggregation of resources related by a
common historical theme:
       Buck Avenue District, which includes 15 contributing buildings on the 100, 200, and
        300 blocks of Buck Avenue.
       Monte Vista Avenue District, which includes nine contributing buildings on Bush
        Street and East Monte Vista Avenue.
       100/200 Block of Kendal Street, which includes 14 contributing buildings.
       300/400 Block of Kentucky Street, which includes seven contributing buildings.
       Parker Addition, which includes 56 contributing buildings on Boyd Street, Catherine
        Street, Davis Street, Elizabeth Street, Stevenson Street, and William Street.
The City has also designated the Downtown and a parcel containing a building that served as
St. Mary’s Catholic Church from 1930 to 1956 as historical preservation zones with design
standards to enhance the historical characters of these areas.
Native American Tribal Cultural Resources
Native American tribal cultural resources include sites, features, places, cultural landscapes,
sacred places, and objects with cultural value to a California Native American Tribe. While
some tribal cultural resources include physical archaeological resources, described above,
cultural resources are not limited to physical resources that have scientific significance.
Tribal cultural resources also include cultural landscapes and non-unique archeological
resources. Non-unique resources are resources that are deemed culturally significant to a
tribe, but do not contain information needed for scientific purposes, and may not be the best
specimen in terms of quality, uniqueness, or age.
Aside from the prehistoric archaeological resources discussed above, no Native American
tribal cultural resources have been identified by records searches, literature reviews, and
                                                                                        COS-21

ancestral territory of Native Americans, there are likely unrecorded cultural resources that
may be valued by Native American Tribes for reasons other than scientific significance. To
ensure that tribal cultural resources are not impacted by development, the City will continue
to consult with the Native American Tribes with ancestral ties to the Vacaville area.

Vacaville’s scenic resources are a valued local asset for the community. Views of and from
the city serve to situate the community in its local environment and landscape, and comprise
an important element of Vacaville’s quality of life.
Most of Vacaville’s scenic resources are associated with the open space, natural resources,
and agricultural uses of the Planning Area. Such areas include the riparian corridors - the
habitat and vegetation zones associated with the banks and floodplains of a river, stream, or
lake - that run throughout the city, views of the rural and undeveloped lands surrounding the
city, and Vacaville’s hillside areas. Although views of the surrounding ridgelines and
hilltops are an important contributor to the identity of the city, the General Plan addresses
development on ridgelines and hills in the Safety Element in order to acknowledge and
prevent risks to life and property that can result from such development.
Many of the scenic resources that are valued by Vacaville residents, such as the ridgelines of
the Vaca Mountains and English Hills, are located outside the city limits or even beyond the
Planning Area boundary. There are no State-designated scenic highways in Vacaville.
Goal COS-8          Maintain and enhance the quality of Vacaville’s scenic and visual
                    resources.
Policies
Policy COS-P8.1       Preserve scenic features and the feel of a city surrounded by open space,
                      and preserve view corridors to the hills and other significant natural
                      areas.
Policy COS-P8.2       Retain major ridgelines and hillsides as open space.
A balance of naturally occurring gases in the atmosphere determines the earth’s climate by
trapping solar heat through a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. Greenhouse
gases (GHGs), including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and
water vapor, keep solar radiation from exiting our atmosphere. In a process very similar to
the windows on a greenhouse, GHGs trap so much heat that the temperature within the
earth’s atmosphere is rising.

GHGs are emitted through both natural processes and human activities. Emissions from
human activities, such as electricity production, motor vehicle use, and agriculture, are
contributing to the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere and have led to a trend of
unnatural warming of the earth’s climate, which is known as global warming.
Coping with climate change and reducing GHG emissions is ultimately part of the larger
challenge of fostering sustainable communities – communities that engage in practices that
meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs. A sustainable community is one that is economically, environmentally, and
socially healthy and resilient. Climate change goals are most effectively accomplished when
efforts are focused on integrating principles of sustainability within sectors such as
transportation, buildings, ecosystems, and water systems. One way to integrate sustainability
into a community is by creating compact, walkable development. Walkable, mixed-use
communities provide their residents with retail and services within walking distance of their
homes and workplaces, thereby reducing the need to make automobile trips and,
consequently, reducing GHG emissions. In addition, green building practices that promote
energy and resource conservation can be effective in cities like Vacaville, where energy use
generates a significant portion of the city’s GHG emissions.
In 2006, the Governor of California signed Assembly Bill (AB) 32, codified under the Global
Warming Solutions Act, into legislation. The Act requires that California cap its GHG
emissions at 1990 levels by 2020. This legislation requires the California Air Resource
Board (CARB) to establish a program for statewide GHG emissions reporting, as well as
monitoring and enforcement of that program. CARB is also required to adopt rules and
regulations to achieve the maximum technologically feasible and cost-effective GHG
emission reductions. To meet these regulatory requirements, CARB published a list of
discrete GHG emissions reduction measures that can be implemented immediately. In
addition, CARB’s Early Action Plan identified regulations and measures that could be
implemented in the near future to reduce GHG emissions.
The main measures to reduce GHG emissions are contained in the AB 32 Scoping Plan,
which was approved on December 12, 2008. This plan includes a range of GHG reduction
actions. Central to the draft plan is a cap and trade program covering 85 percent of the
State’s emissions. This program will be developed in conjunction with the Western Climate
Initiative, comprised of seven states and three Canadian provinces, to create a regional
carbon market. The plan also proposes that utilities produce a third of their energy from
renewable sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal, and proposes to expand and
strengthen existing energy efficiency programs and building and appliance standards. The
plan includes full implementation of the Pavley clean car standards, whereby the California
Environmental Protection Agency requires reductions of GHG emissions for passenger cars,
pick-up trucks, and sport utility vehicles. Less polluting and more efficient cars and trucks
allow consumers to save on operating costs through reduced fuel use. The standards also call
for development and implementation of the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which will require
oil companies to make cleaner domestic-produced fuels.

Senate Bill (SB) 375 also responds to AB 32. SB 375 calls for the automobile and light truck
industry to produce reduced-emission vehicles and requires metropolitan planning
organizations (MPOs) to prepare sustainable communities strategies, which will demonstrate
how a region will meet CARB’s GHG reduction targets by reducing the amount of vehicle
miles traveled. The Association of Bay Area Governments and the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission are currently leading the effort to prepare the sustainable
communities strategy for the Bay Area, including Vacaville.
The City inventoried baseline GHG emissions that occurred in 2008 in Vacaville from the
following sectors: transportation, residential and non-residential energy use (electricity and
natural gas), moving and treating water/wastewater, solid waste disposal, and other off-road
emissions (e.g. from lawnmowers and construction equipment). This inventory provides a
baseline against which to measure future reductions in GHG emissions. Figure COS-3
represents the 2008 GHG emissions in Vacaville by sector. The transportation sector
represents the largest source of GHG emissions in Vacaville followed by energy use.
FIGURE COS-3 2008 GHG EMISSIONS IN VACAVILLE
The City of Vacaville adopted an Energy and Conservation Action Strategy (ECAS) in 2015
to set targets and establish measures to reduce GHG emissions in Vacaville. The ECAS
includes an inventory of 2008 GHG emissions and models 2020 business as usual forecasts
of GHG emissions. The ECAS also includes targets for GHG emission reductions, measures
that will enable the City to meet those targets through municipal and communitywide actions,
and a monitoring and implementation plan.

Actions
Action COS-A9.1 Implement the Energy and Conservation Action Strategy and monitor its
                      effectiveness every five years by conducting a greenhouse gas emissions
                      inventory. Adjust the Energy and Conservation Action Strategy as
                      needed based on these calculations to ensure that the City is on track to
                      meet its greenhouse gas emissions reduction target.
Action COS-A9.2 Continue to provide alternative fuel infrastructure throughout the city,
                      such as electric vehicle charging stations, and conduct periodic studies to
                      ensure that there is demand for such facilities as technologies change.
Action COS-A9.3 Continue to purchase alternative fuel, low emission vehicles for the
                      City’s vehicle fleet.
Energy production, conservation, and patterns of energy consumption are of growing
importance to individuals, agencies, and jurisdictions. Energy price fluctuations in the late
1990s and increases in early 2001, combined with rolling blackouts, have led to a renewed
interest in energy conservation.
The residential sector’s energy demands constitute approximately 52 percent of the
electricity and natural gas use within the city limits, as shown in Table COS-4. Typically,
the most important factors influencing residential energy consumption are the size of the
house, the type of house (detached single-family or multi-family structure), the number of
major appliances, and the construction and siting of the structure. Residential energy needs
are often fulfilled by electricity or a combination of gas and electricity. Space heating is the
most energy-consuming activity in residential structures.
The State of California requires local governments to address energy conservation and
efficiency in new construction. The State Building Standard Code, including Title 24,
requires energy conservation and efficiency measures for any new structures, additions to
existing structures, changes to the footprint of structures, or changes to water and heating
systems. In Vacaville, the Community Development Department is responsible for enforcing
all the provisions of Title 24.

Due to its location, meteorology, land uses, and traffic patterns, Vacaville experiences a
variety of air quality issues. The city is located primarily within the Sacramento Valley Air
Basin (SVAB); however, a small portion of Vacaville, Lagoon Valley, is located within the
San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin. The prevailing winds in Vacaville are moderate in
strength and vary from moist clean breezes from the south to dry land flows from the north.
The mountains surrounding the SVAB create a barrier to airflow, which can trap air
pollutants under certain meteorological conditions. Surface concentrations of pollutants are
highest when stagnant conditions are combined with temperature inversions that trap
pollutants near the ground.
Air pollutants of concern in Vacaville include ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen
oxides (NO2 and NO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM). These pollutants
originate from sources both within and outside of Vacaville. Vehicle use is the primary
source of air pollutants in Vacaville. Vehicles form pollutants both directly by combustion
and indirectly by the interaction of combustion byproducts with one another and with
ultraviolet (UV) light. PM is produced by both vehicles and wood-burning fireplaces, among
other sources. In addition, toxic air contaminants (TACs), such as benzene, butadiene,
formaldehyde, and hydrogen sulfide, are of concern because they are harmful in small
quantities.
Air quality in Vacaville and in Yolo County to the north is primarily monitored and managed
by the Yolo Solano Air Quality Management District (YSAQMD), although a small

southwest portion of the Planning Area is managed by the Bay Area Air Quality
Management District (BAAQMD). The YSAQMD and BAAQMD are tasked with
achieving and maintaining healthful air quality for their residents by establishing programs,
plans, and regulations enforcing air pollution control rules in order to attain all State and
federal ambient air quality standards and to minimize public exposure to airborne toxins and
nuisance odors. The YSAQMD has adopted several attainment plans to achieve State and
federal air quality standards. The YSAQMD continuously monitors its progress in
implementing attainment plans and must periodically report to the California Air Resources
Board and the US Environmental Protection Agency.
Sensitive receptors include those segments of the population that are most susceptible to
poor air quality, such as children, elderly people, and sick people, as well as sensitive land
uses, such as schools, hospitals, parks, and residential communities. Air quality problems
intensify when sources of air pollutants and sensitive receptors are located near one another.
Since residential areas are located throughout the city, as are schools, parks, and medical
facilities, the consideration of sensitive receptors is an important aspect of the General Plan.
Goal COS-12          Maintain and improve air quality.
Policies

                      minimize direct and indirect air pollutant emissions by including
                      components that reduce vehicle trips and promote energy efficiency.
Policy COS-P12.4 Require that development projects implement best management practices
                      to reduce air pollutant emissions associated with the construction and
                      operation of the project.

As described in the Public Facilities and Services Element, Vacaville’s water supply comes
from both surface water and groundwater, and is drawn from a variety of reserves. The
City’s current water use is less than half of the City’s total water allocation. Residential uses
make up the vast majority of water use in the city (approximately 70 percent), followed by
commercial/industrial uses and irrigation (each about 10 percent).
New mandatory requirements, per State law (The Water Conservation Act of 2009 – Senate
Bill X7-7), mandate the reduction of per capita water use and agricultural water use
throughout the state by 20 percent by 2020.
Currently, the City has "standby authority" to impose water conservation during
emergencies.
The City’s current Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) addresses the current and
projected use and distribution plans for recycled water.

The City owns and operates twelve municipal groundwater wells with very high quality
groundwater. Eleven of the wells withdraw water from the deep aquifer in the basal zone of
the Tehama Formation. Most City wells are located in the Elmira field. However, new wells
are being sited further north, near Interstate 80. A regional program is being implemented to
monitor groundwater data to ensure against overdraft and/or contamination.
The major sources of groundwater recharge in the Vacaville area are precipitation,
infiltration from streets, subsurface inflow, and deep percolation of applied irrigation water in
agricultural areas. Creeks, streams, flood corridors, riparian habitat, and wetlands may
accommodate floodwater for groundwater recharge and stormwater management, which is
discussed in the Safety Element.

Policies
Policy COS-P15.1 Consult Travis Air Force Base officials for review and comment on
                      proposed development projects, General Plan changes, zoning changes,
                      policy and specific plans, and other comprehensive plans that have the
                      potential for significant impacts within the Base’s Area of Influence.
Policy COS-P15.2 Consider the needs of Travis Air Force Base for new and expanded
                      infrastructure, as well as on-going maintenance needs for those
                      infrastructure systems, within the Base’s Area of Influence.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the Vacaville Planning Area contains limited
mineral resources that are being extracted. Near the southern boundary of the Planning Area
in the vicinity of Cement Hill, limestone deposits show evidence of some historic use. Stone
quarries in the Vaca Mountains produced dimensioned and ornamental stone. Although the
western hills contain sandstone and conglomerates that may be used for sands, gravel, and
stone, none of these resources are currently being mined. However, State law requires that
the General Plan address mineral resources.

COS-38
The purpose of the Land Use Element is to shape the future physical development of
Vacaville and to preserve, protect, and enhance Vacaville’s quality of life. The Land Use
Element sets forth specific goals, policies, and actions to guide land use for the City of
Vacaville through the year 2035. The General Plan Land Use Map, which is also part of this
element, graphically represents the City’s vision for the future development of the city limits
– the boundary that encompasses the incorporated city and defines the properties that are
subject to the City’s jurisdiction – and the Sphere of Influence (SOI) – the area that the City
expects to grow into in the future. The Land Use Element also includes goals, policies, and
actions for the Planning Area – the areas outside of the city’s boundaries that bear a relation
to the city’s planning but are under the jurisdictional control of Solano County. These
planning boundaries are shown in Figure I-2 of the Introduction chapter. The City’s Land
Use and Development Code and subdivision regulations implement the Land Use Element.
The Land Use Element describes land use designations, special planning areas, and existing
land uses in Vacaville. The Land Use Element is divided into the following sections:
       Background Information: A description of Vacaville’s community form and image;
        existing land use; policy plans, master plans, and specific plans; the Urban Growth
        Boundary (UGB); the Master Water Agreement; and the Nut Tree Airport Land Use
        Compatibility Plan.
       General Plan Land Use Designations: A description of the characteristics and
        intensity of the different land use designations in Vacaville, including a map
        identifying the locations of these land use designations.
       Goals, Policies, and Actions: A list of goal, policy, and action statements that
        provide guidance to Vacaville on land use decisions.
Because it identifies locations for future development, the Land Use Element is closely tied
to the other elements in this General Plan. In particular, the Transportation and Public
Facilities and Services Elements address the infrastructure needs to serve new development;
the Conservation and Open Space Element addresses groundwater recharge, which is
important to mitigate flood risks that can affect new development; and the Safety Element
addresses flood risks for new development.
Vacaville’s development continues to transform it from its historic roots as a small rural town
to a moderate-sized suburban city. Although its history will continue to play an important
                                                                                            LU-1

role in setting the character of the community, new influences must also be integrated. The
strongest visual features of the city are the Vaca Mountains, Alamo Creek Ridge, and the
English Hills along the western borders of the city. These natural hillsides and ridgelines can
be seen from most areas of the city. Creeks and associated riparian corridors are another
valuable visual asset. The older sections of Vacaville, especially the Downtown, project a
distinctive identity, formed by the city’s past. General Plan policies are intended to enhance
the character of the existing community.
If Vacaville wishes to retain its identity as a distinct city, as opposed to the seemingly endless
urban sprawl so prevalent in other metropolitan areas of California, it must establish clear
edges of urban development. Over the coming years, there must be a deliberate effort to
promote design that is not only attractive, but also expresses the community identity. Ideas
embodied in the General Plan include: continued revitalization and expansion of the
Downtown; individual landscape treatments of arterial streets and the freeways; design
elements that mark points of entry; and preservation of open space on slopes, major ridges,
and Vacaville’s Planning Area. To work towards this vision, the City adopted Residential
Design Requirements for New Single-Family Development, a companion document to the
City’s Land Use and Development Code, as well as the City Gateways Design Master Plan
and the Opportunity Hill Master Plan, both described later in this chapter.
Community planning can directly enhance the wellness of a community. Land use planning
has recently become a recognized tool for increasing individuals’ physical activity rates,
access to healthy foods, and access to health care. This Element and the Conservation and
Open Space and Parks and Recreation Elements contain policies and actions that promote
healthy communities.
This section provides qualitative and quantitative descriptions of existing land uses in
Vacaville. Data on existing land use is based on the City’s land use database. Figure LU-1
shows a map of the existing land uses in the city as of 2011 and Table LU-1 lists the acreage
in each category. As shown in Figure LU-1, most of Vacaville is comprised of single-family
residential neighborhoods, with a retail corridor along Interstate 80 and a mix of uses in
Downtown Vacaville. Vacaville has significant amounts of vacant land designated for
development as well, most of which is located along Interstate 505 in the northeastern
portion of the city.
In addition to the General Plan, Vacaville has other plans that guide development in specific
areas of the city, including specific plans, policy plans, and master plans. The City’s existing
specific plans, policy plans, and master plans are shown on Figure LU-2.

Specific Plans
A specific plan is tool for systematically implementing the General Plan within a portion of
the Planning Area. A specific plan is a hybrid document that combines General Plan policy
statements with development regulations. It is often used to address the development
requirements for a single project, such as urban infill or a new growth area. As a result, its
emphasis is on concrete standards and development criteria. Its text and diagrams will
address the planning of necessary infrastructure and facilities, as well as land uses and open
space. In addition, it will specify those programs and regulations necessary to finance
infrastructure and public works projects.
A specific plan may be adopted either by resolution, like a general plan, or by ordinance, like
zoning. The City currently has three specific plans: North Village Specific Plan, Vanden
Meadows Specific Plan, and Brighton Landing Specific Plan. The City requires that specific
plans be applied to large areas of raw land on the city’s fringe where major utility and
circulation extensions are likely to be required. Specific plans are also required for areas
within the city where major projects are being considered or a significant change in land use
will occur. Specific plans may be implemented by themselves or in conjunction with
development agreements, and are executed consistent with State law.
Future specific plans must include a diagram showing the distribution of land uses; define
permitted and conditionally permitted land uses; identify major public facilities, including
roads, water, sewer and drainage facilities, schools, and parks; describe phasing; identify
infrastructure financing mechanisms; and describe any other elements that may be needed to
ensure an orderly development process with minimal adverse impacts.
Policy Plans
Similar to a specific plan, a policy plan is another tool used to implement the General Plan.
Policy plans provide development guidelines for master planning development within a
geographic area of the city. The principal difference between the contents of a policy plan
and a specific plan is that the specific plan contains more detailed information on public
infrastructure and facilities and how they will be funded. The City has 18 policy plans that
support commercial, office, and industrial development. Many of these documents are over
20 years old and address areas that have been built out. However, the City’s largest policy
plan areas, located in the northern portion of the city, have a significant inventory of vacant
land capable of accommodating additional development within the existing industrial and
business parks. This area is addressed by the following policy plans: Airport Business Area
Policy Plan, Nut Tree Ranch Policy Plan, Interchange Business Park Policy Plan, Golden
Hills Business Park Policy Plan, and Vaca Valley Business Park Policy Plan.
Master Plans
The City of Vacaville has adopted two Master Plans: the City Gateways Design Master Plan
and the Opportunity Hill Master Plan. Master plans provide development and design
                                                                                           LU-7

CITY OF VACAVILLE
VACAVILLE GENERAL PLAN
LAND USE ELEMENT
guidelines for specific geographic areas within the city or for specialized areas and/or
amenities within the city (e.g. freeway landscaping, riparian areas, and freeway signage).
The City Gateways Design Master Plan, adopted on October 26, 1999, establishes standards
for entry points into the city and for the city’s image as seen from the freeways that traverse
the city, including landscape design and a coherent signage design. Focusing on the
Interstate 80 and Interstate 505 corridors, the City Gateways Design Master Plan identifies
ways to improve the perception of Vacaville from the freeways.
Adopted in April 2008, the Opportunity Hill Master Plan establishes goals and policies to
enhance two areas in Downtown Vacaville, as shown in Figure LU-2: the Opportunity Hill
sites, located at the northeast corner of Wilson Street and East Main Street, and the Depot
Street site, located on McClellan Street between Bush Street and East Main Street. The
strategic framework identifies the primary land uses and supporting strategies for these sites.
Primary land uses include housing, restaurant/entertainment, recreation, retail, office, and
heritage tourism. The Opportunity Hill Master Plan includes two development scenarios for
these sites that feature a mix of housing and commercial uses. To support the Master Plan’s
goals, several policies and actions are included in this Element related to design guidelines
and standards, parking, development incentives, General Plan and Zoning amendments,
connectivity, infrastructure, wayfinding, and affordable housing. In addition, this Element
directs the City to amend the Residential Urban High Density Overlay on the Opportunity
Hill and Depot Street sites to allow up to 65 dwelling units per acre.
In 2008, the City adopted a 20-year Urban Growth Boundary (UGB), which totals 36 square
miles in size and is shown in Figure LU-3. The UGB indicates the maximum allowable
extent of urbanization; beyond this boundary, only agricultural or open space uses are
typically permitted. The UGB was adopted by the City Council as a result of a voter
signature gathering process. Subsequently, the City Council voted to incorporate the UGB
within the General Plan Land Use Element. The location of the UGB and the City’s UGB
policies can only be amended by the voters of Vacaville or by the City Council pursuant to
the procedures set forth in the policies related to the UGB in this Element, which establish
required findings for such an amendment. Land outside the UGB cannot be annexed into the
City or designated for anything other than agriculture, park, open space, public facility, or
utility uses until March 1, 2028. For areas outside of the UGB but within the Planning Area,
the General Plan land use map (see Figure LU-6) shows land use designations consistent with
the Solano County General Plan. The only exception to this approach is an area designated
Public/Institutional south of the city limits and UGB between Peabody Road and Vanden
Road.
The Urban Service Area Boundary, shown on Figure LU-3, is a result of the 1995 Master
Water Agreement between the City and the Solano Irrigation District (SID). As part of the

CITY OF VACAVILLE
VACAVILLE GENERAL PLAN
LAND USE ELEMENT
Master Water Agreement, which remains in effect until 2050, the City and SID committed to
accommodate and support urban development within the Urban Service Area Boundary.
Conversely, both entities have committed not to support urban development outside of the
boundary, which is considered to be SID’s agricultural service area. The agreement specifies
that the City and SID could mutually amend the agreement to consider an easterly expansion
of the Urban Service Area Boundary. Such an amendment would be required to allow City
water service in the East of Leisure Town Road Growth Area, an area that is designated for
urban development under this General Plan.
The City requires a 300- to 500-foot agricultural buffer between residential and agricultural
uses. The agricultural buffer is intended to protect viable agricultural operations (particularly
crops that require irrigation, tilling, and spraying) from the intrusion of urban uses. The
Master Water Agreement stipulates that any proposal for the expansion of the Urban Service
Area Boundary must consider the potential expansion of the City’s existing agricultural
buffer requirement. The agricultural buffer is addressed in the Conservation and Open Space
Element.
Adoption of the UGB created two new significant areas of undeveloped land within the
UGB: the East of Leisure Town Road Growth Area and the Northeast Growth Area, which
are shown in Figure LU-3. Each of these growth areas is partially located outside of the
existing city limits and SOI, but within the UGB. The East of Leisure Town Road Growth
Area is approximately 1,300 acres in size, and the Northeast Growth Area is approximately
1,400 acres in size. The two growth areas are separated by the unincorporated Locke Paddon
community. This General Plan establishes land use designations for new urban development
within these two areas.
The Solano County Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) is charged with promoting land
use compatibility around the county’s airports as a means to minimize public exposure to
excessive noise and safety hazards. This is accomplished through the preparation and
periodic update of Airport Land Use Compatibility Plans (ALUCPs).
Two airports influence land use decisions in Vacaville: the Nut Tree Airport, operated by
Solano County and located on East Monte Vista Avenue just north of Interstate 80, and
Travis Air Force Base, operated by the United States Air Force and located in Fairfield, south
of Vacaville.
The Nut Tree ALUCP’s land use compatibility zones are shown in Figure LU-4. Table LU-2
displays the maximum residential densities, permitted number of structures, maximum
people per acre, and open space requirements for each airport compatibility zone.

* The use should generally not attract more than the indicated number of persons per net acre. These densities are intended as general
planning guidelines to aid in determining the acceptability of proposed land uses.
** Zone allows clustered development of up to three times the allowed density, which equates to 18 units per acre.
*** Under flight tracks, captive groups should not exceed 100 persons/structure; large assemblages should not exceed 300 persons,
where grouped in close proximity, i.e., theaters, auditoriums, conference facilities, etc.

As shown in Figure LU-5, with the exception of the extreme northern and northwestern
portions of Vacaville, the majority of the city is located within Compatibility Zone D of
Travis Air Force Base Land Use Compatibility Plan. Compatibility Zone D does not place
any restrictions on the types of land uses allowed, with the exception of land uses that could
cause hazard to flight, such as physical, visual, and electric forms of interference and land
uses that attract birds. Any object over 200 feet tall requires airspace review. The only
development condition for Compatibility Zone E, within which the rest of the Planning Area
is located, is the requirement for airspace review for objects over 200 feet tall.
This section describes the General Plan land use designations for Vacaville. The land use
designations are intended to help implement the future vision of Vacaville, as reflected in the
goals, policies, and actions of this General Plan, while also providing flexibility for
landowners.
Figure LU-6 maps the locations of the land uses designations, and Table LU-3 summarizes
the acreage for each land use designation. The land use designations described in this
Element establish the types and intensity or density of uses allowed on each parcel.
In this General Plan, standards of building intensity for residential uses are stated as the
allowable range of dwelling units per gross acre (site area less area occupied by non-
residential uses, area of slope at or over 25 percent, creekways, flood channels, hazardous
lands, and areas above the water service elevation). The number of units permitted will be
further modified by the zoning district, policy plan, and/or any applicable overlay district.

Standards of building intensity for non-residential uses are stated
as maximum floor-area ratios (FAR) based on gross acreage.
FAR is a ratio of the gross building square footage permitted on a
lot to the gross square footage of the lot. For example, on a site
with 10,000 square feet of land area, a FAR of 1.0 will allow
10,000 gross square feet of building floor area to be built. On the
same site, a FAR of 2.0 would allow 20,000 square feet of floor
area. This could take the form of a two-story building with 100
percent lot coverage, or a four-story building with 50 percent lot
coverage. A FAR of 0.4 would allow 4,000 square feet of floor
area.
The goals, policies, and actions contained in this Element provide
additional direction on how the various land use designations
should be developed to contribute to the overall character of and
vision for Vacaville. These designations are also implemented
through the zoning districts applied in the Land Use and
Development Code. More than one zoning district may be
consistent with a single General Plan land use designation. Land
use classifications in policy plans may be more detailed than those
in the General Plan; however, all development must be consistent
with the policies of the General Plan.
Nine residential categories establish different densities. The
residential densities described below are given as a range of units
                                                                         Examples of floor-area
per gross acre – the entire amount of land area, prior to any            ratio (FAR) and building
dedications for public use, health, and/or safety purposes. The          coverage.
number of units permitted may be further modified by the zoning
district, any applicable overlay district or specific plan, or density
transfers or bonuses.
Existing neighborhoods include some residences built at densities outside the ranges
specified in this General Plan. This does not imply that such development should be replaced
or treated as nonconforming uses by the City’s Land Use and Development Code.
The residential land use designations are as follows:
        Rural Residential. This designation provides opportunities for rural living on lots
         ranging in size from 2½ to 10 acres. This designation also permits animal husbandry
         and limited horticulture, subject to appropriate standards. The base density is 0.1
         units per gross acre, and the maximum potential density is 0.4 units per gross acre.
        Residential Estate. This designation provides opportunities for very low density
         residential land uses. The minimum lot size is 10,000 square feet; larger lots may be
                                                                                               LU-17

      required in specific areas by policy plans and/or zoning regulations because of
      topography or limited public service capacities. The base density is 0.5 units per
      gross acre, and the maximum potential density is 3 units per gross acre.
     Residential Low Density. This designation provides opportunities for single-family
      residential uses in neighborhoods on lot sizes ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 square
      feet, subject to appropriate standards. The base density is 3.1 units per gross acre,
      and the maximum potential density is 5 units per gross acre.
     Residential Low Medium Density. This designation provides opportunities for
      single-family, duplex, and clustered housing in neighborhoods on lot sizes ranging
      from 3,600 square feet to 4,500 square feet, subject to appropriate standards. The
      designation also permits clustered development on sites measuring at least 10 acres in
      size, subject to appropriate standards. The base density is 5.1 units per gross acre,
      and the maximum potential density is 8 units per gross acre.
     Residential Medium Density. This designation provides opportunities for multiple
      residential uses, including duplexes, duets, attached or detached townhouses, and
      multi-dwelling structures with landscaped open space for residents, subject to
      appropriate standards. Homes designed as stacked units without garages are
      prohibited in this land use designation. Multi-dwelling structures must be within a
      subdivision in which each unit may be under individual ownership. Single-family
      detached housing may be allowed when in compliance with Residential Design
      Requirements for New Single Family Development. The base density is 8.1 units per
      gross acre, and the maximum potential density is 14.0 units per gross acre.
     Residential Medium High Density. This designation provides opportunities for
      higher density multi-family residential uses, including attached or detached
      townhomes, condominiums, and apartments, subject to appropriate standards. The
      base density is 14.1 units per gross acre, and the maximum potential density is 20
      units per gross acre.
     Residential High Density. This designation provides opportunities for high density
      multiple residential uses, including attached townhouses, condominiums, and
      apartments, subject to appropriate standards. The base density is 20.1 units per gross
      acre, and the maximum potential density is 24 units per gross acre.
     Residential Golf Course. This designation provides opportunities for residential use
      in conjunction with a golf course development, subject to appropriate standards. A
      golf course, or comparable large recreation center, is a required component in any
      development project under this classification. The average base density is 1 unit per
      gross acre, and the maximum potential density is 2 units per gross acre; units may be
      clustered. Specific or policy plan approval is required.
     Residential Manufactured Home Park. This designation provides opportunities for
      affordable housing using manufactured or modular components on sites developed as
      a planned unit development, subject to appropriate standards. This classification is
      intended for both parks with rental spaces for manufactured housing (i.e. mobile

        homes) and parks where the spaces are individually owned. The base density is
        6 units per gross acre, and the maximum potential density is 10 units per gross acre.
Six commercial land use designations allow a range of commercial, retail, service, and office
uses. The maximum intensity of development allowed in all of the commercial designations
is generally limited to a FAR of 0.3, although, as noted in the descriptions below, the Mixed
Use designation allows a higher FAR. Exceptions to the FAR limits may be granted for
areas with low employee densities, such as wholesaling and distribution uses, or low peak-
hour traffic generation, such as a hospital. Further, the FAR may be adjusted in policy plan
areas based on the intensity of the use and the availability of public facilities and
infrastructure and projected traffic levels of service. FAR limits may be increased only if
adequate public services are available or new development is responsible to resolve any
deficiencies.
       Mixed Use. This designation allows and encourages different but compatible uses to
        be located in close proximity to each other. A common example is a single building
        or a group of buildings that combine residential uses with commercial, public,
        entertainment, and/or office uses. In multi-story mixed-use developments, the ground
        floor uses are predominantly retail or office with the purpose of supporting pedestrian
        activity. Mixed-use buildings with two or more uses in the same structure are
        encouraged in this designation, but single use residential, retail, or office buildings
        are also allowed. Since this designation allows for both residential and commercial
        uses, it allows a wider residential density range and a higher FAR than other
        designations. This designation allows 10 to 40 dwelling units per acre and a
        maximum FAR of 1.0.
       General Commercial. This designation provides for a full range of commercial
        uses, including retail stores, food and drug stores, auto sales, and businesses selling
        home furnishings, apparel, durable goods, and specialty items. Support facilities,
        such as entertainment and eating-and-drinking establishments, are also permitted.
       Neighborhood Commercial.            This designation provides for small sites for
        neighborhood commercial centers, generally anchored by a grocery store with
        convenience uses serving the immediate area. New Neighborhood Commercial sites
        must be between 4 and 10 acres in size.
       Commercial Service. This designation provides areas for heavy commercial uses,
        such as lumber yards and auto-related services. Limited retail is permitted, but the
        primary function of this designation is to provide for commercial uses not permitted
        in other areas because they attract heavy vehicles or otherwise have adverse impacts
        on other uses. Office uses are prohibited unless they are accessory to a commercial
        service use.
       Highway Commercial. This designation adjoins Interstate highways and includes
        specialty retailing, restaurants, hotels/motels, and commercial recreation and
                                                                                          LU-19

         entertainment, designed to attract primarily visitor business and shopping.
         Development in this designation should be high-quality in order to enhance views of
         Vacaville from the highway.
        Commercial Office. This designation provides sites for office development.
         Supporting retail and business services are permitted. This designation is intended
         for transition areas between commercial and residential areas. The Land Use and
         Development Code identifies a Professional Office overlay zoning district that can be
         applied to this land use designation that limits the types of permitted uses to
         professional and administrative offices, including medical and dental offices, which
         primarily provide services to local residents. No retail type of uses are allowed
         within this overlay district.
There are three categories of business and industrial land uses that provide opportunities for a
wide range of uses, including office centers, research and development, technology facilities,
and manufacturing. All three of these designations are either located within existing policy
plans, or will require the preparation of a specific plan prior to development. In all areas
with one of these three designations, the FAR may be adjusted in specific plan areas based on
the intensity of the use and the availability of public facilities and infrastructure and projected
traffic levels of service. FAR limits may be increased only if adequate public services are
available or new development is responsible for resolving the existing deficiencies.
        Business Park. This designation applies to sites in a landscaped setting for office
         centers, research-and-development facilities, and, under appropriate conditions,
         medical and institutional uses. Secondary uses may include limited industrial
         activities, small-scale warehousing and distribution operations, and limited retail sales
         accessory to these areas. Commercial uses and services for employees and businesses
         (e.g. delicatessens, child care, dry cleaners, and branch banks) are required as a means
         of reducing trips and vehicle miles traveled. These uses must be centrally located and
         have adequate pedestrian access. The commercial uses and services must also be
         ancillary, rather than primary uses, and there must be adequate public infrastructure to
         support the proposed use. Policy plans and specific plans may additionally allow for
         commercial development.
         This designation is intended for parcels that would be developed as a unit. In
         addition, this designation is intended for lower-intensity uses than the uses permitted
         in the Industrial Park and Technology Park designations, thereby reducing potential
         adverse impacts to adjacent development. The FAR is generally limited to 0.3.
        Industrial Park. This designation provides sites for industrial uses that require
         access to major transportation lines and large areas for structures, truck loading and
         parking, and storage of products, equipment, and materials. This designation also
         accommodates light manufacturing and heavy industrial uses, subject to appropriate
         standards to ensure that adjacent uses are not adversely impacted. The commercial
         uses and services must also be ancillary, rather than primary, uses, and there must be

        adequate public infrastructure to support the proposed use. Policy plans and specific
        plans may additionally allow for limited office and commercial uses. This
        designation is intended to protect Vacaville’s established industrial areas, which
        constitute a major resource, from encroachment by non-industrial retail and
        commercial uses. The FAR is generally limited to 0.4.
       Technology Park. This designation applies to sites of at least 100 acres in size.
        Development in this designation must provide a landscaped setting, and may include
        office centers, research-and-development facilities, technology facilities, and medical
        and institutional uses. Secondary uses may include limited industrial activities,
        small-scale warehousing and distribution operations, and limited retail sales accessory
        to these areas. Commercial uses and services for employees and businesses (e.g.
        delicatessens, child care, dry cleaners, and branch banks) are encouraged as a means
        of reducing trips and vehicle miles traveled. Such uses must be centrally located and
        have adequate pedestrian access. The commercial uses and services must be
        ancillary, rather than primary, uses, and there must be adequate public infrastructure
        to support the proposed use. The FAR is generally limited to 0.4.
Other land uses shown on Figure LU-6 include various public, institutional, open space, and
recreation uses. These uses comprise a substantial portion of the City’s Planning Area and
have a direct effect upon its character and the quality of life for Vacaville residents.
       Public/Institutional. This designation includes the Civic Center, Cultural Center,
        California Medical Facility, California State Prison, Vaca Valley Hospital and related
        medical facilities, and other public facilities, large institutions, and utilities. The FAR
        is generally limited to 0.3. The FAR may be adjusted in specific cases based upon the
        intensity of the use and the availability of services and infrastructure and projected
        traffic levels of service. FAR limits may be increased only if adequate public
        services are available to service the project or new development resolves the existing
        deficiencies. Public facilities are also addressed in the Public Facilities and Services
        Element.
       Schools. Existing and proposed private and public elementary, junior high, and high
        schools are included in this category. Public school sites are subject to review by the
        school districts, and ultimate locations may not be the same as proposed on the
        General Plan Land Use map (Figure LU-6). Schools are also addressed in the Public
        Facilities and Services Element.
       Public Parks. This designation includes existing and proposed public park sites.
        Parks are also addressed in the Parks and Recreation Element.
       Private Recreation. This designation includes country clubs, free-standing golf
        courses, recreational vehicle (RV) parks, riding stables, campgrounds, and theme
        parks. The FAR is generally limited to 0.1, but may be adjusted in specific cases if
        included in a specific plan, and based on the availability of public services and
                                                                                                LU-21

      infrastructure and expected traffic levels of service. FAR limits may be increased
      only if adequate public services are available to serve the project, or if new
      development resolves the existing deficiencies.
     Public Open Space. This designation consists of lands that are owned or controlled
      by the City, a public entity, or a non-profit entity. This designation is also used to
      identify lands that are designated for future acquisition by the City, and lands that are
      to be preserved as permanent open space. This category includes creekways,
      hillsides, ridgelines, transmission line corridors, and the hillside areas of the
      California Medical Facility. Public open space lands may be used for recreational
      purposes, such as hiking; to preserve a permanent inventory of open space lands; or
      for agricultural grazing. However, the Public Open Space designation does not
      guarantee public access to these lands. The physical characteristics of the land, or the
      extent to which improvements are required, may restrict the accessibility of the site.
      Public open space lands are addressed in more detail in the Parks and Recreation
      Element.
     Agriculture. This designation includes lands currently used for agricultural purposes
      or lands planned for agricultural use. This designation primarily consists of irrigated
      croplands and pasture outside of the city limits but within the City’s Planning Area.
      Agricultural lands are also discussed in the Conservation and Open Space Element.
     Agricultural Buffer. This designation identifies lands bordering urban development
      on one side and intensive and/or irrigated agriculture on the other. Uses within this
      designation are intended to serve as a buffer between urban development and
      agricultural uses and are subject to an agreement between the City and the Solano
      Irrigation District (SID). Proposed uses include passive open space uses that are not
      accessed by a large number of employees or the general public. These uses include
      public infrastructure improvements, passive recreational uses such as pedestrian and
      bicycle trails, and alternative energy facilities.
      Where urban land uses abut grazing land, buffers are evaluated on a case-by-case
      basis. The FAR is generally limited to 0.01, and may only be increased in specific
      instances where the City Council finds that a higher ratio will not substantially reduce
      the open space utility of the buffer zone. Only structures that are non-occupied and
      that meet one of the following criteria are allowed:
      ●   Structures that are necessary to the maintenance of agricultural operations (e.g.
          pump stations); or
      ●   Structures that form a portion of a landscaped separator (e.g. a sound wall); or
      ●   Structures that serve a passive public recreation use; or
      ●   Structures that are adjunct to a public health and safety use of the buffer zone (e.g.
          floodwater detention facilities).
     Hillside Agriculture. This designation includes lands that are generally privately
      owned hillside properties. This designation is intended for low-intensity agricultural
      uses. Hillside agriculture lands generally consist of hillsides and ridgelines where
      development is limited due to the topography. Lands within this designation

                                                               VACAVILLE GENERAL PLAN
                                                                        LAND USE ELEMENT
       generally contain steep slopes, are located above the public water system service
       elevations, have a high fire risk, have highly visible ridgelines, are likely to have
       value as plant or wildlife habitat, and may be subject to geologic instability. This
       designation allows for the development of 1 residential unit per 20 acres, subject to
       compliance with established development standards.
       This designation also provides for the potential for density transfers, in which the
       allowed density from one part of a site is transferred to another part of the site, so that
       sensitive areas are preserved as open space and density is increased in less
       constrained areas, while the average density across the whole site does not exceed the
       allowed maximum. This tool is a means of preserving sensitive areas and
       accommodating public facilities. Section 14.09.098.060, Density Transfer, of the
       Land Use and Development Code explains how density transfers are implemented in
       Hillside Agriculture areas.
      Urban Reserve. This designation is applied to relatively large, contiguous, and
       undeveloped geographic areas where comprehensive planning must occur prior to
       urbanization. The purpose of assigning the Urban Reserve designation, rather than
       specific land use designations in the East of Leisure Town Road Growth Area, is to
       demonstrate that the City eventually expects urban development in these areas, while
       also allowing flexibility in planning for these uses in the future. This designation has
       also been applied to a small area within the Northeast Growth Area where existing
       uses have developed in the unincorporated county.
The General Plan land use map (Figure LU-6) also designates the following two General
Plan boundaries and overlays:
      Downtown. The Downtown boundary encompasses the area generally bounded by
       Stevenson Street, Cernon Street, Monte Vista Avenue, and the former Southern
       Pacific Railroad track. The Downtown area includes a mix of residential,
       commercial, civic, and recreational uses appropriate for the Downtown. New
       development within this boundary is subject to a maximum FAR of 3.0 for the core
       area in the parking district and a range of 1.0 to 2.0 elsewhere in the Downtown. The
       Land Use and Development Code identifies a Residential Urban High Density
       (RUHD) overlay applied to properties zoned Downtown Commercial, General
       Commercial, and Office Commercial within the Downtown boundary. The RUHD
       overlay district provides for a development of high-density residential and mixed-use
       development. Residential uses with densities of 8.1 to 36 units per acre are
       encouraged as part of mixed-use projects, and, as directed in the actions for the
       Downtown in the Areas of Special Consideration section of this Element, the
       Opportunity Hill and Depot Street sites will allow up to 65 units per acre. Separate,
       non-mixed-use residential projects are subject to conditional use permit approval.
       Construction of new, detached single-family housing in the Downtown area is not
       permitted.
                                                                                            LU-23

       Community Separator. The Community Separator boundary includes lands to be
        restricted to agricultural or other defined open space uses through zoning, joint
        powers agreements between Vacaville and adjacent cities, and/or through acquisition
        of development rights by a public or nonprofit agency. The City is a party to two
        Greenbelt Agreements: the Vacaville-Fairfield-Solano Greenbelt Agreement, and the
        Vacaville-Dixon Greenbelt Agreement.
        The Vacaville-Fairfield-Solano Greenbelt Agreement identifies approximately 4,100
        acres between Vacaville and Fairfield that must be preserved to serve as a permanent
        separation between the urban areas of Fairfield and Vacaville. This area must be
        maintained in agriculture and open space uses consistent with the provisions of the
        agreement. The Vacaville-Dixon Greenbelt Agreement identifies approximately
        1,000 acres of land located between Vacaville and Dixon that have been purchased by
        the Vacaville-Dixon Greenbelt Authority (VDGA) to be maintained in productive
        agriculture or as other open space uses mutually agreed upon by VDGA.

                      foothills, farmland, and other open space.
Policy LU-P1.2        Protect Vacaville’s natural environment. Integrate creeks, hills, utility
                      corridors, and other significant natural features into major development
                      plans.
Policy LU-P1.3        Preserve the predominant single-family residential character of Vacaville
                      while providing other housing opportunities.
Policy LU-P1.4        Protect established neighborhoods from incompatible uses.
Policy LU-P1.5        With the exception of Priority Development Areas, require that infill
                      projects be designed to complement the neighborhood and surrounding
                      zoning with respect to the existing scale and character of surrounding
                      structures, and blend, rather than compete, with the established character
                      of the area.

Policy LU-P1.8   Design aesthetically pleasing roadways using trees or other appropriate
                 landscaping.
Policy LU-P1.9   Do not use streets alone to define the outer limits of urbanization. The
                 boundary of the city shall be defined by elements such as the natural
                 topography of the land, enhanced landscaping, and other existing visual
                 barriers
Policy LU-P1.10  Promote and acknowledge outstanding community design.
Actions
Action LU-A1.1   Maintain and replace, as necessary, lighting and landscaping on the

Goal LU-2       Carefully plan for new development in undeveloped portions
                Vacaville.
Policies
Policy LU-P2.1   Require lands outside, but adjacent to, the current city limits to annex to
                 the City of Vacaville as a prerequisite to development. Do not provide
                 City utility services, water, and sanitary sewer to new development
                 outside of the city limit (with the exception of sanitary sewer for infill in
                 the Elmira area) unless the City Council, with the approval of the Local
                 Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), approves exceptions in
                 situations where the following three conditions are met:
                    The area in question cannot annex to the City immediately, because it
                     is not currently contiguous to the city limit.
                    The property owner signs a recorded, irrevocable agreement to annex
                     the property to the City when such annexation is requested by the
                     City.
                     The development is consistent with this General Plan and is found to
                      meet all appropriate City development standards.

Policy LU-P2.2 Require that specific plans be prepared for new areas brought into the
               city for development. Such specific plans must provide a coordinated
               plan for land use, public facilities, and public services. Prohibit
               individual, piecemeal developments within these outlying areas.
Policy LU-P2.3 Encourage housing, shopping, and employment opportunities on both
               sides of Interstate 80 to minimize the need for excessive travel across
               Interstate 80.
Policy LU-P2.4 Require that development on any prime farmland, farmland of statewide
               importance, or unique farmland (as classified by the California
               Department of Conservation) purchase conservation easements to
               permanently protect agricultural land of equal or greater value at a ratio
               of 1 acre of conserved agricultural land per 1 acre of developed
               agricultural land.
Policy LU-P2.5 Do not convert lands designated Public Open Space to developed urban
               uses unless an overriding public purpose requires such a change.
Policy LU-P2.6 Lands designated Public Open Space that are converted to developed
               urban use shall be compensated for by providing equal or better lands for
               a similar use in another location. All proceeds that the City receives
               from any sale of Public Open Space lands shall be used to acquire
               additional open space lands elsewhere.
Policy LU-P2.7 Require that open space that is designated as a condition of development
               approval be permanently restricted to open space use by recorded map or
               deed.
Policy LU-P2.8 Continue discussions with the Solano Irrigation District (SID) to
               consider the future expansion of the Urban Service Area as far east as the
               PG&E transmission line right-of-way subject to the expansion of the

                 the following maximum development projections for the year 2035 for
                 the lands located within the Urban Growth Boundary, excluding the East
                 of Leisure Town Road and Northeast Growth Areas, shown in Figure
                 LU-3:

                     Commercial: 880,000 square feet (67 acres)
                     Office: 1.06 million square feet (81 acres)
                     Industrial: 1.49 million square feet (86 acres)
                 When approved development within the city reaches the maximum
                 number of residential units or any of the non-residential square footages
                 projected in the General Plan EIR, the Community Development
                 Director shall require that environmental review conducted for any
                 subsequent development project address growth impacts that would
                 occur due to development exceeding the General Plan EIR’s projections.
                 This does not preclude the City, as lead agency, from determining that an
                 EIR would be required for any development in the Urban Growth
                 Boundary to the extent required under the relevant provisions of CEQA
                 (e.g. Section 21166 and related guidelines). The City will conduct the
                 appropriate scoping at the time of initial study for any specific plan, all

                 development within the East of Leisure Town Road and Northeast
                 Growth Areas. See Policies LU-P17.8 and LU-P18.8, respectively, for
                 these areas.
Policy LU-P3.2   Manage growth so that the quantity and quality of public services and
                 utilities provided to existing businesses and residents will not drop below
                 required levels of service because of new development, except when
                 required findings related to levels of service are made. While existing
                 development bears some responsibility to fund improvements that will
                 resolve such deficits, ensure that new development also funds its fair
                 share of the costs of maintenance and depreciation of facilities.
Policy LU-P3.3   Provide urban services in accordance with the May 1995 City of
                 Vacaville/Solano Irrigation District Master Water Agreement, as it may
                 be amended from time to time.

                immediately adjacent to existing development or infrastructure.
Actions
Action LU-A3.1  Regularly update and maintain the City’s Municipal Services Review
                and Comprehensive Annexation Plan to ensure that urbanization does
                not outpace the provision of public facilities within the Urban Growth
                Boundary.
Action LU-A3.2  Monitor the rate of growth to ensure that it does not overburden the
                City’s infrastructure and services and does not exceed the amounts
                analyzed in the General Plan EIR.
Action LU-A3.3  Continue to monitor new development where infrastructure limits are
                being reached or exceeded so that linkages with necessary improvements
                can be established and funded.
Action LU-A3.4  Continue to revise existing policy plans, which are shown in Figure
                LU-2, to conform to General Plan policies and requirements for
                infrastructure financing mechanisms and open space.
Action LU-A3.5  Review and revise the City’s capital improvement program annually to
                ensure that public improvements will be consistent with General Plan
                policies for residential areas and that progress is made toward
                implementing these policies.

Goal LU-5      Maintain the City’s Urban Growth Boundary.
Policies
Policy LU-P5.1  Urban Growth Boundary: To enhance and protect the city’s quality of
                life, establish and maintain an Urban Growth Boundary so that urban
                development will be focused within the Urban Growth Boundary and the
                land outside the Urban Growth Boundary will not be redesignated other
                than for agriculture, park, open space, public facility, and utility uses
                until March 1, 2028, specifically as set forth in Policies LU-P5.4 through
                LU-P5.7.
Policy LU-P5.2  Lands East of Leisure Town Road: In conjunction with approval of any
                new urban development on lands shown as “Area B” on Figure LU-3,
                which consists of lands that are inside the Urban Growth Boundary but
                east of Leisure Town Road and between the Locke Paddon Community
                areas on the north and New Alamo Creek on the south, the City shall
                require such development to mitigate its impact on agricultural and open
                space lands by preserving, to the extent consistent with applicable law,
                for each acre of land developed, at least 1 acre of land outside the Urban
                Growth Boundary but within Pleasants Valley, Upper Lagoon Valley, or
                Vaca Valley, or any other location that is within 1 mile of the Urban
                Growth Boundary. Alternatively, to the extent consistent with applicable
                law, such development may pay an equivalent in-lieu fee as determined
                by the City in consultation with the Solano Land Trust. Lands acquired
                directly or with fees collected pursuant to this requirement shall first be
                offered to the Solano Land Trust. Any such fees transferred to the
                Solano Land Trust may only be used to acquire or protect lands outside
                of the Urban Growth Boundary but within 1 mile of the Urban Growth

               If for any reason adequate land to meet the conservation goals described
               in the Vacaville General Plan, and in particular this section, cannot be
               identified or acquired, the City and the Solano Land Trust, or if the
               Solano Land Trust declines to participate, the City and another land
               conservation entity shall meet and confer to identify other areas where
               conservation acquisitions can occur at a reasonable cost and to satisfy the
               conservation goals described in this section.
Policy LU-P5.3 Coordination with Future Solano County LAFCO Open Space or
               Agricultural Land Mitigation Program: If the Solano County Local
               Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) adopts an open space or
               agricultural land mitigation program applicable to the area defined in
               Policy LU-P5.2, lands defined therein shall be subject only to the
               requirements of the LAFCO mitigation program, provided that if the
               requirement described in Policy LU-P5.2 provides greater mitigation
               than the LAFCO requirement, the incremental difference between the
               two programs shall be imposed in addition to the LAFCO requirement to
               the maximum extent permitted by State law. To the extent the LAFCO
               requirement and this requirement overlap, development shall be subject
               to only the LAFCO requirement.
Policy LU-P5.4 Establish and Maintain an Urban Growth Boundary: Establish and
               maintain an Urban Growth Boundary so that urban development within
               the City’s land use jurisdiction will be focused within the Urban Growth
               Boundary and the land outside the Urban Growth Boundary within the
               City’s land use jurisdiction will be maintained primarily for agriculture,
               park, open space, public facility, and utility uses until March 1, 2028, as
               generally described in Policies LU-P5.1 through LU-P5.3, and as more
               specifically set forth in Policies LU-P5.5 through LU-P5.7. Until
               March 1, 2028, Section 2.10 of the Vacaville General Plan Land Use

Policy LU-P5.6 Land Use Restrictions Outside the Urban Growth Boundary: In those
               areas located outside the Urban Growth Boundary and within the City’s
               land use jurisdiction, only the following shall be permitted: (1) all uses

               Development Code on the Submittal Date, or existing on that date, shall
               continue to be permitted, and in the event any such use is damaged or
               destroyed by natural disaster, fire, or Act of God, it may be rebuilt and
               continued; (2) new uses consistent with the General Plan as amended by
               the Urban Growth Boundary Initiative; and (3) any infrastructure
               improvements necessary or appropriate to serve or protect existing uses
               and new permitted uses within the Urban Growth Boundary, including,
               but not limited to, construction and/or expansion of public facilities and
               utilities outside the Urban Growth Boundary that support such
               development elsewhere, such as stormwater detention basins, water tanks
               (reservoirs), sewer and water lines, and wastewater treatment plants to
               accommodate buildout of the Vacaville General Plan. In addition, the

Policy LU-P5.7 No Amendment before March 1, 2028, except by Voters, or City Council
               Under Specific Enumerated Circumstances: Until March 1, 2028, the
               location of the Urban Growth Boundary depicted on Figure LU-3 and the
               policies adopted or amended by the Urban Growth Boundary Initiative
               may be amended, or exceptions thereto may be granted, only by the
               voters of Vacaville, or by the City Council pursuant to the procedures set
               forth in subsections (a) through (d) below.
                (a) Upon request of an affected landowner with a pending development
                    application, the City Council may amend the location of the Urban
                    Growth Boundary depicted on the General Plan Diagram, or amend
                    policies adopted or amended by the Urban Growth Boundary
                    Initiative, if it makes both the following findings based on
                    substantial evidence in the record:
                    (i) That the application of any aspect of the Urban Growth
                        Boundary depicted on the General Plan Diagram or the
                        implementation of any Vacaville General Plan Policy amended
                        by the Urban Growth Boundary Initiative would constitute an
                        unconstitutional taking of a landowner’s property for which
                        compensation would be required, and

                         landowner’s property.
               (b) The City Council may amend the location of the Urban Growth
                   Boundary, or amend policies adopted or amended by the Urban
                   Growth Boundary Initiative, where the City Council determines,
                   after at least one public hearing, that doing so is necessary to comply
                   with State law regarding the provision of housing, if it first makes
                   each of the following findings based on substantial evidence in the
                   record:
                   (i) a specific provision of State law requires the City to
                         accommodate the proposed housing; and
                   (ii) the amount of land to be included within the Urban Growth
                         Boundary is no greater than necessary to accommodate the
                         proposed housing; and
                   (iii) no alternative site within the Urban Growth Boundary could be
                         used to satisfy the applicable State housing law; and
                   (iv) the proposed housing will be located adjacent to already
                         developed land and roads, unless locating the development in
                         such areas would result in greater environmental impacts than
                         would locating the housing elsewhere, would conflict with State
                         or federal laws, or would not be possible.
               (c) The City shall not approve any general plan amendment, zoning
                   amendment, specific plan or policy plan, specific plan or policy plan
                   amendment, rezoning, subdivision map, conditional use permit, or
                   public works project not otherwise provided for in Policy LU-P5.6,
                   or take any other similar action that is inconsistent with the Vacaville
                   General Plan amendments adopted by Section 3 of the Urban
                   Growth Boundary Initiative.
               (d) The policies under Goal LU-5 of the General Plan Land Use Element
                   shall not apply to any development project or ongoing activity that
                   has obtained, as of the effective date of the Urban Growth Boundary
                   Initiative, a vested right pursuant to State or local law.

                 intersection of major thoroughfares and, where appropriate, adjacent to
                 multi-family housing and transit.
Policy LU-P13.4  Prohibit the location of competing new neighborhood shopping centers
                 at one major intersection.
Policy LU-P13.5  Encourage similar and compatible types of commercial businesses to
                 cluster together in appropriate locations to provide comparison shopping.
Policy LU-P13.6  Provide sufficient space to meet the need for commercial services and

LAND USE ELEMENT
                 shopping centers and in highway commercial areas. In neighborhood
                 and community shopping centers, the guidelines should set a coherent
                 design concept but avoid imposing a rigid, stylistic requirement for
                 individual buildings. A range of architectural expression should be
                 allowed. Free-standing uses, such as service stations, banks, and
                 restaurants, should be compatible in design and materials with the main
                 building complex. In highway commercial areas, the guidelines should
                 ensure that the characteristics of major entrances into the community and
                 views from the freeway are not diminished by incompatible uses or
                 inharmonious site development concepts.
Action LU-A13.2 Revise the Land Use and Development Code to set specific limits on the
                 size of neighborhood shopping centers to preserve opportunities for
                 local-serving businesses and to exclude region-serving stores likely to
                 generate high traffic volumes. Require increased setbacks from
                 residential neighborhoods.
Action LU-A13.3 Revise the Land Use and Development Code to define competing
                 neighborhood commercial uses, and to outline the development review
                 process applicable to addressing development proposals including
                 competing land uses and appropriate siting standards.
Goal LU-14      Promote the development of attractive office areas and uses that
                provide jobs to Vacaville residents.
Policies
Policy LU-P14.1  Encourage new regional and local-serving office development at
                 appropriate locations.
Policy LU-P14.2  Require increased setbacks adjoining freeways and ensure that new
                 office developments do not back up to freeways.
Actions
Action LU-A14.1 Establish office design guidelines to govern new construction and
                 alterations and additions, including criteria for building massing, exterior
                 materials, landscaping, and location of parking.

                     impacts to adjacent non-industrial uses, particularly residential
                     neighborhoods, with respect to, but not limited to, noise, dust and
                     vibration, water quality, air quality, agricultural resources, and biological
                     resources. Include specific standards in Policy Plans for adequate
                     physical and aesthetic separation of industrial business parks and
                     residential land.
Policy LU-P15.6      Require increased setbacks adjoining freeways and ensure that new
                     developments do not appear to back up to freeways.
Actions
Action LU-A15.1 Continue marketing efforts and assistance to promote the stimulation of
                     job-generating industrial uses in Vacaville.
Action LU-A15.2 Compile information and/or maps to assist new development in
                     identifying infrastructure availability and assist in economic
                     development efforts for City capital improvement planning.
In addition to land use designations and goals, policies, and actions, the General Plan
identifies numerous Areas of Special Consideration. These are specific areas of the city

Downtown
The Downtown area, especially the Historic District, is a unique area within the city. No
other commercial area has both the central location and historic atmosphere of the
Downtown. The Downtown area is located generally between Stevenson Street, Cernon
Street, Monte Vista Avenue, and the former Southern Pacific Railroad line. The following
provisions are intended to enhance the existing historic character of the Downtown and add
to its economic vitality by providing for a wide range of commercial and residential uses.
Goal LU-16           Promote a physically, socially, and economically vibrant Downtown.
Policies
Policy LU-P16.1       Encourage continued improvement and redevelopment of the Downtown
                      area with new specialty shops, restaurants, major stores, offices, and
                      supporting commercial uses, but retain the small-town scale and
                      character conveyed by development along Main Street with an
                      appropriate transition between commercial and adjoining existing
                      residential areas.
Policy LU-P16.2       Encourage mixed-use development projects in the Downtown.
Policy LU-P16.3       Encourage local-serving offices to locate in the Downtown.
                                                                                         LU-43

CITY OF VACAVILLE
VACAVILLE GENERAL PLAN
LAND USE ELEMENT
Policy LU-P16.4 Encourage local-serving commercial uses to locate in the Downtown.
Policy LU-P16.5 To the extent possible, continue to provide off-street parking facilities
                close to Downtown retail areas.
Policy LU-P16.6 Continue to integrate Andrews Park and the Ulatis Creek Creekwalk into
                Downtown planning efforts.
Policy LU-P16.7 Support the implementation the Opportunity Hill Master Plan.
Policy LU-P16.8 Encourage transit-oriented development, including mixed use, high
                density housing, and commercial and office uses, in the Downtown.
Policy LU-P16.9 Allow retention and rehabilitation of the traditional single‐family homes
                on the east side of Vine Street, south of Vineyard Valley Way. Due to
                the topography of these lots, these lots may be redeveloped with single‐
                family homes within the legally established setbacks of the original
                homes without the need of an approved planned development permit.
Actions
Action LU-A16.1 Review and revise the adopted Design Requirements for the Main Street
                Vacaville Historic District to include the entire Downtown area. The
                guidelines should encourage the renovation and preservation of historic
                structures in the Downtown Historic District; preserve the architectural,
                historical, and cultural significance of those buildings; and govern new
                commercial development and major exterior alterations and additions.
                As part of these guidelines, define and clarify “gateway” areas to the
                Downtown. Include criteria and guidelines so that new buildings in the
                gateway and surrounding areas are compatible with buildings in the
                Historic District, including building design, building materials, massing,
                and colors. The guidelines should set a coherent design concept but
                avoid imposing a rigid, stylistic requirement for individual buildings.
                Instead, a range of architectural expression should be allowed.
Action LU-A16.2 Continue to implement public improvements that will support
                revitalization of the Downtown area.
Action LU-A16.3 Provide information regarding rehabilitating buildings in the Downtown
                Historic District to businesses and property owners. The information
                should include federal, State, and local requirements, and City
                procedures for design review, conditional use permits, environmental
                review, and building permits.

Action LU-A16.4 Amend the Land Use and Development Code to increase the allowed
                     density in the Residential Urban High Density Overlay on the
                     Opportunity Hill and Depot Street sites, which are shown in Figure
                     LU-8, up to 65 dwelling units per acre.
Action LU-A16.5 Amend the zoning designations within the Downtown to conform to
                     revised land use designations.
Action LU-A16.6 Prepare a Downtown Specific Plan to provide development standards
                     that will promote the development of the City’s central commercial core
                     and implement policies for the commercial, mixed‐use, and employment
                     uses promoted under Goal LU‐16.
Growth Areas
With adoption of the Urban Growth Boundary in 2008, two new growth areas were
established in areas predominantly used for agriculture: the East of Leisure Town Road
Growth Area and the Northeast Growth Area. The East of Leisure Town Road Growth Area
is approximately 1,300 acres in size and primarily designated for future residential growth.
The Northeast Growth Area is approximately 1,400 acres in size and primarily designated as
an economic development area. These growth areas are not anticipated to fully develop
within the 2035 horizon year of this General Plan. As such, an Urban Reserve land use
designation has been applied to relatively large, contiguous geographic areas within the East
of Leisure Town Road Growth Area, and to a small area within the Northeast Growth Area.
Lands designated as Urban Reserve are recognized by the City as areas that may be annexed
to the City and developed in the future. Areas within the East of Leisure Town Road Growth
Area with an Urban Reserve land use designation will require comprehensive planning and
the preparation of a Specific Plan prior to development. In conjunction with a Specific Plan,
a General Plan amendment will be necessary to establish specific General Plan land use
designations for each parcel of land.
This section provides policies and actions to ensure balanced growth in these areas with
adequate public facilities and services. In addition to the goals, policies, and actions below
that specifically address the growth areas, the growth areas are also subject to all of the other
goals, policies, and actions in the General Plan. For reference, Figure LU-9 shows the land
use designations from Figure LU-6 for just the growth areas.

                 Growth Area to 2,175 dwelling units with the following general
                 assumptions:

Policy LU-P17.2  The East of Leisure Town Road Growth Area shall include a mixture of
                 housing densities, and attached and detached housing types consistent
                 with the adopted land use diagram.
Policy LU-P17.3  When considering specific plan proposals for development on lands
                 designated Residential High Density in the East of Leisure Town Road
                 Growth Area, ensure that overall development in the East of Leisure
                 Town Road Growth Area is on track to provide at least 13 percent of the
                 total residential units as attached, multi-family units.
Policy LU-P17.4  Approximately 80 percent of the 610 units permitted for the properties
                 located within the East of Leisure Town Road Growth Area, north of

Policy LU-P17.5  Require that specific plans be prepared for development in the East of
                 Leisure Town Road Growth Area to ensure that coordinated plans for
                 land uses, public facilities, and public services are created for such area,
                 and require that these specific plans are consistent with the City’s
                 updated infrastructure master plans that account for development in the
                 East of Leisure Town Road Growth Area.

                 phasing, infrastructure financing mechanisms, interim fire protection
                 measures, and any other elements that may be needed to ensure an
                 orderly development process with minimal adverse impacts to the
                 existing community. The specific plans shall be consistent with the
                 City’s master infrastructure plans prepared for the East of Leisure Town
                 Road Growth Area.
Policy LU-P17.7  Prohibit the location of competing new neighborhood shopping centers
                 at the Hawkins Road and Leisure Town Road intersection.
Policy LU-P17.8  The General Plan Update Environmental Impact Report (EIR) assumes
                 the following maximum development projections for the year 2035 for
                 the lands located within the East of Leisure Town Road Growth Area,
                 shown in Figure LU-7:
                     Residential: 2,340 units
                     Commercial: 160,000 square feet (12 acres)
                 When approved development in the East of Leisure Town Road Growth
                 Area reaches the maximum number of residential units or commercial
                 square feet projected in the General Plan EIR, the Community
                 Development Director shall require that environmental review conducted
                 for any subsequent development project address growth impacts that
                 would occur due to development exceeding the General Plan EIR’s
                 projections. This does not preclude the City, as lead agency, from
                 determining that an EIR would be required for any development in the
                 East of Leisure Town Road Growth Area to the extent required under the
                 relevant provisions of CEQA (e.g. Section 21166 and related guidelines).
                 The City will conduct the appropriate scoping at the time of initial study
                 for any specific plan, all in accordance with these requirements.
                 Note: The General Plan Update EIR assumed more residential units in
                 the East of Leisure Town Road Growth Area would develop by 2035 than
                 the number of units permitted by Policy LU-P17.1.
Policy LU-P17.9  Require residential specific plans within the East of Leisure Town Road
                 Growth Area to contain a component of housing designed to attract
                 business executives and professionals.
Policy LU-P17.10 Require Specific Plans within the East of Leisure Town Growth Area to
                 provide a wide variety of lot sizes and housing types. Lots located
                 adjacent to the Agricultural Buffer, north of Elmira Road, shall be
                 10,000 square feet in size.
                                                                                      LU-49

                 from 500 feet to 300 feet. A 300‐foot-wide agricultural buffer is
                 consistent with the Solano County General Plan policy that identifies the
                 requirement for 300‐foot-wide agricultural buffers. Further discussions
                 with the Solano Irrigation District are required as part of this action, and
                 will be addressed in an amendment to the Master Water Agreement. In
                 the event that the City and the Solano County Irrigation District do not
                 agree to such amendment, the buffer shall remain 500 feet in width.
Action LU-A17.2 Work with the Solano Irrigation District to expand the Urban Service
                 Area and amend the Master Water Agreement to accommodate urban
                 development in the East of Leisure Town Road Growth Area. As part of
                 the amendment to the Master Water Agreement, consider the width,
                 location, and allowed uses in the agricultural buffer.

Policy LU-P18.3 Require that specific plans be prepared for development in the Northeast
                Growth Area to ensure that coordinated plans for land uses, public
                facilities, and public services are created for each area, and require that
                these specific plans are consistent with the City’s updated infrastructure
                master plans that account for development in the Northeast Growth Area.
Policy LU-P18.4 Require that specific plans for the Northeast Growth Area include a
                diagram showing the distribution of land uses and define permitted and
                conditionally permitted land uses, major public facilities (including
                schools, parks, roads, water, sewer, and drainage facilities), phasing,
                infrastructure financing mechanisms, interim fire protection measures,

                   Industrial: 560,000 square feet (32 acres)
                 When approved development in the Northeast Growth Area reaches the
                 maximum industrial square feet projected in the General Plan EIR, the
                 Community Development Director shall require that environmental
                 review conducted for any subsequent development project address
                 growth impacts that would occur due to development exceeding the
                 General Plan EIR’s projections. This does not preclude the City, as lead
                 agency, from determining that an EIR would be required for any
                 development in the Northeast Growth Area to the extent required under

                    infrastructure and facilities to serve the needs of these growth areas.
Priority Development Areas
In 2008, the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) approved the Allison Policy
Plan Area and Downtown Vacaville as Priority Development Areas (PDAs) for inclusion in
FOCUS, the San Francisco Bay Area’s Regional Blueprint Plan. FOCUS is a regional
development and conservation strategy that promotes a compact land use pattern for the Bay
Area. The PDAs discussed in this section meet the FOCUS designation criteria by allowing
mixed-use development, including office, commercial, retail, and residential uses, in close
proximity to jobs, public transit, parks, libraries, shopping, and dining. PDA designations
provide the City with the opportunity to apply for grants to assist with the costs of planning,
                                                                                            LU-53

areas.
Allison Policy Plan Area
The Allison Policy Plan Area PDA is categorized as a “Suburban Center.” Suburban Center
PDAs generally have a mix of low-rise, mid-rise, and some high-rise residential buildings,
consisting of 30 to 100 dwelling units per acre. The Allison Policy Plan Area PDA
encompasses approximately 290 acres, and is bordered by Interstate 80 in the vicinity of
Allison Drive. It is served by the Vacaville Intermodal Transit Center, which serves regional
and local transit needs by providing bus service with connections to Sacramento, Bay Area
Rapid Transit (BART), and the Vallejo ferry. The Transit Center includes a multi-bus
terminal, a park-and-ride area with surface parking for over 200 cars, bicycle lockers, and a
van pool. Future expansion plans include a 400-car parking garage.
There are prominent job, entertainment, and leisure opportunities within this PDA, including
approximately 3,500 jobs, and the potential for approximately 800 additional jobs. The PDA
also includes the Vacaville Performing Arts Theater, the Ulatis Community Center, a branch
of the Solano County Library, and a private school serving kindergarten through eighth
grade. Approximately 600 apartments are located within this PDA, with the potential for
approximately 230 additional apartments. This PDA is located adjacent to single family
homes, senior housing, and an assisted living facility.
Downtown Vacaville
The Downtown Vacaville PDA is designated as a “Transit Town Center” PDA, which is
generally characterized as having a mix of small-lot single family homes, townhomes, and
low- and mid-rise residential buildings, with 20 to 75 dwelling units per acre. The
Downtown PDA encompasses approximately 300 acres, and is located in downtown
Vacaville, bound generally by Monte Vista Avenue to the north, Interstate 80 to the
southeast, West Street to the west, and Depot Street to the east.
The area is envisioned for mixed-use residential and retail projects. The area includes the
City Coach Transit Center that serves six local bus routes and connects to the Intermodal
Transit Center. This area is pedestrian orientated with an abundance of shopping and dining
options, a branch of the Solano County Library, a movie theater, an indoor sports facility,
and a large community park that routinely hosts live entertainment.

                      Vacaville Priority Development Areas.
Policy Plan Areas
As described earlier in this Element, policy plans are one of the primary tools used by the
City to strategically plan for new growth within the industrial and business parks. In order to
allow development flexibility, the policy plans typically allow a wide range of land uses.
However, development of much of the remaining vacant land within the Interchange
Business Park, Vacaville-Golden Hills Business Park, and Vaca Valley Business Park Policy
Plans is limited by the available water, wastewater, and transportation infrastructure; there is
not adequate infrastructure to allow every parcel to be developed with uses that have high
water demand or traffic impacts. This section includes policies to address these
infrastructure issues. See the section on specific plans, policy plans, and master plans in the
Background Information section of this Element for additional information about policy plan
areas.
Goal LU-21          Provide for development that is consistent with the limits imposed by
                    water and wastewater infrastructure in the Interchange Business
                    Park, Vacaville-Golden Hills Business Park, and Vaca Valley Business

Rice McMurtry Area
The Rice McMurtry area is surrounded by the English Hills to the west, a residential
subdivision to the south, and rural and agricultural uses to the north and east. The northern
boundary of the Cheyenne Subdivision serves as the jurisdictional boundary between the city
and county. As such, it has been the intention of the City and the project applicants to create
a high quality development area that serves as a transition area between the city and county.
This goal is being accomplished by allowing flexibility and creativity in building design and
site planning.
Development within the Rice McMurtry Area is required to promote a rural atmosphere. As
outlined below, all new residential development within the Rice McMurtry area must be of
superior quality and design.
Goal LU-22         Provide large residential lots within a rural atmosphere to achieve the

Section 65302(f) of the California Government Code requires that General Plans contain a Noise
Element that can be used as a guide for establishing a pattern of land uses that minimize the
exposure of community residents to excessive noise. Local governments are required to analyze
and quantify noise levels and exposure to noise through field measurements or noise modeling,
and to use the Noise Element to address existing and foreseeable noise problems.
Noise is generally defined as unwanted sound. Noise consists of any sound that may produce
physiological or psychological damage and/or interfere with communication, work, rest,
recreation, or sleep. Noise is especially a concern in the vicinity of noise-sensitive uses, which
are generally defined as locations where people reside or where the presence of unwanted sound
could adversely affect the use of land, such as residences, schools, and hospitals.
To the human ear, sound has two significant characteristics: pitch and loudness. Pitch is the
number of complete vibrations, or cycles per second of a sound wave (frequency), which results
in the range of tone from high to low. Loudness is the strength of a sound that describes a noisy
or quiet environment. It is measured by the amplitude of the sound wave. Loudness is
determined by the intensity of the sound waves combined with the reception characteristics of
the human ear. Sound intensity refers to how hard the sound wave strikes an object, which in
turn produces the sound’s effect. This characteristic of sound can be precisely measured with
instruments. Table NOI-1 contains a list of typical acoustical terms and definitions.
Measurement of Sound
A decibel (dB) is a unit of measurement which indicates the relative intensity of a sound. The
zero point on the dB scale is based on the lowest sound level that the healthy, unimpaired human
ear can detect. Changes of 3 dB or less are only perceptible in laboratory environments.
Since the human ear is not equally sensitive to all pitches (i.e. sound frequencies) within the
entire noise spectrum, a special frequency-dependent rating scale has been devised to relate noise
to human sensitivity in a process called “A-weighting,” expressed as “dBA.” The dBA, or A-
weighted decibel, refers to a scale of noise measurement that approximates the range of
sensitivity of the human ear to sounds of different frequencies. Table NOI-2 shows representa-
tive noise sources and their corresponding noise levels in dBA.

Because sound can vary in intensity by over one million times within the range of human
hearing, a logarithmic loudness scale1 is used to keep sound intensity numbers at a convenient
and manageable level. Thus, a 10 dBA increase in the level of a continuous noise represents a
perceived doubling of loudness, while a 20 dBA increase is 100 times more intense, and a 30
dBA increase is 1,000 times more intense.
As noise spreads from a source, it loses energy so that the farther away the noise receiver is from
the noise source, the lower the perceived noise level. Noise levels attenuate, or diminish, as
distance from the source increases based on an inverse square rule, depending on how the noise
source is physically configured.

           Unlike linear units such as inches or pounds, decibels are measured on a logarithmic scale, representing
points on a sharply rising curve. The logarithmic decibel scale allows an extremely wide range of acoustic energy to
be characterized in a manageable notation.

There are many ways to rate noise for various time periods, but an appropriate rating of ambient
noise affecting humans also accounts for the annoying effects of sound. The predominant rating
scales for communities in California are the equivalent continuous sound level (Leq), the
community noise equivalent level (CNEL), and the day-night average level (Ldn), which are all
defined in Table NOI-1. Leq represents an average of the sound energy occurring over a
specified period. This descriptor is useful because sound levels can vary markedly over a short
period of time. The most common averaging period for Leq is hourly, but it can be of any
duration. CNEL is the energy average of the A-weighted sound levels occurring during a 24-
hour period, with 10 dB added to the A-weighted sound levels occurring between 10:00 p.m. and
                                                                                           NOI-3

7:00 a.m. (defined as sleeping hours) and 5 dB added to the A-weighted sound levels occurring
between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. (defined as relaxation hours), in order to adjust for the fact
that noise during these hours is more disruptive than noise during the day. Ldn is similar to the
CNEL scale, but without the adjustment for events occurring during the evening relaxation
hours. CNEL and Ldn are normally exchangeable.
The noise environments discussed in this Element are specified in terms of maximum levels,
denoted by Lmax. Lmax is the highest exponential time averaged sound level that occurs during a
stated time period. Lmax reflects peak operating conditions, and addresses the annoying aspects
of intermittent noise.
Effects of Noise
According to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development’s 1985 Noise Guidebook,
permanent physical damage to human hearing can occur at prolonged exposure to noise levels
higher than 85 to 90 dBA. Exposure to high noise levels affects our entire system, with
prolonged noise exposure in excess of 75 dBA increasing body tensions, and thereby affecting
blood pressure, functions of the ear and the nervous system, and triggering emotional reactions
like anger, depression, and anxiety. In comparison, extended periods of noise exposure above 90
dBA would result in permanent cell damage. When the noise level reaches 120 dBA, a tickling
sensation occurs in the human ear, even with short-term exposure. This level of noise is called
the threshold of feeling. For avoiding adverse effects on human physical and mental health in
the workplace or in communities, the US Department of Labor, Occupational Health and Safety
Administration requires the protection of workers from hearing loss when the noise exposure
equals or exceeds an 8-hour time-weighted average of 85 dBA.
Unwanted community effects of noise occur at levels much lower than those that cause hearing
loss and other health effects. Annoyance occurs when noise interferes with sleeping,
conversation, or noise-sensitive work, including learning or listening to the radio, television, or
music. According to the World Health Organization, during daytime hours, few people are
seriously annoyed by activities with noise levels below 55 dBA, or moderately annoyed with
noise levels below 50 dBA.
This section summarizes existing noise levels in Vacaville, including mobile noise sources and
stationary noise sources.
The primary source of noise in Vacaville is vehicle traffic from highways and major roadways.
Additional noise sources include the Union Pacific Railroad, Nut Tree Airport, and Travis Air
Force Base. In addition, industrial areas within Vacaville are a source of stationary noise.
Mobile Noise Sources
This section describes existing mobile noise sources, including traffic, railroads, and aircraft.

Traffic
Motor vehicles have distinctive noise characteristics and are a dominant noise source in
Vacaville. The amount of noise varies according to many factors, such as the volume of traffic,
vehicle mix (i.e. percentage of cars and trucks), average traffic speed, and distance from the
receptor. Major contributing roadway noise sources include Interstate 80, Interstate 505, Leisure
Town Road, Vaca Valley Parkway, Monte Vista Avenue, Peabody Road, Elmira Road, Alamo
Drive, and other arterial and collector roadways throughout the city.
Existing traffic-related noise conditions along roadways within the city are shown in Figure
NOI-1.
Railroad
Rail operations are a source of noise in Vacaville. Factors that influence the overall impact of
railroad noise on adjacent uses include the distance of buildings from the tracks, surrounding
land topography, frequency of train operations, and the lack or presence of sound walls or other
barriers between the tracks and adjacent uses.
The train activity along the Union Pacific rail line bordering the southeast portion of the city
includes Amtrak passenger trains and freight trains. Noise from existing train operations are
estimated to be up to 76 dBA Ldn at 50 feet from the railroad centerline without warning horns,
and up to approximately 91 dBA Ldn at 50 feet from at-grade railroad crossings when warning
horns are sounded. The contributions to the existing noise contours from current rail operations
are shown in Figure NOI-1.
Aircraft
Aircraft overflights contribute to the ambient noise levels in Vacaville. The Nut Tree Airport is
located in the north central portion of Vacaville, and Travis Air Force Base is located southeast
of the city limits. The existing noise contours for each of these airports are provided in Figure
NOI-2; Figure NOI-3 provides a zoomed in view of the Nut Tree Airport Noise Contours.
This Noise Element includes Policy NOI-P1.4 prohibiting new residential land uses in locations
where the exterior noise associated with aircraft operations at Nut Tree Airport or Travis Air
Force Base exceeds 60 dB CNEL, which is commonly accepted throughout California as the
maximum noise exposure level that is compatible with low-density, single-family residential
development. Existing land uses in the portions of the city that lie within the 60 dBA CNEL
noise contour of the Nut Tree Airport include open space, business park, and industrial land uses,
and a few residential land uses in the area north of Monte Vista Avenue between Brown Street
and Browns Valley Parkway. The City has also adopted a Policy Plan for the Nut Tree Ranch
property allowing the future development of a mixed-use commercial, residential, office, and
entertainment development on this site, portions of which lie within the 60 dBA CNEL noise
contour. Residential land uses are also located adjacent to, but outside of, the 60 dBA CNEL
noise contour for Nut Tree Airport.

As shown on Figure NOI-2, no portion of Vacaville lies within the 60 dBA CNEL noise contour
of the Travis Air Force Base airfield.
Stationary Noise Sources
Existing stationary noise sources throughout most of the city include heating ventilation and
conditioning (HVAC) mechanical systems, delivery truck idling and loading/unloading
activities, and recreational and parking lot activities, such as slamming car doors and talking. Of
these noise sources, noise generated by delivery truck activity typically generates the highest
maximum noise levels. Delivery truck loading and unloading activities can result in maximum
noise levels ranging from 75 dBA to 85 dBA Lmax at 50 feet. Typical parking lot activities, such
as people conversing or doors slamming, generates approximately 60 dBA to 70 dBA L max at 50
feet. Other noise sources specific to commercial centers and industrial zones of the city include
light and medium industrial land uses, which can vary in noise levels.
Noise contours for 2035 are shown in Figure NOI-4. These noise contours are based on
projected land uses in 2035, the General Plan horizon year.
A new commuter rail station, the Vacaville/Fairfield Multi-Modal Rail Station, is planned to be
constructed in northeast Fairfield along Amtrak’s Capitol Corridor. Although the construction of
the station itself will not result in a direct increase in the number of train trips, it is possible that
trips will be expanded in the future, which could increase noise from railroad operations.
The Nut Tree Airport also intends to conduct several improvements to its facility, including
adding more hangars and expanding the aircraft parking areas. These proposed changes, along
with the ability to accommodate additional aircraft, will likely increase noise from the airport.
The objective of the noise and land use compatibility guidelines is to provide the community
with a means of judging the noise environment that it deems to be generally acceptable and to
minimize noise-related complaints from residents. The compatibility policies shown in Table
NOI-3 should be used in conjunction with the future noise exposure levels in Figure NOI-4 to
identify locations that may require special treatment to minimize noise exposure.
If ambient noise levels in the area of a proposed project would exceed “normally acceptable”
thresholds for the proposed land use category as shown in Table NOI-3, the City shall require a
detailed analysis of feasible noise reduction requirements. As needed, noise insulation features
shall be included in the design of such projects in order to reduce exterior noise levels to meet
the acceptable thresholds, or, for uses with no active outdoor use areas, to ensure maintenance of
acceptable interior noise levels for the proposed land use.

Goal NOI-1      Maintain an acceptable noise environment in all areas of the city.
Policies
Policy NOI-P1.1 Require an acoustical analysis for all proposed projects that would locate
                noise sensitive land uses where the projected ambient noise level is greater
                than the respective ”normally acceptable” noise level as indicated on Table
                NOI-3, and require mitigation of noise impacts that exceed the land use
                compatibility standards.
                Any acoustical analysis prepared pursuant to this Noise Element shall comply
                with the following:
                   Be performed according to a scope of work that has been approved by the
                    Director of Community Development.
                   Be the financial responsibility of the applicant.
                   Be prepared by a qualified person experienced in the fields of noise
                    assessment and architectural acoustics.
                   Include representative noise level measurements with sufficient sampling
                    periods and locations to adequately describe local conditions, predominant
                    noise sources, and peak noise sources.
                   Estimate existing and projected cumulative (2035) noise levels in terms of
                    CNEL, and compare those levels to the adopted policies of the Noise
                    Element.
                   Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with the
                    adopted policies and standards of the Noise Element, giving preference to
                    proper site planning and design over the construction of noise barriers or
                    structural modifications to buildings. Where the noise source in question
                    consists of intermittent single events, the report must address the effects of
                    maximum noise levels in sleeping rooms in terms of possible sleep
                    disturbance.
                   Estimate noise exposure after the prescribed mitigation measures have
                    been implemented.
                   Describe a post-project monitoring program that could be used to evaluate
                    the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures.

Note: This table provides land use compatibility standards for all noise sources. While the prior General Plan established different standards
for different noise sources, it has since become common practice to establish one set of land use compatibility standards for all noise sources
because it is often difficult to definitively determine which portion of ambient noise levels are attributable to a particular noise source.

CITY OF VACAVILLE
VACAVILLE GENERAL PLAN
NOISE ELEMENT
NOI-16
The provision of plentiful, well-designed, and well-maintained parks and recreation facilities
significantly contributes to the quality of life in a community. Parks fulfill a number of
important functions – they provide green “breathing” spaces within the city which promote
healthy lifestyles; they provide children and families a place to play and explore; they provide
areas for active sport uses and civic functions; and they provide areas for passive recreation and
relaxation. Parks may also incorporate natural features and visual assets of the landscape, in
addition to preserving habitat areas that are vital to the city's identity, history, and environmental
health. Other recreational facilities such as special-purpose facilities, accessible open spaces,
and trails fulfill specific community needs that formal developed parks typically cannot provide.
The Parks and Recreation Element is an optional element under State law. It contains goals and
policies that strengthen the City’s commitment to providing a high level of parks and recreation
facilities and services to Vacaville residents, and provides guidance for new development to
incorporate additional recreational facilities as needed to maintain this level of service. These
policies reflect the diversity of recreational needs historically desired by Vacaville residents, and
attempt to provide flexibility in Vacaville’s parks and recreational services so as to appropriately
respond when new recreational needs are desired by Vacaville’s changing population.
The City’s current inventory of parks and recreation facilities is classified into six basic
categories:
        Neighborhood Parks: Smaller parks that are primarily intended to serve the recreation
         needs of residential areas within ½ mile (an approximate 10-minute walking distance) of
         the park. Park facilities are usually oriented towards the recreation needs of children and
         typically include a multipurpose playfield, a playground, and picnic facilities. When
         neighborhood parks are located adjacent to schools, they may also include a small
         recreation building, and be designed for joint use with the school-owned property.
         Existing neighborhood park sites generally range in size from 1 to 10 acres. However,
         new neighborhood parks should be designed within a 6- to 9-acre size range, depending
         upon the neighborhood park needs of the part of the city in which they are located.
        Community Parks: Mid-sized parks designed to provide major active-use recreational
         facilities such as lighted sports fields, sport courts, community buildings, swimming
         pools, spaces for community festivals, civic events, organized sports, and athletic
                                                                                                  PR-1

PARKS AND RECREATION ELEMENT
      competitions. Community parks should ideally also include areas for passive recreation
      including walking paths with benches, shaded picnic areas, and preserved or created
      natural areas such as creeks, habitat areas, and unique landforms. Community parks
      often include appropriate support facilities such as parking areas, restroom buildings, and
      concession stands. Community parks generally range in size from 12 to 60 acres and are
      intended to serve the population living within a 1½-mile radius. A community park can
      also function as a neighborhood park for nearby residential areas.
     Regional Park: A large, nature-themed park that is focused on balancing the natural
      environment with related recreational activities. Lagoon Valley Park is the city’s only
      regional park and is designed to serve the city’s entire population and the greater
      Vacaville region. It includes a wide variety of passive recreation opportunities and
      amenities, including a 106-acre lake and open fields that are used for many large and
      regional events. The park is defined by its natural environment of hills, creeks, the
      lagoon, and the valley. It is intended to provide the public with access and use of these
      areas while sensitively preserving the habitat and natural environment for which the park
      is recognized. The historic Pena Adobe and its surrounding grounds are considered a
      sub-area of the park that provides additional space for group picnics and other events.
      The park provides trailheads and access to many acres of open space with miles of
      hiking, biking, and equestrian trails.
     Accessible Open Space: Land owned by the City of Vacaville (or other non-profit or
      public agency) that includes public access for limited recreational use and is maintained
      in a natural or non-intensive developed state. Publically accessible open space includes
      lands of geologic, agricultural, ecologic, and scenic significance, and includes certain
      lands that are used jointly as creekways, drainages, detention basins, and other specific
      dual purposes. Accessible open space areas are made available to the public for self-
      guided and low-impact activities that typically include hiking, biking, horseback riding,
      bird watching, sky gazing, and nature appreciation. Accessible open space often includes
      developed nature trails that provide the public with defined access and utility of the open
      space while minimizing negative impacts to the environment. The Land Use Element
      includes a designation called “Public Open Space,” which includes both these accessible
      open space lands as well as undeveloped areas that are not made accessible to the public
      for reasons related to public safety or other special concerns. Open space related to
      biological resources, agricultural lands, cultural resources, and scenic resources is also
      addressed in the Conservation and Open Space Element. Open space related to public
      health and safety, including ridgelines and areas with steep slopes, is addressed in the
      Safety Element.
     Special Purpose Facilities: Buildings that house recreational programs and/or facilities
      targeted to meet the needs of a certain sector of the population or neighborhood. Most of
      these facilities are located within the boundaries of a park. However, others may be
      located on properties that are not owned by the City, but operated by the Community
      Services Department and/or under contract to the Department for its programs.

        Bikeways, Multi-Use Trails, and Nature Trails
         Bikeways: Most of the city’s paved, off-street bikeways are officially designated as off-
         street bike paths; however, they also function as multi-use trails and are appropriately
         shared with walkers, runners, skaters, and other non-motorized forms of transportation.
         Vacaville follows Caltrans definitions for its paved bikeways; therefore, these facilities
         are more completely defined and discussed in the Transportation Element. For both
         recreation and transportation purposes, it is important that bikeways provide logical
         connections to various destination points and make connections to regional bikeways that
         are outside of city limits. In some cases, a paved bikeway may be incorporated within a
         park (or accessible open space) as part of that individual facility’s circulation plan.
         Multi-Use Trails: In addition to the paved bike paths built to accommodate a broad range
         of recreational activities related to walking, running, and bicycle riding, there are a
         number of unpaved trails that do not qualify as formal bike paths, but they are used by
         bicyclists, pedestrians. Where appropriate, a multi-use path can include an adjacent but
         separate bridle path if the width of the right-of-way is sufficient to prevent conflict
         between bicyclists, pedestrians, and horseback riders. Some of these trails are not much
         more than informal dirt or gravel maintenance roads, but due to significant use by the
         public, they may be considered important recreational elements within a park or
         accessible open space.
         Nature Trails: Nature trails are used by bicycle riders, hikers, and in many cases
         equestrians, but these unpaved trails tend to primarily serve recreational users who are
         interested in traversing challenging terrain. Because these trails are typically located in
         the steep and rugged environment of open space, they are discussed more thoroughly
         within the accessible open space component of this Element.
In addition, the local school districts own and operate a number of fields and specialized
facilities that, in some cases, are made available for public use through policies set by the
individual school district. The City recognizes the public ownership of these school facilities
and has previously utilized a joint-use agreement with the Vacaville Unified School District to
make a wider range of facilities available for the public’s use. However, as of the publication of
this General Plan, there is not currently an active joint-use agreement between the two agencies.
There are also many privately owned recreational facilities in Vacaville, such as golf courses;
swim, tennis, and fitness clubs; ice skating and hockey rinks; bowling alleys; and equestrian
centers. While recognizing the availability of the private recreational facilities, this Element
focuses primarily on the City’s provision of public park and recreation facilities.
The locations of the city’s parks are illustrated in Figure PR-1 (page 6), and a complete inventory
of existing neighborhood, community, and regional parks are listed in Table PR-1 (page 7).

CITY OF VACAVILLE
VACAVILLE GENERAL PLAN
PARKS AND RECREATION ELEMENT
The natural setting of the city is characterized by the ridges and hillsides west and south of the
city, the agricultural valley lands to the north and east, and free-flowing creeks crossing though
the city. As the city continues to grow, it is important to consider the impact urbanization can
have on the accessible open space areas and to consider how to best preserve and enhance their
character and uses. Policies in the Land Use Element express the City’s vision for urban form
and growth management. Policies in the Conservation and Open Space and Safety Elements
help guide the protection of open spaces, particularly hillside and ridge areas.
Accessible open space includes natural landscapes that are essentially undeveloped, but suitable
for passive recreational activities that do not require substantial facilities or improvements.
This includes lands that are owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the City of Vacaville, or
by some other public or non-profit entity, and are made accessible to the public for recreation,
nature preservation, education, viewshed, and other open space purposes.
Figure PR-2 (page 10) illustrates the locations of the publicly-accessible open space areas in
Vacaville. Table PR-2 (page 11) lists their acreages.
Hiking, biking and walking are popular recreational activities for Vacaville residents. Trails
provide an important recreational resource in-and-of themselves, but many trails also serve as a
support facility in providing access between neighborhoods and important destinations, and in
the case of paved trails, can also serve as part of the city’s transportation network. Trail use is
most often a self-directed recreational activity, but there is also a recognized trend toward
increased use of trails by organized groups for special events.
As part of the effort to better serve the needs of Vacaville residents who choose to hike, bike, and
walk for recreation, the City seeks to link the neighborhoods of the city to recreational resources
in a comprehensive network of pedestrian facilities, bikeways, hiking trails, and multi-use trails,
and to accommodate both bicycle and equestrian users wherever appropriate. Although it is a
citywide system, each section of the trails system should relate to its immediate surroundings in
design and function. Trails within the open spaces and hillsides are typically rustic and
particularly conducive to hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding; by their nature (rugged,
steep, and unpaved), most cannot be made to accommodate Americans with Disability Act
(ADA) access. By contrast, most of the multi-use trails along the creekways, trails that provide
linkages to neighborhood facilities, and those within developed parks are hard surfaced and
designed for easy access for all. Most of these paved trails are designed to accommodate
maintenance and emergency vehicles, and some also serve a dual purpose of providing
maintenance vehicle access to city utilities such as sewer, water, and drainage facilities.

Trail definitions, the trail system, and the various types of trails are further outlined in the
Comprehensive Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Master Plan, and are summarized under the
Park Classifications in the Background Information section above.
      Trailhead: The beginning of a hiking/biking/equestrian trail. Trailheads typically
       include orientation signs giving distance mileage, information on trail use including
       safety hazards, and perhaps a natural history of the area. Trailheads are sometimes
       referred to as staging areas when they also provide appropriate parking areas, restroom
       facilities, and drinking water, and particularly when they include facilities for horse
       trailers and equestrian users.
With the exception of the Mariposa and Trower Neighborhood Centers as noted below, Vacaville
owns and operates the following special purpose facilities, the locations of which are shown in

Vacaville’s “Comprehensive Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Master Plan” was developed in
1992 to guide the development of parks, recreation, and open space facilities throughout the city.
The Master Plan describes the condition of parks and recreation facilities as they existed in 1992,
proposes new facilities, and includes policies to implement the Plan. The Plan establishes
service standards for parks, recreation, and open space facilities and includes policies for the
development of new facilities, and for distributing these amenities throughout the city.
The City of Vacaville has identified locations for future parks in areas that are underserved and
areas where future development is anticipated, as well as future open space. Table PR-3 (page
15) and Figure PR-4 (page 14) identify the planned parks and open space in Vacaville.
Funding for the acquisition and development of parks is derived primarily from park
development impact fees as authorized under the Mitigation Fee Act (Govt. code 66000), and in
some cases by Mello Roos Community Facilities Districts, and grants. However, Action PR-
A1.3 directs the City to adopt a Quimby Ordinance, which will also provide funding for park
acquisition. Operation of the City’s parks, including programs, staff, and other operations, is
provided by the Community Services Department and funded through the City’s General Fund
and user fees. Maintenance of all City parks and recreation facilities is provided by the Public
Works Department and funded primarily through the General Fund and numerous maintenance
districts as authorized by the Lighting and Landscaping Act of 1972.

Park standards provide a means to measure how much park land should be set aside for
recreational use as the city develops. This section establishes the acreage, size, and service area
standards for neighborhood, community, and regional parks. No standards are established for the
provision of trails and open space. However, the Comprehensive Parks, Recreation, and Open
Space Master Plan includes standards for certain special purpose facilities and individual
recreation facilities.
The City’s park acreage standards are simple ratios of the City’s total desired number of
developed park acres, divided by the total population of the city (less those living in the prisons’
group housing facilities). The overall standard of providing 4.5 acres of developed parkland per
thousand people reflects a minimum goal to maintain this important quality of life component as
the city’s population increases through the years.
The City’s standard of 4.5 acres of developed parkland per thousand residents was established in
1992. As indicated below, this park acreage standard is further divided into the park categories
of neighborhood, community, and regional parklands, which are described earlier in this
Element:
     Neighborhood Park: 1.8 acres per 1,000 people
     Community Park:           1.7 acres per 1,000 people
     Regional Park:            1.0 acre per 1,000 people
     Total:                    4.5 acres per 1,000 people
The following park size standards provide efficiencies in programming and maintenance:
       New neighborhood parks must be a minimum of 6 acres in size, and can be as large as
        9 acres as needed to serve the local service area. New neighborhood parks less than
        6 acres may be approved in infill areas where there is a documented shortfall of parkland.
       New community parks must be a minimum of 10 acres in size, and may be up to 40 acres
        as needed to serve the planned service area. Centennial Park is a notable exception to
        this size standard in that it is intended to ultimately include all 265 acres and serve the
        entire city.
       Lagoon Valley Regional Park is the city’s only regional park at slightly over 300 acres.
        The City does not anticipate adding any new regional parks within the planning period of
        this General Plan.

For analysis purposes, the service area standard is represented as a radius drawn around a
neighborhood or community park, rather than as travel time; although significant barriers to
transportation, such as freeways and canals, should be taken into consideration. All residential
areas of the city should be served by a neighborhood and a community park within the service
area standards provided below; although, a community park may serve the residents within ½
mile as their neighborhood park. There is no service area standard for regional parks because
Lagoon Valley Regional Park serves the greater Vacaville region and it is expected that most
users will need to travel a distance to access the park.
            Neighborhood Park: ½ mile maximum (approximately a 10-minute walk)

PARKS AND RECREATION ELEMENT
The Comprehensive Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Master Plan specifies long-range facility
standards and programming recommendations for all the listed parks. Service ratios are provided
for a variety of specific recreation facilities, including gymnasia, tennis courts, baseball/softball
fields, golf courses, and community centers, among others. Additionally, the Master Plan makes
general recommendations for the provision of programming based on education, demographic,
and recreation trends. Since the Master Plan was approved in 1992, many of the listed
recommendations have been accomplished, a number of planned facilities have been constructed,
and trends and other changes in recreational activities suggest that this document should be
updated to better reflect the current recreational needs of the city’s residents.
Goal PR-1           Develop and maintain a high-quality public park system that provides
                    varied recreational opportunities for city residents, workers, and visitors.
Policies
Policy PR-P1.1      Provide new parks according to the standards established in this Element to
                    ensure adequate distribution, size, and access.
Policy PR-P1.2      Provide neighborhood parks to serve the unique recreational, cultural, and
                    educational needs of Vacaville’s diverse neighborhoods. Design new
                    neighborhood parks to have a unique character, appeal to children, and avoid
                    standardized, programmatic designs.
Policy PR-P1.3      Provide community parks to encompass a range of uses, including active high-
                    investment (e.g. gymnasiums and swimming pools), active low-investment
                    (e.g. playfields and picnic facilities), and passive recreational facilities (e.g.
                    natural areas suitable for quiet reflection). Community parks shall serve large
                    portions of the city by providing facilities suitable for recreational and cultural
                    activities beyond those supplied by neighborhood parks.
Policy PR-P1.4      Maintain, improve, and preserve Vacaville’s Lagoon Valley Regional Park to
                    serve the region with a variety of nature-oriented and passive recreational
                    opportunities.
Policy PR-P1.5      Support and encourage the location of special use recreation facilities, such as
                    community gardens, dog parks, and skate parks, on available park or other
                    public lands, where compatible with the existing and planned uses of
                    surrounding properties.

Policy PR-P1.6 Make provisions for elderly and disabled individuals to freely access and
               utilize parks and recreational facilities, according to local, State, and federal
               codes.
Policy PR-P1.7 Encourage the development of private and commercial recreational facilities
               at appropriate locations. However, private recreational facilities shall not
               count towards the park standards established in this Element.
Policy PR-P1.8 Make designated open spaces more accessible to the public with a linked park
               and trail system that takes advantage of surrounding open space.
Policy PR-P1.9 Maintain recreational fishing at Lagoon Valley Regional Park.
Actions
Action PR-A1.1 Update the Comprehensive Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Master Plan to
               include a broader description of desired park facilities and allow staff the
               flexibility to include the facilities desired by the public, and continue to
               implement this Master Plan.
Action PR-A1.2 Develop the Trails and Trailhead system as outlined in the Comprehensive
               Parks, Recreation and Open Space Master Plan. Provide additional trails and
               facilities where they are feasible and appropriate. Connect the trails system to
               the bikeways system wherever feasible and appropriate.
Action PR-A1.3 Implement a Quimby Ordinance requiring that park provision be considered
               and incorporated in the subdivision process.
Goal PR-2      Ensure that new development is responsible for providing new parks and
               recreation facilities in accordance with the City’s park and recreation
               standards and for providing its fair share of neighborhood park
               maintenance costs.
Policies
Policy PR-P2.1 All parks and recreation facilities required by the park standards in this
               Element shall be publicly owned, operated, and maintained, except as
               otherwise allowed by the Quimby Act.
Policy PR-P2.2 New parks and recreation facilities shall be funded, at least in part, by fees
               paid by new development, or as turn-key facilities with new development, as
               described in Policy PR-P2.5.

Policy PR-P2.3 Require that proponents of large projects subject to Specific Plans and/or
               Development Agreements work with City staff early in the planning process
               to ensure that the project includes an adequate amount of developed parkland
               to satisfy the City’s standards.
Policy PR-P2.4 Require all residential developers, including apartment builders, to provide
               sufficient parks and other recreational facilities to meet the standards
               established by the Comprehensive Parks, Recreation, and Open Space
               Facilities Master Plan by dedicating land and/or paying in-lieu fees for land
               acquisition, and by paying Park Development Impact Fees for the construction
               of new facilities.
Policy PR-P2.5 Encourage development of turn-key neighborhood parks, which are completed
               in conjunction with development of a new subdivision, rather than payment of
               impact fees.
Policy PR-P2.6 Work with residential developers to ensure that parks and recreational
               facilities planned to serve new development will be available concurrently
               with need.
Policy PR-P2.7 Encourage new non-residential development that would bring workers to
               Vacaville to incorporate park and recreation facilities into the project design.
Policy PR-P2.8 Ensure that all new residential development will either annex into or set up a
               new park maintenance district in accordance with the Landscaping and
               Lighting Act of 1972.
Actions
Action PR-A2.1 Adjust park impact fees to reflect a more accurate cost of developing parkland
               based on real development costs. Include an adjustment factor for the cost of
               responding to changing requirements, such as the Americans with Disabilities
               Act, playground safety standards, CEQA requirements, and new building
               technology that combats vandalism (e.g. concrete tables and video
               surveillance systems).

The Public Facilities and Services Element provides information and policy guidance regarding
the availability of public facilities and services needed to support existing and future develop-
ment in Vacaville. It addresses the changing public services and infrastructure needs of
Vacaville and provides for their logical and timely extension to keep pace with growth. This el-
ement covers the following topics:
     Fire, Rescue, and Emergency Medical Services
     Law Enforcement
     Schools

State law requires that general plans address “the circulation of people, goods, energy, water,
sewage, storm drainage, and communications.” In this General Plan, the Transportation Element
and the Public Facilities and Services Element fulfill this requirement. This Public Facilities and
Services Element also fulfills the State law requirement that general plans include “the proposed
general distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the land for…solid and liquid
waste disposal facilities,” as well as information on “the general location and extent of existing
and proposed… public utilities and facilities.”
The beginning of each section below contains brief background information on the major plan-
ning issues. The second part contains goals, policies, and actions related to the specific public
service or infrastructure category.
The coordination of land use, public services, and utilities is discussed in the Land Use Element.
Water conservation is addressed in the Conservation and Open Space Element. Stormwater
management is addressed in the Safety Element.
The Vacaville Fire Department (VFD) provides fire and emergency medical services to approx-
imately 28 square miles within the City of Vacaville, as well as emergency medical services to
                                                                                              PUB-1

approximately 160 square miles of unincorporated county land surrounding the city. VFD re-
sponds to calls to service for fires, hazardous materials emergencies, certain technical emergen-
cies, vehicle accidents and extrication incidents, and first responder and transport services. VFD
also organizes and conducts a fire prevention and public education program in Vacaville, includ-
ing business and occupancy inspections.
VFD maintains several facilities and a variety of equipment. In addition to its administrative of-
fices at City Hall, VFD has four existing fire stations in the city, as shown in Figure PUB-1: Sta-
tions 71 (serves as the main station), 72, 73, and 74. Beyond ambulances and basic fire engines,
VFD maintains and operates a variety of specialty and support equipment.
As of the preparation of this General Plan in 2013, there are plans in place to develop three new
fire stations and relocate one existing station, which are all shown on Figure PUB-1. Planned
fire stations include:
        Station 75, which will be located in and will serve the Southtown area.
        Station 76, which will be located in Lagoon Valley in southwest Vacaville.
        Station 77, which is planned at Orange Drive and Leisure Town Road, but contingent on
         the planned relocation of Station 73.
Funding for VFD comes from the City’s General Fund, ambulance transport fees, Special Para-
medic tax, Inspections fees, impact fees from new development, and from public safety Com-
munity Facilities Districts (CFDs), which have been formed for new development areas to offset
the costs of providing public safety services to such areas through the levy of special taxes.
Fire service for the areas surrounding the city limits is provided by fire protection districts, in-
cluding the Vacaville Fire Protection District, Dixon Fire Protection District, and Suisun Fire
Protection District. In addition, VFD is actively involved in formal agreements with the City of
Dixon, the City of Fairfield, and the Vacaville Fire Protection District to provide automatic aid
responses in designated areas. VFD also participates in a Mutual Aid Plan with other fire de-
partments in Solano County.

VACAVILLE GENERAL PLAN
PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES ELEMENT
Goal PUB-1      Provide adequate fire, rescue, and emergency medical services to serve
                existing and new development.
Policies
Policy PUB-P1.1   Prohibit any development that will not, even with identified mitigation
                  measures, maintain standards for fire, rescue, and emergency medical ser-
                  vice. All service standards shall be met prior to project occupancy. Allow
                  exceptions to these services standards only when there are overriding find-
                  ings of special circumstances or economic or social benefits.
Policy PUB-P1.2   Ensure that new development pays a fair and equitable amount to offset the
                  costs for fire, rescue, and emergency medical response services by collect-
                  ing impact fees, requiring developers to build new facilities, and requiring
                  the new areas to create or annex into a Community Facilities District.
Policy PUB-P1.3   Establish Community Facilities Districts or other funding mechanisms to
                  provide standby fire protection services (i.e. fire protection services during
                  the construction phase of new development, adding permanent staffing lev-
                  els as construction progresses), if necessary.
Policy PUB-P1.4   Identify and mitigate fire hazards during the project review and approval
                  process.
Policy PUB-P1.5   Require that new development satisfy fire flow and hydrant requirements
                  and other design requirements as established by the Fire Department.
Policy PUB-P1.6   Plan future fire station locations to maintain or enhance current response
                  levels.
Policy PUB-P1.7   Continue to coordinate fire protection services with the other agencies to
                  ensure coverage for all areas within Vacaville's Planning Area.
Actions
Action PUB-A1.1   Develop a public safety facilities plan for fire, rescue, and emergency medi-
                  cal services. Include the following elements in the plan:
                     Analysis of current fire, rescue, and emergency medical facilities and
                      equipment, and their adequacy to service the existing planning area.

The Vacaville Police Department (VPD) provides law enforcement service to the City of
Vacaville. Responsibilities of VPD include a 24/7 communication center, crime suppression and
prevention, investigations, traffic patrol, and emergency service. In addition, VPD oversees the
Reserve Officer and Cadet Programs and administers specialty units. There is one main VPD
police station, which is located at 660 Merchant Street, adjacent to Vacaville City Hall. VPD is
currently meeting or exceeding its adopted standards for response times.
Funding for VPD mainly comes from the City’s General Fund. A small percentage of other
funding comes from grants and development impact fees. In addition, public safety CFDs have
been formed for new development areas to offset the costs of providing public safety services to
such areas through the levy of special taxes.
VPD participates in a regional Office of Emergency Services mutual aid agreement. By partici-
pating in this mutual aid agreement, VPD commits staff and other resources to assist with disas-
ters throughout the state. In return, VPD receives assistance from outside entities should a sig-
nificant emergency occur in Vacaville. Additionally, the Solano County Sheriff’s Office pro-
vides law enforcement and emergency response in unincorporated parts of Solano County and
provides a small degree of support for Vacaville police, assisting the City with police services
approximately ten to 15 times per year.
                                                                                           PUB-5

VACAVILLE GENERAL PLAN
PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES ELEMENT
Goal PUB-2      Maintain a safe environment in Vacaville through the enforcement of the
                law.
Policies
Policy PUB-P2.1   Maintain adequate police staffing, performance levels, and facilities to serve
                  Vacaville’s existing population as well as any future growth.
Policy PUB-P2.2   Prohibit any development that will not, even with identified mitigation
                  measures, maintain standards for law enforcement service. All service
                  standards shall be met prior to project occupancy. Allow exceptions to
                  these services standards only when there are overriding findings of special
                  circumstances or economic or social benefits.
Policy PUB-P2.3   Ensure that new development pays a fair and equitable amount to offset the
                  costs for law enforcement services by collecting impact fees and requiring
                  the creation of or annexation into a Community Facilities District.
Policy PUB-P2.4   Identify and mitigate law enforcement hazards during the project review
                  and approval process.
Policy PUB-P2.5   Require physical site planning that prevents crime by locating walkways,
                  open spaces, landscaping, parking lots, parks, play areas, and other public
                  spaces in areas that are visible from buildings and streets.
Actions
Action PUB-A2.1   Develop a public safety facilities plan for law enforcement services. In-
                  clude the following elements in the plan:
                     Analysis of current law enforcement facilities and equipment, and their
                      adequacy to service the existing planning area.
                     Projections of the impacts of new development on the provision of law
                      enforcement services to the existing and new areas of the community.
                      These projections should include the adequacy of facilities and equip-
                      ment, response times, and communications systems.
                     Response time standards for law enforcement services, and adequate
                      personnel and facilities to meet the established standards.

Action PUB-A2.2        Provide neighborhood security and crime prevention information and train-
                       ing to neighborhood groups and homeowners’ associations.
Schools play a central role in the daily life of the city. New families contemplating a home in
Vacaville look at the quality of local schools as part of their evaluation of whether to settle in
town, and existing residents are actively engaged in schools to help them maintain a high level of
achievement. School children require an environment that excites and stimulates learning.
Moreover, because children spend a significant part of their lives in school, school buildings
constitute important landmarks in the image that the young residents of Vacaville form of their
community.
The City of Vacaville does not have jurisdiction over local schools. However, schools are an
important part of the community, and the General Plan can support the mission of local school
districts and the provision of high-quality education for Vacaville’s children.
School Districts
The City of Vacaville is served mainly by the Vacaville Unified School District (VUSD) and the
Travis Unified School District (TUSD). However, a portion of the city is located within the
Dixon Unified School District (DUSD), and a small portion of the Lower Lagoon Valley area
falls within the jurisdiction of the Fairfield-Suisun Unified School District (FSUSD). Figure
PUB-2, School Districts and Existing Schools, illustrates the current boundaries of the four
school districts serving the City of Vacaville and shows the location of existing schools. Planned
school sites, which are considered preliminary, are shown in Figure PUB-3.
Solano Community College
Solano Community College, established in 1945, offers associates degrees in a variety of fields,
as well as other academic programming. The college has a main campus in Fairfield and satellite
campuses in Vacaville, Vallejo, and Travis Air Force Base. The Vacaville Center of Solano
Community College is located at 2000 North Village Parkway, off Vaca Valley Parkway. This
satellite campus offers general education courses, job training in computer applications, and
training for a variety of vocational programs.
School Funding
Senate Bill (SB) 50, approved by the California Legislature in 1998 and funded by Proposition
1A, limits the power of Vacaville or any other city or county to require fiscal mitigation on home
developers as a condition of approving new development, and provides for a standardized devel-
oper fee for schools. California Government Code Sections 65995 to 65998 set forth provisions
                                                                                              PUB-7

to implement SB 50. Specifically, according to Section 65995(3)(h), the payment of statutory
fees is “deemed to be full and complete mitigation” of the impacts of any land use decision or
development project approval on the provision of adequate school facilities. Local school dis-
tricts in Vacaville are responsible for implementing the specific methods for mitigating school
impacts under the Government Code.
In addition to the use of developer fees, school districts may acquire funds to provide school ser-
vices in specific areas through the creation of a Community Facilities District (CFD). The
Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982 allows the City Council to create such a district
with a two-thirds vote by area landowners, and may authorize a special tax and sell bonds to
meet service costs. School districts may also initiate the formation of a CFD.
The City of Vacaville should work closely with all school districts to devise an on-going means
of financing school construction within the districts to accommodate the anticipated growth un-
der this General Plan.
Goal PUB-3          Support high quality education for Vacaville's school children as a com-
                    munity priority.

Policy PUB-P3.2       Encourage school districts to promote innovative and high-quality design in
                      school building architecture, landscaping, and campus layout.
Policy PUB-P3.3       Encourage school districts to locate elementary schools away from major
                      streets to avoid vehicular noise and traffic hazards.
Policy PUB-P3.4       Encourage school districts to design school sites with adequate on-site pick-
                      up and drop-off areas to prevent school-related traffic congestion on the
                      fronting and surrounding roadways.
Policy PUB-P3.5       Encourage school districts to locate schools on sites with access to more
                      than one street to avoid congestion on nearby streets.
Policy PUB-P3.6       Encourage school districts to provide direct, safe, and convenient pedestrian
                      and bicycle access between school sites and nearby residential neighbor-
                      hoods to provide safe passage for students and teachers.

                    Vacaville and the school districts.
Policies
Policy PUB-P4.1       Regularly inform the school districts of policies and projects that may affect
                      the provision of educational facilities and services.
Policy PUB-P4.2       Work with the school districts to plan educational facilities with sufficient
                      permanent capacity to meet the needs of current and projected future en-
                      rollment, and ensure that there are mechanisms to provide for the timely
                      construction of the facilities.
Policy PUB-P4.3       In conjunction with the approval of residential development, cooperate with
                      local school districts to ensure that sufficient school facilities are available
                      to serve the enrollment generated by the new development.
Policy PUB-P4.4       If planned school sites, as shown in Figure PUB-3, are not required or are
                      needed in an alternate location, as determined by the school districts, the
                      land use designation of the site will revert to the predominant land use in
                      the area through a General Plan Amendment process.
The City of Vacaville owns and/or operates numerous public buildings in the city, including City
Hall, a public works corporation yard, remote City offices at the corner of Buck Avenue and El-
dridge Street, and the Easterly Waste Water Treatment Plant. City Hall is located at 650 Mer-
chant Street. The facility provides for governance and administrative functions, such as the City
Council, City Manager, City Attorney, Finance Department, and the City Clerk, and also houses
the administrative offices of multiple City departments, including Community Development, Po-
lice, Fire, and Public Works. The Public Works corporation yard is located at 1001 Allison
Drive, just east of Downtown Vacaville. It provides facilities for municipal building, engineer-
ing, and maintenance, and public works functions. The remote City offices located at the corner
of Buck Avenue and Eldridge Street house the City’s Community Services and Housing Services

There are two libraries in Vacaville and both are maintained by the Solano County Library Sys-
tem in cooperation with the Vacaville Unified School District Library District. The Town
Square branch of the Vacaville Public Library, located at 1 Town Square Place, opened in 2005
and features 25,000 square feet of space. The Cultural Center branch, located at 1020 Ulatis
Drive, was remodeled in 2005 and features 24,000 square feet of space. Both libraries feature a
meeting room, a study room, and a computer center, as well as additional equipment and techno-
logical amenities.
Public safety facilities (i.e. police and fire stations) and schools are covered in separate sections
of this element. Recreational facilities and community centers are covered in the Parks and Rec-

A wide variety of utilities and technologies are central to a modern community. Adequate provi-
sion of these utilities and services allows businesses to prosper, homes and schools to be con-
nected to educational resources from across the world, and government services to be easily ac-
cessed by citizens. Likewise, lack of these facilities can be a major detriment to the health and
development of a community. Since most of these facilities and services are provided by private
companies, a partnership between government, industry, and citizens is needed. In addition, be-
cause the field of technology and telecommunications changes very rapidly, policies and regula-
tions need to be flexible enough to respond to the changing marketplace.
Many of the facilities necessary to provide telecommunications services are located in the public
right-of-way, or in public utility easements adjacent to the right-of-way. To avoid damage to the
public investment in landscaping and roads, and to avoid disruption to residential neighborhoods,
maintenance and installation work should be coordinated and properly scheduled. Some utility
franchises are established by State law (e.g. telephone), while other franchises are left to local
negotiations, although both examples have severe and substantial limitations on the exercise of
local authority. These franchise agreements provide rights to use of the right-of-way to the fran-
chisee, and provide the City with money to help pay for the repair of damages caused by installa-
                                                                                              PUB-13

tion and maintenance work. Franchise agreements also provide the City with tools to ensure ser-
vices are provided to areas that may be less economically desirable for the provider to serve.
Telecommunications facilities can impact the appearance of a community. Too many above-
ground facilities can detract from the residential character of neighborhoods. In many older resi-
dential and commercial areas, electrical distribution lines are located on poles in the public right-
of-way, which can disrupt the aesthetic characteristics of a neighborhood or commercial center.
In newer developments, the distribution lines for electricity are placed underground, along with
cable television, telephone, and natural gas lines.
Access to the Internet is an essential feature of schools and businesses. In addition, more work-
ers are telecommuting, working from their home by connecting to the main office through tele-
communications technology. This benefits the community and region by reducing traffic and
providing citizens with more time to commit to their families, local organizations, and activities.
As citizens and businesses have come to rely on the Internet for economic and educational activi-
ties, they also expect the same sort of access and service from government. The City’s website
helps residents sign up for programs, take out permits, and participate in general governance
more effectively. In addition, the City has established a “control network” to accurately identify
all new parcels and facilities in new development projects, which will assist emergency response
planning, modeling to determine future facility needs, and general mapping activities. Tele-
communications services have also become important tools for law enforcement and emergency
medical services. Not only is radio used to dispatch units, but data on suspects and patient rec-
ords is commonly sent to vehicle-based computer systems. Global Positioning System (GPS)
receivers are also used to keep track of emergency response vehicles, and an Opticom traffic sig-
nal system provides green lights for emergency vehicles through intersections.
Goal PUB-7          Promote the development of state-of-the-art technology and telecommu-
                    nications facilities that benefit the public.
Policies
Policy PUB-P7.1       Ensure that technological facilities and services are available to the broadest

As the City grows, there will be an increasing demand and support for community services and
cultural facilities. Most services that enhance the quality of life within the city, such as health
services, child-care services, and cultural and community facilities, such as theaters, galleries,
places of worship, are provided by private businesses or public agencies other than the City.
However, the City provides some of these services, such as the Vacaville Cultural Center, which
includes a performing arts facility.

The City of Vacaville contracts with a private waste collection company to provide weekly solid
waste, green waste, and recyclable material collection to Vacaville residents and commercial
businesses. The California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) has
allocated the City of Vacaville with a disposal rate target of 6.5 pounds of waste per person per
day. In 2010, the City of Vacaville’s disposal rate was 4.9 pounds of waste per person per day,
which was well below the CalRecycle target.
Recyclable material can also be taken to several drop-off recycling centers throughout the city,
including a recycling Center located at 855½ Davis Street. Recyclable material collected by the
private waste collection company is sent to a material recovery facility.
Solid waste collected from Vacaville is deposited at the Hay Road Landfill. In 2009, the landfill
received 126,000 tons of solid waste, of which 48 percent was from Vacaville residents and

Vacaville residents can dispose of household hazardous waste at the Household Hazardous
Waste Facility. The Household Hazardous Waste Facility also accepts commercial hazardous
waste from Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators (CESQGs) that generate less than
220 pounds or 27 gallons of hazardous waste for a fee.
Division 8.08 (Solid Waste, Yard Waste, and Household Hazardous Waste) of the Vacaville
Municipal Code regulates the collection and disposal of solid waste, yard waste, and household
hazardous materials. All Vacaville residents must pay to have their solid and yard waste collect-
ed. Solid and yard waste may not be burned or buried within the city limit. Household hazard-
ous waste must be disposed of at a licensed and permitted collection facility. In addition, the
Land Use and Development Code (Division 14.09 of the Municipal Code) requires that residen-
tial, commercial, business, industrial, and public districts provide areas for the collection of recy-

Actions
Action PUB-A9.1        Consider adopting a procurement ordinance to purchase recycled goods,
                       thereby creating a market for recycled materials.
Action PUB-A9.2        Amend the Land Use and Development Code to require at least 50 percent
                       diversion (i.e. reuse or recycling) of non-hazardous construction waste from
                       disposal.
The City provides potable water to users within the city limits via a network of water mains,
transmission mains, reservoirs, groundwater wells, booster pump stations, and treatment plants.
Water Supply
Water supply for the city comes from both surface water and groundwater, and is drawn from a
variety of reserves, including the following:
       Solano Project. The Solano Project was constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation in
        1958. The main feature of the Solano Project is Monticello Dam, which provides storage
        for approximately 1.6 million acre-feet (AF) of water in Lake Berryessa. In addition to
        its direct entitlement, Vacaville entered into an agreement with the Solano Irrigation Dis-
        trict (SID) that augments the city’s allocation of Solano Project water.
       State Water Project (North Bay Aqueduct). Pursuant to agreements with the Solano
        County Water Agency (SCWA) and the Kern County Water Agency (KCWA), surface
        water received from the State Water Project is delivered through the North Bay Aqueduct
        (NBA) to the City of Vacaville. Because the NBA is part of the entire State Water Pro-
        ject, any shortages occurring in the State Water Project impact the water availability from
        the NBA, making it a less reliable source than the Solano Project.
       Settlement Water. The California Water Code includes area-of-origin statutes, which
        state that an area shall not be deprived of the prior right to water reasonably required to
        adequately supply the beneficial needs of the area. In settlement of area-of-origin water

        right applications by the cities of Fairfield, Benicia, and Vacaville, the California De-
        partment of Water Resources (DWR) provides “Settlement Water” to Vacaville. This is
        part of the State Water Project.
       Municipal Groundwater Wells. The City owns and operates twelve municipal ground-
        water wells with very high quality groundwater. Vacaville continues to explore well field
        expansion as a means of maintaining adequate water supply.
Areas outside the city limits are generally agricultural and/or rural residential and rely on private
groundwater wells and/or potable water service from the Solano Irrigation District (SID).
In 2002, the California legislature passed Senate Bill (SB) 610, which requires new development
projects to assess the sufficiency of water supply. SB 610 requires the local public water system
to prepare a Water Supply Assessment for large development projects, which are defined in the
legislation. A Water Supply Assessment must document water supply sources, quantify existing
and future demand for water, evaluate potential impacts of short and prolonged droughts, and
compare water supply and demand in order to evaluate water supply sufficiency.
Water Treatment and Distribution
The City operates two water treatment facilities:
       The Diatomaceous Earth Water Treatment Plant (DE Plant), which is located on Elmira
        Road and owned by the City.
       The North Bay Regional Water Treatment Plant (NBR Plant), which is located in Fair-
        field and jointly owned with the City of Fairfield.
The City’s distribution system consists of one main pressure zone, which primarily serves devel-
opment with building pad elevations between 82 and 222 feet, and several upper pressure zones,
which serve development above 222 feet. The system includes approximately 292 miles of dis-
tribution pipelines, including 18-inch, 24-inch, and 30-inch transmission mains, as well as 4-inch
to 12-inch water distribution mains. In addition, water is stored by the City in various elevated
storage reservoirs, including five reservoirs in the main zone and three reservoirs in the upper
pressure zones. New major water distribution system infrastructure required to serve the General
Plan by its horizon year of 2035 is shown in Figure PUB-4.
Urban Water Management Plan
In accordance with State law, the City has adopted an Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP),
which compares projected water use to available water supply sources over the next 20 years.
The UWMP is updated every five years.

Wastewater collection and treatment is provided by the City of Vacaville.
Wastewater Collection
The City owns and operates the wastewater collection system in Vacaville, which consists of
gravity and pressure sewers, lift stations, and associated facilities. The City performs routine
wastewater collection system flow monitoring at various permanent metering locations through-
out the city and at the Easterly Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). Additionally, the City
maintains a collection system model for the purpose of simulating peak flow conditions in major
sewers to determine existing and future needs for collection system improvements. Based on
this model, the City uses Development Impact Fees to replace undersized facilities, giving priori-
ty to those facilities that are expected to reach capacity in the near future.

Wastewater Treatment
The Easterly Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP), located east of the city, near Elmira, pro-
vides treatment of wastewater from residential, commercial, and industrial dischargers through-
out the city. Effluent from the Easterly WWTP is discharged into Old Alamo Creek adjacent to
the WWTP site. Current wastewater flows are within the design capacity of the WWTP.
The City of Vacaville has an adopted Sewer System Management Plan that responds to the
Statewide General Waste Discharge Requirements for Sanitary Sewer Systems and provides a
general framework for collection system operation, maintenance, and overflow prevention.

Goal PUB-14      Coordinate wastewater conveyance, treatment, and disposal with land use
                 planning.
Policies
Policy PUB-P14.1   Assess the adequacy of wastewater infrastructure in existing developed are-
                   as, and program any needed improvements in coordination with new infra-
                   structure that will serve developing areas.
Policy PUB-P14.2   Replace existing sewers, lift station pumps, and associated equipment and
                   facilities with larger facilities as necessary to serve intensified land use in
                   developed areas.
Policy PUB-P14.3   Ensure that new development provides adequate funding for all wastewater
                   infrastructure and facilities.
Policy PUB-P14.4   Prohibit any development that will not maintain adequate standards for
                   wastewater service. All wastewater service standards shall be met prior to
                   project occupancy.
Policy PUB-P14.5   Require that new development designate sewer easements or routes when
                   tentative maps or specific plans are approved.
Policy PUB-P14.6   Prohibit extension of wastewater infrastructure into the Upper Lagoon Val-
                   ley that would promote its urban development.
Policy PUB-P14.7   Long-range strategic capital development plans for areas with concentra-
                   tions of unoccupied Business Park or Technology Park shall be in accord-
                   ance with the sewer master plan that may include one or more unassigned
                   “point loads” in order to accommodate large employers with high
                   wastewater flows.
Actions
Action PUB-A14.1 Continue to update the five-year Capital Improvement Plan to provide for
                   needed wastewater facilities in relation to the City's financial resources.
Action PUB-A14.2 Develop and maintain, through regular updates, a long-range strategic capi-
                   tal development plan for wastewater facilities consistent with the General
                   Plan.
Goal PUB-15      Pursue innovative solutions for wastewater treatment and disposal or re-
                 use that are compatible with the environment.

PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES ELEMENT
Policies
Policy PUB-P15.1 Require buffer landscaping and multiple use, where feasible, of wastewater
                 utility sites and rights-of-way to harmonize with adjoining uses.
Policy PUB-P15.2 Seek out cost effective and environmentally sustainable methods of distrib-
                 uting and using recycled water for non-potable uses.
PUB-26
The Safety Element provides information about risks in Vacaville due to natural and human-
made hazards. It addresses the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks
associated with the effects of:
     Geologic hazards, including earthquakes, ground failure, and slope instability
     Flooding and dam failure
     Wildland fires
     Hazardous materials and waste
     Climate change
This Element also contains information and policies regarding general emergency preparedness.
The Safety Element establishes mechanisms to reduce death, injuries, and damage to property,
and to address the negative effects of public safety hazards like flooding, fires, and seismic
events. Hazards are an unavoidable aspect of life, and although the Safety Element cannot
eliminate risk completely, it contains policies to minimize risk exposure.
Earthquake Hazards
The law requires the California Geological Survey (CGS) to establish regulatory zones (known
as Earthquake Fault Zones or Alquist-Priolo Zones) around the surface traces of active faults and
to issue maps to all affected cities, counties, and State agencies for use in planning and
controlling development. Figure SAF-1 shows the approximate location of the major fault zones
in the Vacaville region.
The Vaca-Kirby Hills Fault system is the only fault system that passes through the Vacaville
Planning Area. The Vaca Fault has not experienced displacement within the past 11,700 years,
and there is no evidence for displacement along the Kirby Hills Fault during the last 700,000
years. The Green Valley Fault system, which lies 12 miles to the southwest of Vacaville, has
been active within the past 200 years. While more likely than either of the two previous faults to
have seismic impacts on Vacaville, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a federal
science organization that examines natural resources, natural hazards, and our environment,
estimates the probability of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake along this fault prior to 2036

producing a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake prior to 2036.1
Ground Shaking
Vacaville is located within a seismically active region and earthquakes have the potential to
cause ground shaking of significant magnitude. Any slip along all or part of a fault surface
releases accumulated energy that radiates in all directions away from the source. This occurs in
the form of earthquake waves. The intensity of the ground shaking varies depending on the
severity of earthquake activity, proximity to that activity, and local soil and geological
conditions.
Liquefaction
Liquefaction occurs when loosely packed sandy or silty materials saturated with water are
shaken hard enough to lose strength and stiffness. Liquefied soils behave like a liquid and are
responsible for tremendous damage in an earthquake. For example, it can cause buildings to
collapse, pipes to leak, and roads to buckle.
As shown in Figure SAF-2, Vacaville is generally characterized by areas of very low, low, and
moderate risk of liquefaction. However, there are some areas with a high and very high risk of
liquefaction in Vacaville due to the underlying soil types or other geologic features. For
example, areas along and adjacent to Vacaville’s major water ways, Ulatis and Alamo Creeks,
feature high and very high levels of liquefaction susceptibility. These creek corridors cross
through the community and include central areas of the city.
Landslides and Ground Failure
Landslides and slope instability are characterized by the movement of soils and bedrock down
steep slopes. This movement results from wet weather, seismic shaking, and/or improper
construction, grading, and drainage. Because portions of western Vacaville include the foothills
of the Vaca Mountains, there is a potential for landslides throughout this area.
As shown in Figure SAF-3, the vast majority of Vacaville’s area is described as flatland by the
USGS with some sloped areas having had small scattered landslides. Very small areas on the
northern and western edges of the city limit have had mapped landslides; however, these areas
are sparsely developed.
Figure SAF-4 shows slopes in Vacaville. Areas with steeper slopes, in combination with other
factors described above, are more susceptible to landslides than areas on shallow slopes.

*Few Landslides consists of few, if any, large mapped landslides, but locally contains scattered small landslides in
questionably identified larger landslides.
**Mostly Landslides consists of mapped landslides with intervening areas typically narrower than 1500 feet and narrow
borders around landslides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       FIGURE SAF-3

Expansive Soils
Certain types of soils have characteristics that make them more susceptible to geotechnical
hazards, such as erosion and expansion. Soils subject to expansion increase when water is added
and shrink when water dries out. Identifying local soil types and understanding their
characteristics help cities to establish appropriate engineering and construction standards for new
buildings and remodeling. The primary soil types in the Vacaville area are silty, sandy, and clay
loams, with a smaller portion being made up of purely clay soils. Though not all types of clay
are expansive, soils with a clay component are more prone to expansion. Approximately 64
percent of Vacaville’s soils contain at least some clay component.
Subsidence
Land subsidence is the sinking of a large area of ground surface with little or no horizontal
movement. Subsidence areas are associated with land over areas where groundwater or natural
gas is extracted, and can also occur from seismic activity. Subsidence can occur throughout
Vacaville, but particularly in any areas where groundwater has been extracted.
Goal SAF-1          Minimize exposure to geologic hazards, including slope instability,
                    subsidence, and expansive soils, and to seismic hazards, including
                    groundshaking, fault rupture, liquefaction, and landslides.
Policies
Policy SAF-P1.1       Consider geologic conditions when designating land use and designing
                      development in Vacaville. Where potential geologic or seismic risks are
                      high and unmitigable, retain low-occupancy or open space forms of use.
Policy SAF-P1.2       Prohibit development on ridges and slopes at or exceeding 25 percent, as
                      shown in Figure SAF-4.
Policy SAF-P1.3       Evaluate and consider the geologic and soil hazards for any proposed
                      extension of urban or suburban land uses into areas that are characterized by
                      slopes from 15 to 25 percent, as shown in Figure SAF-4.
Policy SAF-P1.4       Determine the geologic suitability of proposed development sites during the
                      earliest stages of the planning process. Such analyses should consider the
                      potential structural engineering needs of the project and the impacts
                      development activities may have on adjacent lands.
Policy SAF-P1.5       Require geotechnical studies prior to approving rezoning requests, specific
                      plans, or subdivision maps in areas that have experienced landslides in the
                      past, as shown in Figure SAF-3, and that are within ¼ mile of a fault.

SAFETY ELEMENT
Policy SAF-P1.6  Require preparation of a soils report prior to issuing a building permit,
                 except where the Building Official determines that a report is not needed.
Policy SAF-P1.7  Require comprehensive geologic and engineering studies of critical
                 structures such as hospitals, fire and police stations, utility centers and
                 substations, emergency communications facilities, overpasses, and bridges,
                 regardless of location.
Policy SAF-P1.8  To the extent practical, do not locate structures intended for human
                 occupancy over the trace of an inactive fault. Allow roads to be built over
                 active faults only where alternatives are impractical.
Policy SAF-P1.9  To the extent practical, do not allow facilities and structures that are public,
                 high-occupancy, or critical in disaster situations (e.g. hospitals, fire and
                 police stations, and bridges) to be sited in areas highly susceptible to
                 damage resulting from earthquakes. If locating such a facility or structure in
                 a high-risk area is deemed essential to the public welfare, require that they
                 be sited, designed, and constructed with due consideration of the potential
                 for damage.
Policy SAF-P1.10 Limit cut slopes to 2:1 (50 percent slope) except where an engineering
                 geologist can establish that a steeper slope would perform satisfactorily over
                 the long term. Where practicable, require more gentle slopes than the 2:1
                 standard. Encourage use of retaining walls, rock-filled crib walls, or
                 stepped-in buildings as alternatives to high cut slopes.
Policy SAF-P1.11 Require contour rounding and revegetation to preserve natural qualities of
                 sloping terrains, mitigate the artificial appearance of engineered slopes, and
                 control erosion. Encourage the use of native trees and shrubbery in
                 revegetation areas.
Policy SAF-P1.12 Require financial protection for public agencies and individuals as a
                 condition of development approval for projects that are located in areas
                 where geologic conditions indicate a potential for high maintenance or
                 repair costs.
Policy SAF-P1.13 Require the formation of geological hazard abatement districts or other
                 methods to reduce potential exposure to geologic hazards prior to
                 development approval in a high risk area. Such measures ensure that
                 geotechnical mitigation measures are maintained over the long term and that
                 financial risks are equitably shared among owners rather than borne by the
                 City.

Actions
Action SAF-A1.1      Consider implementing a hazard reduction program for existing
                     development in high-risk zones. This would include inspection of
                     structures for conformance with the Building Code and could give priority
                     for inspection to emergency and critical facilities, older structures, and
                     public facilities.
Storm Drainage
In general, creeks in Vacaville flow in an east-southeasterly direction and ultimately drain into
the Sacramento River via Cache Slough. The southern portion of Vacaville drains either to the
Noonan Drain, which discharges ultimately to Barker Slough, or to Union Creek, which
discharges to Suisun Bay. The major stream courses within the city include:
     Alamo Creek, including its tributaries Laguna Creek and Encinosa Creek
     Ulatis Creek
     Horse Creek, including its tributary Pine Tree Creek
     Gibson Canyon Creek
There are two existing reservoirs in Vacaville: Lagoon Valley Lake, which is a tributary to
Laguna Creek, draining a portion of Lower Lagoon Valley, and the Basherini Reservoir located
on Vine Street, which is owned and operated by the Solano Irrigation District.
The major creeks that flow through Vacaville are largely in their natural state and alignment,
except at the eastern edge of the city where flood control channels have been constructed. The
natural, unaltered portions of the creeks generally do not have adequate flow capacity to convey
a 100-year storm event, which is a storm that has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given
year. In addition, there is not adequate capacity in some areas to accommodate a 10-year storm
event, which is a storm that has a 10 percent chance of occurring in any given year.
Occasionally, overbank flows in Vacaville have resulted in flooding of residential properties,
road blockages, and traffic disruptions.
To address these flooding problems, Vacaville uses a variety of flood control facilities and
measures. As shown in Figure SAF-5, the City has built several regional detention basins that
reduce the flow from the Vaca Mountains before they reach the city in order to reduce urban
flooding. The City also maintains a network of storm drains, and works to keep channel
flowlines free from debris and vegetation. As part of past flood control efforts, certain
creekways have been engineered to handle larger volumes of stormwater than they would in their
natural states. In addition, Vacaville’s Residential Design Guidelines minimize the extent of
                                                                                            SAF-9

impervious surfaces, surfaces through which water cannot penetrate, such as a roof, road,
sidewalk, or paved parking lot. Because impervious surfaces do not allow water to penetrate into
the ground, they increase runoff volumes and contribute to flooding. Minimizing the amount of
permitted impervious surfaces helps reduce flooding.
Recent studies have highlighted the need and potential options for enhanced flood control
infrastructure within Vacaville. In 2008, the Solano County Water Agency (SCWA) conducted
the Ulatis System Drainage Study, which recommended a number of storm drainage
improvements in Vacaville, including new detention basins and channel improvements. The
City also maintains the Storm Drainage Master Plan, which identifies storm drainage
deficiencies and improvements needed to address existing localized flooding problems. The
Storm Drainage Master Plan identifies regional detention basins to mitigate the increase in runoff
from new development. New development is required to provide 100-year level flood protection
within the proposed development area and ensure that developed areas are not adversely
impacted.
Floodplain Development Regulations
Regulation of development in known flood-prone areas, based on Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) mapping and other information, is a key tool in reducing flooding
risks to life and property. The key development regulations in known flood-prone areas are as
follows:
       Central Valley Flood Protection Plan. According to California Government Code
        Sections 65302.9 and 65860.1, every jurisdiction located within the Sacramento-San
        Joaquin Valley, which includes Vacaville, is required to update its General Plan and
        Zoning Ordinance in a manner consistent with the Central Valley Flood Protection Plan
        (CVFPP) within 24 months after the CVFPP’s adoption, which occurred in 2012. In
        addition, the locations of the State and local flood management facilities, locations of
        flood hazard zones, and the properties located in these areas must be mapped and
        consistent with the CVFPP. The planning area of the CVFPP is called the Systemwide
        Planning Area. Vacaville is not included within this area. The CVFPP also catalogs the
        State Plan of Flood Control, which is the collection of State and federal flood protection
        system in the Central Valley. None of the facilities within the State Plan of Flood
        Control are located in Vacaville.
       AB 5, SB 5, SB 17, and AB 162. In 2007, several State laws were passed to address
        flooding risks in California. AB 5 (Wolk), SB 5 (Machado), SB 17 (Florez), and AB 162
        (Wolk) require that urban and urbanizing areas in the Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin
        Valley, such as Vacaville, achieve, or make adequate progress toward achieving, 200-
        year protection by the year 2015 in order to continue to approve development in the
        floodplain. Specifically, AB 162 requires that each local jurisdiction’s Safety Element
        include 200-year floodplain maps. Maps must be based on the best available data on
        flood protection, including areas protected by State and federal project levees, and areas
                                                                                            SAF-11

        outside of these areas. As of the preparation of this General Plan in 2013, the 200-year
        floodplain for the Vacaville study area had not been mapped.
State legislation also requires a jurisdiction’s Safety Element to include a Levee Flood Protection
Zone map and an Alluvial Fan Floodplain Evaluation and Delineation map. However, because
Vacaville is not within a Levee Flood Protection Zone, this Safety Element does not include such
a map. In addition, the Alluvial Fan Floodplain Evaluation and Delineation Map program only
applies to counties within Southern California.
Flood Zones
The most recent mapping of areas subject to flooding, shown in Figure SAF-6, was prepared by
FEMA in 2009. This shows the boundaries of the 100- and 500-year flood plains.
Vacaville has adopted a Floodplain Management Ordinance (Section 14.18 of the Municipal
Code) that outlines the requirements for construction within a designated 100-year floodplain or
areas prone to flooding. Specifically,
       Residential construction, either new or a substantial improvement, must have the lowest
        floor, including the basement, elevated to, or above, the base flood elevation, the
        computed elevation to which floodwater is anticipated to rise during a 100-year storm
        event. A 100–year storm is defined as storm that has a 1 percent chance of occurring in
        any given year. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor
        must be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the
        community building inspector to be properly elevated.
       Nonresidential construction, either new or a substantial improvement, must either be
        elevated to conform to the requirements described above for residential construction, or
        be flood-proofed below the base flood elevation. If the structure is flood-proofed, it must
        be watertight with the wall substantially impermeable to the passage of water, have
        structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and
        effects of buoyancy, and be certified by a registered engineer or architect.
       All preliminary subdivision proposals must identify the special flood hazard area and the
        elevation of the base flood.
       All subdivision plans must provide the elevation of the proposed structure(s) and pad(s).
        If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the lowest floor and pad elevations
        must be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor.
       All subdivision proposals must be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
       All subdivision proposals must have public utilities and facilities located and constructed
        to minimize flood damage.
       All subdivisions must provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards.

CITY OF VACAVILLE
VACAVILLE GENERAL PLAN
SAFETY ELEMENT
       Encroachments within designated floodways are prohibited, including fill, new
        construction, substantial improvement, and other new development, unless certification
        by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments do
        not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base
        flood discharge.
Dam Inundation
All dams pose the potential risk of failure, most likely from seismically-induced ground shaking
or another seismic event, which threatens the area below the dam with inundation of water
spilling from the dam. Since 1972, the State has required inundation maps for most dams,
showing those areas within the potential dam failure inundation zone. As illustrated in Figure
SAF-7, the northeastern portion of Vacaville is subject to potential dam inundation by the
Monticello Dam. The inundation map shows the area likely to flood should the dam fail.
Constructed between 1953 and 1957 in Napa County, the Monticello Dam forms Lake
Berryessa, which stores over 1.6 million acre-feet of water when full. The California
Environmental Quality Act requires that agencies like the City of Vacaville take into
consideration risks from dam failure when approving development that would place people or
structure in dam inundation areas.
State Awareness Mapping Program
The purpose of the State Awareness Mapping project is to show flood hazards that are not
mapped under FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program to give property owners and residents
additional information about potential flood hazards. The State has deemed the areas mapped
under the Awareness Mapping project as prone to flooding. This designation is advisory only
and is not subject to federal or State regulation. Figure SAF-8 shows the Awareness Floodplain
Areas within the Vacaville Planning Area.
Goal SAF-2          Collect, convey, store, and dispose of stormwater in ways that provide an
                    appropriate level of protection against flooding, account for existing and
                    future development, and address applicable environmental concerns.
Policies
Policy SAF-P2.1       Continue to develop a comprehensive system of drainage improvements to
                      minimize flood hazards, and maintain storm drainage infrastructure in good
                      condition.
Policy SAF-P2.2       Assess the adequacy of storm drainage utilities in existing developed areas,
                      and program any needed improvements in coordination with new
                      infrastructure that will serve developing areas.

                flooding and drainage problems.
Policy SAF-P2.4 Design storm drainage infrastructure to serve dual purposes to the extent
                possible. This includes the following:
                   Drainage facilities integrated into recreation corridors with bike paths,
                    sidewalks, and landscaping.
                   Drainage channels integrated with transportation and environmental
                    corridors.
                   Active and passive recreation areas incorporated into detention basins
                    where feasible.
Policy SAF-P2.5 Maintain open areas needed to retain stormwater and prevent flooding of
                urban or agricultural land.
Policy SAF-P2.6 Require new development adjacent to creeks to dedicate the area within 40
                feet of the stable top of bank to the City and be designed to allow access to,
                and visibility of, creek areas for maintenance and public safety purposes.
Actions
Action SAF-A2.1 Study the feasibility of establishing specific fees for those areas in which
                flooding and drainage problems exist. Assessed fees would be used to
                mitigate flooding through physical improvements.
Action SAF-A2.2 Develop a financing plan for the construction of upstream regional flood
                control detention basins.
Action SAF-A2.3 Continue to construct upstream regional flood control detention basins.

                  additional development in undeveloped areas.
Goal SAF-3      Provide effective storm drainage facilities for development projects.
Policies
Policy SAF-P3.1  Evaluate the storm drainage needs for each project; this evaluation should
                 account for projected runoff volumes and flow rates once the drainage area
                 is fully developed. In the Alamo Creek watershed upstream of Peabody
                 Road (including Alamo, Laguna, and Encinosa creeks), require post-
                 development 10-year and 100-year peak flows to be reduced to 90 percent
                 of predevelopment levels. In the remainder of Vacaville, for development
                 involving new connections to creeks, peak flows shall not exceed
                 predevelopment levels for 10- and 100-year storm events.
Policy SAF-P3.2  Continue to require development impact fees to fund necessary storm
                 drainage improvements, including drainage detention basins.
Policy SAF-P3.3  Require a Storm Drainage Master Plan to be prepared for new development
                 projects to ensure new development adequately provides for on-site drainage
                 facilities necessary to protect the new development from potential flood
                 hazards and ensure that potential off-site impacts are fully mitigated.
Policy SAF-P3.4  Require that new development designate storm drainage easements or routes
                 when tentative maps or specific plans are approved.
Policy SAF-P3.5  Prohibit extension of storm drainage infrastructure into the Upper Lagoon
                 Valley that would promote its urban development.

                 Insurance Rate Maps for the Vacaville area and identifying 100-year flood
                 zones.
Action SAF-A4.3  Review and revise the Safety Element concurrently with the adoption of
                 each Housing Element to identify any new housing areas prone to flood
                 hazards.
Action SAF-A4.4  Annually review the Land Use Element to account for new flood
                 information made available during the previous year.
Action SAF-A4.5  Update the Land Use and Development Code to appropriately reflect the
                 Central Valley Flood Protection Plan and to identify current flood hazards
                 and information.
Action SAF-A4.6  Support the efforts of levee owners and regional, State, or federal agencies
                 to design and reconstruct levees that do not meet flood protection standards
                 to bring them into compliance with adopted State and/or federal standards.

                      becomes available.
This section addresses wildland fires. Additional information and policies regarding urban fires
are contained in the Public Facilities and Services Element.
Highly flammable vegetation and warm, dry summers create the potential for wildland fires in
Vacaville. The risk of wildland fires is related to a combination of factors, including winds,
temperatures, humidity levels, and fuel moisture content. Of these four factors, wind is the most
crucial. Steep slopes also contribute to fire hazards by intensifying the effects of wind and
making fire suppression difficult. Where there is easy public access to dry vegetation, fire
hazards increase due to greater chance of human carelessness. High hazard areas in Vacaville
include outlying residential parcels and open lands adjacent to residential areas.
To quantify this potential risk, the California Department of Forestry (CDF) has developed a Fire
Hazard Severity Scale that utilizes three criteria in order to evaluate and designate potential fire
hazards in wildland areas. The criteria are fuel loading (vegetation), fire weather (winds,
temperatures, humidity levels, and fuel moisture contents), and topography (degree of slope).
Figure SAF-9 shows the Fire Hazard Severity Zones for the City of Vacaville.
In addition to the Fire Hazard Severity Zones mapped by CDF in Figure SAF-9, open
agricultural lands in eastern Vacaville pose a threat related to grass fires. Grass fires can travel
very fast, and threaten nearby residential areas. Grass fire threats in open agricultural lands are a
significant concern in the growth areas in the eastern portion of the city, which are shown in
Figure LU-3 in the Land Use Element.
To reduce risks from wildland fires, the City of Vacaville adopted Chapter 14.20.290 of the
Municipal Code, Standards for New Construction Adjacent to Open Space Lands Where
Wildfire is a Threat. Chapter 14.20.290 provides development standards for new construction
adjacent to permanent open or other open lands where no development is anticipated in the near
future (as identified in the General Plan) and where wildfire is a threat. Some of the fire
reduction strategies incorporated in the code include providing for fire access roads, maintaining
a defensible space of non-combustible vegetation around structures, and installing indoor
sprinkler systems.

Products as diverse as gasoline, paint solvents, film processing chemicals, household cleaning
products, refrigerants, and radioactive substances are categorized as hazardous materials. What
remains of a hazardous material after use or processing is considered to be a hazardous waste.
The handling, transportation, and disposal of such waste is a concern to all communities.
Improper handling of hazardous materials or waste may result in significant impacts on human
health and the environment.
Many businesses and residents in Vacaville use hazardous materials and generate some amount
of hazardous waste. Common hazardous waste is generated from gasoline service stations, dry
cleaners, automotive mechanics, auto body repair shops, machine shops, printers and photo
processors, and agriculture. Most of these wastes are petroleum-based or hydrocarbon hazardous
waste and include cleaning and paint solvents, lubricants, and oils. However, medical wastes,
defined as potential infectious waste from sources such as laboratories, clinics, and hospitals, are
also included among the hazardous wastes found in Vacaville.
Hazardous materials and hazardous wastes in Vacaville are heavily regulated by a range of
federal, State, and local agencies. One of the primary hazardous materials regulatory agencies is
the California Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Toxic Substances Control
(DTSC). DTSC is authorized by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to enforce and
implement federal hazardous materials laws and regulations.
Solano County has taken the lead in preparing and adopting a hazardous waste management plan
for all waste projected to be generated in the county. State law requires all businesses to prepare
an inventory of hazardous materials they use and store. The County's Department of
Environmental Management receives this information and distributes it to local fire protection
agencies.
In Vacaville, limited quantities of household hazardous waste may be transported to and dropped
off at a recycling center. Local small businesses may also contract with the waste collection
service provider to regularly dispose of larger quantities of waste.
Goal SAF-6          Minimize risks from the harmful effects of hazardous materials and
                    waste.
Policies
Policy SAF-P6.1       Work with Solano County and other public agencies to inform consumers
                      about household use and disposal of hazardous materials.
                                                                                             SAF-23

                    implementing the following measures:
                       Maintain formally-designated hazardous material carrier routes to direct
                        hazardous materials away from populated and other sensitive areas.
                       Prohibit vehicles transporting hazardous materials from parking on City
                        streets.
                       Require that new pipelines and other channels carrying hazardous
                        materials avoid residential areas and other immobile populations to the
                        extent possible.

This section focuses on hazards associated with climate change. Additional information and
policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are contained in the Conservation and Open Space
Element.
As discussed in the Conservation and Open Space Element, many people, and the State of
California, believe that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are contributing to a
concentration of these gases in the atmosphere, and have led to a trend of unnatural warming of
the earth’s climate, which is known as global warming. The climate and natural resources in
California could be adversely affected by the global warming trend. Droughts and wildland fires
are expected to become more severe. Increased precipitation and sea level rise could increase
coastal flooding, saltwater intrusion, and degradation of wetlands. Mass migration and/or loss of
plant and animal species could also occur. Potential effects of global climate change that could
adversely affect human health include, but are not necessarily limited to, more extreme heat
waves and heat-related stress; an increase in climate-sensitive diseases; more frequent and
intense natural disasters, such as flooding, hurricanes and drought; and increased levels of air
pollution.
Goal SAF-8         Improve Vacaville’s ability to adapt and respond to the impacts of
                   climate change.
Policies
Policy SAF-P8.1       Promote awareness of climate change and its impacts.
Policy SAF-P8.2       Collaborate regionally to prepare for the effects of climate change.
Actions
Action SAF-A8.1       Develop a Climate Change Preparedness Plan that will prepare for the
                      impacts of climate change on the city’s economic and natural systems and
                      provide a climate-resilient community.

The purpose of the Transportation Element is to define the long-term vision for citywide
mobility by setting goals and policies that respond to existing conditions and future
changes. This element defines the means to meet this vision by establishing standards
that need to be met for transportation operations through the year 2035, and preserves
right-of-way for transportation improvements that have the capacity to serve the ultimate
buildout of the General Plan. This element balances the need to provide efficient and
reliable ways to move people and goods by multiple transportation modes and routes with
the overall vision of Vacaville as a safe, attractive community with walkable
neighborhoods, vibrant retail districts, and economically strong employment areas.
Looking forward, the transportation system should accommodate the planned growth of
Vacaville, minimize environmental degradation, and complement regional transportation
and land use plans.
Transportation is, and will remain, a major issue for the citizens and businesses of
Vacaville and will need to be balanced with the anticipated transportation impacts of new
development. Regional freeway traffic will continue to affect Vacaville no matter what
types of development occur within the city. The volume of traffic in Vacaville is
expected to increase over the coming decades. Roadway and interchange improvements
will be required to increase capacity capable of serving this increased traffic.
Land use patterns and transportation systems are directly related. Land use decisions
drive the need for a transportation system, while the capacity of the transportation
network may support or constrain land use options. Therefore, State law requires that the
Transportation Element include “the general location and extent of existing and proposed
major thoroughfares, transportation routes, (and) terminals… all correlated with the Land
Use Element of the Plan” (Govt. Code, Sec. 65302[b]). The circulation network included
in this Transportation Element is based on the land use map and designations contained in
the Land Use Element.
The California Complete Streets Act (AB 1358), passed in 2008, requires all General
Plan updates after January 1, 2011 to “plan for a balanced, multimodal transportation
network that meets the needs of all users of streets, roads, and highways for safe and
convenient travel” and defines “users of streets, roads, and highways” to include
bicyclists, children, persons with disabilities, motorists, pedestrians, users of public
transportation, and seniors. The policies and actions in this Transportation Element are
intended to meet the requirements of Complete Streets legislation.

the City’s Municipal Code and as part of project-specific environmental assessment
documents.
This section describes the existing transportation and circulation systems and programs in
the Vacaville area.
The city contains a hierarchy of roadways that serve different functions, ranging from the
highway system to arterial, collector, and local streets. A subset of these roads are
designated as regionally significant routes and are subject to regional policy
considerations, as described in the sections below that summarize the Solano County
Comprehensive Transportation Plan and Congestion Management Program. Vacaville’s
existing roadway system is shown in Figure TR-1.
Highways
Vacaville is served by two freeways, Interstate 80 and Interstate 505, which are part of
the interstate highway network.
Interstate 80 primarily has four travel lanes in each direction in the Vacaville area. It
extends southwest through Fairfield and Vallejo, crosses the Carquinez and Oakland Bay
Bridges, terminating at Highway 101 in San Francisco. It also extends northeast through
Dixon and Davis, over the Sacramento River to Sacramento and beyond.

CITY OF VACAVILLE
VACAVILLE GENERAL PLAN
TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT
Interstate 505 links Interstate 80 with Interstate 5, a major north-south freeway serving
the west coast of the United States. Interstate 505 has two travel lanes in each direction.
These freeways and their associated interchanges define the regional context, which
affects the local access and circulation within Vacaville.
Local Street and Roadway System
The local street and roadway system is composed of a hierarchy of streets with varying
functions. The classifications within this hierarchy are explained in detail in the
Roadway Classifications and Standards section below. Arterial roads range from six-lane
arterials, such as portions of Elmira Road, to four lane arterials, such as Peabody Road
and Nut Tree Road. Two-lane roads can also be designated as arterial roads. Collectors,
which have two travel lanes, include Orchard Avenue, Marshall Road, and Vanden Road.
Local streets are primarily found in residential neighborhoods, carry little through traffic,
and generally have the lowest traffic volumes. As shown in Figure TR-1, collector routes
funnel traffic from local roadways to the arterial roadway network. In most cases,
collector and local streets also serve as residential streets.
Routes of Regional Significance
The Solano County Comprehensive Transportation Plan (CTP) envisions, directs, and
prioritizes the transportation needs of Solano County. The CTP identifies Routes of
Regional Significance, which are roadways that carry significant through traffic, connect
two or more jurisdictions, serve major transportation hubs, or cross county lines. Since
these routes are significant to the transportation network of the region, and serve more
than local transportation needs, they are eligible for federal funding. Figure TR-1
identifies the Routes of Regional Significance in the Vacaville area.
The 2009 Draft Comprehensive Transportation Plan Update (2009 CTP Update) is the
current CTP for Solano County as of fall 2013 and identifies transportation needs through
the year 2035. In addition to Interstate 80 and Interstate 505, the 2009 CTP Update
identifies the following local roadway segments within the Vacaville city limits as Routes
of Regional Significance:
        Alamo Drive between Interstate 80 and Leisure Town Road.
        Fry Road between Leisure Town Road and eastern city limits.
        Allison Drive between Elmira Road and Interstate 80.
        Bella Vista Road between Interstate 80 and Davis Street (segment no longer
         exists).
        Cliffside Drive between Interstate 80 and Peabody Road.
        Davis Street between Hickory Lane and Bella Vista Road.
        Elmira Road between Leisure Town Road and Interstate 80.

        Leisure Town Road (Jepson Parkway) between Interstate 80 and Vanden Road.
        Midway Road between Interstate 505 and eastern city limits (portions in county).
        Peabody Road between Elmira Road and southern city limits.
        Vaca Valley Parkway between Interstate 505 and Interstate 80.
The 2009 CTP Update also identifies the following roadway segments that are located
within the county, adjacent to city limits, as Routes of Regional Significance:
        Cherry Glen and Pleasants Valley Road from Interstate 80 to Vaca Valley Road.
        Farrell Road between North Orchard Avenue and Gibson Canyon Road.
        Fry Road from existing city limits east into Solano County.
        Lewis Road from Midway Road south to Fry Road.
        Midway Road from Interstate 505 east across Interstate 80 into Solano County
         (portion within city limits).
        Vaca Valley Road from Pleasants Valley Road to Gibson Canyon Road.
        Vanden Road (Jepson Parkway) from Leisure Town Road south into Fairfield.
Congestion Management Program
The Solano County Congestion Management Program (CMP) identifies a CMP System
for monitoring purposes, which consists of a subset of roadways identified as Routes of
Regional Significance by the CTP. The CMP is a mobility monitoring and planning tool
for counties that contain an urbanized area with a population of 200,000 or more. The
major goals of the CMP are to maintain mobility on Solano County’s streets and
highways, and to ensure the County’s transportation system operates effectively as part of
the larger Bay Area and Northern California transportation systems. The 2009 CMP is the
current version as of fall 2013.
State law requires that level-of-service (LOS) standards1 be established as part of the
CMP process. The purpose of setting LOS standards for the CMP system is to provide a
quantitative tool to analyze the effects of land use changes to the system’s performance
(i.e. congestion). If the actual system performance falls below the standard (i.e.
congestion worsens to LOS F), actions must be taken to improve LOS. The roadway
segments listed below are subject to biannual monitoring to ensure compliance with the
levels of service identified by the 2009 CMP.

The relatively flat areas of the city, where most residents live and employees work, are
attractive for both bicycle commuters and recreational riders. Figure TR-2 shows the
existing and planned bicycle network in Vacaville. These bicycle routes are more
expansive than the bikeways designated in the Solano Countywide Bicycle Plan, which
was adopted by the Solano Transportation Authority (STA) in 2004.
The City classifies bikeways into categories that are consistent with the California Streets
and Highways Code (Section 890.4), the California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices for Streets and Highways, and the Caltrans Highway Design Manual. These
classifications are described below.
       Bike Path (Class I Bikeway). Off-street bike paths are designated for the
        exclusive use of bicyclists and pedestrians, with minimal crossflows by motorists.
       Bike Lane (Class II Bikeway). On-street, striped and signed bike lanes are
        designated for the exclusive or semi-exclusive use of bicycles alongside through
        travel by motor vehicles. Vehicle parking and crossflows by pedestrians and
        motorists are permitted adjacent to Class II bikeways.
       Bike Route (Class III Bikeway). On-street, signed bike routes are designated for
        shared use by bicyclists with motorists. Bicycles are permitted on most roadways,
        but for safety purposes, signed bicycle routes are often found on streets with
        lower speeds and traffic volumes.
Vacaville has a well-established pedestrian network. Sidewalks with a raised curb and
gutter are typically provided along arterial and collector streets, and in newer residential
neighborhoods. Some older residential neighborhoods, constructed prior to sidewalks
being a standard condition of approval, contain sidewalks with rolled curbs that are
intermittently interrupted by landscaping and other obstructions. This is a prominent
condition in the older neighborhoods located west of Downtown.
Most major intersections in the city have marked crosswalks and pedestrian crossing
signals that can be activated by pedestrians. Pedestrian curb ramps are located at most
intersections. High-contrast truncated domes – textured ground surface indicators to
assist vision-impaired pedestrians – are provided at newer installations.

TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT
Detectable warnings that comply with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
requirements have not yet been installed in Downtown, one of the areas of highest
pedestrian activity. The City has an established ADA Committee to address priorities in
providing ADA improvements.
Public transportation service in Vacaville includes local and regional bus service and taxi
operations. Public transportation plays an important role in reducing traffic congestion
within Vacaville, adjoining jurisdictions of Solano County, and along the Interstate 80
corridor. As residential growth continues, the City’s public transit service will be a
critical component in transporting individuals in a local capacity and in a broader
commuter-based transportation system throughout Solano County and beyond.
The City’s public transportation program does not receive funding through the City’s
General Fund. Instead, funding is derived from passenger fares, the State Transportation
Development Act, the Federal Transit Administration, and various grants. These funding
sources are finite, limited, and subject to established requirements. For example, State
transit funding, provided by the State Transportation Development Act, requires a 20
percent farebox recovery, meaning that for every dollar spent on operating expenses, 20
cents must be recouped from collected passenger fares. Anticipated ridership data
derived from various sources, such as public transit interest surveys and short range
transit plan documents, must demonstrate an adequate level of ridership to meet the 20
percent farebox recovery mandate before a bus route can be added or extended.
Bus Service
Bus service in Vacaville is provided by Vacaville City Coach, Fairfield and Suisun
Transit (FAST), and YOLOBUS, as described further below.
       Vacaville City Coach, operated by the City of Vacaville, offers local service.
        Most of its routes either begin or end at one of the two City transportation centers:
        the Vacaville Transit Plaza, located at the corner of Monte Vista Avenue and
        Cernon Street in the Downtown, and the Vacaville Transportation Center, located
        at the northeasterly corner of Allison and Ulatis Drives, near access to the
        Interstate 80 corridor and a key commercial area.
       Fairfield and Suisun Transit (FAST), a public transportation agency, operates
        intercity service from the Vacaville Regional Transportation Center and the Bella
        Vista Park & Ride Lot.
       YOLOBUS, which is administered by the Yolo County Transportation District,
        offers one fixed bus route between Vacaville and Davis.
City Coach provides special services to eligible residents as an ADA paratransit service
within Vacaville. Trips beyond the city limits may be specially arranged with City
Coach.

Taxi Service
Vacaville is served by a number of privately-operated taxi companies, including Yellow
Cab of Vacaville, Veteran’s Cab, and Vacaville Checker Cab. In addition, the City of
Vacaville administers the Taxi Scrip Program, which provides elderly and disabled
Vacaville residents the opportunity to use Vacaville’s local Taxi Cab companies at a
discount to the regular fare. This program is subject to funding availability as part of the
Solano Transportation Authority’s mobility resources for seniors and people with
disabilities.
The City has established an extensive truck route network on which vehicles exceeding a
gross vehicle weight rating of 5 tons (i.e. the City’s definition of “trucks”) must travel
unless they are destined for, or originated from, points within the city. The shortest and
most direct routes must be used to and from the truck routes, and/or between locations
within the city. The City has also established an extra-legal permit process, patterned
after a State process, for trucks with loads exceeding legal limits. Applications must
specify truck dimensions and weights. Appropriate truck routes are approved and
conditioned based on established City truck routes, and permits establish limitations for
specific extra-legal truck dimensions and weight. Designated truck routes are shown in
Figure TR-3.
The Nut Tree Airport is a valuable resource for business and recreational air travel, while
Travis Air Force Base is the home of the world’s largest military cargo airlift. The
Solano County Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) has adopted plans for airport land
use compatibility that will facilitate orderly development and avoid land use conflicts in
the airport environs. Policies addressing land use compatibility around the Nut Tree
Airport are located in the Land Use Element and in the Land Use and Development Code.
Policies addressing Travis Air Force Base are located in the Conservation and Open
Space Element.
The term Transportation Systems Management (TSM) refers to measures designed to
more efficiently serve peak automobile traffic through the efficient use of existing
transportation resources. Examples of TSM measures include optimizing signal timing,
providing transit preemption, conducting improvements to reduce bottlenecks, and
collecting traffic data to monitor and adjust operations. Strategies to reduce traffic
demand, specifically that of single-occupancy private vehicles, and/or shift the demand to
other modes and to non-peak travel periods are referred to as Transportation Demand
Management (TDM). These strategies focus on public transit, flexible working hours,
carpooling and vanpooling, and incentives to increase the use of these alternatives.

TDM has become increasingly important in the effort to reduce air quality impacts and
greenhouse gas emissions in Solano County and elsewhere in the Bay Area. Consistent
with State law, any TSM and TDM program must be achieved on a voluntary, rather than
mandatory, basis.
The road hierarchy in Vacaville is composed of three different functional classifications:
arterial, collector, and local. Each road type performs a different function in moving
people around the city. The design and construction standards for these roadway
classifications are described in the City’s Standard Specification for Public
Improvements. Figure TR-4 depicts the recommended future roadways by type.
Arterials link residential and commercial districts with the freeway network and provide
intercity connections. These roadways can be either divided or undivided, and generally
carry the heaviest amount of traffic among the three classifications. While the majority
of arterials in Vacaville consist of four travel lanes, there are also two-lane arterials, such
as Midway Road and Gibson Canyon Road, and six-lane arterials, such as portions of
Elmira Road. Access and intersections along arterials are limited to facilitate efficient
travel along the arterial.
Rural Arterials serve the same functions as arterials in urban areas, but are outside the
boundaries of the urban area. Rural arterials may have different design standards than
urban arterials. Design standards are defined in the most recent version of the American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) A Policy on
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (“Green Book”). Parking lanes, medians,
curbs, and sidewalks are typically not constructed on rural arterials. Where curbs and
sidewalks are not provided, a minimum 2 feet of shoulder width should be paved. Where
bicycles are to be accommodated on the shoulder, a minimum paved width of 4 feet
should be used.
Collectors are designed to connect residential neighborhoods with arterials. All collector
streets in Vacaville have two travel lanes. Some examples of collectors are Orchard
Avenue, Marshall Road, portions of California Drive and Youngsdale Drive. Collectors
typically provide direct access to adjacent land uses and are wider than most local streets
so as to provide improved motor vehicle and bicycle circulation. Access may be limited
along collectors to facilitate travel along the roadway, maintain capacity, and limit
conflicts between through traffic and local access.

Rural Collectors serve the same functions as collectors in urban areas, but are outside the
boundaries of the urban area. Rural collectors may have different design standards than
urban collectors, and are defined in the Green Book mentioned above. Typically, two
travel lanes are appropriate for rural collectors. Parking lanes, medians, curbs, and
sidewalks are typically not constructed on rural collectors.
Local streets are intended to serve adjacent and nearby residential and commercial
neighborhoods or business areas only. They generally carry little through traffic and
have low traffic volumes.
In Vacaville’s developed areas, the primary circulation issue is the flow of traffic on city
streets. The standard used for measuring the quality of this flow is called Level of
Service. Level of Service (LOS) describes the operating conditions experienced by
roadway users, and applies quantifiable traffic measures such as average speed,
intersection delays, and volume-to-capacity ratios to approximate driver satisfaction.
Levels of service are designated LOS A through F, from best to worst, and are evaluated
differently for different road facility types. This element addresses LOS standards for
signalized and unsignalized intersections, and for roadway segments.
Signalized intersection LOS is defined in terms of the average total vehicle delay of all
movements through an intersection. Vehicle delay is a method of quantifying several
intangible factors, including driver discomfort, frustration, and lost travel time.
Specifically, LOS criteria are stated in terms of average control delay per vehicle during a
specified time period (for example, the afternoon peak commute hour). Vehicle delay is a
complex measure based on many variables, including signal phasing (i.e. progression of
movements through the intersection), signal cycle length, and traffic volumes with
respect to intersection capacity.
Unsignalized intersection LOS criteria can be further divided into two intersection types:
all-way stop-controlled and two-way stop-controlled intersections. All-way stop-
controlled intersection LOS is expressed in terms of the average vehicle delay of all of
the movements, much like that of a signalized intersection. Two-way stop-controlled
intersection LOS is defined in terms of the average vehicle delay of individual
movements. This is because the user experience at a two-way stop-controlled intersection
is very different for vehicles traveling through the intersection without a stop sign versus
those at stop signs. For this reason, LOS for a two-way stop-controlled intersection is
defined in terms of its individual movements rather than its average performance overall.
Roadway segment LOS is based on a comparison of hourly traffic volumes to hourly
segment capacities by roadway type as established by the City.

CITY OF VACAVILLE
VACAVILLE GENERAL PLAN
TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT
The LOS standard provides a means to measure whether the performance of the
transportation system meets the goals and vision for the city. The level of service
standard is used to identify the needed capital improvements to accommodate growth and
to set the significance threshold against which future development is evaluated.
Chapter 14.13 of the Vacaville Land Use and Development Code, Traffic Impact
Mitigation Ordinance, describes the specific LOS standards and traffic analysis
procedures that implement the policies of the Transportation Element relative to level of
service.
Existing regional and local transportation plans and City staff have identified needed
improvements to the transportation network in Vacaville to address existing level of
service deficiencies and to permit additional development without adversely impacting
LOS standards. This section describes these changes to the transportation network. The
changes include previously planned roadway, transit and bicycle improvement projects,
as well as recommendations for additional improvements to accommodate future growth.
Planned and recommended roadway improvements that would be implemented by the
City of Vacaville are shown in Figure TR-5 and listed in Table TR-1.
The California Complete Streets Act (AB 1358), passed in 2008, requires all General
Plan updates to “plan for a balanced, multimodal transportation network that meets the
needs of all users of streets, roads, and highways for safe and convenient travel.” This
law also defines “users of streets, roads, and highways” to include bicyclists, children,
persons with disabilities, motorists, pedestrians, users of public transportation, and
seniors. Future improvements in Vacaville’s transportation network will need to consider
these principles.
The improvements discussed in this section were identified in the following plans and
programs, and as part of approved development projects:

Planned Roadway Improvements
The following planned roadway improvements include those at the regional and local
levels for both vehicular and alternative modes of transportation.
Regional Roadway Improvements
The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has jurisdiction over all State
highway facilities, including the freeway ramps and ramp intersections. The projects
identified below include projects on regional routes being planned by Caltrans and the
City, and projects being planned in coordination with other jurisdictions. The project
status is described as of fall 2013.
Caltrans projects:
          Interstate 80/Alamo Drive/Merchant Street Westbound On-Ramp. Widen bridge
           over Alamo Creek and extend westbound on-ramp to provide an
           acceleration/merge lane. This project is under construction.
          Interstate 80/Cliffside Drive Eastbound On-Ramp. Widen bridge over Mason
           Street and extend eastbound on-ramp to provide an acceleration/merge lane. This
           project is in its planning phase.
          Interstate 80/Davis Street/Hickory Street Westbound On-Ramp.                                           Extend
           westbound on-ramp to provide an acceleration/merge lane. This project is in its
           planning phase.
          Interstate 80/Davis Street Eastbound On-Ramp. Widen bridge over Davis Street
           and extend eastbound on-ramp to provide an acceleration/merge lane. This
           project is in its planning phase.
          Interstate 80 High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes. Construct new HOV lanes
           between the Interstate 80 interchange with Interstate 505 and the Yolo County
           line. This project is in its planning phase.
          Interstate 80/Mason Street Westbound On-Ramp. Extend westbound on-ramp to
           provide an acceleration/merge lane. This project is in its planning phase.
          Interstate 80 Ramp Metering. Provide ramp metering improvements to control
           access to the freeway. The project has been initiated in Fairfield and a planning
           phase has been initiated for Vacaville.
          Interstate 505 Weave Correction. Construct weave corrections for westbound
           traffic at the interchange ramp and eliminate lane drop. This project is in its
           planning phase.2
        2
          The weaving area is a segment of the freeway between two interchange ramps, where vehicles merge onto or
out of the basic travel lanes. This segment is generally shorter than 2,500 feet in length. Lane drop means elimination
of a lane, for instance transitioning from four travel lanes to three travel lanes. The location of the lane drop is usually
a point of conflict as vehicles merge onto the available lanes.
                                                                                                                     TR-17

       Lagoon Valley Road Ramp Modifications and Signal. Widen interchange ramps
        and bridge to accommodate left-turn storage for both eastbound and westbound
        on- and off-ramps and provide pedestrian access on the bridge; install traffic
        signals. The design of this project is on hold pending funding from the Lower
        Lagoon Valley developer. This is a City of Vacaville project with Caltrans
        oversight.
       Vaca Valley Parkway/Interstate 505 Southbound Interim Improvements. Widen
        Vaca Valley Parkway to provide a protected westbound left-turn lane and an
        eastbound right-turn lane and widen southbound off-ramp to provide an eastbound
        left-turn lane; provide signalization at the southbound ramp intersection. Funding
        is included in the current Vacaville Development Impact Fee Program. This is a
        City of Vacaville project with Caltrans oversight.
Projects planned in coordination with other jurisdictions:
       Jepson Parkway. Construct a new four-lane expressway between State Route 12
        and Interstate 80 along Walters Road, Cement Hill Road, Vanden Road, and
        Leisure Town Road, and include a Class I bike/pedestrian path. This project is
        subject to design criteria identified in STA’s 2000 Jepson Parkway Concept Plan.
        In Vacaville, Jepson Parkway follows the Vanden Road and Leisure Town Road
        alignments. A concept plan and environmental assessment has been completed.
        This project is partly funded by the Development Impact Fee Program and partly
        as conditions of approval for adjacent development. Jepson Parkway is being
        planned and constructed in partnership with STA, Solano County, and the cities of
        Fairfield, Suisun City, and Vacaville.
       Peabody Road between Fairfield and Vacaville City Limits. Widen the two-lane
        arterial to a four-lane arterial. This is a City of Fairfield project associated with
        the Fairfield Train Station Specific Plan.

        revised during updates to the fee program.
       Midway Road Widening. Widen Midway Road to provide two lanes in each
        direction between Putah South Canal and Interstate 80. This project will be
        funded by adjacent development as a condition of approval.4
       Browns Valley Road Widening. Widen Browns Valley Road between Allison
        Drive and Wrentham Drive. Funding for this project is included in the current
        Development Impact Fee Program.
       Interstate 505/Midway Road Interchange Improvements.                             Improve the
        intersections of Midway Road with the Interstate 505 northbound and southbound
        freeway ramps to accommodate projected demand. This project will be funded by
        future development impact fees.
Local Streets Within New Development Areas
The following new roadway network is anticipated as part of approved and proposed
development areas. These new roadways and roadway improvements will be funded by
development as a condition of approval.
       North Village Parkway. Complete the connection of North Village Parkway
        between Vaca Valley Parkway and Midway Road consistent with the approved
        Specific Plan.

TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT
        East of Leisure Town Internal Roadway Network. Improve and construct
         roadways to serve development east of Leisure Town Road, including but not
         limited to Hawkins Road, Elmira Road, Fry Road, and the new North-South
         Arterial.
        Midway Road Interstate 80 Interchange and Overcrossing Improvements.
         Improve the Interstate 80 freeway ramp intersections at Midway Road to
         accommodate area development, including development in the Northeast Growth
         Area. These improvements will be funded by adjacent development as a condition
         of approval, as well as the Development Impact Fee program if included in future
         updates.
        Northeast Growth Area Internal Roadway Network. Improve Midway Road,
         Weber Road, Kilkenny Road, Walnut Road, Willow Road, Byrnes Road, and
         Lewis Road to serve area development, provide connections to Orange Drive, and
         provide new internal roadways as required for local development access. These
         improvements will be funded by adjacent development as a condition of approval.
Planned Transit Improvements
As development occurs, public transit will play a larger role in the area, particularly for
commute trips within Vacaville and to and from adjoining cities. Regional and local
transit is necessary to maintain acceptable travel alternatives and achieve a balanced level
of service. Based on anticipated growth in the region, projections indicate the potential
for serious traffic congestion in the Interstate 80 corridor in the future. To effectively
reduce the rate of growth in automobile trips, and thus the need for road widening, the
Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) and other agencies encourage efforts to
enhance and better coordinate public transit.
The following transit service improvements are planned or proposed:
        Vacaville/Fairfield Multi-Modal Rail Station. Construct a new commuter rail
         station at the southeast corner of Peabody Road and Vanden Road in northeast
         Fairfield along Amtrak’s Capitol Corridor, which provides regional rail service.
         The station will be the focal point of a transit-oriented development with up to
         3,000 dwelling units within a ½-mile radius of the station. The preliminary
         design of the Fairfield/Vacaville Train Station includes a passenger platform, bus
         passenger transfer area, parking, an overpass for Peabody Road, and an underpass
         for pedestrians and bicycle users. It is anticipated that the public transit service
         will be revised to make connections to the new train station based upon ridership
         demand and available funding. The City of Fairfield is the lead agency.
        Vacaville Intermodal Station. The City of Vacaville completed the construction
         of a bus transfer facility at the corner of Ulatis Drive and Allison Drive with ten
         bus bays and a 220-vehicle parking lot in March 2011. Phase 2 of the project
         includes construction of a 400-vehicle parking garage structure adjacent to the
         intermodal station. Phase 2 is in its planning phase.

Planned Non-Motorized Transportation Improvements
The following improvements for bicycle and pedestrian transportation in Vacaville are
planned or proposed, with project status described as of fall 2013.
          Ulatis Creek Bike Path. Construct a Class I bike path along Ulatis Creek between
           Allison Drive and Interstate 80. The preliminary design and environmental
           assessment phase has been initiated.
          Elmira Road Bike Path. Construct a Class I bike path along the old Southern
           Pacific Railroad right-of-way on the north side of Elmira Road between Leisure
           Town Road and Edwin Drive. This project is in its planning and design phase, and
           is a priority project identified in the STA Countywide Bicycle Plan.
          Other Bikeways. Construct the future bikeway improvements shown in Figure
           TR-2 through conditions of approval for area development, grant funding as
           available, and/or the Development Impact Fee Program.
          Video Detection Installation. Install video detection at all City traffic signals to
           enhance bicycle and motorcycle detection, including remote viewing and fine-
           tuning of signal operations. These improvements have begun and will be on-
           going.
          Pedestrian Signal Improvements. Install audible pedestrian push buttons for
           signals in the vicinity of transit facilities and countdown pedestrian signals at all
           City-controlled traffic signals. The installation of countdown pedestrian signals
           has begun.
In addition to the improvements planned or programmed in regional and local plans,
additional capacity enhancements will be necessary to maintain established level of
service policies on City roadways to accommodate expected future growth under this
General Plan. These recommended roadway improvements are based on conditions in
2035 and are listed in Table TR-1 and shown in Figure TR-5.
Specific improvements should be identified and implemented on the basis of detailed
traffic studies. Intersection improvements may include intersection approach lane
expansions, related channelization5 improvements, traffic signal installations, and
roundabouts. Roundabouts are a relatively new intersection concept in California that
relies upon a circular traffic flow pattern and the use of yield control on each approach to
the intersection. Other intersections not identified in Table TR-1 and Figure TR-5 may
also need future improvements.
        5
          Channelization improvements include geometric changes at an intersection, such as raised islands that separate
the right-turn lane from the through traffic lane, thereby “channelizing” traffic.
                                                                                                                 TR-21

CITY OF VACAVILLE
VACAVILLE GENERAL PLAN
TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT
The Year 2035 transportation improvements discussed above and illustrated on Figure
TR-5 are based on the amount of increased levels of traffic expected to occur within the
2035 horizon year of this General Plan. Additional roadway capacity will be necessary to
accommodate growth expected to occur after the horizon year, and to maintain the City’s
established level of service policies. The full potential development of all land uses
allowed under the General Plan beyond the 2035 horizon year (i.e. buildout) is
anticipated to occur many decades in the future. Therefore, it would be premature to
identify and design specific improvements to serve this development.
However, the City must prepare for future roadway improvements (i.e. new roads,
roadway widenings, signalized intersections) necessary to support buildout of the General
Plan. One way to do this is to preserve right-of-way (ROW). Using projected traffic
generated from the development of all land uses allowed under the General Plan, the City
can plan to preserve the additional ROW necessary to accommodate future development.
Recommendations for reservation of ROW for transportation improvements needed to
support buildout of the General Plan are shown in Figure TR-6 and listed in Table TR-2.
These recommendations would provide the roadway capacity and associated ROW that
would be needed to maintain consistency with General Plan policies. These improve-
ments would be needed in addition to the improvements listed in Table TR-1 and shown
in Figure TR-5.
Goal TR-1        Work with other agencies to plan for an integrated transportation
                 network that responds to regional and local transportation needs
                 while maintaining Vacaville as a safe and pleasant place to live and
                 work.
Policies
Policy TR-P1.1       Coordinate, to the extent feasible, regional transportation system
                     improvements, specifically those on the Congestion Management
                     Program (CMP) network and Routes of Regional Significance, with
                     neighboring jurisdictions.
Policy TR-P1.2       Provide frontage roads, or parallel roadway facilities adjoining the
                     freeway, wherever possible in order to allow local traffic to avoid

Note: Final roadway alignments in the Growth Areas will be determined by Specific Plan policies and adjacent development.
Note: This map shows the ultimate right-of-way that would be needed to accomodate future improvements that would likely be necessary to serve the complete
buildout of all growth allowed under the General Plan, including growth that would be expected to take place beyond the 2035 horizon year. The map only shows
requirements beyond the 2035 improvements that were identified in Figures TR-4 and TR-5.

                  Plan (2000), or subsequent updates to the Plan for Jepson Parkway.
Actions
Action TR-A1.1    Consider the impacts of regional development on the Vacaville
                  Transportation Network by reviewing public notices for
                  development in the vicinity of Vacaville and require development
                  within Vacaville to establish its impact on the regional (CMP)
                  transportation network. Create a loop street system around the city
                  to avoid over-reliance on Interstate 80 for internal city travel.
                  Construction of the Vaca Valley Parkway Extension, Foxboro
                  Extension, California Drive Extension, and Interstate 80
                  Overcrossing projects would create the proposed loop street system.
Action TR-A1.2    Continue with the design and construction of Jepson Parkway in
                  south Vacaville and within the county between Fairfield and
                  Vacaville under the funding agreement administered by the Solano
                  Transportation Authority (STA). To the extent possible, facilitate
                  the design and construction of future segments of Jepson Parkway in
                  Vacaville.
Action TR-A1.3    Continue to support STA updates of the Congestion Management
                  Program (CMP) and other regional transportation planning efforts.
Goal TR-2      Work with Caltrans and other agencies to plan for freeway facilities
               that operate at the highest level possible.
Policies
Policy TR-P2.1    Work with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans)
                  and Solano Transportation Authority (STA) to achieve timely
                  construction of programmed freeway and interchange improvements.
Policy TR-P2.2    Work with Caltrans to consider how ramp metering is implemented
                  to regulate access to State facilities, while also considering the
                  impacts to local roadways and balancing the desire for a high level
                  of operations on Interstate 80.
Policy TR-P2.3    Encourage Caltrans to widen and upgrade Interstate 80 through
                  Vacaville. In new development areas adjoining Interstate 80 and
                  Interstate 505, require major building setbacks and offers-of-
                  dedication to permit the long-term planning and widening of the
                  freeways.

Policies
Policy TR-P3.1    Strive to maintain LOS C as the LOS goal at all intersections and
                  interchanges to facilitate the safe and efficient movement of people,
                  goods, and services. Design improvements to provide LOS C
                  conditions based on the City’s most recent 20+ year traffic forecast.
                  At unsignalized intersections, maintain an overall LOS C standard
                  with the worst approach to the intersection not exceeding LOS D.
Policy TR-P3.2    At signalized and all-way stop control intersections, LOS mid-D
                  shall be the LOS significance threshold. At two-way stop control
                  intersections, LOS mid-E shall be the LOS significance threshold on
                  the worst approach.
Policy TR-P3.3    To allow for infill development and higher density development at
                  transit centers, the LOS significance threshold shall be LOS D at
                  signalized and all-way stop control intersections in the Downtown
                  Urban High Density Residential Overlay District or other Priority
                  Development Areas (PDA) designated by the City. At two-way stop
                  controlled intersections in these areas, the overall LOS significance
                  threshold shall be LOS mid-E with the worst approach not exceeding
                  LOS E.
Policy TR-P3.4    The City may allow LOS above the established LOS significance
                  thresholds for a particular location as an interim level of service
                  where improvements are programmed by the City that will improve
                  the service to an acceptable level.
Policy TR-P3.5    The City may allow LOS above the established LOS significance
                  thresholds for a particular location on the basis of specific findings

Policy TR-P4.3    In order to ensure that adequate roadway capacity is provided for the
                  buildout of the General Plan and that new development does not
                  preclude the construction of adequate circulation facilities, require
                  all new development to provide right-of-way dedications consistent
                  with this Transportation Element (Figure TR-6).
Policy TR-P4.4    When reviewing development proposals, consider Year 2035
                  projections for fair share contributions to transportation
                  improvements (as shown in Figure TR-5) and full buildout
                  projections (beyond Year 2035) for dedication of right of way for
                  future road improvements (as shown in Figure TR-6).
Policy TR-P4.5    For locations where the LOS would exceed thresholds described in
                  Policies TR-P3.2 and TR-P3.3 without the addition of traffic from a
                  proposed development, the City may establish impact and mitigation
                  criteria based on the incremental traffic contribution from the
                  proposed development as described in Chapter 14.13 of the Land
                  Use and Development Code (Traffic Impact Mitigation Ordinance).
Policy TR-P4.6    Where future roadway widening to serve urban development occurs
                  on the Urban Growth Boundary along Kilkenny Road, roadway
                  widening shall occur on the City side of the boundary. Roadways
                  may be realigned to place urban‐serving roadways within the
                  adjacent growth areas where appropriate (e.g. Kilkenny Road).
Goal TR-5      Design and maintain arterial roadways that meet circulation and
               access needs.
Policies
Policy TR-P5.1    Design intersections on arterial roadways to meet level of service
                  standards and to avoid traffic diversion to local roadways or the
                  freeway.
Policy TR-P5.2    Locate high traffic generating uses so that they have direct access or
                  immediate secondary access to arterial roadways, while balancing
                  the need to control the number of driveways that enter arterial
                  roadways.
Policy TR-P5.3    Maintain the City’s funding system to enable completion of arterial
                  roadway and interchange capacity improvements in a timely manner
                  (Action TR-A3.3) and give appropriate priority and consideration to

Policy TR-P5.4 Maximize the carrying capacity of arterial roadways by controlling
               the number of intersections and driveways, minimizing access, and
               prohibiting direct residential access whenever possible, and by
               requiring sufficient on-site parking to meet the needs of each project.
               This includes designing parking areas so that traffic turning into the
               parking areas does not impede through traffic on the arterial
               roadway, providing acceleration and deceleration lanes, combining
               driveways to serve several small parcels, limiting appropriate
               driveways to right-in and right-out movements only,                 and
               maintaining adequate distances between driveways and intersections
               to permit efficient traffic merges.
Policy TR-P5.5 Control access to auto-oriented commercial areas by use of median
               strips and frontage roads to improve safety, maximize roadway
               capacity, and minimize traffic conflicts.
Actions
Action TR-A5.1 As funding permits, improve traffic flows on major arterial streets
               and continue to implement the coordination of traffic signals at
               major intersections and along arterial streets during daily peak travel
               periods.
Action TR-A5.2 To improve emergency vehicle response times and minimize transit
               system delays, continue to implement the emergency vehicle traffic
               signal preemption (EVP) and Transit Priority System Priority
               controls (Opticom or an approved equivalent) along major
               emergency response and transit routes. Require that the system be
               installed as part of any upgrades or signalizations triggered by new
               development along these routes.
Action TR-A5.3 Establish policies and procedures for limiting full access along
               existing and proposed arterials based on the need to maintain
               roadway capacity, limit conflicts and improve traffic safety.
Action TR-A5.4 Establish policies, procedures, and standards for implementing
               improvements that maximize carrying capacity of arterials.

Policy TR-P7.2 Require that new and existing on-street bicycle lanes be striped,
               signed, and maintained to encourage their use.
Policy TR-P7.3 Require that new development applications include transit amenities,
               such as bus stops, bus bays, transit shelters, benches, and on-site
               drop-off locations, as appropriate, or explain why these features are
               infeasible or unnecessary.
Policy TR-P7.4 Require that new development applications design roadway
               networks to accommodate transit vehicles and facilitate efficient
               transit routes.
Policy TR-P7.5 Where existing street widths or traffic volumes do not support
               creation or maintenance of striped bicycle lanes or shoulders, but
               where cyclists can be safely accommodated and other conditions
               permit, consider use of mechanisms such as “sharrows” (i.e.
               markings painted on roadways indicating that auto traffic is expected
               to share the lane with cyclists), pavement markings, or “share the
               road” signage to indicate to both drivers and bicyclists that bicycle
               use is permitted and should be expected.
Policy TR-P7.6 Require that new development applications design roadway
               networks to accommodate on-street bicycle lanes, and only allow
               bicycle routes with sharrows when on-street bicycle lanes are
               impractical or infeasible.
Policy TR-P7.7 Require that new roadway networks be designed as a grid pattern to
               reduce circuitous travel patterns and improve access and circulation
               for all modes.
Policy TR-P7.8 Prioritize transportation improvements that support and enhance
               travel by transit, bicycle, and pedestrian modes to and from
               designated Priority Development Areas (PDA).
