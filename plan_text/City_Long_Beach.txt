“Transportation systems provide one
 of the most essential human services
 and comprise a large proportion of
 our everyday urban environment.
 Although transportation is rarely
 desired for its own sake, we travel in
 order to get to work, obtain medical
 care, become better educated, and
 participate in recreational, social,
 cultural, and religious pursuits. The
 ability to access places and activities
 provides choices that are the essence
 of human freedom.”

“…It’s a matter of balance. Until a few years
 ago, our streets looked the same as they
 did 50 years ago. That’s not good business,
 to not update something in 50 years!
 We’re updating our streets to reflect the
 way people live now. And we’re designing
 a city for people, not a city for vehicles.”

Introduction

                        Broadway and 3rd Street Protected Bikeway
                        In April 2011, the City of Long Beach installed two 1-way cycle tracks on Broadway and 3rd Streets, as a Federal
                        Highway Administration (FHWA) demonstration project to increase bicycle ridership and public safety. The project
                        provides one-way bikeways along the left side of each street, separated from traffic by a parking lane and a raised
                        curb. One traffic lane was removed to accommodate the protected bike lane. Traffic signals were also modified at
                        most intersections to provide bicycle signals and left turn arrows for vehicle traffic. The results from the “before”
                        and 12-month “after” study on pedestrian, bicycle, and motor vehicle conditions reveal positive outcomes for all
                        modes. Implementation of the protected bikeway project on 3rd and Broadway resulted in a 33% overall increase in
                        the number of bicyclists using the two streets. At the same time there has been a nearly 60% decrease in the total
                        number of bike- and pedestrian-related collisions, and a 30% decrease in the number of bicyclists on the sidewalk.
                        In addition, vehicle traffic volumes and speeds are down since project implementation.

                   Manage Traffic, Manage Expectations, and Improve Efficiency
                   Historically, most cities — including Long Beach — have used a functional street classification system to plan and design
                   street improvements. In this type of system, the vehicle capacity of the roadway has been the primary consideration
                   when it comes to planning and designing streets.
                   Today, many communities are switching to a context-sensitive street classification system which categorizes streets
                   into a hierarchy based on function and community context. Under this system, the street classification considers all
                   road users — not just automobiles — as well as the character of adjacent properties and buildings.
                   By using a context-sensitive approach, the City of Long Beach plans to address the function of the street, neighborhood
                   character, and the needs of all mobility users. This approach lends itself to a more balanced mobility system that also
                   integrates land use and urban design objectives for better place-making.

                   The First and Last Mile
                   Many commuters confront a barrier in
                   their daily commute known as the first-
                   or last-mile problem. This occurs when a
                   commuter cannot easily or conveniently
                   access the transit stop or station nearest
                   to the starting point or final destination
                   of their commute, due to distance,
                   terrain, or pedestrian safety issues.
                   If the bus stop or train station is too far,
                   if getting there is considered unsafe,
                   inconvenient, or too time-consuming,
                   most people will choose to drive
                   rather than take public transit. Offering
                   workable solutions, such as bicycling
                   and shuttle services, that help people
                   traverse this first or last mile increases
                   the likelihood that residents will leave

                Maximizing Our Precious Parking Resources
Context
                Historically, parking problems have been addressed by building additional parking facilities. As land becomes limited
                and the cost of building parking facilities soars, this approach is becoming much less feasible. Rather than adding more
                parking, the City of Long Beach is working to better manage existing parking resources through a range of strategies:
                »» Sharing the parking facilities of businesses within a district.
                »» Dedicating the most convenient spaces for priority users.
                »» Providing parking access and information signs so that motorists can easily find available parking locations.
                »» Using pricing strategies to influence travel and parking behavior.
                »» Using valet parking systems.
                »» Using automated parking systems to reduce the amount of land needed to meet parking demands.
                Partnerships between Long Beach Transit and business associations or other entities can provide transit passes to
                employees or other participants to use transit rather than driving, thereby leaving parking spaces for others, such as
                shoppers. This is underway at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB) and Belmont Shore.
                As a result of these strategies, parking spaces attain a higher value and are used more efficiently. This leads to less demand
                on parking, as well as less need for parking spaces to serve particular areas. The City has already seen the success of
                these parking management strategies in several areas, including Downtown Long Beach and Belmont Shore.

    (I-710) links the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles
    to major Southern California distribution centers and
    intermodal rail facilities. An essential component of the
    regional, statewide, and national transportation system,
    it serves both passenger and goods movement vehicles.
    An Environmental Impact Report is currently being
    recirculated to analyze possible improvement alternatives
    for the I-710 corridor between the Ports of Long Beach and
    Los Angeles and the Pomona Freeway (SR-60). The project
    will generally include freeway widening, freight corridor,
    and arterial system improvements.

                      Table 4: Context-Sensitive Street Classification System Definitions
                                                 Designed for intraregional and intercommunity mobility, these corridors emphasize traffic movement and include signalized
                         Regional Corridor       pedestrian crossings. The adjacent land uses should provide continuous mixed-use and commercial land uses with adequate
                                                 off-street parking to minimize dependency on on-street parking.
                                                 Characterized by a long-distance, medium-speed corridor that traverses an urbanized area, boulevards consist of four or fewer
                                                 vehicle travel lanes, a balanced multimodal function, landscaped medians, on-street parking, narrower travel lanes, more intensive
                                                 land use oriented to the street, and wide sidewalks. Buildings uniformly line the edges.
                             Boulevard
                                                 Multiway boulevards, a variation of the boulevard characteristic of post war neighborhoods, contain a central roadway for through-
                                                 traffic and parallel roadways for access to abutting property parking, and pedestrian and bicycle facilities. Parallel roadways are
                                                 separated from the through-lane by curbed, landscaped islands that may also provide transit stops and pedestrian facilities.
                                                 A major avenue serves as the major route for the movement of traffic within the City as well as a connector to neighboring cities.
                                                 Most traffic using a major avenue will end the trip within the City (as opposed to through-traffic). As such, design treatment and
                           Major Avenue
                                                 traffic operation should give preference to this type of traffic. Long corridors with typically four or more lanes, avenues may be high-
                                                 transit ridership corridors. Goods movement is typically limited to local routes and deliveries.
                                                 A minor avenue provides for the movement of traffic to neighborhood activity centers and serves as a route between neighborhoods.
                           Minor Avenue
                                                 Avenues serve as a primary bicycle route and may serve local transit routes as well.
                           Neighborhood          A neighborhood connector street serves trips generated in surrounding or adjacent neighborhoods, and should discourage
                            Connector            through-trips that do not end within the neighborhood. Goods movement is restricted to local deliveries only.
                                                 Local streets primarily provide access to individual residential parcels. The streets are generally two lanes with on-street parking, tree
                            Local Street         planting strips, and sidewalks. Traffic on a local street should have a trip end on that street, or on a connecting local street,
                                                 or to a connector.

                      Pedestrian safety has always been and will continue to be the

                      priority areas already deemed walkable, the City will continue
                      to maintain and improve the street design with additional
                      enhancements. At the same time, the City plans to improve
                      other areas not yet established as walkable to enhance the
                      pedestrian experience and encourage more walking. Over
                      time, these areas will become more walkable districts.

    From Pavement to Plazas
    Streets and other public rights-of-way make up over 20% of the City’s land area. Long Beach has its share of excessively
    wide streets that contain large zones of wasted space, especially at intersections with lower traffic volume. The “Pavement
    to Plazas” concept seeks to temporarily reclaim these unused swaths of roadway and turn them into small public plazas.
    Reclaiming this wasted space is a fairly simple process: paint or treat the asphalt, place protective barriers along the
    periphery, install moveable planters, tables, and chairs — and suddenly you have an attractive, safe gathering space
    for people to enjoy.
    Transforming these dead zones into parklets is also relatively easy to do. Small spaces for people to relax, drink a cup
    of coffee, eat a meal, and enjoy the city around them; parklets are created by building a platform in the parking lane
    of a street. This continues the grade of the sidewalk out into the parking lane. On the platform, benches, planters,
    landscaping, bike parking, and café tables and chairs all come together to provide a welcoming new public space.
    Making these changes does not typically require large outlays of capital. And the benefits far outweigh the costs: better
    street life, additional space for businesses, more green space to filter stormwater pollution, and more enjoyment for
    the people who live and work nearby.

    way to access transit corridors, the enhanced network will

                      Ranking Bicycle-Friendly Communities
Mobility Plan
                      Across the nation, bicycle-friendly towns share a common goal: to improve the quality of life for individuals and families
                      by promoting bicycling. They also share a common ranking system defined by the Bicycle-Friendly Community Program.
                      Developed to evaluate the bicycle infrastructure and programs of communities, this program assigns rankings of
                      Platinum, Gold, Silver, or Bronze to communities based on criteria known as the 5 Es:
                      »» Engineering  »  Education   »  Encouragement  »  Enforcement  »  Evaluation and Planning
                      Engineering
                      This refers to the actual bicycle infrastructure built to promote bicycling in the community: accommodation of bicyclists
                      on public roads and the existence of both well-designed bike lanes and multiuse paths in the community.
                      Education
                      Communities’ efforts to educate bicyclists and motorists are considered in their ranking. Education includes teaching
                      bicyclists of all ages how to ride safely on multiuse paths and congested city streets, as well as teaching motorists how
                      to share the road safely with bicyclists.
                      The following aspects are evaluated: the availability of bicycling education for adults and children, the number of League
                      Cycling Instructors in the community, and ways that safety information is distributed to both bicyclists and motorists
                      in the community, including bike maps and tip sheets.
                      Encouragement
                      This category concentrates on how the community promotes and encourages bicycling. Good promotional measures
                      include “Bike Month” and “Bike to Work Week” events, as well as community bike maps, route finding signage, community
                      bike rides, commuter incentive programs, and the presence of a Safe Routes to School Program.
                      Additional strategies and initiatives designed to promote bicycling or a bicycling culture may include: off-road facilities,
                      BMX parks, velodromes, and the availability of both road and mountain bicycling clubs.
                      Enforcement
                      The enforcement category measures the connections between the bicycling and law enforcement communities. Areas
                      examined include: the presence of a law enforcement liaison who interfaces with the bicycling community; the bicycle
                      divisions of the law enforcement or public safety communities; use of targeted enforcement to encourage bicyclists
                      and motorists to share the road safely; and the existence of bicycling-related laws such as penalties for failing to yield
                      to a bicyclist while turning or penalties for motorists that “door” bicyclists.
                      Evaluation and Planning
                      As part of the ranking process, the program evaluates communities’ current programs and future bicycle plans. Criteria
                      measured include the amount of bicycling taking place in the community, the crash and fatality rates, and ways that
                      the community works to improve these numbers.
                      How Does Long Beach Rank?
                      The City of Long Beach is currently designated as a Silver Level Bicycle-Friendly Community, the third-highest ranking
                      level in the program. Portland, Ore., is the largest city in the nation with a Platinum rating.36

    Taking Transit to the Next Level

    Transit plays, and will continue to play, a critical role in the
    City’s overall transportation system. In the City of Long
    Beach, planners face limited opportunities to widen streets
    and intersections to accommodate more vehicles. As such,
    transit will have an increasing role in the mobility of people
    living and working in the City. Transit also provides mobility
    for all people who — regardless of age, income, ability, or
    preference — do not have access to a car.
    One of the primary goals of this Mobility Plan is the
    increased use of transit as a more viable option for both              Providing an inviting and comfortable environment at

       Streetcars Make a Comeback
       In our quest to resolve Long Beach’s current and future transportation issues, the City may do well to look to our past. Long
       Beach once had a well-developed network of electric street car lines. In fact, in 1927 over 30 miles of tracks connected
       our City’s neighborhoods and districts. After World War II, the lines were dismantled and gradually replaced by bus transit.
       As the projected population of Long Beach is expected to increase, streetcars or other high-capacity people movers may
       offer a viable option to meet transportation needs. Primary transit streets with high ridership that connect to employment
       centers and tourist destinations would be the favored candidates for streetcar or people-mover systems. It’s interesting how
       concepts from the past can also inspire ideas for the future.

                Putting Our Mobility Plan Into Action
“Any city for better or worse is constantly
 undergoing physical changes brought about by
 natural, social, or economic forces. These changes
 are inevitable. If they are anticipated and fitted
 into a logical pattern and relationship to each
 other, the city will improve. Conversely, if changes
 are permitted to occur without following a plan
 there are bound to be conflicts and waste.
 In itself, the Master Plan cannot improve or
 change the city in the slightest degree. Only
 when its proposals and recommendations
 are translated into action resulting in physical
 improvements such as streets and highways,
 residences, stores, factories, parks, and other
 amenities will the true value of the plan
 become evident.”

               Appendix                 7
In great cities, spaces as well as
places are designed and built:
walking, witnessing, being in public,
are as much part of the design and
purpose as is being inside to eat,
sleep, make shoes or love or music.
The word citizen has to do with
cities, and the ideal city is organized
around citizenship — around
participation in public life.

2013-2021 Housing Element

                                                                            INTRODUCTION
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Community Context
First incorporated in 1888, Long Beach is a progressive urban community of 462,000
residents located in the South Bay region of Los Angeles County. The City is home to the
world renowned Port of Long Beach, a rejuvenated and thriving downtown, major
employers, tourist attractions, a State University and over 60 residential neighborhoods,
incorporating 17 historic districts and over 150 local neighborhood and business
organizations.
Long Beach benefits significantly from strong employment and educational institutions.
The City’s economy is expanding as the region’s economic base continues to shift from
manufacturing industries to an information-based economy built around higher technology,
a more skilled and educated labor force, and venture capital investments. To facilitate this
transition, new housing opportunities are needed to accommodate the newly emerging
workforce.
Long Beach has a highly diverse resident population and is a community where no single
race or ethnic group is the absolute majority. This is largely due to the former status of the
City as a preeminent west coast naval base and the influx of foreign-born immigrants from
the 1970’s through the present. This diversity is also reflected in age groups, special needs
populations and household types. Such diversity manifests itself with significant housing
implications, as housing needs and preferences commonly vary by age of residents,
household type, and cultural practice, among other factors.
With over 176,000 housing units, Long Beach offers a range of housing opportunities
varying from single-family homes, mobile homes and moderate-density courtyard
apartments and town homes, to higher-density condominium and apartment buildings.
Future housing growth will be focused in the downtown and greater downtown, along major
transit corridors, and within close proximity to major employment and activity centers.
Through the Long Beach Community Investment Company (formerly the Long Beach
Housing Development Company), the City will continue to be active in preserving and
creating affordable housing opportunities for its residents.
Although the Long Beach economy has improved over the last decade, the improvement
has been uneven. Residents in some areas have high levels of housing overcrowding and
overpayment. Certain neighborhoods also have a high percentage of older housing units.
As housing stock ages, neighborhood preservation and improvement continues to be a
significant concern.
Therefore, Long Beach faces several challenges over the 2013-2021 planning period of the
Housing Element. These challenges include ensuring the quality and affordability of the
housing stock, ensuring that suitable housing is available for persons of all economic
segments, directing reinvestment in lower income areas, assisting individuals and families

with special housing needs, and meeting the needs of a diversifying community. This
Housing Element sets forth policies and programs to address these and other identified
housing needs.
B. Organization of the Housing Element
This Housing Element covers an eight year planning period from October 15, 2013 to
October 15, 2021. The current Housing Element planning period was originally set for July
1, 2008 through June 30, 2014, but was amended to end on October 15, 2013 pursuant to
SB 375 (Steinberg). The Housing Element identifies policies, programs and objectives that
focus on the following issues: 1) conserving and improving existing affordable housing; 2)
providing adequate sites for new housing; 3) assisting in the development of affordable
housing; 4) removing governmental constraints to housing development; and 5) promoting
equal housing opportunities for Long Beach’s population. The Housing Element consists of
the following:
     A description of the community outreach effort, community comments and a
          response to this input. (Section I and Appendix A);
     An analysis of the City’s demographic, household and housing characteristics to
          help identify the community’s housing needs (Section II);
     A review of potential market, governmental, and environmental constraints to
          meeting the City’s identified housing needs (Section III);
     An evaluation of the land, financial, and administrative resources available to
          address Long Beach’s housing needs (Section IV);
     A statement of the Housing Plan to address the City’s identified housing needs,
          including housing goals, policies and programs (Section V);
     A summary of community comments received at public forums on the Housing
          Element (Appendix A).
C. Data Sources and Methods
Various sources of information were used to prepare the Housing Element. The 2010
Census provides the basis for population and household characteristics. Several data
sources were used to supplement the 2010 Census as follows:
     Detailed population and demographic data are provided by the American Community
          Surveys (ACS);
     Housing market information, such as home sales, rents, and vacancies, is updated
          by City records and property tax assessor files;

     Public and nonprofit agencies are consulted for data on special needs groups, the
          services available to them, and gaps in the system; and
     Lending patterns for home purchase and home improvement loans are provided
          through the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) database.
D. Public Participation
The City of Long Beach recognizes the importance of public participation in helping shape
the City’s housing strategy for the next eight years. As part of this Housing Element
development, the City’s public participation program included the following:
1. Community Meetings
The City conducted three community meetings to solicit input on housing needs, the most
underserved groups in the community, and appropriate locations/types of new housing:
     Saturday, March 23, 2013, 10:00 am to 12:00 noon, Houghton Park Community
          Center
     Wednesday, April 24, 2013, 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm, Mark Twain Library
     Saturday, April 27, 2013, 10:00 am to 12:00 noon, Stearns Park Community Room
The community meetings were advertised on the City’s website and direct invitations to the
meetings were sent via emails to individuals, organizations, and agencies that had
previously expressed interest in housing and community development matters in the City.
The email list contains over 1,000 addresses. Comments received are documented in
Appendix A and summarized below.

5. Consolidated Plan/Annual Action Plan
In 2012, the City updated its five-year Consolidated Plan for the use of Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnership (HOME), and
Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) funds to address the City’s housing and community
development needs. As part of that process, the City conducted an extensive public
participation programs to solicit input on housing needs and ideas for programs and
activities to be funded over the next five years.
Specifically, the City held a series of three community workshops and public meetings on
March 27, 2012, April 24, 2012, and May 23, 2012, to provide opportunities for community
input on the Consolidated Plan. The City publicized these workshops by publishing notices
in Long Beach Press Telegram (English), Impacto USA (Spanish), and Angkor Borei
(Khmer), posting flyers on City website, and sending email blasts to over 2,000 individuals
and organizations that had previously expressed interest in the City’s housing and
community development programs. Public hearings held by the Community Development
Advisory Commission on April 18 and June 20, 2012, and a City Council meeting held on
July 10, 2012 provided residents a final opportunity to comment on the Plan prior to
adoption and submittal to HUD.
Several recurring comments were expressed by residents during the community outreach
meetings:
     Job creation/retention and business assistance are important investments.
     Foundational assistance such as affordable housing and neighborhood
          improvements are critical to creating a decent living environment.
     Taking care of the youth, providing services and assistance give positive direction to
          youth eliminates a lot of issues and have long-lasting impact.
     Shelter for the homeless is needed, particularly for victims of domestic violence.
     Emphasis on central homeless services that provide various services to the
          homeless.
In addition, the City conducted a Housing and Community Development Needs Survey. A
total of 325 responses were received. Among the various housing needs in the City,
residents identified the following as top housing-related issues:
     Rehabilitation Assistance for Homeowners
     Affordable Rental Housing
     Rehabilitation Assistance for Rental Housing
     Code Enforcement
     Housing for Victims of Domestic Violence
     Housing for Seniors
     Housing for Disabled
     Homeless Shelters for Homeless

     Housing for Substance Abuse
The comments received during the Housing Element update process were consistent with
input received for Consolidated Plan. In crafting the Housing Element programs and
policies, the Consolidated Plan was consulted.
E. Relationship to Other General Plan Chapters
The 2013-2021 Housing Element is a chapter of the Long Beach General Plan. The
General Plan is currently being updated in an effort called Long Beach 2030 whereby new
land use, mobility, urban design, historic preservation and sustainability components are
being written. Meanwhile, the existing General Plan consists of the following 12 chapters:
1) Land Use; 2) Mobility; 3) Housing; 4) Open Space; 5) Conservation; 6) Noise; 7) Local
Coastal Program; 8) Seismic Safety; 9) Air Quality; 10) Public Safety; 11) Scenic Routes;
and 12) Historic Preservation. This Housing Element builds upon the other General Plan
chapters and the policies and programs set forth herein remain consistent with the goals,
policies and objectives of the entire General Plan.
The 2013-2021 Housing Element does not propose significant change to any other chapter
of the City’s adopted General Plan. As portions of the General Plan are amended in the
future, the Housing Element will be reviewed along with other elements to ensure internal
consistency is maintained. Pursuant to SB 162, the City has reviewed and updated its
Land Use and Safety Elements to address flood hazards and management.
F. Relationship to City’s Strategic Plan
The City adopted the Long Beach 2010 Strategic Plan in June of 2000. The goals, policies
and objectives of the Strategic Plan are incorporated into this Housing Element by
reference, they include:
     Build a strong network of healthy neighborhoods in Long Beach;
     Strengthen community leadership, collaboration and stewardship, and increase
          public participation;
     Create healthy neighborhoods where diversity is celebrated, arts and cultural
          programs flourish, services are accessible, and all people have tools to improve the
          quality of their lives;
     Support neighborhood efforts to create beauty and pride by removing blight and
          providing high-quality and well-maintained public infrastructure, parks and public

II. HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Assuring the availability of decent and affordable housing for residents of all social and
economic groups is an important goal for Long Beach. To that end, this section of the
Housing Element analyzes important population and housing characteristics to identify the
City’s specific housing needs. Important characteristics to consider include:
     Demographic issues of age, race/ethnicity and employment
     Household type, age and income
     Special housing needs present in the community
     Housing type, cost, condition and affordability; and
     Evaluation of the City’s share of the region’s housing needs.
As a result of this analysis, this section will clarify the type and extent of housing needs of
residents in Long Beach. Moreover, this evaluation will also serve as the basis for the
City’s goals, policies and programs detailed in the Housing Plan (Chapter V) that will be
implemented over the 2013-2021 planning period of the Housing Element.
A. Population Characteristics
Population characteristics affect the type and amount of housing need in a community.
Issues such as population growth, age characteristics, race/ethnicity and employment
trends combine to influence the type of housing needed and ability to afford housing. This
section details the various population characteristics affecting housing needs.
1. Population Trends
Currently, the City of Long Beach is the fifth largest city in the State of California. The past
fifty years have seen extensive growth, with population increasing from approximately
250,000 persons in 1950 to over 462,000 by the Year 2010. Over this period, Long Beach
has experienced several cycles of growth – each bringing with it changes in population
characteristics that affect housing need. Table 2 summarizes population changes in Long
Beach over the past fifty years.
The first population growth cycle – the World War II era – was characterized by significant
growth. From the 1950’s through 1960’s, the expansion of U.S. Naval operations and the
emergence of the aerospace and defense industries in Long Beach provided the stimuli for
significant economic and population growth. As a result, the City’s population increased
significantly, from approximately 251,000 in 1950 to a peak of 344,000 by 1960 – a total of
37% over the decade.
The 1960s and 1970s were characterized by more modest population growth. Population
increased 2.5% each decade, rising from 344,000 in 1960 to 361,000 persons by 1980.
This period of stability was related to the emergence of suburban communities around the
City, the relocation of the navy, the decline in federal contracts for the aerospace industry,

                                                                  HOUSING RESOURCES
and the economic decline of the downtown. Without job growth, housing demand and
population growth was minimal.
The 1980s signaled a return of rapid population growth. From 1980 to 1990, population
increased 19% from 361,000 to 429,000. In particular, between 1984 and 1988, the City’s
population increased 2.5% annually – growing more than the previous 24-year period
(1960-1984). This unprecedented growth was fueled by high rates of immigration into Long
Beach and an increase in the fertility rates. Employment growth in the region also
contributed to population growth.
The population growth boom of the 1980s eventually slowed. Significant federal cutbacks
in defense budgets, the shut down of shipbuilding and naval facilities, and reduction in the
aerospace workforce downsized the defense industry in Long Beach. Meanwhile, the real
estate market depression in the 1990s coupled with economic restructuring also dampened
housing demand. As a result, housing construction and population growth slowed
considerably during the 1990s.
The City’s population, according to the 2010 Census, was estimated at 462,257 persons.
This represents an increase of less than one percent from 2000, reflecting a relatively
stagnant economy between 2006 and 2010.

2. Age Characteristics
Housing demand is affected by the age characteristics of residents in a community.
Different age groups are often distinguished by important differences in lifestyle, family
type, housing preferences and income levels. Because the community’s housing needs
change over time, this section analyzes changes in the age distribution of Long Beach
residents and how these changes affect housing need. Table 3 summarizes various trends
in age characteristics of Long Beach residents.
As illustrated in Table 3, the City’s population under age 18 has increased slightly over the
past three decades from 23% in 1980 to 25% in 2010. Meanwhile, Long Beach’s share of
college age (18-24 years) residents has declined from 15% in 1980 to 12% in 2010. Both

the number and relative proportion of middle age residents have increased in Long Beach
since 1990. The proportion of seniors (age 65+) in the City has steadily decreased over
time. However, given the City’s large number of middle age residents, Long Beach’s senior
population will likely grow significantly over the coming decade.

3. Race and Ethnicity
Currently, Long Beach is considered to be the most ethnically diverse major city in the
United States. As previously noted, during the 1970s and 1980s, Long Beach was the
destination for thousands of immigrants fleeing wars and political turmoil in Southeast Asia,
especially from Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines. These migrants were followed by
other in-migrants from various Latin American countries. During the 1980s, the City’s
foreign-born population doubled to over 100,000 persons, with the majority of the
immigrants coming from Mexico and Central America. The arrival of large numbers of
Asian and Latin American immigrants in Long Beach quickly transformed the City from
what had previously been a predominantly White community into a truly multi-ethnic society
where there is no major ethnicity.
Table 4 displays the racial/ethnic composition of Long Beach’s population in 1980 to 2010.
During these three decades, the White population declined from 68% to 29% of the total
population, while the Hispanic population more than tripled in number, increasing from 14%
to 41%. Similarly, the number of Asian residents more than doubled, increasing from 6% in
1980 to 13% by 2010. The proportion of African- American residents also exhibited a
modest increase, from 11% to 13% of the population.
Long Beach has effectively become a “starter community” for many new immigrants; a
place where they begin the critical process of acculturation. In 2010, 27% of the City’s
residents were foreign-born, which translates to approximately 124,000 foreign-born
residents. Approximately one-third of this population entered the United States after 1990,
indicating a relatively new immigrant population. Recent immigrants, with their limited
resources, often face difficulties in acquiring adequate housing as they adjust to their new
surroundings and obtain employment.

    * Note: The 2000 Census introduced a new category “two or more races” that was not a component of earlier censuses.

            accounted for in another category.
Concentrations of Racial and Ethnic Groups in Long Beach
While Long Beach as a whole is an ethnically diverse community, patterns of ethnic
concentration are present within particular areas. Areas with concentrations of minority
residents may have different needs, particularly in areas where recent immigrants tend to
reside. A concentration is defined as a Census block group with a proportion of minority
residents greater than that of the countywide average. Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3
illustrate the concentrations of Hispanic, African-American and Asian residents in Long
Beach by census tract, respectively.
As Figure 1 shows, concentrations of Hispanic residents are evident in numerous Long
Beach neighborhoods, including the majority of Central Long Beach, Downtown, and North
Long Beach, and to a lesser degree the Westside. Although Hispanic residents have
always been present in Long Beach, during the 1990s they supplanted Whites as the City’s
largest racial/ethnic community (See Table 4). In some respects, the City is the final
‘frontier’ being settled by a flow of Latinos moving southward along the Los Angeles River
from their traditional East Los Angeles core through the Gateway Cities sub-region. This
movement has culturally transformed cities located closer to its source, such as Huntington
Park, Bell, Bell Gardens, and Cudahy, which are now populated almost entirely by
Hispanics. Many of these migrants to Long Beach – many recently arrived in the United
States and characteristically young families having low incomes, few linguistic or
educational skills, and limited employment – have settled in many of the same Long Beach
neighborhoods once occupied by Cambodians and African-Americans.
The majority of neighborhoods with a concentration of Hispanic residents also exhibit
concentrations of African-American residents (Figure 2). The African-American community
in Long Beach was traditionally located just northeast of Downtown in the vicinity of the
Pacific Coast campus of the Long Beach City College at the intersection of the Pacific
Coast Highway and Alamitos. Since this location was one housing mainly lower income

households in the mid-1970s, it soon attracted the impoverished Cambodians beginning to
arrive in the City. As the numbers of Cambodians continued to grow, they gradually
displaced African-American residents, who relocated first to the periphery of their original
community, then to the City’s upper West Side, and increasingly to various portions in
North Long Beach.
Figure 3 illustrates the extent of concentrations of Asian residents. Long Beach’s Filipino
population traditionally settled in the West Side near the naval facilities. As Filipino
residents acculturated and become more affluent, they have expanded across the Los
Angeles River into the Wrigley neighborhood. The City’s highest concentration of
Cambodians has historically been at the Anaheim/Cherry Avenue core, and has now
spread out into the neighborhoods surrounding this core. More recently, Cambodians have
also begun relocating to apartments in North Long Beach.

4. Employment Market
The Long Beach-Los Angeles metropolitan region, like other metropolitan areas across the
southland, underwent significant economic changes during the 1990s. Base closures,
defense industry layoffs, a slowdown in the manufacturing and construction sectors and
rising levels of unemployment characterized the regional economy through the early 1990s.
During 2000, Long Beach’s unemployment rate was 5.7% according to the Employment
Development Department Labor Market data. During the Great Recession of the late
2000s, the City’s unemployment rate increased to over 10.2% in 2009 and peaked at
12.3% in 2010 (State Economic Development Department). The City’s unemployment rate
has improved since, yet remains above 10%, as of January 2013.

The types of jobs held by residents of Long Beach have changed noticeably from 1980 to
2011 (Table 5). Between 1980 and 2011, the proportion of residents employed in Service
and Managerial/Professional occupations increased substantially, while those employed in
Production and Operator/Fabricator/Labor occupations decreased.
Changing employment patterns impact housing needs. From 1980 to 2011, the 83%
increase in managerial and professional positions suggests that income levels are
increasing for a certain segment of the population. However, the increase in lower wage
service jobs also indicates that a significant portion of Long Beach residents are earning
lower incomes. These employment trends indicate a polarization of income levels among
residents.

Change in Employment Base
Table 6 details changes in Long Beach’s employment base between 1990 and 2011.
During this time period, increases in annual average employment rates in Los Angeles
County and the City were comparable (approximately 1.3% and 1.2%, respectively).
During this period, the arts/entertainment/recreation and accommodation/food services
sectors experienced the most growth (a 39% increase). Conversely, the information
employment sector saw the largest decline (at 18%).
Currently, the educational/health/social services, technology/manufacturing, and
trade/tourism sectors form the core of Long Beach’s economy. Approximately 23% of the
City’s labor force is employed in educational/health/social services, 12% work in the
professional/scientific/management sector, and 11% work in each of the following sectors:
manufacturing, retail trade, arts/entertainment/recreation, and accommodation/food
services.
Between 2000 and 2011, the City added a net total of 24,800 jobs. However, most of these
new jobs were created in relatively lower-paying employment sectors. Job loss was
greatest in the manufacturing (-3,275) and information (-1,109) sectors.
According to the California Employment Development Department, the Los Angeles/Long
Beach/Glendale Metropolitan Statistical Area is projected to see a 16% growth in jobs
between 2010 and 2020. Business/Financial and Management occupations are expected
to increase 19% and 11%, respectively. The largest increases, however, are expected to
occur in the relatively lower-wage Healthcare Support, Personal Care/Service, and Food
Prep/Service occupations (25% each).

B. Household Characteristics
Household composition, income, and other characteristics determine the type of housing
needed by residents. The following sections discuss household and housing stock
characteristics affecting housing needs in Long Beach, as well as the housing problems
experienced by the City’s residents.
1. Household Type
A household is defined as all persons living in a housing unit. Families are a subset of
households and include those persons living together that are related by blood, marriage,
or adoption. A single person living alone is also a household, but a household does not
include persons in group quarters or dormitories. Other nonfamily households are
unrelated people residing in the same dwelling unit, such as roommates.

The 2010 Census reported 163,351 households in Long Beach, with an average household
size of 2.8 persons. The composition of households is illustrated in Figure 5. The majority
of households were families (61%); single persons comprised the second largest group at
28% of households. “Other” households, which include unrelated persons living together,
comprised the remaining 11%.

The number of total households and average household size in the City remained
essentially unchanged from the previous decade. The proportion of family households in
Long Beach also remained steady at 61%. However, from 2000 to 2010, the distribution of
family households did change noticeably. Since 2000, the proportion of families with
children decreased by 11%, while the proportion of families without children increased by
14%. Meanwhile, during that same time period, the number of single-person households
decreased by three percent and the number of other non-families increased substantially
by 17%. Non-family households are comprised of members not related to the heads of
households; this includes roommates and two families sharing housing arrangements..

2. Household Size
Another important housing characteristic affecting housing need is household size (Table
8). The average household size in Long Beach remained unchanged (at 2.8 persons per
household) from 2000 to 2010. The average family size in the City also stayed the same at
3.5 persons.2 Household size did vary by race/ethnicity, however. Hispanic and Asian
households had larger average household sizes than the citywide average (3.7 and 3.2
respectively). Hispanic and Asian households also had larger average family sizes at 4.2
and 3.8, respectively, than the citywide average.

Differences in household size, race/ethnicity, and householder age suggest that persons in
different life stages and cultures may have different housing needs. For instance, a high
proportion of large Asian and Hispanic households may indicate that overcrowding or
overpayment are issues in a community.

     A household is an occupied housing unit and includes all persons residing in that unit. A household can consist of a
     single person, a family, multiple families, unrelated individuals living together, and any combination of these groups.

3. Household Income
Household income is the most important factor affecting housing opportunity, determining a
family’s ability to balance housing costs with basic necessities of life. Income levels can
vary considerably among households, based upon tenure, household type, location of
residence, and race/ethnicity among other factors.
According to the 2007-2011 ACS, households in Long Beach earned a median household
income of $52,945 – below the $56,266 median household income for Los Angeles County.
The median family income in Long Beach ($60,179) was also below the County’s family
median income of $62,595. Approximately 22% of Long Beach households earned less
than $25,000, and approximately 45% earned less than $50,000.
Southern California has some of the most expensive housing in the nation. But, many of
the workers who make up the diverse fabric of Long Beach earn limited incomes and suffer
from a number of housing problems. Table 9 shows some of the more common
occupations in Long Beach and the income levels associated with these jobs in the Los
Angeles/Long Beach metropolitan area.

To facilitate the analysis of income distribution among households in communities, the
State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) groups households into
categories by income. Income categories are determined as a percentage of the Area
Median Income (AMI) and then adjusted for household size in the following manner:
      Extremely Low Income - less than 30% of the AMI
      Very Low Income - between 31% and 50% of the AMI
      Low Income - between 51% and 80% of the AMI
      Moderate Income - between 81% and 120% of the AMI
      Above Moderate Income - greater than 120% of the AMI
Collectively, extremely low, very low, and low income households are referred to as lower
income households (up to 80% AMI).

The 2010 Census does not collect information on the number of households belonging to
each of the income categories described above. However, household income data was
tabulated by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) using the 2005-
2009 ACS (Table 10). As shown below, between 2005 and 2009, approximately 44% of
the City’s households earned lower incomes, while approximately 56% earned moderate or
above moderate incomes.

Household Income by Race/Ethnicity
Although aggregate information on income levels is useful for looking at trends over time or
comparing income levels for different jurisdictions, income levels may also vary significantly
by household type, size, and race/ethnicity.
Race/ethnicity is a characteristic that is often linked to housing need because income often
varies by race/ethnicity. As shown in Table 11, Whites had the lowest proportion of lower
income households (23%). By contrast, Hispanics (44%) and Blacks (42%) were much
more likely to be lower income. Because lower income households have less income for
housing, tradeoffs in expenditures to afford other living essentials may result in a greater
incidence of overpayment and/or overcrowding for these households.

4. Special Needs Groups
Certain segments of the population have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable
housing due to special circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to one's
employment and income, family characteristics, disability, and household characteristics
among others. As a result, certain groups within Long Beach may experience a higher
prevalence of lower income, overpayment, overcrowding, or other housing problems.
These “special needs” households include large households, seniors, single-parent
households, persons with disabilities, people living in poverty, farmworkers, and the
homeless. Because Long Beach is home to two City Colleges and a State University, the
City also hosts a large number of college students. Table 12 summarizes the special needs
groups in Long Beach.

Large Households
Large households consist of five or more persons. These households are considered a
special needs population due to the limited availability of affordable adequately sized
housing for this group. The lack of large units is especially evident among rental units in
Long Beach. Large households often live in overcrowded conditions, due to both the lack
of large enough units and insufficient income to afford available units of adequate size.

According to the 2010 Census, approximately 26,178 large households reside in Long
Beach, representing 16% of all households in the City. Of these large households, the
majority (57%) are renters. According to CHAS data shown in Table 25 on page 53, the
majority of these large renter-households (79%) earned lower incomes. CHAS data also
indicates that 89% of the City’s large renter-households suffer from one or more housing
problems, including housing overpayment, overcrowding and/or substandard housing
conditions.
Census data further documents the mismatch between the demand for larger rental units
and the City’s supply of these units. In general, an appropriately sized dwelling unit for a
large household will have three or more bedrooms. Approximately 12,591 rental units in
Long Beach contain three or more bedrooms. The City, however, is home to 26,178 large
renter-households – twice the number that can be accommodated by the City’s current
stock of large rental units. This imbalance between supply and demand contributes to 16%
of the City’s large renter-households residing in overcrowded conditions.
Resources Available
Large households in Long Beach can benefit from a range of services provided by the City
and local agencies. The City’s Department of Health and Human Services operates the
Center for Families and Youth, which offers a variety of family support programs, including
job training/employment, developmental services, housing assistance, and child care. In
addition, the Central Facilities Center serves the community by providing childcare services
and public health services. The Center also links residents directly to a range of services
offered by local nonprofit agencies. These services include counseling, education, youth
programming and nutritional and health services. Agencies offering programs and services
at the Center include: Helpline Youth Counseling; Inc.; LBUSD Child Development Center;
Women, Infants & Children; United Cambodian Community; First 5 LA; A New Way of Life
Re-Entry Project; St. Mary Medical Center: and Peace Garden.
Elderly and Frail Elderly
In 2010, approximately 9% of Long Beach residents were over age 65, and about 16% of
all households were headed by seniors. Two-thirds of senior-headed households owned
their homes (64%) while one-third (36%) rented their homes. Approximately 45% of the
City’s elderly live alone and about 41% of elderly residents in Long Beach suffer from at
least one disability.
The elderly have a number of special needs including housing, transportation, health care,
and other services. Housing is a particular concern due to the fact that many of the elderly
are on fixed incomes. As housing expenses rise, they may have less money available for
medical costs and other vital services.
Rising rental housing costs are a major concern, since 80% of Long Beach’s elderly renter
households have lower-incomes (<80% AMI), with 47% earning extremely-low incomes
(<30% AMI) (Table 25 on page 53). Moreover, the CHAS data found that approximately

59% of the City’s elderly renters were experiencing a housing cost burden (> 30% income
spent on rent).

As shown later in Table 22 Long Beach is home to 32 senior housing projects, providing
over 3,400 affordable units restricted to occupancy by lower income seniors In addition,
1,676 senior households receive Housing Choice Vouchers from the Housing Authority of
the City of Long Beach (HACLB) and another 323 households are on the waiting list for
Section 8 assistance.
Over 8,000 lower income senior households in Long Beach owned their homes. Minor
home repair and rehabilitation assistance is needed by many of these elderly owners, as
their financial and physical condition makes it difficult for them to maintain their homes.
The special needs of seniors can be met through a range of services, including congregate
care, rent subsides, shared housing, and housing rehabilitation assistance. According to
Community Care Licensing Division records, 42 licensed residential care facilities for the
elderly are located in Long Beach with a total capacity to serve 2,124 persons. Thirteen
adult day care facilities (with a total capacity to serve 445 persons) and 57 adult residential
facilities (with a total capacity to serve 726 persons) are also located in the City.
Long Beach seniors can benefit from the activities and programs offered at the City’s six
senior centers, which are operated by the Parks, Recreation, & Marine Department.
Activities and programs range from arts and cultural experiences, dance, fitness, life-long
learning opportunities, enrichment, health and social services, nutrition, excursions, drop-in
and special events, volunteerism and special interest groups. Homebound senior residents
can also utilize services offered by Meals On Wheels of Long Beach and Homebound
Reader Services offered by the Long Beach Public Library.
Single-Parent Households
Single-parent households often require special consideration and assistance as a result of
their greater need for affordable housing and accessible day care, health care and other
supportive services. According to the 2010 Census, there were 19,833 single-parent
households in Long Beach, representing 12% of all households.
Single-mother households, in particular, tend to have lower incomes, and as a result have a
greater need for affordable housing and childcare. In 2010, there were 14,864 female-
headed households with children in Long Beach. Of those households, approximately 40%
lived in poverty. Without access to affordable housing, many of these households may be
at risk of becoming homeless. Affordable housing with childcare centers, or in close
proximity to schools, public transportation and recreation facilities can address the critical
needs of lower-income single-parent families.

Another vulnerable sub-group of single-parent families are “subfamilies” with children,
which is defined as single parents/grandparents with children who live with another family.
According to the 2007-2011 ACS, Long Beach had 4,368 mother-child subfamilies and 972
father-child subfamilies in 2011. Many subfamilies double up with other families in living
arrangements to save income for basic necessities. In some cases, subfamilies double up
to share child-rearing responsibilities.

Single-parent households in Long Beach can benefit from a range of services accessible to
residents. The City’s Department of Health and Human Services operates the Center for
Families and Youth, which offers a variety of family support programs, including job
training/employment, developmental services, housing assistance, and child care. The
Central Facilities Center serves the community by providing childcare and public health
services and by linking residents directly to services offered by other local nonprofit
agencies. Agencies offering services at the Center include: Helpline Youth Counseling,
Inc.; LBUSD Child Development Center; Women, Infants & Children; United Cambodian
Community; First 5 LA; A New Way of Life Re-Entry Project; St. Mary Medical Center: and
Peace Garden. Additionally, the City’s Parks, Recreation, & Marine Department offers
programs and activities that serve the City’s youth, including after school activities at parks
and schools throughout the City, and youth and teen sport leagues and day camps. The
Department also operates five teen centers that provide social and recreational programs.
These teen centers are strategically located near high schools that serve the City’s youth.
Persons with Disabilities (including Developmental Disabilities)
Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities may prevent a person from working,
restrict one’s mobility, or make it difficult to care for oneself. Thus, persons with disabilities
often have special housing needs related to limited earning capacity, a lack of accessible
and affordable housing, and higher health costs associated with a disability. An additional
segment of residents suffer from disabilities that require living in an institutional setting.
Because of these conditions, persons with disabilities have special housing needs.
The 2010 Census did not collect information on disabilities. However, according to 2009-
2011 ACS data, approximately 10% of Long Beach residents suffered from at least one
disability. The ACS also tallied the number of disabilities by type for residents with one or
more disabilities. Among the disabilities tallied, ambulatory difficulties were most prevalent
(55%), while cognitive (42%) and independent living (40%) difficulties were also common
(Table 13).

           Notes:
           1. Persons under 5 years of age are not included in this table.
           2. Persons may have multiple disabilities.
The living arrangement of persons with disabilities depends on the severity of the disability
and the person’s finances. Many persons live at home in an independent arrangement or
with other family members. To maintain independent living, persons living with disabilities
may need assistance. Four factors – affordability, design, location, and discrimination –
significantly limit the supply of housing available to households of persons with disabilities.
The most obvious housing need for persons with disabilities is housing that is adapted to
their needs. State and federal legislation mandate that a percentage of units in new or
substantially rehabilitated multi-family apartment complexes be made accessible to
individuals with limited physical mobility. Most single-family homes, however, are
inaccessible to people with mobility and sensory limitations. Housing may not be adaptable
to widened doorways and hallways, access ramps, larger bathrooms, lowered countertops,
and other features necessary for accessibility. Location of housing is also an important
factor for many persons with disabilities, as they often rely upon public transportation to
travel to necessary services and shops.
Persons with Developmental Disabilities
A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element discuss the housing needs
of persons with developmental disabilities. As defined by the Section 4512 of the Welfare
and Institutions Code, “developmental disability” means “a disability that originates before
an individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely,
and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual. As defined by the Director of
Developmental Services, in consultation with the Superintendent of Public Instruction, this
term shall include mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term shall
also include disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to
require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but shall
not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.” Reflects the
individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or generic
services, individualized supports, or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong or
extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated.

The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S.
Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an acceptable estimate of the percentage of
the population that can be defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5%. This translates to
6,934 persons in the City of Long Beach with developmental disabilities, based on the
City’s 2010 Census population.
According to the State’s Department of Developmental Services, as of November 2012,
approximately 4,951 Long Beach residents with developmental disabilities were being
assisted at the Harbor Regional Center. Most of these individuals were residing in a private
home with their parent of guardian and 1,912 of these persons with developmental
disabilities were under the age of 18.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group
living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals
may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are
provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in
supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s
living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
Resources Available
Many disabled persons receive Social Security Income (SSI) assistance, however, benefit
payments are well below the level necessary to afford market rate apartments in the Long
Beach community. In order to assist with this need, the City provides a number of
affordable housing opportunities for persons with disabilities. There are currently 18
affordable housing developments in the City that have units specifically set aside for
disabled persons.
In addition, the City has a number of residential care facilities that provide supportive
housing and services to persons with disabilities. According to the California Department of
Social Services, Community Care Licensing Division, there are 13 adult day care facilities,
37 adult residential facilities, and 42 residential care facilities for the elderly located in Long
Beach.
Residents with disabilities can also benefit from programs offered by the Disabled
Resources Center, including assistive technology, employment, housing, independent
living, mobility management, personal assistance, and volunteer services. Homebound
residents can utilize services offered by Meals on Wheels of Long Beach and Homebound
Reader Services offered by the Long Beach Public Library.

Residents Living Below the Poverty Level
Families with incomes below the poverty level, typically those households with extremely
low and very low incomes, are at greatest risk of becoming homeless and typically require
special programs to assist them in meeting their rent and mortgage obligations so as to not
become homeless. The 2007-2011 ACS found that 19% of all Long Beach residents were
living below the poverty level. These households need assistance with housing subsidies,
utility allowances and other living expense subsidies, as well as supportive services.
Resources Available
Residents living in poverty can utilize services offered at the City’s Multi-Service Center for
the Homeless (MSC), including outreach, intake and assessment, referrals to shelters and
other social service programs. The City also distributes a Pocket Guide Resource
Directory to residents that outlines agencies that offer services to individuals and families in
the Long Beach area. Additionally, the City maintains a weekly schedule of meal services,
food bank, and clothing services offered by providers throughout the City. Most affordable
housing programs in the City will benefit persons living in poverty.
Farmworkers
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned
through permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farm laborers work in the
fields, processing plants, or support activities on a generally year-round basis. When
workload increases during harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal
labor, often supplied by a labor contractor. For some crops, farms may employ migrant
workers, defined as those whose travel distance to work prevents them from returning to
their primary residence every evening.
The City of Long Beach is a fully urbanized and built-out community. No agriculturally
zoned land is located here. According to the 2007-2011 ACS, only 954 Long Beach
residents were employed in the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, and mining
industry, representing less than one percent of the City’s residents in 2011. The City has
no agriculturally designated land. Therefore, no special programs are warranted for this
group in Long Beach.
Students
College students in a community can affect housing demand and housing costs. Although
students represent a temporary housing need, the heightened demand for rentals around
colleges can impact the housing market with higher rent levels. A large student population
is also associated with higher mobility and turnover rates. The 2007-2011 ACS reported
that Long Beach had 48,526 residents who were college students, some attending college
in Long Beach, some attending college elsewhere.
City of Long Beach                                                                      Page 30

Long Beach is home to two public (two-year) city colleges and a public university with large
student populations. The city colleges are estimated to have approximately 28,500 full and
part-time students attending classes. In keeping with the intent of the community college
system to serve local needs, approximately two-thirds of these students are part-time,
many of whom are younger persons living with parents. Thereby, the housing need of city
college students is not necessarily considered significant.
However, Long Beach is also home to the nationally renowned California State University.
Current enrollment is estimated at approximately 37,000 full-time and part-time students.
CSULB is an urban commuter campus with only about 2,400 beds in 20 on-campus
residence halls. Most students live in the surrounding communities and commute to
campus. Because students typically are lower-income and occupy rental units, they
influence the overall demand for apartments in the Long Beach and surrounding
communities.
Resources Available
Housing programs that expand affordable rental housing opportunities and improve
housing conditions will benefit students in general.
Homeless Persons
State law (Section 65583(a)(7)) mandates that Housing Elements address the special
needs of homeless persons. “Homelessness” as defined by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD), describes an individual (not imprisoned or
otherwise detained) who:
      Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; and
      Has a primary nighttime residence that is:
              o A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide
                 temporary living accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate
                 shelters, and transitional housing for the mentally ill);
              o An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to
                 be institutionalized; or
              o A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular
                 sleeping accommodation for human beings.
This definition does not include persons living in substandard housing, (unless it has been
officially condemned); persons living in overcrowded housing (for example, doubled up with
others), persons being discharged from mental health facilities (unless the person was
homeless when entering and is considered to be homeless at discharge), or persons who
may be at risk of homelessness (for example, living temporarily with family or friends.)
The size, diversity and geographic location in a major population center have made Long
Beach home to homeless persons. The City of Long Beach, Department of Health and
Human Services has been conducting homeless enumerations biannually:
City of Long Beach                                                                      Page 31

     2003 - 5,845 homeless persons
     2005 - 4,475 homeless persons
     2007 - 3,829 homeless persons
     2009 - 3,909 homeless persons
     2011 - 4,290 homeless persons
     2013 – 4,387 homeless persons
This process of quantifying the homeless population has provided important data to
comprehensively understand the demographics of Long Beach homeless persons. This
data has been used to evaluate existing service availability and determine gaps in
resources citywide. In the 2003 count 35% of the homeless were children; in the 2013
count 12% were children. In 2003, 795 families were counted as homeless. By 2013 the
number of families decreased to 340 families.
Homelessness affects all people, regardless of household size, age, race or ethnicity.
However, one factor that seems to have remained constant is that three-quarters of the
homeless are single adults. A factor that seems to be changing, though this category is
more difficult to identify, is that more of the homeless are teenagers unaccompanied by
families. The 2013 survey found that 35% of the homeless are African American, 38% are
White, 17% are Hispanic, and 10% are other ethnicities. Males account for 71%, females
28%, less than 1% transgender, and the remaining portion counted as missing data.
Table 14 summarizes the continuum of care gap analysis. Based on the current inventory
of housing available to serve the homeless, the gap analysis documents an unmet need of
1,620 beds for homeless individuals and 259 beds for persons in homeless families.

Homeless persons are distinguished by a range of health needs. About a third suffer from
mental illness and it is estimated that at least half of homeless persons suffer from some
type of substance abuse problem. Homeless people also experience a range of medical
conditions associated with the rigors of living on the street. Addressing the range of
services needed by homeless persons requires a comprehensive strategy.
The City’s Department of Health and Human Services is developing a Ten Year Plan to
End Homelessness and has established a Continuum of Care (CoC) Program to assist
homeless people to exit the streets, become stable and achieve self-sufficiency to the
maximum extent possible. Following is a description of the stages in the CoC Program.
     Outreach/Assessment – The City has established an outreach and assessment
          program to reconnect a homeless person to public benefits, rent assistance,
          employment counseling, health care and other support services. The City’s Multi-
          Service Center is the entry point into the Continuum of Care. The Health
          Department, Los Angeles County Mental Health Association, and Boys Town Long
          Beach provide outreach for different groups of the homeless population.
     Emergency Shelter – Long Beach provides emergency shelter beds for homeless
          persons, including 302 emergency shelter beds for single persons, 152 beds for
          families and one year-round program for single homeless males. Hotel and motel
          vouchers are provided for persons living with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.

      Transitional Housing – Transitional housing is the second phase of the program,
          where clients are provided a more structured environment. Clients are linked to
          rehabilitative services, such as substance abuse, mental health, employment,
          counseling and life-skills training to prepare them for transition to service-enriched
          housing or more independent settings. Nonprofit housing provides 1,181 beds.
      Supportive Services – Long Beach offers an array of supportive services for the
          homeless to ease their transition into shelter. These include mental health and
          substance treatment, job and life-skills training, medical care, childcare and
          transportation services. The City has also developed a Standard of Care to
          standardize case management services for homeless people citywide.
      Permanent Housing – This phase is designed to transition homeless persons into
          permanent housing with childcare, drug treatment, job training and other supportive
          skills needed to reintegrate into community life. A total of 863 beds of supportive
          permanent housing are provided. The City also administers almost 7,000 Section 8
          vouchers and provides over 4,000 subsidized housing units.
Homeless residents can utilize services offered at the City’s Multi-Service Center for the
Homeless (MSC), including outreach, intake and assessment, referrals to shelters and
other social service programs. The City distributes a Pocket Guide Resource Directory to
residents that details agencies that offer services to individuals and families in the Long
Beach area. Additionally, the City maintains a weekly schedule of meal, food bank, and
clothing services offered by providers throughout the City. Additional resources available
throughout the County to homeless persons include 211 LA County, Los Angeles
Homeless Services Authority, St. Joseph’s Center, People Assisting the Homeless, Ocean
Park Community Center, and the Watts Labor Community Action Committee.
The Villages at Cabrillo is a residential community established to break the cycle of
homelessness. As a nonprofit affiliate of Century Housing, Century Villages at Cabrillo
(CVC) is the community development organization that owns, develops, and manages this
unique campus. The Villages at Cabrillo is home to more than 1,000 residents, including
veterans, families, and children, and features a collaboration with 20 nonprofit and
government agencies that collectively provides residents with safe, affordable housing and
access to the skills, tools, and services needed to establish self-sufficiency. CVC’s
supportive housing paradigm consists of emergency shelter, transitional housing, and
permanent housing all complemented with wrap around social services. This “continuum of
care” approach encourages formerly homeless individuals and families to move
progressively through various levels of housing and increasing independence. In 2012, a
total of 2,085 persons were housed at the Villages of Cabrillo, including 335 persons with

C. Housing Stock Characteristics
The characteristics and condition of Long Beach’s housing stock, combined with household
characteristics discussed earlier, affect the well being of residents. This section begins with
an examination of the gap between housing production and need in the region and the City
of Long Beach, followed by an evaluation of local housing characteristics - including:
housing stock changes and types, tenure and vacancy rates, age and condition, and
housing costs.
1. Housing Growth
As previously shown, between 2000 and 2010, Long Beach experienced a 3% increase in
the housing stock and a less than 1% increase in population and number of households,
resulting in a stable average household size (2.8 persons) and a higher vacancy rate.
2. Housing Type
A certain level of diversity in the housing stock is an important factor in ensuring adequate
housing opportunity for all Long Beach residents. A diverse housing stock helps ensure
that all households, regardless of their income, age, and/or family size, have the
opportunity to find housing that is best suited to their lifestyle needs. This section briefly
details the housing stock characteristics in Long Beach.

        *Note: In 1990, a variety of “other” housing types were grouped under this category. In the subsequent 2000 Census
        and Department of Finance estimates, these “other” units have been combined with multi-family units (5+ units).
The ACS documented a total of 176,188 housing units in Long Beach in 2011. The mix of
housing has remained relatively constant, comprised predominately of single-family
detached homes (42%) and larger multi-family buildings (39%), followed by duplexes/

triplexes/fourplexes (13%), single-family attached units such as townhomes and
condominiums (6%), and mobile home units (1%).
3. Housing Tenure and Vacancy
The tenure of housing refers to whether a housing unit is owned, rented or vacant. Tenure
is an important indicator of well being in a given community because it reflects the cost of
housing and the ability of residents to own or rent a unit. Moreover, tenure often affects
several other aspects of the local housing market, including turnover rates and overall
housing costs.
Contrary to public perception, owner-occupancy rates in the City have also remained stable
over the past two decades. During 2000 to 2010, the Census documents that 42% of Long
Beach households were homeowners, with 58% renters. However, while the City has
maintained a consistent level of homeownership, the homeownership rate is still relatively
low in comparison to both the County (48%) and the State (56%), and is particularly low
among African-American and Hispanic residents. The 2010 Census documents the
following homeownership rates by race/ethnicity in Long Beach: 27% for African-
Americans, 35% for Hispanics, 45% for Asians, and 60% for Whites.
Residential vacancy rates are a good indicator of how well the current supply of housing is
meeting the demand for various types of units. A certain number of vacant housing units
are needed in any community to moderate the cost of housing, allow for sufficient housing
choices, and provide an incentive for landlords and owners to maintain their housing. The
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) has identified optimal vacancy
rates of 5% for rental housing and 2% for ownership units.
The overall vacancy rate reported for Long Beach in the 2007-2011 American Community
Survey was 8.1% (combined vacancy rate for rent, for sale, seasonally occupied, and
abandoned/boarded up units). The figure below depicts only rental and ownership vacancy
rates in Long Beach from 1990 to 2011. In 1990, rental vacancies were at 7.5%, indicating
an adequate supply of rentals to allow mobility. However, with only limited increases in
rental housing and continued population pressures, rental vacancies had dropped to 4.2%
by 2000. As of 2011, rental vacancies had increased slightly to 5.5%. The 1990 ownership
vacancy rate of 1.6% was slightly below optimum, but had increased to a healthy 2.2 % by
2000, and increased to 2.3% by 2011.

4. Housing Age and Condition
The age of a community’s housing stock can be an indicator of overall housing conditions.
If not well maintained, housing can deteriorate and depress property values, discourage
reinvestment, and negatively affect the quality of life in a neighborhood. Typically, housing
over 30 years in age is likely to have rehabilitation needs that may include new plumbing,
roof repairs, foundation work and other repairs. If not well maintained, housing over 50
years in age may require total building replacement.
Table 17 summarizes the age distribution of Long Beach’s occupied housing stock by
owner/renter tenure. Among owner-occupied housing, over 90% of units were constructed
prior to 1980. Similarly, about 85% of the renter housing is greater than 30 years in age.
Furthermore, this housing is typically of lesser quality construction and suffers more wear-
and-tear from tenants than owner-occupied housing. The prevalence of housing built prior
to 1978 is also of concern because of lead-based paint hazards, discussed in greater detail
later in this section. The advanced age of the majority of Long Beach’s housing stock
indicates the significant need for continued code enforcement, property maintenance and
housing rehabilitation programs to stem housing deterioration.

While a Citywide survey of housing stock conditions is not available, information from the
City’s Code Enforcement program provides a good indicator of the extent of housing
deterioration. During FY 2012 (October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012), the City had
opened 12,550 code enforcement cases and closed 12,273 cases, with 1,458 cases still
active at the time of this report (Table 18). Over 90% of these were for property
maintenance issues such as abandoned vehicles, deteriorated paint or roof covering,
broken windows, overgrown vegetation, or other similar maintenance issues not directly
related to the structural condition of the unit. Another 9% were for unpermitted
construction. In contrast, less than 1% of the cases were for substandard buildings.

Based on the age of housing stock in the City, approximately 141,800 housing units are 30
years or older. Applying the 1% to the City’s older housing stock results in an estimate
1,418 units in substandard conditions (with 815 rental units and 603 ownership units).
Concentrations of deteriorated housing are located in the Downtown and in Central Long
Beach, and to a lesser degree in North Long Beach.3 These areas also correspond with
high levels of household overcrowding and a predominance of low and moderate income
households.
5. Housing Costs and Affordability
The cost of housing is directly related to the extent of housing problems in a community. If
housing costs are relatively high in comparison to household income, there will be a
correspondingly higher prevalence of overpayment and overcrowding. This section
summarizes costs for housing in Long Beach and evaluates the affordability of the City’s
housing stock to low and moderate-income households.
Ownership Costs
Median sales prices of existing single-family homes and condominiums, represented by 11
Long Beach zip codes, are presented in Table 19. From March 2012 to March 2013, 200
homes were sold throughout Long Beach. Median prices ranged between $158,000 and
$797,000, depending on location. Home prices in most areas of the City experienced an
increase (up to a 42% increase), while two areas experienced a decrease (up to a 26%
decrease). During this same period, 90 existing condominiums were sold, with median
prices ranged from $115,000 to $462,000. A majority of areas in the City experienced an
increase in the price of condominiums (up to a 126% increase), while two areas also
experienced a decline (up to a 20% decrease).

6. Housing Affordability
The costs of home ownership and renting can be compared to a household’s ability to pay
for housing to determine the general affordability of a community’s housing stock. The
federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts annual household
income surveys nationwide to determine a household’s eligibility for federal housing
assistance. Based on this survey, HCD developed income limits that can be used to
determine the maximum price that could be affordable to households in the upper range of
their respective income category. Households in the lower end of each category can afford
less by comparison than those at the upper end. Table 21 illustrates maximum affordable
mortgage payments and rents for various household sizes in Los Angeles County earning
the top end of their respective income categories.
For homeownership, Table 21 assumes a 30-year mortgage at a four-percent interest rate
and a 10% down payment. A comparison of Table 21 with previous tables (Table 19)
shows that ownership housing in Long Beach is beyond the financial reach of lower income
households. Larger moderate income households may be able to afford a home, but
finding adequately sized affordable housing still poses a challenge for these households.
Some low income households may be able to afford small apartments, but larger
apartments are typically not affordable to low income households (Table 20). Even
moderate income households may only be able to afford a two-bedroom apartment.

To afford a median-priced home of $437,000 in Long Beach, a household income of
approximately $109,000 (168% of the County median income for a family of four) would be
needed (Table 21). Renting an average apartment at $1,395 would require less income
($67,000); however, based on wage data from 2012, many of the occupational categories
in Los Angeles County pay lower wages than needed to afford housing in Long Beach.

The City has deed restrictions on 754 single-family homes, which include 427 rehabilitation
loans for low income homeowners and 327 second mortgage loans for low income first-
time homebuyers. These homes are located throughout the City.
2. Rental Housing
State law requires the City to identify, analyze, and propose programs to preserve existing
multi-family rental units that are currently restricted to low income housing use and that will
become unrestricted and possibly be lost as low income housing (i.e., “units at risk” or “at-
risk units”). State law requires the following:
     An inventory of rent-restricted low income housing projects in the City and their
          potential for conversion;

     An analysis of the costs of preserving and/or replacing the units at risk and a
          comparison of these costs;
     An analysis of the organizational and financial resources available for preserving
          and/or replacing the units “at risk”; and
     Programs for preserving the at-risk units.
The following discussion satisfies the first three requirements of State law listed above
pertaining to the potential conversion of assisted housing units into market rate housing
between October 15, 2013, and October 15, 2023. The Housing Plan section includes a
program for preserving the at-risk units, which meets the final requirement of State law.
Long Beach has a sizable stock of publicly assisted rental housing. This housing stock
includes all multi-family rental units assisted under federal, state, and local programs,
including HUD, state/local bond programs, and density bonus housing units. Assisted
rental projects include both new construction, as well as rehabilitation projects with
affordability covenants. A total of 4,353 publicly assisted multi-family units are located in
the City. Table 22 summarizes multi-family projects in Long Beach, which are rent
restricted as affordable to lower-income households.

  Note: Status of Section 8 contracts is based on HUD database, which is only updated periodically.
From time to time, restricted units lose their affordability controls and revert to non-low-
income use due to expiration of subsidy contracts and/or affordability covenants. For
example, projects receiving City assistance, primarily through HOME and Redevelopment
Set-Aside funds, carry long-term affordability covenants of 30-55 years. However, many of
the HUD-assisted projects have much shorter affordability controls and may be at risk of
conversion to market-rate housing due to the expiration of Section 8 contracts. Overall, 21
projects totaling 1,600 may be considered at risk.
Among the 21 assisted housing projects in Long Beach, most were constructed with HUD-
insured mortgages: Section 202, and Section 811. Section 202/811 projects are owned by
non-profit organizations and low-income use restrictions are locked in for the full 40-year
mortgage loan. Because they are owned by non-profits the long-term low-income use
restrictions on these projects is fairly secure. Nevertheless, the Section 8 contracts may be
at risk due to budgetary constraints at HUD. Long Beach has nine Section 202/811
projects.
However, the projects are primarily at risk of becoming market-rate housing due to the
potential expiration of the Section 8 contracts. These contracts are project based –
attached to the specific project – rather than vouchers, which move with the individual
tenant. Project-based Section 8 contracts started to expire in 1997 and can now be
renewed for one-, five-, ten- or twenty-year terms. Renewals are subject to annual
appropriations by Congress. For this reason, projects with Section 8 contracts are
considered at risk of losing their affordability annually.
3. Preservation and Replacement Options
Preservation or replacement of at-risk projects in Long Beach can be achieved in several
ways: 1) provision of rental assistance to tenants using other funding sources; 2)
replacement or development of new assisted multi-family housing units; and/or 3) purchase
of affordability covenants. These options are described below, along with a general cost
estimate for each. Typically, transferring ownership from a private profit-motivated
organization to a nonprofit organization is another feasible option of preservation.
However, virtually all of the at-risk projects in Long Beach are owned by nonprofit
organizations.

 Rental Assistance
 All at-risk projects in Long Beach maintain Section 8 contracts for rental assistance.
 Availability of funding at the federal level for Section 8 contract renewal is uncertain.
 Should Section 8 be terminated or deed-restrictions at other projects be expired, the City
 could potentially provide rent subsidies to maintain affordability at these projects that are
 structured to mirror the Section 8 program. Under Section 8, HUD pays owners the
 difference between what tenants can pay (defined as 30% of household income) and the
 negotiated payment standard.
 The feasibility of this alternative depends on the willingness of property owners to accept
 rental assistance and the ability of the City to provide such assistance. Nonprofit owners
 are most likely to be willing to accept other rent subsidies, while for-profit owners will
 evaluate how comparable the rent subsidies are to market rate rents. As summarized in
 Table 23, given the bedroom mix of all 1,600 at-risk Section 8 units, the total cost of
 subsidizing the rents to Fair Market Rent (FMR) levels is approximately $1.17 million per
 month or approximately $14.1 million annually.

Notes:
     1. Fair Market Rent (FMR) is determined by HUD. These calculations use the 2013 HUD FMR for the Housing Authority of the City
          of Long Beach Small Area Demonstration.
     2. Rents are restricted to 50% AMI in these buildings, which puts residents in the Very Low Income Category, set by the California
          Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD).
     3. The affordable housing cost is calculated based on 30% of the AMI, minus utilities for rentals.
     4. The monthly subsidy covers the gap between the FMR and the affordable housing cost.
 Construction of Replacement Units
 The construction of new low income housing units as a means of replacing currently at-risk
 units is an option for Long Beach. The cost of developing housing depends upon a variety
 of factors including the density and size of the units (i.e. square footage and number of
 City of Long Beach                                                                                                         Page 49

bedrooms), location, land costs and type of construction. Based on general assumptions
for average construction costs, it would cost approximately $157 million to construct 1,600
affordable replacement units, excluding land costs and other soft costs (such as
architecture and engineering). Including land costs, the total costs to develop replacement
units would be significantly higher.

Purchase of Affordability Covenants
Another option to preserve the affordability of at-risk projects is to provide a lump sum
financial package to maintain the projects as low-income housing, including writing down
the interest rate on or paying off the remaining loan balance, and/or supplementing the
Section 8 subsidy received with cash flow for other expenses. By providing lump sum
financial assistance or an on-going subsidy in rents or reduced mortgage interest rates, the
City could ensure that some or all of the assisted units remain affordable.
E. Housing Problems
The SCAG data estimating the number of households at each income level presented
earlier does not provide any detail on the specific housing needs and problems faced by
the City’s lower income households. The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy
(CHAS) developed by the Census Bureau for HUD, however, provides detailed information
on housing needs by income level for different types of households in Long Beach.
Detailed CHAS data based on the 2005-2009 ACS data is displayed in (Table 25).
Housing problems considered by CHAS include:
      Units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom);
      Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room);
      Housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 30% of gross income; or
      Severe housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50% of gross income.

1. Overcrowding
Overcrowding is a significant issue in Long Beach. Overcrowding is defined by the State
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) as a household with more
than one person per room (excluding bathroom, kitchen). Severe overcrowding is one with
more than 1.5 persons per room.4 Overcrowding typically occurs when housing costs are
so high relative to income that families double-up or take on roommates or boarders to
devote income to other basic needs, such as food and medical care. Overcrowding also
tends to result in deterioration of homes and shortage of on-site parking. Therefore,
maintaining a reasonable level of occupancy and alleviating overcrowding is an important
contributor to quality of life.
Overall, 15.9% of the renter-households and 5.9% of the owner-households in the City
were considered overcrowded. The 2007-2011 ACS further documents the presence of
severe overcrowding in 2% of homeowner households and 7% of renter-households in
Long Beach. One of the key demographic trends impacting housing needs in Long Beach
is the City’s transition from a majority White homeowner population comprised of smaller
households to an increasing number of Hispanic and Asian renter-households with large
families. The City’s existing rental housing stock of primarily older, small units are of
inadequate size to house this population, contributing to significant unit overcrowding and
deterioration.

     A housing unit with more than one person per room is considered by HCD and HUD as overcrowded. In calculating
     overcrowding, living and dining rooms are included but kitchens and bathrooms are excluded.

Figure 9 highlights this mismatch between the need for larger rental units and the City’s
supply of predominately studio and one-bedroom units. Using State Redevelopment
definitions of “household size appropriate for the unit” as number of bedrooms plus one,
Long Beach has only 2,055 rental units (4+ bedrooms) to accommodate 12,990 large renter
households (5+ members). This imbalance between supply and demand contributes to a
significant proportion of large renter households living in overcrowded housing.

2. Cost Burden (Overpayment)
Most lower income households cope with housing cost issues either by assuming a cost
burden, or by occupying a smaller than needed or substandard unit. Specifically, according
to CHAS, 86% of the City’s extremely low income households and 82% of very low income
households experienced one or more housing problems (e.g., cost burden, overcrowding,
or substandard housing condition) between 2005 and 2009.5 The types of housing
problems experienced by Long Beach households vary according to household income,
type, and tenure. Some highlights include:
      In general, renter-households had a higher level of housing problems (59%)
          compared to owner-households (53%).

III. HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
The provision of decent, safe, and affordable housing is an important goal of the City of
Long Beach. However, there are a variety of factors that encourage or constrain the
development, maintenance, and improvement of the housing stock in the City. These
include market mechanisms, government codes and regulations, and physical and
environmental constraints. This section addresses the above constraints.
A. Market Constraints
Land costs, construction costs, and market financing contribute to the cost of housing
investment, and potentially can hinder the production of affordable housing. Although
many of these potential constraints are driven by market conditions, jurisdictions have
some options to address these constraints. This section analyzes these constraints as well
as the activities that the City of Long Beach can take to mitigate their impacts.
1. Development Costs
The costs of developing housing vary widely according to the type of home, with multi-
family housing generally less costly to construct than single-family homes on a per-unit
basis. However, within each construction type, costs can vary based on the size of unit
and the number and quality of amenities provided, such as fireplaces, swimming pools, and
interior fixtures among others. Land costs vary by location, size, and the existing use of the
lot, i.e., whether the site has an existing structure that must be removed.
A key component in the cost of housing development is the price of raw land and any
necessary improvements and infrastructure that must be made to a particular site. The
diminishing supply of vacant residential land combined with a fairly high demand kept land
cost relatively high in Southern California, even through the most recent recession. In
recognition that land costs affect the feasibility of developing affordable housing, the Long
Beach Redevelopment Agency routinely wrote down the cost of land on Agency-owned
property in exchange for developers placing affordability controls on the units. In the
absence now of the Redevelopment Agency, Long Beach has no source of funding to
reduce the cost of land for development.
A 2011 survey on land cost in Long Beach concludes that residential land can be valued at
approximately $30 per square foot for smaller parcels (less than five acres). Larger parcels
command a lower per-square-foot cost of about $28. For commercial properties where
mixed use development is an allowable use, the average cost is estimated at $40 per
square foot for smaller parcels (less than five acres) and $38 per square foot for larger
parcels.
Construction costs also vary widely according to the type of housing development. Multi-
family housing is generally less costly to construct than single-family homes, but
construction costs can vary greatly depending upon the size of unit and the number and

quality of amenities provided. However, construction costs are generally uniform across
the region and therefore do not serve to constrain housing development in specific
communities.
2. Mortgage Financing
Home Purchase Loans
The availability of mortgage financing affects a household’s ability to purchase a home.
This section describes and analyzes the disposition of loan applications submitted for home
purchases based upon data provided through the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA).
Home purchase loans, both conventional and government-backed, are summarized in
Table 26. During the middle years of the past decade, housing prices were especially high
in relation to incomes and mortgage-lending restrictions were substantially loosened, with
the result that few households relied on government-backed financing for home purchases.
However, more recently with the gradual recovery of the housing market, government-
backed financing has served a major share of homebuyers once again, though the total
number of purchases has been comparatively low. A total of 4,636 households applied for
loans in 2011 to purchase Long Beach housing units, less than one third of the total
number five years earlier (2006). Specifically for government-backed financing, there were
1,899 applications in 2011, 41% of the total, compared with only nine applications in 2006.

Table 26 summarizes the disposition of loan applications for home purchase loans in Long
Beach. The rates of approval for conventional loans and government-backed financing are
similar, though the rate for conventional loans is slightly higher.
Home Improvement Loans
Home purchase mortgage financing is generally available to Long Beach. However, home
improvement financing is more limited. As shown in Table 26, only 464 applications were
filed, with a high denial rate of close to 30%.
City of Long Beach                                                                                                      Page 55

Foreclosures
Between 2000 and 2005, with record low interest rates, “creative” financing (e.g., zero
down, interest only, adjustable loans), and predatory lending practices (e.g. aggressive
marketing, hidden fees, negative amortization), many households purchased homes that
were beyond their financial means. Under the assumptions that refinancing to lower
interest rates would always be an option and home prices would continue to rise at double-
digit rates, many households were unprepared for the hikes in interest rates, expiration of
short-term fixed rates, and decline in sales prices that accelerated in 2006. Suddenly faced
with significantly inflated mortgage payments, and mortgage loans that are larger than the
worth of the homes, many households faced foreclosures. Though foreclosure remains a
problem in a city with the diverse income levels of Long Beach, the scale of the problem is
far smaller.
In Los Angeles County, 3,985 homeowners filed Notices of Default (NODs) in the first
quarter of 2013, representing a 65% decrease from the11,443 NODs filed during the same
period one year earlier.6            With the implosion of the mortgage lending market, many
households faced difficulty obtaining new mortgage loans or refinancing, even the above
moderate income households. However, as the decrease in filings illustrates, many fewer
households are now affected.
In April 2013, 736 homes in Long Beach were listed at various stages of foreclosure (from
pre-foreclosures to auctions).7 The prices of these homes reached as high as a $4.5
million for a waterfront property, but prices were generally between $200,000 and
$800,000. The high prices of homes facing foreclosure indicate that the impact of
foreclosure continues to extend not only to lower and moderate income households but
also to some households with higher incomes.
B. Governmental Constraints
Local policies and regulations can impact the price and availability of housing and, in
particular, the provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, residential development
standards, fees and exactions, and permit processing procedures among others may
increase the cost of housing maintenance, development and improvement. This section
discusses these potential constraints and actions taken to mitigate them.
1. Land Use Controls
The Land Use Element (LUE) of the Long Beach General Plan sets forth the City’s policies
for guiding local development. It establishes the distribution and intensity of land that is
allocated for different uses. The General Plan LUE provides eight residential land use
designations in the community. Development density ranges from 7 units per acre in

Planned Development Districts (PDs)
The Planned Development (PD) district allows flexible development standards for areas
with unique land uses that would benefit from special design policies and standards not
otherwise possible under conventional zoning district regulations. The PD district is
designed to promote a compatible mix of land uses, allow for planned commercial/business
parks, and encourage a variety of housing styles and densities. Many of the PD districts
have provided the primary opportunities for infill development during the past decade,
specifically in PDs 5, 6, 25, 29, and 30. Since 2006, 707 housing units have been
constructed within the various PD districts, including 503 affordable units for lower and
moderate income households. The majority of units constructed in these PDs thus far,
have been affordable units.
The PD districts with significant potential for residential development are noted below:

     PD-5 Ocean Boulevard: PD-5 is located between the beach and Ocean Boulevard,
     from Alamitos Boulevard to Bixby Park. The land is primarily used for multi-family
     housing at a relatively high density (54 units per acre). The PD-5 plan is designed to
     encourage similar high-density housing through lot assembly, provided that
     development is sensitive to parameters in the Long Beach Local Coastal Program.
     PD-6 Downtown Shoreline: The goal of the PD-6 plan is to guide and control the
     development of the Downtown Shoreline below Ocean Boulevard. Specifically, the plan
     intends to coordinate future public and private improvements under a concept of mixed
     uses, including residential, commercial, and recreational components. PD-6 consists of
     eleven sub-areas, each with unique standards and guidelines for development. Though
     housing is not permitted in some subareas of PD-6, Subarea 9 permits residential
     density up to 250 units per acre.
     PD-25 Atlantic Avenue: The Atlantic Avenue PD-25 area is transitioning from blighted
     conditions such as vacant, underutilized and deteriorated commercial and residential
     structures and incompatible land uses, to include new schools, banks, residences and
     shopping opportunities. PD-25 aims to ensure that recycling and reinvestment results in
     high-quality development and compatible uses that complement and serve the adjoining
     residential neighborhoods. New workforce, senior and family housing developments
     are improving this corridor.
     PD-29 Long Beach Boulevard: PD-29 is designed to promote the economic and
     aesthetic revitalization of Long Beach Boulevard below the I-405 freeway, once a very
     distressed corridor. PD-29 has encouraged quality commercial, residential and infill
     institutional projects, and promotes uses and levels of intensity that take advantage of
     the Blue Line passenger rail service to Los Angeles. Higher density residential uses
     and special needs housing, including R-4-N uses with residential densities up to 109
     units per acre, are permitted in Sub-areas 1 and 3, and R-4-U uses are allowed in
     Subareas 2 and 5.
     PD-30 Downtown: PD-30 is designed to develop the downtown into a multi-purpose
     activity center of regional significance and to connect the various districts of downtown
     into a cohesive and functional whole. PD-30 residential districts include the: Mixed Use
     District, East Village Mixed Use District, West End Residential District, and East Village
     Residential District. Typical densities range from 31 to 54 units per acre, with unlimited
     higher densities available to high-rise buildings in the Downtown Core.
     PD-31 CSULB Technology Center/Villages at Cabrillo: Set on the 26-acre former
     Naval housing site on the Westside of Long Beach, the Villages at Cabrillo contains
     emergency housing and permanent supportive housing for veterans, homeless, families
     and youth. It is a location where the Long Beach Community Investment Company
     (LBCIC) works with nonprofit developers to create permanent affordable housing. In

2. Residential Development Standards
The Zoning Code implements the general policies contained in the General Plan. It is
designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of residents, and
serves to preserve the character and integrity of residential neighborhoods. Therefore, the
Zoning Code establishes specific definitions of allowable uses and residential development
standards for the community. The Zoning Code delineates the following five basic
residential zones, with 18 subcategories:
          R-1:   Single Family (plus suffix S, M, N, L, or T)
          R-2:   Two Family (plus suffix S, I, N, A, or L)
          R-3:   Low Density Multi-Family (plus suffix S, 4, or T)
          R-4:   High Density Multi-Family (plus suffix R, N, H, or U)
          RM:    Mobile Home (no suffix attached)
These zoning districts and associated development standards provide for the development
of a variety of housing types in the City. Table 28 summarizes the development standards
for each zone and 29 summarizes the residential densities allowed for multi-family districts.
Overall, the City’s development standards (citywide and in the coastal zone) do not
constrain housing development. Because the City facilitates residential development
primarily through Planned Development (PD) zoning, flexibility in development standards is
built into the PD regulations. As demonstrated later in Section IV, Housing Resources,
most multi-family developments in the PD zones intended for high density residential and/or
mixed use developments were able to achieve maximum permitted densities. In PD-30
(Downtown Core) there are no limits to height or density. The requirement for parking is
one space per unit, without distinction by the number of bedrooms, a significant reduction
from the 1.5 to two spaces that are generally required for units of one or more bedrooms in
the City. With the reduced requirement for parking and no limit to height or density,
developments have exceeded 200 units per acre in this area. High density development is
permitted in the PD-6 (Downtown Shoreline) and PD-29 (Long Beach Boulevard) districts.

Parking Requirements
Parking requirements for residential districts vary by the number of bedrooms in a housing
unit, location of the development, type of permitted use, and other criteria associated with
the demand for parking generated by the particular development. Chart 39 details parking
requirements by residential type citywide and in Downtown Long Beach.
The City offers incentives to ensure that parking standards do not constrain the
development of housing. The Planning Commission may reduce the parking standards for
residential projects for lower income seniors and disabled residents when the neighborhood
in which the complex is proposed has ample, readily available on-street parking or is well-
served by public transportation and a concentration of supportive services. Parking is also
reduced for special group residences, and other uses typically requiring less parking.
Overall, the City’s parking requirements are lower than most communities in Southern
California, reflecting the compact development patterns in the City and the greater use of
public transit by residents and workers in the City. Long Beach has a Downtown Transit
Mall served by the MTA Blue Line, regional buses and local buses, and the very popular
Bike Station.
On-street parking in the coastal zone is more limited given that the California Coastal Act
encourages the City to not impair public coastal access. However, the difference between

requirements citywide (except in PD-30, where one space per unit is required regardless of
unit size). This difference is to recognize the current under-parked situation in the coastal
zone and the encouragement of the Coastal Commission to provide adequate parking in
the zone. Given the desirable location, even small units (especially in the Belmont Shore
area) are occupied by households with two cars. Specifically, the City conducted a parking
study in Belmont Shore to identify appropriate parking standards for the area.
To balance the need for parking for coastal access, business uses, and housing, the
Zoning Code allows several incentives: tandem parking for low-income housing units when
projects include 10% or more of the units as on-site low-income units and for projects of 20
units or more to satisfy the parking requirements for one-bedroom units in the PD-30 and
the PD-5 districts. Moreover, PD districts also allow for shared use guest parking for
mixed-use projects.
Because the City’s parking standards are reasonable and the City offers numerous
incentives Citywide as well as in the coastal zone to mitigate cost impacts on affordable
housing, the City’s parking standards do not unduly constrain the development or
affordability of housing. Furthermore, much of the City’s residential development potential
identified for the 2013-2021 planning period is expected to occur in PD-29 and PD-30
(portions that are outside the coastal zone). Affordable housing in the coastal area also
usually receives funding from the coastal housing replacement fund.

Site Requirements
In general, maximum height and lot coverage standards determine the number of units that
can be constructed on a given lot. In some communities, relatively strict standards in effect
could disallow the maximum allowable densities from being achieved. However, in Long
Beach, the maximum building height ranges from two stories in the low-density R-1 zone to
five stories in the R-4-U zone. Unlimited heights are allowed in the core of Downtown PD-
30; high rises are allowed along the Downtown Shoreline in PD-5 and PD-6 and in limited
areas along Long Beach Boulevard PD-29. The R-4-H zone offers a height incentive up to
24 stories if the minimum lot width and height standards are met. Maximum lot coverage
varies from “none” in some residential zones to 65% in the mobile home zone, while R-3
and R-4 zones are not subject to such requirement. Therefore, the City’s overall site
requirements do not constrain housing development.
In Long Beach there are five Site Plan Review Findings used to ensure quality
development and promote certainty in the development process. These finding are:
     1. The design is harmonious, consistent and complete within itself, and is compatible in
          design, character, and scale with neighboring structures and the community in which
          it is located;
          (This simply means that the Site Plan Review Committee will not approve a
          disjointed or poor quality design, nor will they approve a design that is out of
          character and scale with neighboring structures that should be respected.
          Appropriate heights, massing and setbacks are carefully evaluated in higher density
          projects to ensure they respect the design character of their surroundings.)
     2. The design conforms to the City’s Design Guidelines for R-3 and R-4 Multi-family
          Development, the Downtown Design Guidelines, the General Plan, and any other
          design guidelines or specific plans which may be applicable to the project;
     3. The design will not remove significant mature trees or street trees unless no
          alternative design is feasible;
     4. There is an essential nexus between the public improvement requirements and the
          likely impacts of the proposed development; and,
     5. The project conforms to all requirements set forth in Chapter 21.64 on
          Transportation Demand Management.
Incentives for Affordable Housing
To encourage the development and conservation of affordable housing, the City has
adopted several ordinances – a density bonus ordinance, State coastal zone law, as well
as various other incentives. These ordinances encourage higher density housing that is
City of Long Beach                                                                     Page 63

affordable to special needs populations and remove potential constraints to development,
while preserving affordable units in the coastal zone.
     Density Incentives – Long Beach has adopted the State density law to provide up
          to 35% of density bonus to facilitate the development of lower income housing,
          moderate-income condominiums, and housing for seniors.
     Waiver of Fees – In addition to the density bonus, parks and recreation and
          transportation development fees are waived for affordable housing if the criteria on
          length of affordability and income/affordability level are met.
     Relaxed Standards – In conjunction with the density bonus ordinance, certain
          development standards may be relaxed if increased density cannot be physically
          accommodated on the site. This provision follows a priority order specified in the
          Zoning Code and the applicant must show that the density bonus cannot be
          achieved with each sequential waiver before the next waiver is allowed. The priority
          order is:
               1.   Percentage of compact parking
               2.   Tandem parking design limitations;
               3.   Privacy standards;
               4.   Private open space;
               5.   Common open space;
               6.   Height;
               7.   Distance between buildings;
               8.   Side yard setbacks;
               9.   Rear yard setbacks;
              10.   Number of parking spaces (but not less than one space per unit); and
              11.   Front setbacks.
If the developer believes that with the density bonus and the additional incentives, the
provision of lower income housing, moderate income condominiums, or senior citizen
housing units is not financially feasible, then the developer may submit a project pro forma
demonstrating the deficiency.
Replacement Policies
State law stipulates that the conversion or demolition of homes occupied by lower or
moderate-income households within the coastal zone is not permitted unless the units are
replaced. Since 1980, the City has required one-for-one replacement of very low, low, and
moderate-income housing units demolished or converted in the coastal zone. Developers
are required to replace the affordable housing by either providing units on site or within
three miles of the coastal zone through the following: 1) new construction; 2) rehabilitation
of substandard units; 3) subsidy of existing higher cost units; or 4) payment of an in-lieu
fee. Through this replacement policy the City has provided 393 affordable housing units in

the coastal zone since 1980. In all cases, the developers opted to pay the in-lieu fees.
Under the City’s replacement housing requirements, payment of the in-lieu fees per City fee
schedule would be considered as fulfilling the replacement requirement. Collected funds
were used to develop two affordable housing projects. Through this replacement policy the
City has provided 393 affordable units in the Coastal Zone since 1980, equivalent to
replacement credits of 428 units (see detailed breakdown in Table 36: Payment of In-Lieu
Fee for Affordable Housing in Coastal Zone).
3. Provisions for a Variety of Housing
Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made
available through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the
development of various types of housing for all economic segments. This includes single
and multi-family housing, factory-built housing, mobile homes, emergency shelters,
transitional housing, supportive housing, and single-room occupancy (SRO) units, among
others. Table 31 summarizes the housing types permitted within Long Beach’s primary
residential zone districts.

In addition to single-family residential opportunities, the following housing types are
available for all economic segments of the community, including lower income residents,
seniors, students, homeless people, and other residents of the City.
Multi-Family Housing
Multi-family housing comprises approximately half of the City’s housing. The City’s Zoning
Code sub-categorizes multi-family housing units into duplexes, three-family dwellings, four-
family dwellings, and multi-family dwellings with five or more units. Duplexes are permitted
in the R-1-T, and R-2, R-3, and R-4 zones. Triplexes are permitted in R-2-A, R-3-S, R-3-4,
and all R-4 zones. Four-family dwellings are permitted in the R-3-S, R-3-4, and R-4 zones.
Finally, multi-family dwellings with five or more units are permitted in the R-4 zones.
Mixed Use Development
Housing can be developed in mixed-use commercial zones, provided it complies with the
specified density and development standards. Townhouses are permitted in the
Neighborhood Commercial and Residential (CNR) zone. R-4-N uses (apartments and
condominiums) are allowed in the CO, CCN, and CT zones. In addition, R-4-R uses
(duplexes, triplexes, and other smaller multi-family complexes) are permitted in the CCR
zone.
Secondary Units
Secondary units are permitted in 12 residential districts as an accessory use. The Zoning
Code permits secondary units, provided the following:
     The lot must be at least 4,800 square feet;
     The unit cannot exceed one bedroom or 640 square feet;
     The unit cannot exceed 10% of existing home’s floor area
     The unit must be located only on lots that contain existing single-family residences;
     The unit must be attached to the principal unit and comply with development
          standards of its underlying zone;
     The principal unit maintains the existing number of parking spaces and provides one
          additional space if the secondary unit exceeds 450 square feet;
     The entrance to the unit cannot be on the front façade; and
     The unit is subject to minimum housing code compliance and the principal unit must
          be brought into compliance before occupancy of the secondary unit is allowed.
Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing
Long Beach has approximately 2,400 mobile homes.                  Recognizing the significant
contribution that mobile homes can make toward providing a variety of housing choices, the
City has established the RM district for mobile home parks. In addition, mobile home parks

are conditionally permitted in all residential zones provided that the specified requirements
are met.
Manufactured or modular housing placed on a permanent foundation is explicitly permitted
in the R-1, R-2 (except R-2-A), and RM zones.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
The City recognizes the need for housing for persons with disabilities (including
developmental disabilities). Through various provisions and incentives, the City offers
ample opportunities for housing that serves this special needs group.
Land Use Control
The City facilitates the development of housing for persons with disabilities via provisions
for group care facilities. The Zoning Code provides for group care facilities through either
Small Group Care Facilities or Special Group Residences, depending on the size.
     Small Group Care Facilities. The Long Beach Zoning Code defines a group home
          as any residential care facility serving six or fewer persons who are mentally
          disordered or otherwise handicapped or supervised. A group home must be
          licensed by the State pursuant to Section 1400 of the Health and Safety Code. In
          compliance with the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act, the City of
          Long Beach permits the siting of State-licensed small group homes serving six or
          fewer persons by right in all residential zones.
     Special Group Residences. The Zoning Code defines special group residences to
          include (but not be limited to): housing for seniors and the disabled, residential care
          facilities, communal housing, convalescent hospitals, half-way houses, and boarding
          houses/lodging houses. These are housing options that meet the census definition
          of group quarters, but not housing units.
          Special group residences are permitted in the higher density R-4 zones, Community
          Commercial CCR and CCN zones subject to a conditional use permit, and in three
          Planned Development Districts. Group housing for seniors and other special group
          housing are also conditionally permitted in the R-4, CCR and CCN zones.
Social services in support of housing for persons with disabilities are classified in the
Zoning Code as Institutional uses. Social services with food distribution are conditionally
permitted in the CHW zone. Social services without food distribution are permitted in the
following zones: Neighborhood Commercial (CNA), Community Commercial (CCA),
Commercial Pedestrian (CP), Community R-4-R Commercial (CCR) and Community R-4-N
Commercial (CCN) through an Administrative Use Permit process. Such uses are also
permitted in the Regional Commercial (CHW) zone.

Therefore, the City offers ample opportunities for the development of housing and
supportive uses for persons with disabilities. In fact, over 100 licensed facilities are located

          of 728 beds;
     7 group homes for children, ranging in size from 6 beds to 29 beds, with a total of 75
          beds;
     2 small family homes for children, totaling 5 beds;
     3 residential care facilities for the chronically ill, totaling 32 beds; and
     42 residential care facilities for the elderly, ranging in size from 4 beds to 262 beds,
          with a total of 2,128 beds.
Overall, nearly 3,000 beds are being provided in these group care facilities.8 The City of
Long Beach, unlike many neighboring areas, has an aggressive program for facilitating and
encouraging the development of special group residences as noted below:
     Special group residences are entitled to apply for a density bonus incentive of up to
          100% above the density allowed in the underlying zone district. In a nonresidential
          zone, density shall be limited to one unit per 200 square feet of lot area, which
          translates into a density of approximately 217 units per acre.
     Handicapped housing, senior housing, and congregate care facilities that are low
          rent are required to have only one parking space per two bedrooms. Residential
          care facilities, sororities, and dormitories require only one space per bedroom.
          Monasteries, convents, etc., require only one space per two beds.
     Section 21.52.271 of the Zoning Code sets forth the same approval process for
          special group residences. Standard conditions are that no similar facility can be
          operate within ½ mile from one another, thus furthering state law and fair housing
          goals to reduce the impaction of lower-income households in any one area.
     The Zoning Code sets forth further incentives for siting special group facilities.
          Because of the low parking demands associated with the uses, each facility must
          only comply with R-4 parking standards (unless provided an incentive), and thus
          shall be located within 1,000 feet by legal pedestrian route to a public transit stop.
Definition of Family
The Zoning Code defines “family” as “any group of individuals living together based on
personal relationships. Family does not include larger institutional group living situations
such as dormitories, fraternities, sororities, monasteries, nunneries, residential care
facilities or military barracks, nor does it include such commercial group living
arrangements such as boarding houses, lodging houses and the like.”

Because the City facilitates housing for persons with disabilities through its provisions for
small group care facilities and special group residences, this definition does not conflict with
the City’s policies regarding housing for persons with disabilities. The City has reviewed
this definition and determined that it does not present potential constraints to housing for
persons with disabilities. The City of Long Beach has an excellent track record of providing
various housing options for special needs population. Nevertheless, the City will amend
the Zoning Code to revise the definition of family to “any group of individuals living together
based on personal relationships.”
Building Code
The City adopted the 2013 California Building Code, to be effective on January 1, 2014. No
unique restrictions are in place that would constrain the development of housing for
persons with disabilities. Compliance with provisions of the Building Code is reviewed and
enforced by the Building Division of the Development Services Department as a part of the
building permit submittal.
Planning/Processing Fees
Small group care facilities are permitted by right and no entitlement fee is required. Special
group care facilities (for more than six persons) are permitted via a CUP, requiring payment
of a processing fee. However, given the number of large residential care facilities located
in the City, the City’s processing fee is not seen as a constraint to the development of
housing for persons with disabilities.
Reasonable Accommodation
It is the policy of the City, pursuant to the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988,
to provide people with disabilities reasonable accommodation in rules, policies, practices
and procedures that may be necessary to ensure equal access to housing. The City has
adopted specific procedures in the Zoning Code for processing reasonable accommodation
requests.
In order to make specific housing available to persons with disabilities, a disabled person or
representative may request reasonable accommodation relating to the various land use,
zoning, or building laws, rules, policies, practices and/or procedures of the City. If an
individual needs assistance in making the request for reasonable accommodation, or
appealing a determination regarding reasonable accommodation, the Development
Services Department will provide the assistance necessary to ensure that the process is
accessible to the applicant or representative. The applicant is entitled to be represented at
all stages of the proceeding by a person designated by the applicant.
A request for reasonable accommodation in laws, rules, policies, practices and/or
procedures may be filed on an application form provided by the Development Services
Department at any time that the accommodation may be necessary to ensure equal access
to housing.

When a request for reasonable accommodation is filed with the Development Services
Department, it will be referred to the Zoning Administrator or Building Official for review and
consideration. The Zoning Administrator or Building Official will issue a written
determination within 30 days and may (1) grant the accommodation request; (2) grant the
accommodation request subject to specified nondiscriminatory conditions; or (3) deny the
request. All written determinations will give notice of the right to appeal and the right to
request reasonable accommodation on the appeals process, if necessary.
The following findings must be analyzed, made and adopted before any action is taken to
approve or deny a request for reasonable accommodation:
     The housing will be used by an individual protected under the Fair Housing Act.
     The request is necessary to make the housing available to an individual protected
          under the Fair Housing Act.
     The requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial or administrative
          burden on the City.
     The requested accommodation will not require a fundamental alteration of the
          zoning or building laws, policies and/or procedures of the City.
     For housing located in the coastal zone, a request for reasonable accommodation
          will be approved by the City if it is also consistent with the certified Local Coastal
          Program (LCP). Where a request is not consistent with the LCP, the City may waive
          compliance if the City finds:
          o The requested accommodation is consistent, to the maximum extent feasible,
              with the LCP; and,
          o There are no feasible alternative means for providing an accommodation at the
              property that would provide greater consistency with the LCP.
The City defines a group home as one for no more than six persons. A request for
reasonable accommodation relating to increased occupancy of a group home can be filed
with the Zoning Administrator. A hearing with the Zoning Administrator or the Planning
Commission is required to act on a request to increase the number of occupants for a
group home. A decision must be made within 30 days by the Zoning Administrator or
within 60 days by the Planning Commission.
Emergency Shelters
Senate Bill No. 2 (2007) amended Sections 65582, 65583, and 65589.5 of the Government
Code relating to local planning. This bill added emergency shelters to these provisions and
required that the Housing Element identify zones in the City where emergency shelters are
allowed as a permitted use without a Conditional Use Permit. State law defines an
emergency shelter as a means of housing with minimal supportive services for homeless
persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person. No
individual or household may be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay.
Prior to 2013, the City conditionally permitted the siting of shelters for no more than six
persons in two Community Commercial districts – Community R4R (CCR) and Community
City of Long Beach                                                                        Page 70

R4N (CCN). In addition, halfway houses have been conditionally permitted as special
group care facilities in R4, CCR, CCN, and CHW (Community Commercial – Regional
Highway) districts. Through these provisions, the City has facilitated the siting of many
homeless shelters in the community, including Catholic Charities Shelter (54 beds for
families), Long Beach Rescue Mission (130 beds for men), Lydia House (40 beds for
women and children), Women Shelter (32 beds for domestic violence victims), Project
Achieve (59 beds for adults), etc.
Pursuant to commitments in the 2008-2014 Housing Element, the City amended the Zoning
Code in 2013 to allow by-right emergency shelters in the IP-Port zone and in PD-31
Villages at Cabrillo. Primary reasons for permitting by-right emergency shelter beds in
these two zones are: 1) these zones/areas already contain a concentration of primary,
necessary support services for individuals and families experiencing emergency,
transitional, and sometimes permanent housing needs; 2) they have ample capacity to
bridge the gap between what is currently needed in emergency shelter beds and what is
currently provided; and 3) these homeless service centers are close to each other and
easily accessible along bus service routes.
The Continuum of Care Program, Program 2.1 in the Housing Plan section of the Element
discusses the services and facilities available at both The Villages at Cabrillo and the City’s
Health and Human Services Multi-Service Center (MSC). The Villages at Cabrillo is
located just east of the Terminal Island Freeway (I-47), north of Pacific Coast Highway, and
west of Santa Fe Avenue. The Multi-Service Center is located 1.5 miles to the southeast of
the Villages at Cabrillo on the south side of Anaheim Street just west of the Long Beach
Freeway (I-710). Santa Fe Avenue would be the north/south main bus corridor connecting
these two facilities. Bus shelters and bus benches are found along Pacific Coast Highway,
Santa Fe Avenue, and Anaheim Street.
Since 1997, the Multi-Service Center, a collaborative partnership between the City of Long
Beach, the Port of Long Beach, and twelve public and private partner agencies has been
located on this IP-zoned site at 1301-1327 W. 12th Street. Services at the Center include:
showers, laundry, mail, medical clinic, employment assistance, case management, and
shelter and housing placement assistance.
Similarly, The Villages at Cabrillo located nearby in PD-31, is a collaborative partnership of
17 agencies, which currently provide the largest non-governmental housing and social
services program for homeless people in the United States. Built on a former naval
housing site, new housing here ranges from emergency and transitional shelters to
permanent-affordable housing for singles, families, Native Americans and veterans.
Additionally, support services include childcare, employment counseling, mental health and
medical care. They also have a program to help homeless children re-integrate into the
public school system in Long Beach. Three facilities have opened in The Villages since
2009. The Family Commons, which opened in 2009 features 81 units of permanent
affordable housing in six residential buildings, along with three new community buildings.
The majority of the population in the Family Commons is of Long Beach origins. This
facility is specifically targeted to providing assistance to homeless families with mental

disabilities. The Knabe Exchange, a new 5,829-square-foot supportive services and
commercial facility with a focus on veterans, also opened in 2009. In 2012, the Elizabeth
Ann Seton Residence began serving homeless families. As of 2013, this facility has 54
beds.
Hence, the nexus between providing supportive services and supportive housing is a
strong reason for emergency shelters in PD-31 and in the IP- port zone. Furthermore,
access between The Villages at Cabrillo and the Multi-Service Center is straightforward
and convenient. Service providers currently operate free shuttles between the two sites,
and both Anaheim Street and Santa Fe Avenue serve as major bus routes with public bus
stops within a reasonable distance to the entrance of each facility.
According to the Continuum of Care Homeless Population Gaps Analysis the City’s
emergency shelter gap is 1,620 beds for individuals (Table 15). Housing law requires
jurisdictions to review their shelter gaps and identify at least one land use zone where
shelters can be built, by right, to address this gap. City staff has found that there is
adequate capacity for development of emergency shelter facilities and transitional housing
for those in need in the IP zone. Assuming that the docks, piers and primary port activity
areas will not be targeted for emergency shelters, this leaves an area north of the Southern
Pacific Railroad right-of -way, south of Anaheim Street, between the Terminal Island (I-47)
and Long Beach Freeways (I-710).
In this IP-Port-zoned area there are 55.3 acres of land with 37.9 of these acres (68.5%)
owned by the City of Long Beach. Of the 163 parcels in the area, 102 of them are City-
owned. Additionally, there are a number of opportunities for an emergency shelter to lease
space in existing buildings located within a three- to ten-minute walk of the Multi-Service
Center (MSC).
It should be emphasized that the City has been working cooperatively with the Port of Long
Beach for more than a decade in operating the Multi-Service Center on the site at 1301-
1327 W. 12th Street. Offering the opportunity for shelter beds to be accommodated on sites
in the IP zone and at the Villages at Cabrillo should create no hardship, especially since
performance standards for emergency shelters will be instituted, including: maximum
number of beds permitted; proximity to other shelters; length of stay permitted; location and
size of waiting drop-off areas; security and lighting; and provisions for on-site management.
Transitional and Supportive Housing
Section 50675.2(h) of Health and Safety Code defines transitional housing as buildings
configured as rental housing developments, but operated under program requirements that
call for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible
program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less than
six months. Section 50675.14(b) of Health and Safety Code defines supportive housing as
housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target population as defined
in subdivision (d) of Section 53260, and that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist

                                                                     HOUSING RESOURCES
the supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status,
and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community.
The City of Long Beach is actively facilitating and encouraging the conversion of surplus
naval property to one of the largest transitional housing facilities for homeless persons in
the nation. The Villages at Cabrillo provides 300+ beds of transitional housing and services
for men, women, and unaccompanied youth. The City of Long Beach regulates transitional
and supportive housing as a residential use in the same manner as similar uses in the
same zone, as:
     Residential Care Facilities – if they meet the State definition under the Lanterman
          Disability Services Act;
     Dwelling Units – if they meet the California Building Code definition of a dwelling
          unit; or
     Special Group Residence – if they do not meet either of the above definitions.
In 2013, the City codified a Zoning Administrator Interpretation to ensure that transitional
and supportive housing is regulated as a residential use and subject to the same conditions
for similar uses in the same zone.
Single-Room Occupancy Units
Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) units are one of the most traditional forms of affordable
private housing for lower income individuals, including seniors and persons with disabilities.
An SRO unit is usually small, between 80 and 250 square feet. These units provide a
valuable source of affordable housing and can serve as an entry point into the housing
market for formerly homeless people.
Currently the Long Beach Zoning Code does not contain specific provisions for SRO units.
Through Program 2.2 the Zoning Code will be amended to incorporate SRO housing under
the provisions for Special Group Residence. Conditions for approval will be objective and
pertain to performance standards such as parking, management and security. Such
conditions will be similar to those required for other special group residence uses in the
same zone.
4. Building Codes and Enforcement
Long Beach has adopted building and safety codes in order to preserve public health,
safety, and welfare. To implement these codes, the City has various code enforcement
programs designed to address building and neighborhood conditions. These building codes
and their enforcement have the potential to significantly increase the cost of development,
maintenance, and improvement of housing.
     Building Codes - Long Beach has adopted and enforces the California Building
          Code (CBC) that establishes standards pertaining to the construction of housing and
          inspection at various stages of construction to ensure code compliance.
City of Long Beach                                                                      Page 73

     Accessibility Codes - The Federal Fair Housing Act of 1998 and the American
          Disabilities Act (ADA) are federal laws that are intended to assist in the provision of
          safe and accessible housing. These regulations were codified in Title 24, Part 2,
          known as the California Building Code and apply to newly constructed multi-family
          dwelling units in building with three or more units or in condominium projects with
          four or more units. The City of Long Beach has adopted and enforces compliance
          with these standards to comply with federal law.
     City Code Enforcement - The City’s Development Services Department enforces
          State and local regulations governing the maintenance of residential buildings. The
          Code Enforcement Division administers programs to facilitate neighborhood
          upgrading, including property maintenance, weed abatement, and other citywide
          programs. In addition, the City implements a Neighborhood Improvement Strategy
          (NIS). The NIS program aims to improve the quality of life in specific CDBG-targeted
          areas through a partnership of City staff, other agencies and neighborhood
          residents.
     Community Code Enforcement - The Community Code Enforcement program is
          designed to customize actions to fit the needs of a specific neighborhood. Target
          areas under the program are selected upon the presence of established, active
          community groups, and the need for code enforcement to assist in stabilizing and
          improving the neighborhood. The City provides the community with an individual
          point of contact and City staff members who can coordinate with various
          governmental agencies in addressing multi-faceted problems.
Building codes and their enforcement increase the cost of housing investment and can
impact the viability of rehabilitating older properties required to be upgraded to current code
standards. To the extent this makes the cost of housing production or rehabilitation
economically infeasible, it could serve as a constraint. However, these regulations are
similar to cities in the region, provide minimum standards for safe and accessible housing,
and thus are not considered to be an undue constraint upon housing investment.
5. Development Permit Procedures
Communities can encourage needed reinvestment in the housing stock by reducing the
time and uncertainty involved in obtaining development permits. Pursuant to the State
Permit Streamlining Act, governmental delays are recommended to be reduced by: (1)
limiting processing time in most cases to one year; and (2) by requiring agencies to specify
the information needed to complete an acceptable application. Table 32 summarizes the
approximate planning project processing time in the City and Table 33 summarizes the
building timelines.
Residential projects of less than five housing units typically do not require committee
review. Projects with 5 to 49 units that comply with all standards and have no other zoning
entitlements are only subject to Staff Site Plan Review, which takes approximately five
weeks. Planning Commission Site Plan Review is necessary for developments with 50 or
City of Long Beach                                                                        Page 74

more units, and projects that require a Negative Declaration or Conditional Use Permit.
The approximate time needed for Commission Site Plan Review is 11 weeks. As shown in
Table 33, for the issuance of building permits, most projects are able to complete the
review process within three months. Building permits for multi-family projects take between
four and five months. Comparatively, among larger cities in the Los Angeles Basin, Long
Beach has relatively short processing times for routine planning and permit processing
actions.
While the City requires legislative approval of multi-family projects of 50 or more units, this
process has not impeded residential development. As evidenced in Section 4, Housing
Resources, of this Housing Element, many of the entitled projects have more than 50
units.
To facilitate multi-family residential and mixed use developments, the City offers pre-
application study sessions with the Planning Commission at no cost to the applicants.
These pre-application study sessions allow the applicants to gain an understanding in the
City’s goals and objectives for the project site, and therefore be able to craft a project that
can take advantage of the flexibility offered through the PD zoning regulations and address
City issues and concerns. In most cases, developers do take advantage of the pre-
application study sessions.

Site Plan Review
The requirements and process for site plan review are clearly specified in the City’s Zoning
Code. The following residential projects require site plan review:
     Five or more units as one project;
     Construction of a new dwelling unit or an addition greater than 450 square feet in
          size to an existing dwelling, located on a lot less than 27 feet in width in the R-1-N,
          R-1-M, R-2-N, and R-2-A districts;
     Any project proposing to utilize the incentive program established for very low and
          low income households; and
     Any residential project proposing to utilize a wing wall.
A residential project of 50 or more units is also required to submit a conceptual site plan for
review by staff prior to formal site plan review.
At the Site Plan Review, the review committee (either staff or Planning Commission) can
request reasonable conditions for approval of the site plan, including:
     A revised site plan;
     Reduced building height, bulk or mass;
     Increased setbacks;
     Changes in building material;
     Changes in rooflines;
     Increased usable open space;
     Increased screening of garages, trash receptacles, motors or mechanical
          equipment;
     Increased landscaping;
     Increased framing, molding or other detailing;
     Change in color; or
     Other changes or additions that are necessary to further the goals of the site plan
          review process.
These are typical conditions to improve the performance of the project and design
compatibility with surrounding uses in order to make the following findings for approval:
     The design is harmonious, consistent and complete within itself and is compatible in
          design, character and scale, with neighboring structures and the community in which
          it is located;
     The design conforms to any applicable special design guidelines adopted by the
          planning commission or specific plan requirements, such as the design guidelines
          for R3 and R4 multi-family development, the downtown design guidelines, PD
          guidelines or the general plan;

     The design will not remove significant mature trees or street trees, unless no
          alternative design is possible;
     There is an essential nexus between the public improvement requirements
          established by this ordinance and the likely impacts of the proposed development;
          and
     The project conforms to all the transportation demand management requirements.
In addition, the review committee has authority to waive certain development standards,
including standards that may make a critical difference to the feasibility of a project. The
list of possible waivers includes requirements for open space, courtyard dimensions, and
guest parking, among others. Specific findings are necessary for such waivers, in addition
to the approval findings described above.
Development Services Center
Pursuant to the Permit Streamlining Act, the Permit Center serves as a one-stop
processing counter staffed with representatives from various City departments. In
particular, the Planning Counter processes the following: coastal permits, standards
variances, conditional use permits, subdivision maps, certificates of compliance, lot line
adjustments, and condominium conversion permits. Permits issued by other counters at
the Center include sewer permits, health permits, and all building, electrical, plumbing, and
mechanical permits for new buildings and additions/alterations to existing buildings. In
many cases, developers can apply for permits via the City’s website. By offering a
consolidated services center and web access, the City can effectively reduce the costs of
processing routine permits and facilitate and encourage housing production.
6. Fees and Exactions
Planning Fees
Development service fees charged by local governments contribute to the cost of
maintaining, developing, and improving housing. Long Beach collects fees to recover the
costs of processing permits and providing the necessary services and infrastructure related
to new development. Table 34 summarizes the common planning fees charged for
providing associated services for new housing development. Certain fees have been
reduced in FY 2013 and all fees are held constant for FY 2014.
The City conducts an annual assessment of its service fees to ensure that they reflect the
cost of providing services and attempts to keep fees in line with other communities. Fees
are generally increased based on a comparative survey and increase in the CPI. Fees are
generally not waived, because they represent the actual cost for service, are a relatively
minor portion of the total building valuation, and therefore are not considered to be an
undue constraint upon the production or maintenance of housing.

Development Impact Fees
In addition to planning fees, the City of Long Beach charges various development impact
fees upon new development. In contrast to service fees that recover the costs of providing
services, impact fees are intended to fund the improvements in infrastructure and services
needed to accommodate new housing development. For instance, common examples
include school fees, park and recreation fees, sewer fees, and transportation improvement
fees. Table 35 below details these impact fees. School fees are set by the Long Beach
Unified School District (LBUSD) pursuant to State legislation. The City does not assess or
collect the fees on behalf of LBUSD.

To ensure that development impact fees are reasonably related to the costs to extend
infrastructure, public services, and facilities, the City conducts a periodic nexus study that
links service costs to the actual impacts of the development. However, to ensure that fees
do not constrain the production of affordable housing, the City waives development impact
fees – parks and recreation and transportation improvement fees – for housing that is
dedicated as affordable to lower income households.
Recent studies compared Long Beach fees with those of other California jurisdictions. A
2011 study for the City of Long Beach examined combined plan check, permit, and impact
fees in eleven California cities using sample projects. Fees in Long Beach, as a
percentage of project cost, ranked in the middle of fees for the eleven cities for new single-
family homes and for a 50-unit mixed-use project. For a small 8-unit multi-family project,
Long Beach fees ranked third in the study. A 2012 national study of impact fees provides a
similar assessment of fee costs in Long Beach in comparison to other California cities.

7. Site Improvements
Site improvements are an important component of new development and include water,
sewer, circulation, and other infrastructure needed to support development. Long Beach
requires pro-rata payments for off-site extension of the water, sewer and storm drain
systems, and pro-rata payments for traffic signals. It requires the developer to construct all
internal streets, sidewalks, curb, gutter, affected off-street arterials, and landscaping. New
residential construction will occur as infill, where infrastructure is in place. While these
impact affordability, these requirements are deemed necessary to maintain the quality of
life desired by City residents, and are consistent with the City’s General Plan goals to
ensure that public services and facilities are in place at the time of need, thus avoiding the
overloading of existing urban service systems.
8. Coastal Zone Housing
State Housing Element law requires a review of the City’s success in maintaining affordable
units in the coastal zone. Pursuant to Government Code (GC) Section 65590, “the
conversion or demolition of existing residential dwelling units occupied by persons and
families of low or moderate income…shall not be authorized unless provision has been
made for the replacement of those dwelling units with units for persons and families of low
or moderate income.” However, the GC further stipulates several exemptions to the
replacement requirement. Specifically, GC 65590(b)(3) provides the following exemption:
          “The conversion or demolition of a residential structure located within the
          jurisdiction of a local government which has within the area encompassing the
          coastal zone, and three miles inland therefrom, less than 50 acres, in
          aggregate, of land which is vacant, privately owned and available for
          residential use.”
The City of Long Beach is primarily built out with less than 50 acres of vacant, privately
owned, residential land in or within three miles of the Coastal Zone. The most significant
opportunities for residential use within three miles of the Coastal Zone are parking lots in
the Downtown area, which are owned by the City, not privately held.
Nevertheless, the City of Long Beach adopted its own ordinance (MC 21.61 - Maintenance
of Low Income Housing in the Coastal Zone), providing for one-for-one replacement for
very low, low and moderate income housing units removed by new construction or
conversion to other non-residential uses. The City ordinance allows for several methods of
replacement:
     On-site new units;
     Off-site new units;
     Off-site rehabilitated units;
     Off-site converted units; or
     In-lieu fees.
City of Long Beach                                                                       Page 80

                                                                    HOUSING RESOURCES
The City’s in-lieu fees were established by ordinance and are updated annually in
accordance with the change in the Building Cost Index (BCI) from January to January.
Currently, the fees range from $18,000 to $46,000 per removed unit depending on the
unit’s size and affordability level. Partial credits are given if the developer is already
required to pay relocation assistance. Funds collected are deposited into a special account
administered by the City within the City’s dedicated Housing Fund. Chapter 21.61
stipulates that in-lieu fees are to be used for the production of affordable housing within 36
months of receipt, within the area located south of the area bounded by the Los Angeles
River on the West, Pacific Coast Highway on the North, and 7th Street on the East.
Depending on the market conditions and the specific opportunities available for affordable
housing development at the time (such as new construction vs. rehabilitation), the amount
of subsidies required to provide affordable housing varies. Therefore, the City’s ordinance
assumes the payment of in-lieu fees according to the City’s established fee schedule to
have met the one-to-one replacement requirement.
The ordinance also provides for two exemptions from the replacement requirements:
     If the residential structure has been condemned and would require the expenditure
          of 50% or more of the improvement value (not including land value) to meet
          applicable building codes; or
     If the removal is for the purpose of building two or fewer residential units, or for
          converting two or fewer rental units to condominium type units.
In the City’s Coastal Zone, since 1980, 375 affordable units have been demolished and 54
affordable units have been converted to market-rate condominiums for a total of 429 units.
Table 36 summarizes the affordable units removed between 2000 and 2012.

In all cases above, the developers opted to pay in-lieu fees totaling $2,152,168, which
accrued interest totaling $80,610. Under the City’s replacement housing requirements,
payment of the in-lieu fees per City fee schedule would be considered as fulfilling the
replacement requirement of 111 units. Funds from the Coastal Zone Replacement Housing
Fund were used toward two projects with a total of 76 units (Puerto Del Sol and Palace
Hotel). The Coastal Zone Replacement Housing Fund currently has a balance of $47,346.

C. Environmental and Infrastructure Constraints
Environmental issues and infrastructure capacity or other limitations could possibly affect
the type and amount of residential development in a given location. If not mitigated, these
types of constraints could preclude a jurisdiction from facilitating the development of
housing that is needed to address a community’s Regional Housing Needs Assessment
(RHNA) assignment. None of the sites being used to address the City’s new RHNA targets
have environmental or infrastructure constraints. Nevertheless, this section addresses the
environmental and infrastructure constraints in the City of Long Beach and the actions that
have been taken to mitigate these constraints to the potential development of housing.
City Infrastructure
Long Beach was incorporated 125 years ago in 1888. Today, the City is highly urbanized
and fully developed. The only remaining theoretically developable parcels (assuming that
parks, beaches and wetlands will be preserved) are either brown fields or other lands that
can be recycled for new uses. No new streets are needed; water, sewer and power lines
service all properties. With respect to needed infrastructure able to support additional
housing development, there are no known constraints. However, like most developed
communities, one of the City’s major challenges is to maintain this infrastructure in good
condition and working at optimal levels to serve the needs of residents and businesses.
The long and short term Capital Improvement Programs are designed to address these
concerns.

Geologic Conditions
Located directly adjacent to and between the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers, with
eight miles of coastline, the City is situated on a coastal plain with relatively unstable soils
(i.e., terrace deposits). The potential for flooding and liquefaction are an ongoing concern
for the City, and steps have been taken to mitigate these hazards. For instance, following
the discovery of oil here in the 1920s, by the 1950s areas along the downtown and in the
port experienced severe subsidence when oil and gas resources were extracted. In 1958,
a full-scale water injection system was initiated to repressurize and stabilize these areas.
With this Wilmington Oil Field underlying the coastline a very important national resource,
and oil operations continuing for the foreseeable future, this water injection system is
maintained to protect the developments on the surface above – including a lot of new
housing recently constructed in the City’s downtown.
Similarly, following severe storms and flooding in the City’s early history, an extensive
breakwater was constructed to protect lives and properties situated on the peninsula and
along the shoreline. Although studies are planned to examine the reconfiguration of this
breakwater in order to allow more surf and better offshore water quality, it is not expected
that alterations to the breakwater would impact any potential development sites.
Although potential land subsidence is an issue, the most pervasive geologic hazard in Long
Beach is that of an earthquake. The City is bisected diagonally across the center by the
Newport Inglewood Fault Zone. Again, because of the relatively unstable soils beneath the
surface in some areas, a major earthquake along this fault could cause widespread
devastation. In fact, the City experienced such a quake in 1933 where lives were lost and
many buildings destroyed. Learning from that episode, the City has developed a reputation
for applying strict building standards, and initiating and supporting State legislation to
protect lives and property from potential earthquake damage. The Alquist-Priolo Special
Studies Zone Act of 1973 was adopted to mitigate the potential impacts from an earthquake
by requiring buildings to be set back from the fault zone. Further, several years ago levees
along both the San Gabriel and Los Angeles Rivers were raised and improved to mitigate
exposure to flooding should an earthquake occur.

IV. HOUSING RESOURCES
This section describes and analyzes resources available for development, rehabilitation,
and preservation of housing in the City of Long Beach. This includes the availability of land
resources and the City’s ability to satisfy its share of the region’s future housing needs,
financial resources available to support the provision of affordable housing, and
administrative resources available to assist in implementing the City’s housing programs.
A. Opportunities for Residential Development
1. Regional Housing Needs Assessment
State Housing Element law requires that a local jurisdiction accommodate a share of the
region’s projected housing needs for the planning period. This share, called the Regional
Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA), is important because State law mandates that
jurisdictions provide sufficient land to accommodate a variety of housing opportunities for
all economic segments of the community. Compliance with this requirement is measured
by the jurisdiction’s ability in providing adequate land to accommodate the RHNA.
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), as the regional planning
agency, is responsible for allocating the RHNA to individual jurisdictions within the six-
county region, including the County of Los Angeles.9 The RHNA is distributed by income
category. For the 2013 Housing Element update, the City of Long Beach is allocated a
RHNA of 7,048 units as follows:
     Extremely Low Income (up to 30% of AMI): 886 units10 (12%)
     Very Low Income (31% to 50% of AMI): 887 units (13%)
     Low Income (51% to 80% of AMI): 1,066 units (15%)
     Moderate Income (81% to 120% of AMI): 1,170 units (17%)
     Above Moderate Income (more than 120% of AMI): 3,039 units (43%)
The RHNA for this planning period commences on January 1, 2014 and covers through
October 31, 2021. The City must ensure the availability of residential sites at adequate
densities and appropriate development standards to accommodate these units. An
important component of Long Beach’s Housing Element is the identification of sites for
future residential development, and evaluation of the adequacy of these sites in fulfilling the
City’s share of regional housing needs as determined by SCAG.
9
     Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) covers a six-county region, including Los Angeles, Orange,
     Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, and Imperial.
10
     The City has a RHNA allocation of 1,773 very low income units (inclusive of extremely low income units). Pursuant to
     State law (AB 2634), the City must project the number of extremely low income housing needs based on Census
     income distribution or assume 50% of the very low income units as extremely low. Therefore, the City’s RHNA of
     1,773 very low income units may be split accordingly into 886 extremely low (50%) and 887 very low income (50%)
     units. However, for purposes of identifying adequate sites for the RHNA, State law does not mandate the separate
     accounting for the extremely low income category.

2. Future Residential Development Potential
Future residential development will focus in several planned development districts and
high-density residential areas.
Entitled and Proposed Developments
Because the RHNA for this 2013-2021 Housing Element begins on January 1, 2014,
housing developments that have received entitlement but are not expected to issue building
permits until January 2014 can be credited toward the RHNA. Table 38 lists the projects
that have received entitlement but are not yet permitted. Among the entitled projects, the
majority of the units are market-rate units and therefore not likely to be affordable to lower
income households. However, two affordable housing projects have been entitled –
MetaHousing and Safran Senior Housing Project. These two projects will provide a total of
66 lower income units. One proposed project is being reviewed.

Identifying Sites Suitable for Housing
In identifying the sites available for accommodating the 2014-2021 RHNA, the City began
by reviewing and updating the sites inventory compiled for the previous Housing Element
(2008-2014). Due to the depressed housing market and associated economic recession,
development activities in the City have slowed in recent years. Many of the sites identified
in 2008 are still available for development.
The original sites inventory was compiled using Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
analysis, staff knowledge, and field survey. Using the GIS, existing zoning (units/acre) and
parcel area were used to calculate the potential maximum housing units allowed per parcel
for the entire 50 square mile City. Then the improvement-to-land value ratio for each parcel
was calculated by dividing the value of improvements (buildings) by the value of the land
(from Los Angeles County Assessor data). For example, a parcel with improvements worth
$500,000 and land worth $1 million would have an improvement ratio of 0.5. The lower the
improvement ratio, the higher the potential for recycling the parcel into a new development.
Then, the list of parcels was sorted by maximum housing units permitted. Only parcels with
an improvement ratio of less than 0.6 were included. Parcels with improvement ratios
higher than 0.6 were considered less likely to recycle than those with lower improvement
ratios. This is a fairly conservative assumption as economic studies typically use a ratio of
1.0 as threshold for recycling feasibility. This analysis identified 120 parcels that could
accommodate 12 units or more on each individual parcel (the size of a small garden
apartment building). This list was reexamined to verify that the GIS analysis was identifying
valid parcels. (A density of at least 30 units/acre is needed to accommodate lower income
housing targets.) Staff knowledge of existing uses, aerial photos, and field checks were
used to screen properties with near-term development potential.
Staff reviewed the 2008 sites inventory, updated status of specific sites, and re-evaluated
potential development based on current trends. To accommodate the 2014-2021 RHNA,
additional sites are included in the inventory. Ultimately 31 sites are included in the sites
inventory (many with multiple contiguous parcels) as having the potential to accommodate
the City’s RHNA (Table 39Error! Reference source not found.). A detailed list of the
properties identified is included in Appendix B.
The City primarily focuses in areas where densities can exceed 30 units per acre. Each
site is comprised of multiple contiguous parcels with lot consolidation potential. Among the
31 sites identified (see Table 39), seven are vacant, with the remaining 24 sites being
developed with existing but underutilized or marginally viable businesses. The majority of
the underutilized sites are currently used as surface parking lots, vacated buildings; others
are occupied by small independent businesses. These uses do not represent the highest
and best uses for the sites and are not consistent with the City’s vision for these areas.
Specifically, Sites 2, 3, 6, 13, 19, and 22 are interim surface parking lots under City
ownership. Several are vacant lots owned by the City (Sites 12 and 24), and several are
vacant lots owned by the LBCIC (Sites 27, 28, and 31). In addition, one vacant lot is
owned by Habitat for Humanity.

The World Trade Center (Site 1), is “over-parked” by code due to the recent adoption of the
Downtown Plan, which reduced required parking for uses in the Downtown area.
Specifically, for office buildings, required parking was reduced from four spaces per 1,000
square feet to two spaces per 1,000 square feet. This reduction in parking provides
significant opportunities for development of the existing surface parking lot at World Trade
Center. As with any development project, staff will review the proposals for compliance
with applicable City regulations, including parking, to determine the appropriateness of the
development. If a development project seeks to remove existing required parking, that
parking will either need to be replaced in the new development or a parking management
plan must be developed to justify the removal of the required parking. Neither of these
scenarios reduces the viability of these sites for high-density residential uses. Furthermore,
the City has seen previous proposals for the World Trade Center under the old regulations
(with higher parking requirements) that replaced the existing surface parking and still
provided 1,370 units.
Given the densities permitted in these areas, significant economic incentives are present to
induce recycling of these properties to higher intensity uses. Recent development activities
in these areas demonstrate a strong trend of recycling existing low-density uses to high-
density developments. Most of the projects described below under “Achievable Densities”
involve lot consolidation and recycling of existing uses of similar character and economic
status as properties identified in this sites inventory.
These 31 sites total approximately 56 acres and can accommodate 7,044 new units. The
majority of the sites can be developed at densities that are at least 30 units per acre, the
density threshold established by the State as feasible for facilitating lower income
development in metropolitan areas. Particularly, a few sites are located in the PD 30
Downtown Plan area, where height and density are not limited. Significant potential also
exists on R-4-U properties where the maximum permitted density is 108 units per acre.
It should be noted these 31 “sites” represent in reality 31 “groupings of contiguous parcels.”
22 of the 31 “sites” can accommodate at least 100 units, with most “sites” being able to
accommodate at least 200 units. As shown earlier in Table 22, most affordable housing
projects have 100 or fewer units. Therefore, while some lot consolidation is required, it is
not the intent of the City to require that these sites be developed as large-scale residential
developments. Any combination of contiguous parcels may be possibly consolidated to
generate a range of housing types.
Also by no means do these sites represent the full inventory of vacant and underutilized
sites with residential development potential in the City of Long Beach. The sites identified
represent the sites considered to be most appropriate and feasible for residential
development in the near term.

Notes:
1. Appendix B has more detail on each of these sites.
2. Site 28 is anticipated to have a density of 17 units per acre. However, this is a site owned by the LBCIC and therefore future
     development on this site is expected to be housing affordable to lower income households, regardless of density.

Achievable Densities
In estimating development potential, the maximum permitted densities are used.
Although the Zoning Code does not specify a minimum density for many districts,
maximum densities are typically achieved in the R-4 zone, PD 29 and PD 30 districts.
In the Downtown Plan area where height and density are not limited, recent projects are
developed at approximately 200 units per acre.              Some recent developments
demonstrate that the maximum permitted densities are achievable with the development
standards established for the zones (Table 40). Specifically, much of the City’s future
development is expected to occur in Planned Development Districts, where flexibility in
development standards is already built into the regulations for these Districts.
These recent projects demonstrate a consistent trend of reaching or exceeding the
maximum densities in these zones. No special waiver or concession was needed to
allow these projects to reach maximum densities. Therefore, in estimating capacity for
potential development, the City uses the maximum permitted densities. The City will
monitor development in these districts to ensure the City’s continued ability in meeting
the RHNA.

Infrastructure
The sites proposed to address the 2013 Housing Element are suitable for development.
The vacant and underutilized sites are not constrained by environmental issues that
could limit development to the maximum allowable densities. The sites are not
constrained by the availability of infrastructure, public services and facilities that may be
needed to support that development. Therefore, the development potential represents a
realistic estimate.
Developable Lots and Parcel Assembly
During the public outreach process, the public was asked specifically to provide input on
“where new housing should be located.” The top-ranking response from this outreach
process was to locate new housing near public transportation (see Appendix A).
A number of sites suitable for housing development (Appendix B) are along the Metro
Blue Line passenger rail, which runs from Long Beach to Los Angeles. The City in
partnership with SCAG is examining the nodes around the City’s Metro Blue Line
stations to increase walkability and encourage compact development. Facilitating
Transit Oriented Development (TOD) is a high priority for SCAG’s regional Compass
Blueprint program as these passenger rail stations are highly transportation efficient and
provide significant opportunities for balancing job and housing locations. These areas
are also consistent with SB 226 urban infill CEQA reform legislation that encourages
new compact development in areas already well-served by transit.
Furthering the TOD orientation, the City is using a different SCAG grant to develop a
new Long Beach Boulevard Midtown Specific Plan, updating the Long Beach Boulevard
Planned Development District (PD-29). This provides the financial and visioning tools
for the preparation of a new PD-29 ordinance that will expand the design guidance for
the corridor to create a more pedestrian oriented environment. The approach is to
provide the City with a fiscal analysis for a development model, “complete street” urban
design modeling, and land use code recommendations. The emphasis is on work
products that have a strong educational component, as development and
redevelopment depend on land use and construction economics that “pencil out.” The
focus of the plan is to create additional development opportunities and to create a
wellness corridor, including a wider range of housing types as well as recreational
opportunities for existing and new residents.
The Planned Development District zoning for Long Beach Boulevard (PD-29) has been
in place since 1993, following the opening of the Metro Blue Line. This ordinance calls
for significant recycling of underutilized and inappropriate (old auto row) uses and
“intends to ensure that the Boulevard’s important functional, aesthetic, and economic
roles are not undermined or preempted by incompatible uses or construction.” PD-29
recognizes that the original platting of land along the Boulevard (with many narrow and
shallow lots) tends to impede reinvestment and development of appropriate uses today
along this street, and makes provisions for lot consolidation (requires street frontages of
City of Long Beach                                                                      Page 92

                                                                             HOUSING PLAN
lots on the Boulevard to no less than 150 feet in width) and encourages assemblage of
small lots into sites large enough to ensure an appropriate level of economic utilization
through density/FAR incentives.
Pertaining to the development of non-residential uses in Planned Development Districts
29 (Long Beach Boulevard) and 30 (Downtown) and how that could affect achieving the
densities anticipated for future development in these areas, on these sites, City
planners do not see this as an issue or obstacle for a number of reasons.
     1. Over the last ten to fifteen years, local development history is that mixed use
          zoned properties in the Downtown (PD-30) and along Long Beach Boulevard
          (PD-29) are being developed with multi-family, high density residential units and
          parking, and very little commercial square footage, if any. The commercial
          square footage, when added is intended to serve daily-needs of residents and
          generally occupies less than 5% of the building. In planning staff’s experience,
          this has never been an impediment to the achievement of maximum residential
          densities.
     2. Although non-residential development uses could occur in PD-29 and PD-30 on
          some of the sites anticipated for future housing development over the next few
          years, the local commercial real estate market is indicating high vacancy rates
          and new commercial (office and retail) development applications are not being
          received by the Development Services Department.               Even fully entitled
          commercial projects are not being constructed in today’s economic downturn;
          this is not expected to change in the near future.
     3. Even if non-residential development were to occur, by no means do these 29
          sites represent the full inventory of vacant and underutilized sites with residential
          development potential in the City of Long Beach. The sites identified represent
          the sites considered to be most appropriate and feasible for residential
          development in the near term. Other areas that also contain potential for
          recycling into high-density residential uses include PD-25, PD-5, PD-6, and PD-
          31.
The City’s sites inventory for the RHNA (Table 39) includes primarily vacant or
underutilized commercial properties with limited existing residential uses. Most of these
are sites are located in PD-30 (Downtown) and PD-29 (Long Beach TOD).
Development of these properties into mixed use or high-density multi-family residential
uses will not result in the displacement of existing residents, as no significant removal of
existing housing is anticipated to make room for new housing development in these
areas. Since adoption of the Downtown Plan, no mixed use or residential development
has resulted in the demolition any residential units.
Furthermore, historical and recent development along the Long Beach TOD Corridor
(PD-29) has shown little or no evidence of gentrification. In fact, the situation is just the
opposite in the LBTOD. The transit component of the LBTOD includes several local
and regional bus lines, and the Metro Blue Line train, which opened in 1990. The Metro

Blue Line is the oldest and second busiest line in the Los Angeles Metro train system,
with an estimated 26 million boardings per year. In the 23 years that the Blue Line has
existed, a total of 345 housing units in four projects have been developed in the LBTOD
(including one 41-unit project currently in development). Of those units, 33 are market-
rate and 312 are affordable. The market-rate units noted here were developed as part
of the affordable projects, or as unrestricted manager units in the affordable projects.
No market-rate units have been developed in the LBTOD independently of the
financially assisted affordable housing projects. The development of independent
market-rate housing projects did not occur in the LBTOD during the real estate boom of
the early to mid-2000’s. Current rents in the area do not support the development of
market-rate housing.
City staff recently completed an analysis of current rent levels in the 90806 and 90813
zip codes in the LBTOD and found that the market rents are near or below the 60% AMI
TCAC11 rent levels (Table 41). Given current and expected future market conditions, it
is likely that future housing development in the LBTOD will be predominantly affordable
housing units.

3. Adequacy of Residential Sites in Meeting RHNA
Between the entitled and proposed developments, and sites available for future
development, the City of Long Beach has capacity that is adequate to accommodate its
RHNA (Table 42).

B. Financial Resources
With the dissolution of redevelopment in California and diminishing State and Federal
funds, the City of Long Beach has limited funding available for affordable housing
activities compared to the extent of needs in the community.
1. Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds
Through the CDBG program, HUD provides funds to local governments for a range of
community development activities. The eligible activities include, but are not limited to:
acquisition and/or disposition of real estate or property, public facilities and
improvements, relocation, rehabilitation and construction (under certain limitations) of
housing, homeownership assistance, and clearance activities. In addition, these funds
can be used to acquire or subsidize at-risk units. Long Beach receives approximately
$6 million annually in CDBG funds. In the past, the City has used these funds for
residential rehabilitation and code enforcement activities.
2. HOME Investment Partnership Program
Long Beach also receives an annual entitlement under the HOME program. HOME
funds can be used for activities that promote affordable rental housing and lower-
income homeownership, including but not limited to: building acquisition, new
construction, reconstruction, moderate or substantial rehabilitation, first-time homebuyer
assistance, and tenant-based assistance. A federal priority for use of these funds is
preservation of the at-risk housing stock. A city must also provide matching
contributions on a sliding scale: 25% local share for rental assistance or rehabilitation,
33% for substantial rehabilitation, and 50% for new construction. For the 2013-2021
planning period, the City of Long Beach anticipates receiving $2.3 million in HOME
funds annually. The City uses HOME funds primarily for residential rehabilitation and
acquisition/rehabilitation activities.
3. Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG)
In addition to CDBG and HOME funds, Long Beach is also entitled to receive
Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) from HUD. ESG funds are used to support the
operation of emergency shelters for the homeless. Annually, the City receives
approximately $650,000 in ESG funds.
4. Housing Trust Fund
The City has established a Housing Trust Fund (HTF) to assist in the delivery of
affordable housing. As of May 2013, the HTF has a balance of $161,625. The purpose
of the HTF is to complement funding sources such as HOME funds. As such, the HTF

will be used to provide affordable housing for extremely low income households (with
incomes at or below 30% AMI) and middle income households (with incomes between
120 and 150% AMI). Extremely low income households are not specifically identified in
the regulations that govern HOME funds. Middle income households in Los Angeles
County do not earn adequate incomes to afford homeownership but they are not eligible
for any State and federal housing programs. Therefore, the HTF is used to augment
State and federal programs to expand affordable housing opportunities for these
underserved groups.
5. Coastal Replacement Housing Fund
The City has established a one-to-one replacement policy within the coastal zone.
Developers can pay an in-lieu fee to fulfill this requirement. The in-lieu fees are updated
annually in accordance with the change in the Building Cost Index (BCI) from January to
January. Currently, the fees range from $18,000 to $46,000 per removed unit
depending on the unit’s size and affordability level. Funding is used to create affordable
housing in the costal zone. Currently, there is a balance of $47,346 in the Coastal
Replacement Housing Fund.
C. Administrative Resources
Described below are public and non-profit agencies that have been actively involved in
housing activities in the City of Long Beach. These agencies play important roles in
meeting the housing needs of the City. In particular, they are critical in the improvement
of the housing stock and the preservation of at-risk housing units in Long Beach.
      Long Beach Community Investment Company (LBCIC): The Long Beach
      Housing Development Company (LBHDC) was recently disbanded and
      reconfigured as the Long Beach Community Investment Company (LBCIC) The
      LBCIC is a non-profit, public benefit corporation created by the City of Long Beach
      to aid in the support, financing and development of affordable housing based on
      needs identified, in part, by the Housing Element. The City advances money to the
      LBCIC from its Housing Development Fund for the production, improvement, or
      preservation of affordable housing throughout Long Beach.
      Long Beach Housing Authority: The Housing Authority of the City of Long Beach
      receives funds from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development
      (HUD) to provide Section 8 rental assistance to low income individuals and families
      so that they can afford to rent decent, safe, and sanitary housing.
      Long Beach Affordable Housing Coalition, Inc. (LBAHC): The LBAHC is a
      regional, community-based, non-profit provider of affordable housing. The Coalition
      develops and preserves single and multi-family housing through the use of tax
      credits, conventional financing and public/private grants.

D. Opportunities for Energy Conservation
1. City Efforts
The City’s Green Building Program includes three components:
     a. Municipal Green Building Policy
          This policy requires that the City:
          Plan, design, construct, manage, renovate, and maintain facilities and
              buildings in a sustainable manner.
          Use the US Green Building Council LEED Rating System and achieve LEED
              Certification for all new City projects and additions of over 7,500 square feet.
          Apply it to City constructed and owned new construction & additions of over
              7,500 square feet.
          Budget appropriations for projects to include funding to meet the policy
              requirements.
          The Policy also includes building remodel and retrofit goals, and green
          infrastructure goals.
     b. Private Development
          All private development projects that meet the following criteria will be required
          prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, to have registered their
          project with the U.S. Green Building Council with the intent to achieve a minimum
          level of LEED Certified in their final building design or to provide third-party
          verification that they meet the equivalent of the minimum requirements of LEED
          Certification in the final building design.
          Residential/Mixed Use: 50 or more housing units
          Commercial/Industrial: 50,000 or more square feet building area

     c. Construction and Demolition Recycling
          The City also has implemented a Construction and Demolition Recycling
          program that requires certain demolition and/or construction projects to divert at
          least 60% of waste from landfills through recycling, salvage or deconstruction.
2. Other Resources
Utility-related costs can directly impact housing affordability. However, California’s
Energy Efficiency Standards (Title 24, Part 6 of the California Code of Regulations)
provides energy saving recommendations for residential and nonresidential buildings.
These standards are updated periodically to allow for consideration and possible
incorporation of new energy efficiency technologies and methods. The California Home
Energy Guide, published by the California Energy Commission, satisfies the
requirements under the Energy Efficiency Standards for builders to give new
homeowners information on how to efficiently operate their new homes.
General residential energy conservation opportunities include: replacing standard
incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent light bulbs; reducing water usage by
installing faucet aerators, low-flow showerheads, and low-flush toilets; reducing use of
air conditioners; using ENERGY STAR qualified appliances and equipment; turning off
all unnecessary lighting; washing clothes in cold water; and testing for air leaks next to
windows, doors and where there is a possible air path to the outside.
Southern California Edison offers the following Income Qualified Programs for payment
assistance:
     California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Program, providing eligible low-
          income customers with discounts in monthly electric bills.
     Family Electric Rate Assistance (FERA) Program, which offers discounted
          monthly electric rates for eligible families.
     Energy Assistance Fund (EAF)/Rate Relief Assistance Program, offering income-
          qualified customers assistance once in a 12 month period in paying electric bills.
     Energy Management Assistance (EMA) Program, helping income-qualified
          households conserve energy and reduce electricity costs.
     The City of Long Beach also offers the following utility payment assistance
          programs to qualified City residents:
              o Low-Income Discount Program for eligible low-income households and
                  non-profit group living facilities.

public input gathered specifically for the development of this update, inform the goals,
policies and programs to be included in the 2013-2021 Housing Element. The Long
Beach 2010 Strategic Plan’s Neighborhood Development Task Force created the
following vision statement:
          Future Long Beach is a clean, safe, healthy and prosperous city where
          residents, business and government are partners in balancing growth, the
          environment, cultural and neighborhood interests; and creating places for
          people of all lifestyles, cultures and perspectives to flourish, live, love,
          learn and contribute.
To that end, the General Plan sets forth the following principles:
      Build a strong network of healthy neighborhoods in Long Beach;
      Strengthen community leadership, collaboration and stewardship and increase
          public participation;
      Create healthy neighborhoods where diversity is celebrated, arts and cultural
          programs flourish, services are accessible, and all people have tools to improve
          the quality of their lives;
      Support neighborhood efforts to create beauty and pride by removing blight and
          providing high-quality and well-maintained public infrastructure, parks and public
          facilities in each neighborhood; and,
      Improve the quality and availability of housing by addressing declining
          homeownership, neighborhood stability and overcrowding.
In addition to these principles, the City also considered the needs analysis as identified
through available data for population and housing units (presented in Section 2 of this
document), and input from community members provided at three community
workshops, study sessions, and numerous informal consultations with stakeholders. As
described in the Introduction to this Housing Element, community members had various
opportunities to provide feedback on their concerns related to housing issues in the
City of Long Beach                                                                   Page 100

City, including the three community workshops in addition to study sessions before the
Planning Commission and the Long Beach Community Investment Company (LBCIC).
The culmination of these efforts revealed the following key issues:
     Create and preserve accessible, affordable housing, especially as mixed-income
          developments and in mixed-income neighborhoods;
     Promote housing in areas near public transit and with access to healthy food,
          and disperse new housing opportunities throughout the City;
     Provide public assistance to bridge housing affordability gaps, especially for the
          extremely low and very low income households;
     Maintain and upgrade properties and mitigate overcrowding;
     Address homelessness and special needs populations, including housing for the
          elderly, disabled, large households, and veterans.
The following is a summary of the key issues identified in the Housing Needs section,
supplemented with consideration of the community’s input and California’s Housing
Element requirements; along with the goals and policies the City intends to implement
to address the needs identified. Programs and objectives to support the goals and
policies are detailed after the issues, goals and policies information is presented.
1. Housing Affordability
    Issue:       Many residents have expressed concern that housing is becoming
                 increasingly unaffordable, especially to the extremely low and low income
                 households. Adequately sized housing is limited and unaffordable to large
                 households.
   Goal 1:       Provide Housing Assistance and Preserve Publicly Assisted Units
Policy 1.1       Direct local financial assistance to affordable housing projects.
Policy 1.2       Continue implementing the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HVC)
                 program and work with property owners to increase acceptance of
                 Housing Choice Vouchers.
Policy 1.3       Where the City provides financial assistance, require the inclusion of
                 affordable units.
Policy 1.4       Work with property owners, nonprofit housing providers, and tenants to
                 encourage the preservation of assisted multi-family units at risk of
                 conversion to market rents.
Policy 1.5       Continue the City’s rehabilitation loan and grant programs to assist in the
                 preservation of affordable housing units.

Policy 1.6       Seek to preserve the existing stock of single room occupancy housing as
                 a source of permanent, affordable housing. Work to identify additional
                 SRO housing opportunities.
2. Housing Accessibility for Special Needs Residents
    Issue:       Certain groups face greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing
                 due to their special circumstances. Special circumstances may relate to
                 one’s income, family characteristics, disability or health issues. Long
                 Beach is home to a sizable population of persons with special needs
                 including: the homeless, elderly, disabled persons, single parents, large
                 households, veterans, college students, and others.
   Goal 2:       Address the Unique Housing Needs of Special Needs Residents
Policy 2.1       Continue to implement the City’s density bonus program to provide
                 incentives for housing that is accessible and affordable to lower income
                 households, seniors, and disabled persons (including persons with
                 developmental disabilities).
Policy 2.2       Support continued efforts to implement and expand the Continuum of
                 Care program for homeless persons. Implement the feasible components
                 of Within Our Reach: A Community Partnership to Prevent and End
                 Homelessness, Long Beach’s 10-Year Plan Report.
Policy 2.3       Support provision of housing to address the needs of the disabled
                 (including persons with developmental disabilities), the mentally ill,
                 persons with substance problems, persons with HIV/AIDS, veterans and
                 other groups needing transitional and supportive housing.
Policy 2.4       Encourage universal design of housing products and environments,
                 making them usable by a wide range people with different physical and
                 mental abilities.
Policy 2.5       Integrate and disperse special needs housing within the community and in
                 close proximity to transit and public services.
Policy 2.6       Encourage California State University at Long Beach and other institutions
                 of higher education to build student, staff, and faculty housing to meet the
                 needs of their students and employees.
Policy 2.7       Proactively seek out new models and approaches in the provision of
                 affordable housing, such as co-housing and assisted living facilities.
Policy 2.8       Pursue opportunities to identify stable revenue sources to the Housing
                 Trust Fund.

3. Housing and Neighborhood Improvement
    Issue:       Housing and neighborhood conservation and preservation in Long Beach
                 is an important means to improving the quality of life for residents. As an
                 older, highly urbanized and densely populated community, Long Beach is
                 confronted with a range of community development issues, particularly in
                 older neighborhoods where housing conditions, public improvements,
                 community facilities, and neighborhood amenities (such as access to
                 healthy food and open space) all need upgrading or replacement.
   Goal 3:       Retain and Improve           the   Quality  of   Existing    Housing      and
                 Neighborhoods
Policy 3.1       Encourage the maintenance and improvement of the housing stock and
                 the neighborhood context.
Policy 3.2       Preserve and protect the character of established neighborhoods, with an
                 emphasis on single-family neighborhoods and those beginning to decline.
Policy 3.3       Promote continued maintenance of quality ownership and rental housing
                 by offering assistance to encourage preventative maintenance and repair.
Policy 3.4       Promote, where appropriate, the revitalization and/or rehabilitation of
                 residential structures that are substandard or have fallen into disrepair.
Policy 3.5       Continue to improve streets and drainage, sidewalks and alleys, green
                 spaces and parks, street trees, and other public facilities, amenities and
                 infrastructure.
Policy 3.6       Continue to preserve and maintain the City’s historical and architecturally
                 significant buildings and neighborhoods by establishing and maintaining
                 historic landmarks and districts.
Policy 3.7       Continue to support the creation of healthy neighborhoods by addressing
                 public safety issues, performing ongoing property inspections, eliminating
                 threats to the public health, and promoting business establishments that
                 offer healthy food choices.
Policy 3.8       Promote strong, on-site management of multi-family complexes to ensure
                 the maintenance of housing and neighborhood quality.
Policy 3.9       Provide education and outreach to tenants regarding the City’s Code
                 Enforcement program and their rights as a tenant to be provided decent,
                 safe, and sanitary housing.

Policy 3.10      Support programs and projects which link affordable housing with other
                 community development goals and resources.
Policy 3.11      Promote green building standards in the rehabilitation of existing housing.
4. Housing Production
    Issue:       Maintaining a diversity of rental and ownership housing opportunities to
                 meet the needs of residents is one of the City’s challenges. While
                 between 2000 and 2010, the housing stock increased 2.5% compared to a
                 population increase of 0.2%, mismatches between the housing market
                 supply and community housing needs persisted. Housing cost burden
                 and overcrowding continue to disproportionately impact the City’s lower
                 income households. Moderate income households are also experiencing
                 difficulty in finding decent and affordable housing, and moderate income
                 households are not eligible for assistance under federal housing
                 programs.
   Goal 4:       Provide Increased Opportunities for the Construction of High Quality
                 Housing
Policy 4.1       Provide adequate sites, zoned at the appropriate densities and
                 development standards, to facilitate the housing production and
                 affordability goals set forth in the 2014-2021 RHNA.
Policy 4.2       Encourage a balance of rental and homeownership opportunities,
                 including high quality apartments, townhomes, condominiums, and single-
                 family homes to accommodate the housing needs of all socioeconomic
                 segments of the community, including large families.
Policy 4.3       Encourage new high quality rental and ownership housing through the
                 implementation of design review guidelines, and architectural and green
                 building standards.
Policy 4.4       Finalize an ordinance for Planning Commission/City Council consideration
                 to encourage adaptive reuse of existing structures for residential
                 purposes.
Policy 4.5       Encourage residential development along transit corridors, in the
                 downtown and close to employment, transportation and activity centers;
                 and encourage infill and mixed-use developments in designated districts.
Policy 4.6       Maintain a vacant and underutilized residential sites inventory, including
                 City-owned sites, and assist residential developers in identifying land
                 suitable for residential development.

Policy 4.7       Assist in establishing partnerships of nonprofit organizations, affordable
                 housing builders, and for-profit developers, to provide greater access to
                 affordable housing funds.
Policy 4.8       Support the development of housing that is technology-friendly and
                 designed to meet the housing needs of the emerging information and
                 technology industry workforce.
Policy 4.9       Utilize development agreements as a tool to achieve a mix of affordability
                 levels in large-scale projects.
Policy 4.10      Promote mixed-generation housing that accommodates both families and
                 elderly households.
5. Government Constraints to Housing Development
    Issue:       Market factors and government regulations can have a significant impact
                 on the development, improvement and affordability of housing. Although
                 market conditions are beyond the direct influence of any jurisdiction,
                 communities can encourage housing investment by ensuring the
                 reasonableness of local land use controls, development standards, permit-
                 processing procedures, fees and exactions, and governmental
                 requirements that will impact residential development.
 Goal 5:         Mitigate Government Constraints to Housing Investment and
                 Affordability
Policy 5.1       Periodically review City regulations, ordinances and fees to ensure they
                 do not unduly constrain housing investment.
Policy 5.2       Offer financial and/or regulatory incentives, such as density bonuses and
                 fee reductions/waivers, where feasible, to offset or reduce the costs of
                 developing affordable housing.
Policy 5.3       Utilize Planned Developments (PD), form-based zoning and other
                 planning tools to allow flexible residential development standards in
                 designated areas.
Policy 5.4       Provide for streamlined, timely and coordinated             processing   of
                 development projects to minimize project-holding costs.
Policy 5.5       Support the use of technology to improve communications between
                 residents and the community, and to facilitate housing development.
City of Long Beach                                                                  Page 105

6. Home Ownership Opportunities
    Issue:       Many households aspire to home ownership. However, the price of
                 ownership housing is often beyond the financial means of most lower and
                 even moderate income households.
     Goal 6:     Provide Increased Opportunities for Home Ownership
Policy 6.1       Provide home purchasing opportunities, with an emphasis on providing
                 affordable options for low and moderate income households.
Policy 6.2       Utilize home ownership assistance programs as a mechanism to expand
                 affordable housing opportunities and accommodate large families.
Policy 6.3       Pursue participation in other home ownership programs available in the
                 private market and/or other public agencies.
7. Fair and Equal Housing Opportunity
    Issue:       Ensuring fair and equal housing opportunity for home-seekers is an on-
                 going need.      Whether through mediating tenant/landlord disputes,
                 investigating bona fide complaints of discrimination, or through the
                 provision of education services – fair housing services are needed to
                 enforce State and federal laws. The following policies are designed to
                 continue implementation of fair housing laws.
      Goal 7: Ensure Fair and Equal Housing Opportunity
Policy 7.1       Provide fair housing services to Long Beach residents and property
                 owners, and ensure that residents and property owners are aware of their
                 rights and responsibilities.
Policy 7.2       Continue to enforce notification and relocation assistance for low-income
                 households displaced due to demolition, condominium conversion, and
                 persons displaced due to code enforcement activities of illegally converted
                 or substandard residential dwellings.
B. Housing Programs
This section describes programs that are designed to encourage the maintenance,
improvement, development and conservation of housing in the City for the 2013-2021
planning period. The programs are organized under the following policy areas:
     Housing Assistance To and Preservation of Affordable Units;
     Housing for Special Needs Residents;
     Housing and Neighborhood Improvement;
City of Long Beach                                                                   Page 106

     Housing Production;
     Home Ownership Opportunity;
     Mitigation of Government Constraints;
     Fair and Equal Housing Opportunity; and
     Monitoring and Review
This section describes the programs Long Beach will implement to address these
topics, including specific quantified objectives for the planning period.
1. Housing Assistance to, and Preservation of, Affordable Units
Long Beach has a sizable stock of publicly assisted rental housing. This stock includes
all multi-family rental units assisted under federal, state and local programs, including
HUD, state/local bond programs, density bonus and Long Beach redevelopment
programs. Assisted rental projects include both new constructions, as well as
acquisition/rehabilitation projects with affordability covenants. A total of 4,260 publicly
assisted multi-family units as well as approximately 7,000 families assisted through the
HCV Program are located in the City.
Projects receiving City assistance, primarily through HOME and Redevelopment Set-
Aside funds, carry long-term affordability covenants of 30 to 55 years. Unfortunately,
many of the City’s HUD assisted projects have much shorter affordability controls, and
may be potentially at risk of conversion to market rate due to the expiration of project-
based Section 8 contracts. The preservation of these and other affordable housing units
is an important goal for Long Beach.
Program 1.1: Preservation of At-Risk Units
Long Beach has 65 rental complexes that receive government assistance in return for
providing housing that is affordable to low income households. Of this total, 23 of the
projects may lose their affordability controls by October 15, 2023 (timeline of at-risk
housing analysis) due primarily to the expiration of project-based Section 8 contracts.
All of these at-risk projects are owned by nonprofits and are therefore unlikely to convert
to market rate. Options to preserve affordability of these units are as follows:
     a. Provision of rental assistance to tenants using other funding sources including
          the Section 8 Tenant Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) HCV Program
          administered by the Housing Authority of the City of Long Beach (HACLB);
     b. Refinancing the projects;
     c. Provision of staff or technical assistance; and
     d. Provision of financial incentives (if available) to maintain continued affordability.

     2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
     Annually monitor status of the 1,600 affordable housing units in 21 projects that
          are at risk of converting to market rate. Seek to preserve these affordable units
          for extremely low income households and very low income households.
     In the event that a property is scheduled for conversion, coordinate with the
          property owner to ensure that proper noticing is circulated to the at-risk tenants
          and that tenant education is provided regarding their options, such as other
          affordable housing developments and City programs, and special HUD Section 8
          vouchers for tenants displaced due to expiration of project-based Section 8
          assistance.
     In the event that a property is scheduled for conversion, contact qualified, non-
          profit entities, from the State’s qualified entities list, to inform them of the
          opportunity to acquire affordable units. Also inform them of financial assistance
          available through City, State, and federal programs.
     In the event that a property is scheduled for conversion, explore the possibility of
          using available housing funds to acquire or facilitate the acquisition of the units to
          preserve affordability.
     Support the property owners’ application for tax credits or other funding sources
          that would extend the properties’ affordability period.
     Support the property owners’ application for Section 8 contract renewal with
          HUD.
     Extend affordability through acquisition/rehabilitation efforts.
     Provide tenant education and information on special Section 8 voucher
          assistance set aside by the HACLB for residents displaced or impacted by the
          conversion of federally assisted housing projects.
     Responsible Agencies:                HACLB; Development Services Department/
                                          Housing & Community Improvement
     Funding Sources:                     HOME and Federal Department of Housing and
                                          Urban Development (HUD)
Program 1.2: Housing Choice Voucher (aka Section 8 Rental Assistance)
The tenant-based Housing Choice Voucher program provides a portable form of
housing assistance. The Housing Choice Voucher Program (commonly known as
Section 8) is funded by HUD and administered by the Housing Authority of the City of
Long Beach (HACLB). With this program, an income-qualified household can use the
voucher at any rental complex that accepts participation in the HCV program. Section 8

tenants’ rent is based on 30% of monthly household income and HACLB makes up the
difference. HACLB establishes the payment standards based on HUD-established Fair
Market Rents (FMR). Currently close to 7,000 households hold Housing Choice
Vouchers and almost approximately 3,000 more households are on the waiting list to
receive assistance. It is important for the City to continue administering this program to
help the many low income households in need of assistance to prevent them from
becoming homeless. The HCV program is one of the most significant housing
programs for extremely low income households in the City. To further assist those
households most in need, the City assists voucher holders with security deposit using
HOME funds.
     2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
     Encourage property owners to accept Housing Choice Vouchers, including
          working with owners of new rental developments.
     Seek to raise the payment standard to expand the stock of eligible rentals, when
          necessary.

Program 1.3: First Right of Refusal for Displaced Lower Income Households
Lower income households displaced by development assisted with federal funds are
required to adhere to the relocation and displacement requirements under the Uniform
Relocation Act. The City has also adopted an ordinance that provides a right of first
refusal to tenants displaced due to condominium conversion. Tenants are given an
exclusive right of 90 days to purchase or rent the new units under the same or more
favorable terms and conditions that such units will be initially offered to the general
public. Furthermore, the City of Long Beach has adopted a Local Housing Preference
Policy that requires developers to give preference and priority to people who live and/or
work in Long Beach when selling or renting affordable housing units created through the
assistance of the LBCIC or the City.
In 2012, the City conducted a survey of several major cities in California, including San
Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Berkeley, Santa Ana, and West Hollywood. None
of these cities impose a first right of refusal requirement to market-rate developers.
     2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
     By 2016, explore local options to extend first right of refusal to lower income
          households displaced by private development. Survey other cities to benchmark
          their requirements for first right of refusal. Report findings to the Planning
          Commission and City Council in 2017 as part of the Annual Report to HCD for

2. Housing for Special Needs Residents
Long Beach has a history of providing housing and supportive services for its special
needs populations. Special needs populations include the elderly, homeless, persons
with mental, developmental, and physical disabilities, college students, single parents,
large families, veterans, and other groups that have greater difficulty in securing
affordable and adequate housing. The following programs are designed to address the
unique affordable housing needs and circumstances of special needs residents living in
Long Beach.
With respect to permanent supportive housing, the City of Long Beach permits the siting
of supportive housing facilities throughout the community. Long Beach is home to more
than 100 facilities. Additional facilities provide temporary housing and supportive
services for persons recovering from substance abuse, domestic violence and other
situations, which leave them temporarily homeless.
Program 2.1: Continuum of Care
The Homeless Services Division is responsible for coordinating homeless services and
addressing the impacts of homelessness citywide. Located within the Department of
Health and Human Services (Long Beach Health Department), this division provides
oversight of the Long Beach Continuum of Care (CoC), a coalition of homeless service
providers funded by HUD. The City of Long Beach’s CoC program is responsible for
coordinating more than $7 million in federal funding each year, with an overall
Homeless Services Division budget of more than $7.8 million for FY 2013. The City
distributes over half of this money for homeless services to its partner community
agencies.
The Long Beach community has also developed several innovative programs to engage
the homeless, including the Long Beach Multi-Service Center for the Homeless (MSC)
and the Villages at Cabrillo. The MSC is a collaborative partnership between the City,
the Port of Long Beach and non-profit agencies co-located on one site. Services
provided at the MSC range from showers, laundry and mail/phone messaging to

licensed childcare, medical clinic and employment assistance, drug/alcohol treatment,
case management, shelter and housing placement assistance.
The Villages at Cabrillo, located next to the MSC, is a collaborative partnership of
multiple agencies providing the largest non-governmental housing/social services
program for homeless veterans in the nation. Services provided range from emergency
and transitional shelter to permanent affordable housing for singles, unaccompanied
youth, families, Native Americans and veterans. Additional support services (childcare,
employment counseling, mental health/medical) include a program to help children re-
integrate into the public school system in Long Beach.
     2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
     Develop new efficiency units on remaining land at the Villages at Cabrillo with at
          least half of these units targeted to extremely low income households and the
          remainder targeted to very low income households.
     Continue to support services and programs that are part of the Continuum of
          Care system for the homeless through the City’s annual funding allocation
          process.

Program 2.2: Zoning Code Update for Special Needs Housing
Long Beach has a substantial special needs population within the community. The City
of Long Beach allows for the siting of facilities designed to accommodate special needs
groups, such as the homeless, disabled persons (including persons with developmental
disabilities), single parents, large households, college students, seniors, and persons
with substance abuse problems, among others. The Long Beach zoning code permits
emergency shelters and transitional housing, dormitories, and sororities/fraternities,
licensed community care facilities, single room occupancy, affordable senior housing,
as well as other standard housing opportunities. The City will continue to monitor its
zoning regulations to ensure the provision of a range of housing options to the City’s
special needs population.
     2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
     Emergency Shelters: In 2013, the City amended the Zoning Code to permit
          emergency shelters by right via a ministerial approval process in the Port – IP
          zone and in PD-31 (Villages at Cabrillo). The City will explore additional
          opportunities for allowing emergency shelters in PD-29 and the IL (Light
          Industrial) zone. Potential inclusion of sites for emergency shelters will be
          evaluated as part of the PD-29 Specific Plan update in 2014. Inclusion of
          emergency shelters in the IL zone or as an overlay in portions of the IL zone will

          be recommended in 2015. Factors to consider include availability of vacant and
          underutilized properties, access to supportive services and public transportation,
          as well as compatibility with surrounding uses.              Annually, monitor the
          effectiveness of the various zones for by-right emergency shelters and pursue
          alternative strategies as necessary.
     Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) Housing: By the end of 2014, amend the Zoning
          Code to incorporate SRO housing under the provisions for Special Group
          Residence. Conditions for approval will be objective and pertain to performance
          standards such as parking, management, and security. Such conditions will be
          similar to those required for other Special Group Residence uses in the same
          zone.
     Definition of Family: Amend the Zoning Code by the end of 2014 to revise the
          definition of family to “any group of individuals living together based on personal
          relationships.”

Program 2.3: Family Self Sufficiency
The Family Self-Sufficiency Program is designed to assist Housing Choice Voucher
(Section 8) participants in identifying and breaking down barriers that keep them from
securing and maintaining employment that will eventually lead them to self-sufficiency.
The basic goal of the program is to overcome these obstacles, provide opportunities
that allow the participants to gain education and supportive services necessary to
secure and maintain employment, and eventually transfer them off welfare services.
During the program, the HACLB provides rent subsidies and administers an escrow
savings account for each participant. Approximately 854 Housing Choice Voucher
holders in Long Beach participate in this program.
     2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
     Continue to implement the Family Self-Sufficiency Program.
     Promote program at City website, newsletters, and brochures at public counters.

Program 2.4: HOPWA Tenant-Based Rental Assistance
The HACLB currently receives HOPWA funds to operate two housing programs:
     HOPWA Long-Term Tenant-Based Rental Assistance Program: Provides one to
          two years of Section 8 rental assistance, after which the assistance is rolled over
          into the HACLB Section 8 voucher program. Funding levels are for up to 108
          households.
     HOPWA Short-Term Assistance Program (STAP): Provides periodic grants to
          help lower income tenants catch up with rent and utility payments and pay
          moving expenses. The grants provide two types of financial assistance, Short-
          Term Rent, Mortgage, Utilities (STRMU) assistance and Permanent Housing
          Placement (PHP) assistance.
          o STRMU: Provides assistance for up to 21 weeks during any 52 week period
              with rent, mortgage, and/or utilities (gas, electric, water and sewer), which
              may not be consecutive. Applicants must be living in permanent housing in
              Los Angeles County.
          o PHP (Move-In): Provides assistance with reasonable costs to move persons
              into permanent housing by covering the security deposit. Maximum amount
              is based on the fair market rents for Los Angeles County defined annually by
              HUD.
HACLB has full-time HOPWA-funded Case Managers to implement these programs and
to assist lower income tenants with their overall housing needs.
     2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
     Continue to provide assistance to 108 households through the HOPWA Long-
          Term Tenant-Based Rental Assistance and 120 households through the Short-
          Term Assistance Program.

Program 2.5: Universal Design
Universal Design is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people,
to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.
The City promotes these principles by enforcing the American’s With Disabilities Act
(ADA), providing a visitability ordinance for City-assisted new construction of single
family homes and duplexes, and sponsoring a City Disability Commission.

3. Housing and Neighborhood Improvement
Housing and neighborhood improvement and preservation is an important means to
improve the quality of life for residents. As an older, highly urbanized and densely
populated community, Long Beach is confronted with a range of community
development issues, particularly in older neighborhoods where housing conditions,
public improvements and community facilities have deteriorated over time.
Program 3.1: Home Rehabilitation
     a. Owner-Occupied Rehabilitation Loan
          The Owner-Occupied Rehabilitation Loan Program offers low-interest loans to
          homeowners to make improvements and repairs to their homes, generally up to a
          maximum of $35,000 per unit at an interest rate of 3%. Payment on the loans
          may be deferred until the home is sold or transferred; depending upon the
          borrower’s total housing cost.          Proceeds can be used to correct code
          deficiencies, repair damage, and improve the building or grounds. Eligible
          applicants are low and moderate income homeowner-occupants. Zero (0) %
          loans or grants may be made to fund rehabilitation required to meet lead based
          paint abatement requirements. This program is funded with HOME and
          CalHome funds as funds are available.
     b. Multi-Family Rehabilitation Loan
          The Multi-Family Rehabilitation Loan Program provides 0% interest loans to
          owners of rental properties with two or more units on a lot. The loans are used to
          make improvements and repairs to the property and grounds. To qualify for the
          rehabilitation loan, the property must be occupied by lower income tenants and
          the units maintained at affordable rents. A portion of the assistance will benefit
          extremely low income households. This program is funded with HOME funds.
          PD-29 and PD-30 are key areas of focus for the Multi-Family Rehabilitation Loan
          program in order to preserve and enhance affordable housing in these
          neighborhoods. As part of the Housing Action Plan preparation in 2015, the City
          will establish funding priorities and strategies.
     c. Home Improvement Rebate
          The Home Improvement Rebate Program is available to properties in the City’s
          targeted Neighborhood Improvement Strategy areas.               Homeowners are
          reimbursed up to $2,000 to make improvements to the exterior of their homes.
          Eligible improvements include new stucco or painting, doors and windows,
          concrete work, and repair of landscaping. This program is funded with CDBG
          funds.
     d. Mobile Home Repair Grant
          The City proposes to create a new program that provides up to $12,000 per unit
          in grant for repairs of mobile homes occupied by extremely low income
          households. This program will be funded with the Housing Trust Fund.

Program 3.2: Neighborhood Resources
Currently, the City’s Neighborhood Resource Center (NRC) offers free assistance to
neighborhood and community groups to increase their effectiveness. The NRC
provides free access to a range of resources such as meeting areas, neighborhood
group mail boxes, use of computers and Internet access, a library of neighborhood
improvement resource materials, and by hosting a variety of training workshops on
relevant community topics. Grant announcements and grant writing technical assistance
are provided to help groups leverage neighborhood improvement funds from multiple
sources.
The Neighborhood Leadership Program is a six-month training program teaching CDBG
Target Areas residents the principles of effective leadership and provides examples of
how to solve neighborhood problems. Each student must complete a community
project to “graduate” from the program.

blight on private property along the City’s business corridors and in residential
neighborhoods, including multi-housing inspections. Area team meetings are held on a
monthly basis to coordinate enforcement activity. Teams consist of Code Enforcement
personnel, Police, Fire, Neighborhood Improvement Coordinators, Prosecutor, City
Attorney, Business License and Nuisance Abatement. The Nuisance Abatement
program works with the Police, City Attorney and Code Enforcement in an effort to
identify and eliminate unsuitable behaviors generated at a location.
Code Enforcement compliance is also improved by the increased coordination of
Neighborhood Improvement Strategy programs, such as the Home Improvement
Rebate Program, the Commercial Improvement Rebate Program, and neighborhood
clean-ups. By combining proactive programs with traditional code enforcement
activities, the City is better able to sustain the current housing stock and increase the
livability of our neighborhoods.
Development Services Department, Code Enforcement division also administers a Multi
Housing Inspection Program to ensure that sanitation, maintenance, use and
occupancy standards are adhered to. Under this program inspectors provide both
routine and complaint driven inspections of commercial and residential buildings of four
units or more. The program also has a comprehensive tenant education component
which includes information on how to maintain a clean and healthful environment and
addresses issues of indoor air pollution, asthma triggers and safety hazards.
In addition, the City will be exploring the feasibility of establishing a rental escrow
account program as an enforcement tool to encourage landlords to maintain their
properties and to bring properties that have existing violations into compliance. A
property that has been cited with outstanding building, health and safety code violations
may be placed in the rental escrow program. Rents or a portion of the rents from the
affected property would be placed in an escrow account, which can only be used for
specific purposes (such as repairs) as established by the program. The property could
only be removed from the program if it clears all outstanding violations.
The City will also explore other options such as the Franchise Tax Board’s Substandard
Housing program. Substandard housing is property in violation of the California state or
local health and safety codes as determined by city or county regulatory agencies.

Deductions for interest, taxes, amortization, or depreciation expenses are not allowed
for substandard property during the time the regulatory agency determines the property
as substandard.
     2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
     Continue to perform inspections and train residents in nuisance abatement
          procedures.
     Inspect an average of 5,500 multi-family units annually to correct code violations.
     Connect City housing rehabilitation programs with code enforcement efforts to
          ensure assistance is provided to lower income households in making the code
          corrections and improvements.
     Conclude research on rental escrow program, Franchise Tax Board Substandard
          Housing program, and other alternative approaches, and report findings to the
          City Council by the end of 2014. Research should include an analysis on the
          nature and extent of code violations and extent of persistent non-compliance.
          Each program option will be evaluated based on factors such as cost
          implications, effectiveness, and administrative burden. By the end of 2015,
          develop a strategy to implement one or more of the program options that focus
          on addressing habitability issues.

Program 3.4: Neighborhood Improvement Services
To engage the community and to arrest deterioration, the Neighborhood Services
Bureau implements various activities intended to improve the quality, environmental
condition, and character of the neighborhoods of the City of Long Beach. By actively
coordinating and partnering with residents, businesses, and non-profit organizations,
the Bureau delivers services designed to achieve prompt compliance with health,
building and safety codes, utilize City resources to eliminate blight in low-income
targeted areas, and encourage community participation in activities that will improve
Long Beach neighborhoods. Programs are periodically fine-tuned to continue
addressing the needs of our neighborhoods by supporting improvements to our aging
housing stock and the local infrastructure of our innermost neighborhoods, such as
sidewalk, tree plantings, and other hardscape improvements. Furthermore, these
programs will serve to empower area residents by encouraging them to take an active
role in improving distressed neighborhoods.
In partnership with Code Enforcement, the Neighborhood Improvement Division (mainly
using grant funds) provides the following services: the Commercial Improvement and

Home Improvement Rebate Programs eliminate code violations and improve the curb
appeal of business corridors and neighborhoods. The business startup grant assists
new business owners with start-up costs associated with starting a new business in
Long Beach. The Neighborhood Partners Program provides 10-15 matching grants per
year to business and community groups citywide to complete small-scale infrastructure
projects. In addition, the Urban Forestry Program installs sidewalk cuts and 1,000+
trees per year along business corridors and in neighborhoods. The Neighborhood
Clean Up Assistance Program provides supplies and assists neighborhood and
community groups to host over 100 cleanups event per year removing over 1,000 tons
of illegally dumped trash and debris. The Neighborhood Resource Center provides
resources and training to assist neighborhood groups and residents to build their
capacity to address neighborhood problems. The Neighborhood Leadership Program
trains residents to become more effective grassroots community leaders.
     2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
     Continue to implement various neighborhood improvement programs, such as

Program 3.5: Foreclosure Registry
The presence of vacant, abandoned or foreclosed residential properties can lead to
neighborhood decline by creating an unattractive public nuisance that could contribute
to lower property values and could discourage potential buyers from purchasing a home
adjacent to or in neighborhoods with vacant, abandoned or foreclosed residences.
Many vacant, abandoned or foreclosed properties are the responsibility of out of area or
out of state lenders and trustees. In many instances the lenders and/or trustees fail to
adequately maintain and secure these properties.
To preserve the health, safety and welfare of residents and the community, and to the
extent possible, protect neighborhoods from declining property values, aesthetic decay,
and/or loss of character, the City adopted the Foreclosure Registry Ordinance in 2011.
The ordinance requires that every residential property that is issued a Notice of Default
be registered with the City of Long Beach. In addition, the ordinance establishes
maintenance and security requirements on the properties and associated fines and
penalties for noncompliance.

Program 3.6: Lead-Based Paint Hazard Abatement
Based on housing unit age, it is estimated that approximately 60,000 units in Long
Beach have lead-based paint hazard issues. Of these, six zip code areas in the
downtown, Westside and North Long Beach areas have the highest concentrations of
units with lead-based paint.
In FY 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services Bureau of Environmental
Health was awarded a three-year $2.5 million grant from HUD to continue its Lead
Hazard Control (LHC) Program. The LHC Program identifies low income residences
(with a focus on families with children under six years old), and address lead poisoning
hazards created by lead-based paint. The program hires painting and construction
companies that are certified to work with lead, and families are relocated during the
renovations. The program is also responsible for conducting outreach/education events
in the community, and training economically disadvantaged people in lead-safe work
practices so that they may be hired as part of these renovations.
Furthermore, all CDBG, HOME, and ESG-funded housing programs and projects have
incorporated lead-based paint hazard reduction efforts. In addition, Code Enforcement
uses Lead Safe Work Practice (LSWP) standards to correct code enforcement
violations.
     2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
      The LHC Program has established the following work program for FY 2012 – FY
          2015:
          o Enroll 205 housing units into the program and obtain owner consent to
              inspect units for lead hazards.
          o Conduct assessment on 195 units.
          o Complete abatement for 185 units.
          o Conduct 20 outreach events.

4. Housing Production
With a diverse population, it is important to provide a variety of housing opportunities for
different types of households wishing to reside in the community. Allowing for housing
diversity is important to ensure that all households, regardless of their age, income and
family type, have the opportunity to find housing suited to their lifestyle. Part of this
diversity is addressed through the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), which
encourages the construction of housing for all economic segments in Long Beach.
Diversity is also addressed through the provision of General Plan and zoning
regulations that allow different unit types and densities. And, a move toward healthier
living environments and Green Building standards is providing new direction to the
development of innovative buildings. The following programs support housing
production in the City.
Program 4.1: Affordable Housing Development Assistance
The Long Beach Community Investment Company (LBCIC) provides assistance to for-
profit and nonprofit housing developers for the construction or rehabilitation of
affordable rental and for-sale ownership housing. LBCIC assistance usually takes the
form of low interest loans and all assisted units are deed restricted for occupancy by
lower income households. The LBCIC seeks out other sources of funding, including
HOME, State, and Federal funds. Specifically, LBCIC will continue to utilize the 15%
HOME Community Development Housing Organization (CHDO) set-aside funds to
pursue affordable housing opportunities through new construction, substantial
rehabilitation, and/or acquisition/rehabilitation.
     2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
     Annually monitor availability of State and federal funding and partner with
          affordable housing developers, if necessary, in applying for additional funds.
     Identify qualified nonprofit developers for partnership in affordable housing
          construction and acquisition/rehabilitation projects.
     Prepare and implement a Housing Action Plan (HAP) in 2015. The HAP will
          cover a range of topics, including the following:
              o Address the potential uses of a variety of funding sources available to the
                 City (see Program 4.4, Housing Funds). Specifically, establish a priority in
                 which the City should use available funds to assist in the rehabilitation of
                 existing housing stock or for investing in new construction projects
              o Establish a strategy for the development of sites currently owned by the
                 LBCIC, particularly those in transit-oriented neighborhoods.
              o Establish target populations for various programs, i.e. senior, disabled,
                 veterans, families, etc.
              o Devise appropriate strategies for different neighborhoods.

     Incorporate a priority for funding to preserve and promote housing affordable to
          lower income households in transit rich neighborhoods and other targeted growth
          areas, and update the HAP every five years or as needed thereafter to reflect
          changes in conditions and new opportunities.
     Continue to provide funding to help gap-finance affordable housing. Priority in
          funding is granted to projects housing special needs groups (such as the elderly
          and the disabled, including those with developmental disabilities) and/or enriched
          with supportive services such as childcare, health programs, job training, and
          financial and legal counseling.

Program 4.2: Adequate Sites
The City of Long Beach has identified sufficient residential sites, zoned at the
appropriate densities, to accommodate the housing production and affordability targets
of the RHNA of 7,048 units. In keeping with the principles and policies established in
the City’s 2010 Strategic Plan and Land Use Element of the General Plan, new high-
density residential and mixed use development is to be focused in key locations,
allowing for the preservation of existing and stable neighborhoods. Appropriate and
feasible housing densities are allowed, with appropriate development standards and
design guidelines, along transit corridors, in the downtown and greater downtown areas,
and in close proximity to major employment and activity centers.
In addition, the City is undertaking several major efforts to expand housing opportunities
throughout the City. Specifically, the City is updating its Land Use Element and PD-29
(Long Beach Boulevard).
     2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
     Maintain an adequate sites inventory for the remaining RHNA of 7,048 units (886
          extremely low income units; 887 very low income units; 1,066 low income units;
          1,170 moderate income units; and 3,039 above moderate income units).
     Identify additional opportunities for housing through updates to the following:
          Land Use Element and PD-29 by 2014.
     Monitor development trends to ensure availability of sites for residential uses.
     Provide sites inventory to interested developers and to assist in identifying
          additional opportunities for residential development.

Program 4.3: Adaptive Reuse
The City has many older commercial and industrial buildings that are no longer being
occupied by the highest and best uses or compatible uses with its surrounding
neighborhoods. The City is moving forward with a policy change in the municipal code
to amend, expand, establish and clarify alternative building regulations for the
conversion of existing buildings to other uses. In particular, for the conversion of
commercial or industrial buildings, or portions thereof, to residential or alternative non-
residential purposes as allowed under California Health and Safety Code Section
17958.11.
     2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
     Adoption revisions to the Municipal Code in 2014 to encourage adaptive reuse
          and once adopted, promote adaptive reuse to property owners and interested
          developers.

Program 4.4: Affordable Housing Funding Opportunities
The City of Long Beach has a dedicated account for most revenues earmarked
for affordable housing purposes. These funding sources include CalHOME grant
revenues, tax increment bond proceeds, program income, federal HOME funds, coastal
zone in-lieu fees, Housing Trust Fund revenues, loan repayments, rental income from
LBCIC-owned property, and funds owed to the Housing Fund through the dissolution of
redevelopment.
     2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
     On an annual basis as part of the City's budget process, the City will regularly
          evaluate opportunities to direct funding to the Housing Fund.
     In accordance with AB 1484, establish an amortization schedule to repay
          approximately $16.3 million in debt owed the Housing Fund from the
          Downtown Project area related to deferred housing set-aside payments by early
          2014, subject to approval by the State Department of Finance.

     In accordance with AB 1484, establish an amortization schedule by the end of
          2014 to repay approximately $8.1 million in debt owed the Housing Fund from
          the former Redevelopment Agency related to the advance of funds as allowed
          by AB x4 26 (SERAF), subject to approval by the State Department of Finance.
     AB 1484 allows a former redevelopment agency to repay loans received from its
          host city. Under AB 1484, when this debt is reestablished and payments begin, a
          portion of the loan repayment, no less than 20%, must be used for low and
          moderate income housing purposes. The City of Long Beach intends to
          reestablish this debt by 2020, subject to approval by the State Department of
          Finance.
     By the end of 2015, research potential redirection of condominium conversion
          fees for deposit into the Housing Trust Fund.
     On an annual basis, research eligible funding sources, including State Prop 1C
          programs, for deposit into the Housing Trust Fund.
     By the end of 2015, conduct a financial analysis and nexus study to review the
          viability of the Coastal Zone in-lieu fee and consider revisions to the fee
          structure, if necessary, as part of the FY2016-2017 budget process and master
          fee schedule update.
     Annually monitor the availability of State and federal funding and pursue
          additional funding as appropriate. Continue to partner with affordable housing
          developers and other supportive service providers in funding applications.

5.     Home Ownership Opportunity
Long Beach has only a 42% home ownership rate, which is quite low in comparison to
Los Angeles County’s 48% rate, and the statewide rate of 56% home ownership. For a
number of years the City has tried to raise this rate by implementing several programs
to increase ownership opportunities for lower and moderate income households.
However, with the dissolution of redevelopment and diminishing State and federal
funds, the City’s ability to make a significant impact in this area is limited.

Program 5.1: City First-Time Homebuyer Assistance
The Second Mortgage Assistance program is aimed at helping first-time homebuyers by
providing loans as a second trust deed to people who would otherwise qualify for a loan
from a first mortgage lender but need the extra assistance to bridge the gap keeping
them from becoming homeowners. The “silent second” reduces the amount that must
be borrowed for the “first” mortgage, reducing the monthly mortgage payment and
thereby making it affordable to lower income homebuyers.
     2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
     Assist 25 lower income households with homebuyer assistance.
     Promote programs via City newsletters, website, and brochures at public
          counters.
     Pursue additional funding from State housing programs; annually explore funding
          opportunities with State HCD.

Program 5.2: County First-Time Homebuyer Assistance
With limited public resources, the City is not in a position to operate a homebuyer
assistance program. However, resources are available to Long Beach residents through
programs administered by the Los Angeles County Community Development
Commission. Specifically, the following two programs offer homebuyer assistance to
income-eligible households in the County:
      Mortgage Credit Certificates: The MCC Program offers the first-time
          homebuyer a federal income tax credit. This tax credit reduces the federal taxes
          the holder of the certificate pays. It can also help the first-time homebuyer qualify
          for a loan by allowing a lender to reduce the housing expense ratio by tax
          savings. The qualified homebuyer who is awarded an MCC may take an annual
          credit against their federal income taxes paid on the homebuyer's mortgage. The
          credit is subtracted dollar-for-dollar from his or her federal income taxes. The
          qualified buyer is awarded a tax credit of up to 15% with the remaining 85%
          taken as a deduction from the income in the usual manner.
      Southern California Home Financing Authority (SCHFA): SCHFA offers a
          mortgage revenue bond program that issues 30-year mortgage revenue funds at
          below-market interest rates. To be eligible for the program, the buyer must be a
          first-time homebuyer whose income may not exceed 120% of the Los Angeles
          County median income. The program also provides downpayment and closing

6. Mitigation of Government Constraints
Government regulations can discourage the development, maintenance and
improvement of housing to the extent that such regulations significantly increase
development costs and time lines. The City of Long Beach implements several
programs to ensure that local government regulations are not burdensome. The
following programs are designed to mitigate potential local constraints on residential
development and to facilitate the development of a variety of housing types.
Program 6.1: Development Incentives
The City of Long Beach offers other ways to reduce government constraints that
increase the cost of housing development. In Long Beach, some of these constraints
include government regulations regarding residential development standards, fees or
exactions paid for new residential development, or simply the cost of vacant land.
Several programs designed to mitigate these constraints are as follows:
     a. Density Bonus
          Long Beach has adopted the State density law to provide up to a 35% density
          bonus for projects that include lower income housing, moderate income
          condominiums and housing for seniors and disabled residents. Hence, the City’s
          density bonus program facilitates development of special needs housing.
     b. Planned Development Districts
          The Long Beach Municipal Code allows flexible development plans to be
          prepared for certain areas which may benefit from the formal recognition of
          unique or special land uses and the definition of special design policies and
          standards not otherwise available under conventional zoning regulations.
          Planned Development Districts are designed to permit a compatible mix of land
          uses, allowing for planned commercial areas and business parks, and
          encouraging a variety of housing styles and densities – especially along transit
          corridors and near employment and activity centers.

     c. Fee Waivers and Financial Incentives
          The Long Beach Municipal Code exempts new affordable housing units from
          payment of the City’s development impact fees for parks and recreation and
          transportation improvements if the criteria on length of affordability and
          income/affordability levels are met. Combined, these fees can add over $5,000
          to the per-unit cost of a housing development (see Table 35). Additional financial
          incentives may also be available pursuant to the construction of a density bonus
          project as outlined in the City’s affordable housing ordinance. As part of the
          Housing Action Plan to be prepared in 2015, explore financial incentives to
          encourage the inclusion of affordable housing in transit-oriented development.
     d. Relaxed Development Standards
          The Zoning Code also allows the City Planning Commission to relax
          development standards for lower income, density bonus qualified housing
          projects if a developer can demonstrate that the project is still not financially
          feasible after the density bonus is provided. The percentage of compact parking
          spaces may be increased, tandem parking or fewer parking spaces may be
          allowed, privacy and open standards may be reduced, or height and setbacks
          may be reduced. Finally, the City also allows for a standards variance for lots
          with unique physical conditions that may make standard development infeasible.
     e. Reasonable Accommodation
          The City also has an ordinance allowing people with disabilities reasonable
          accommodation in rules, policies, practices and procedures that may be
          necessary to ensure equal access to housing. The ordinance provides a process
          whereby persons with disabilities can make requests for reasonable
          accommodation in regard to relief from the various land use, zoning or building
          laws, rules, policies, practices or procedures of the City.
     2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
     Continue to offer regulatory incentives to accommodate the development of
          accessible and affordable housing.
     Monitor development trends to determine the continued adequacy of incentives
          in facilitating affordable housing and augment incentives as necessary.
     Promote incentives to interested developers and provide technical assistance
          through pre-application meetings in the use of various incentives.

7. Fair and Equal Housing Opportunity
In order to make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of
the community, the City of Long Beach is firmly committed to promoting fair and equal
housing opportunities for all persons pursuant to State and Federal fair housing laws.
Program 7.1: Fair Housing
Long Beach contracts with the Fair Housing Foundation (FHF), a private, nonprofit,
nonpartisan agency to promote enforcement of fair housing laws. The FHF encourages
open housing opportunities through education, enforcement activities, counseling
services and outreach programs. The FHF takes a proactive stance on random audit
testing in underserved areas and employs a full-time bilingual counselor. FHF provides
counsel and mediation for landlords, tenants, and home seekers; educates tenants,
landlords, owners, realtors and property management companies on fair housing laws;
promotes media and consumer interest; and secures grass roots involvement with the
community.
     2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
     Continue to participate in fair housing programs and support fair housing services
          and tenant/landlord counseling services.
     Promote programs via City newsletters, website, and brochures at public
          counters.

8. Monitoring and Review
The City will periodically review its progress in implementing the goals and policies of
the Housing Element and make adjustments to improve its effectiveness.
Program 8.1: Annual Report
In order to monitor the City’s progress in implementing the Housing Element, the City
will prepare an annual progress report to the City Council and to the State Department
of Housing and Community Development (HCD).

A. Planning Commission Meetings
On March 7, 2013, the City conducted a study session with the Planning Commission to
kick-off the Housing Element update. Residents and representatives from the following
agencies provided comments at the meeting:
      Josh Butler, Director of Community Engagement for Habitat for Humanity and
          Board
      Members of Housing Long Beach
      Reverend Ranjit Mathews, Associate Rector of St. Luke's Episcopal Church
      Ladine Chan, Program Coordinator for EM3
      Kelli Pezzeli, LINC Housing
      Winton Johnson, East Yards Communities for Environmental Justice
      Suzanne Brown, Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles
      Kerry Gallagher, Executive Director of Housing Long Beach
The public expressed the need for affordable housing in Long Beach and urged the City
explore innovative options to provide decent and affordable housing to lower income
households and persons with special needs, especially persons with disabilities.
The Planning Commission conducted a public hearing on June 20, 2013 to review the
Draft Housing Element. Residents and representatives from the following agencies
provided comments at the meeting:
      Josh Butler, Director of Community Engagement for Habitat for Humanity and
          Board
      Members of Housing Long Beach
      Suzanne Brown, Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles
      Kerry Gallagher, Executive Director of Housing Long Beach
On December 5, 2013, the Planning Commission held a public hearing to consider the
Draft Housing Element.
A number of affordable housing advocates (Housing Long Beach, LAFLA, and
SCANPH) and residents spoke on the need for mixed income housing and housing
condition. Specifically, LAFLA reiterated this position in its August 2 and November 26
letters, urging the Planning Commission to delay the adoption process to allow for
additional time to consider LAFLA’s recommendations on mixed income housing,
commercial linkage fee, boomerang funds, and the rent escrow program.
Representatives from the Downtown Long Beach Associates, Apartment Owners’
Association, and Downtown Resident Council, among others, reminded the Planning
Commission the City and its Housing Element has a responsibility to address housing

needs for all income groups, including moderate and above moderate income. A low
income Downtown resident indicated she “welcomes” gentrification as it brings diversity
to the area.
B. City Council Meetings
On December 10, 2013, the City Council conducted a Study Session to receive input on
the Draft Housing Element. The following individuals/organizations spoke at the City
Council Study Session:
     1. Alan Greenlee, Executive Director -- Southern California Association of Non-
          Profit Housing
     2. Richard Lewis, Chairman of the Board -- Downtown Long Beach Associates
     3. Susanne Browne, Senior Attorney – Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles
     4. Ehud Mouchley -- Principal, READI, LLC
     5. Jorge Rivera -- Housing Long Beach
     6. Clive Graham, President -- Apartment Owners’ Association, California Southern
          Cities
     7. Brian D’Andrea -- Century Villages at Cabrillo
     8. Jan van dijs/Cliff Ratkovich -- market rate developer interests
     9. Barbara Shull, Executive Director -- Fair Housing Foundation
     10. Joe Ganem, III, Vice President -- Downtown Residential Council
Affordable housing advocates (Housing Long Beach, LAFLA, and SCANPH) and
several residents expressed similar concerns with the Housing Element – lacking
commitments to adopt an inclusionary housing policy and commercial linkage fee,
dedicate a portion of the boomerang funds for affordable housing, establish a rent
escrow program, and identify specific timeline to amend the Zoning Code for by-right
emergency shelters.
Representatives from Downtown Long Beach Associates and Downtown Resident
Council reiterated the need for moderate and above moderate income residents in
Downtown to create a mixed income area. In addition, the Principal of READI spoke
specifically of the need for middle income housing in Long Beach – people who make
up to 170% of the County median would still need a significant subsidy to afford
purchasing a home in Long Beach. Two developers expressed concerns with
inclusionary housing, especially implications to the overall development costs.
Representative of Apartment Owners’ Association commented on the Foreclosure
Registry program and rent escrow program and expressed concern over potentially
heavy handed application of such programs. Fair Housing Foundation also commented
that the City of Los Angeles’ rent escrow program is ineffective in addressing the
primary concern of habitability issues. All these groups expressed support for the
Housing Element as presented by staff.

Long Beach 2030 Plan

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The City of Long Beach is committed to adopting a Historic Preservation Element in
order to create a pro-active, focused plan for use by residents, local preservation
advocates, City staff, the Cultural Heritage Commission, Redevelopment Agency,
Planning Commission, and City Council. The Historic Preservation Element outlines a
vision for future historic preservation efforts and the actions that need to be taken to
achieve it. Development of the Historic Preservation Element was coordinated with the
City’s 2030 General Plan update. Primary goals of the Historic Preservation Element
are to better integrate historic preservation into City procedures and interdepartmental
decisions, and to create a meaningful partnership with the community in order to
implement the historic preservation program.
The Historic Preservation Element was prepared in accordance with the Secretary of
the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation, the
publication entitled “Preparing a Historic Preservation Plan” by Bradford J. White and
Richard J. Roddewig, and other applicable state standards and guidelines. The
preparation of the Historic Preservation Element included public participation, a review
of the City’s existing preservation program, and a study of federal and state guidelines
and incentives for historic preservation.

and in response to the loss of several
high profile historic buildings. In 1989
the City of Long Beach was the first city
in Los Angeles County to appoint a
Historic Preservation Officer to its
planning staff. With the establishment of
this position, the City began a concerted
effort to include historic preservation into
City planning efforts.
In 1992 the City adopted the current
Cultural Heritage Ordinance (updated in
2009), which created a Cultural Heritage
Commission and codified procedures for
designating historic landmarks and
districts, and for demolishing or altering
historic resources. That same year Long
Beach became a Certified Local
Government, allowing the City to directly
participate in state and federal review of
preservation projects in the City and to
qualify for state grant funding for historic
preservation projects.
In 1993 the City of Long Beach adopted
a Mills Act Program which provides a
reduction in the property taxes for
owners of qualified residential and
commercial buildings in exchange for an
agreement         to      rehabilitate       and/or
maintain the historical and architectural
character of the property. The City
currently has 128 historic properties that
are protected by Mills Act contracts.
There         have         been         significant
preservation projects in the last two
decades, particularly in the downtown

MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL STYLES IN LONG BEACH
In order to plan for the preservation of the City’s historic resources and to properly
educate staff, decision-makers, and the public about historic properties, an
understanding of the architectural styles represented in Long Beach is important. The
2009 City of Long Beach Historic Context Statement62 identified thirty architectural
styles that characterize the City’s built environment between 1784 and 1965. The list is
not intended to be exhaustive, but to provide a framework for the identification and
evaluation of the majority of extant resources in Long Beach built prior to 1965.
For detailed descriptions and representative examples of each style, please refer to the
citywide Historic Context Statement.

GOAL 1: Maintain and support a comprehensive, citywide historic
preservation program to identify and protect Long Beach’s historic,
cultural, and archaeological resources.
A comprehensive historic preservation program is needed to ensure the
protection of historic resources in Long Beach. Decisions affecting historic
resources can be made by a number of entities in the City’s government,
especially in Development Services, Community Development, Economic
Development and Cultural Affairs, and the Office of Sustainability. In addition, the
Cultural Heritage Commission, Redevelopment Agency, Planning Commission,
and City Council must coordinate their goals, policies and actions for this local
government to work most effectively to preserve the City’s historic resources.
POLICIES:
P.1.1         The City shall comply with City, State, and Federal historic
              preservation regulations to ensure adequate protection of the City’s
              cultural, historic, and archaeological resources.
P.1.2         The City shall maintain its status as a Certified Local Government
              (CLG) and ensure that CLG requirements are implemented as the key
              components of the City’s historic preservation program.
P.1.3         The City shall allocate sufficient resources to implement the historic
              preservation program.

              program.
P.1.5         The City shall use and encourage the public to use technical
              assistance available through the State Office of Historic Preservation,
              National Park Service, the California Preservation Foundation, and the
              National Trust for Historic Preservation to help guide and fund Long
              Beach’s Historic Preservation Program.
P.1.6         The City shall pursue grant funding available through the CLG
              program, the State Office of Historic Preservation, and other funding
              sources to maintain and expand the historic preservation program in
              Long Beach.
P.1.7         The City shall continue to provide training for Cultural Heritage
              Commissioners and City staff implementing the historic preservation
              program on topics including the Secretary of the Interior Standards, the
              State Historic Building Code, environmental review for historic
              resources, tax credits and incentives for historic preservation, and
              other preservation issues.
P.1.8         The City shall evaluate the effectiveness of the Historic Preservation
              Program and make policy and program changes as necessary.
IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES:
I.M.1.1       The City will continue to monitor historic preservation regulations from
              federal and state codes and, as changes occur, incorporate the new
              standards into the City’s Municipal Code, and into its planning and
              development review activities. With assistance from the Legal
              Department, the Development Services Department will periodically
              recommend updates to the provisions of the Municipal Code to ensure
              consistency with federal and state codes.
I.M.1.2       Alterations to historic properties will be reviewed according to the
              Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and in accordance with the
              California Environmental Quality Act.
I.M.1.3       The City will review and amend as needed the Cultural Heritage
              Commission Ordinance and other provisions of the Municipal Code to
              ensure that City policies continue to reflect standard preservation
              practices and allow for the successful realization of the historic
              preservation program outlined in this document.
I.M.1.4       The City will continue to support the historic preservation program
              using City staff and consultants with historic preservation expertise.

I.M.1.5       The City will continue to fulfill the State Office of Historic Preservation
              (OHP) requirements for Certified Local Governments to maintain Long
              Beach’s Certified Local Government status. Requirements include on-
              going training of Cultural Heritage Commissioners and City staff,
              conducting Commission meetings in an open public forum, updating
              the historic resources inventory and completing an annual report to
              OHP on the City’s progress in meeting the goals of the historic
              preservation program.
I.M.1.6       The City will maintain contact with the State Office of Historic
              Preservation and seek to develop preservation partnerships with other
              agencies, groups, and foundations at the national, state and local
              levels.
I.M.1.7       The City will apply for and encourage other constituencies in Long
              Beach to apply for grants available through the State Office of Historic
              Preservation and other funding sources to maintain and expand the
              historic preservation program in Long Beach.
I.M.1.8       The Cultural Heritage Commission will provide an annual report to the
              Planning Commission evaluating the effectiveness of the City’s historic
              preservation policies and program. Recommendations for amendments
              to the Historic Preservation Element or program will be made as
              needed by the Cultural Heritage Commission to the Planning
              Commission, and by the Planning Commission to the City Council.

GOAL 2: Protect historic resources from demolition and inappropriate
alterations through the use of the City’s regulatory framework, technical
assistance, and incentives.
Federal, state, and local regulations that protect historic and cultural resources
are based on identification and designation. The City of Long Beach has adopted
regulations to protect resources which enable the City to comply with state and
federal law. Critical to the success of these regulations will be educating City staff
in all relevant departments, and working effectively with Commission members to
ensure that rules and policies are being consistently administered.
POLICIES:
P.2.1         The City shall discourage the demolition and inappropriate alteration of
              historic buildings.
P.2.2         The City shall encourage and allow for adaptive reuse of historic
              buildings.
P.2.3         The City shall continue to use the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards
              as guidelines for appropriate rehabilitation projects, adaptive reuse, or
              additions to historic structures.
P.2.4         The City shall ensure compliance of all historic preservation,
              redevelopment, and new construction projects with the California
              Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and Section 106 of the National
              Historic Preservation Act.
P.2.5         The City shall enforce historic preservation codes and regulations.
P.2.6         The City shall implement and promote incentives for historic
              preservation.
P.2.7         The City shall encourage and support public, quasi-public, and private
              entities in local preservation efforts, including the designation of
              historic resources and the preservation of designated resources.

Long Beach 2030 Plan

IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES:
I.M.2.1       The City will continue to discourage the demolition or inappropriate
              alteration of historic resources through the implementation of the
              provisions of the City Charter and Municipal Code pertaining to the
              City’s Historic Preservation Program and Cultural Heritage
              Commission.
I.M.2.2       The City will ensure compliance with the California Environmental
              Quality Act (CEQA) and Section 106 of the National Historic
              Preservation Act, and will continue to consult with the appropriate
              organizations and individuals to minimize potential impacts to historic,
              cultural, and archaeological resources.
I.M.2.3       The City will follow design guidelines for historic districts based on the
              Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation.
I.M.2.4       The City will use the administrative citation program for code
              enforcement citywide, including for properties in historic districts, in
              order to ensure better and timelier compliance with City regulations for
              the upkeep of historic buildings and sites.
I.M.2.5       The City will reestablish the Mills Act program for owners of designated
              historic properties and will implement a program to inspect and monitor
              existing Mills Act properties and to review new applications to ensure
              that proposed projects meet the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards
              for Rehabilitation.
I.M.2.6       The City will accept preservation easements on historic buildings as a
              financial incentive for rehabilitation projects.
I.M.2.7       The City will promote the Federal Rehabilitation Investment Tax Credit
              program, and will encourage the use of the Low Income Housing Tax
              Credit program in conjunction with the Federal Historic Preservation
              Tax Incentive program (also known as the Rehabilitation Investment
              Tax Credit) for the rehabilitation and reuse of historic properties.

GOAL 3: Maintain and expand the inventory of historic resources in Long
Beach.
A current inventory of historic resources is essential to preservation planning and
is the foundation of any preservation effort. Historic and cultural resource surveys
provide City officials, residents, and other stakeholders with a framework for the
integration of historic resources into community planning. Surveys allow the
Cultural Heritage Commission, Planning Commission, and City Council the
opportunity to make decisions about historic district designations with the
knowledge of how particular resources fit into the fabric of the City and how these
resources are significant to the City’s history. Surveys furnish property owners,
developers, and the community with a good sense of what historic resources the
City considers important, thereby providing predictability to the development
process.
As the community grows and changes over time, some historic and cultural
resources will be lost to demolition or inappropriate alteration, while others may
be recognized for the first time. Consistently updating and maintaining the
inventory of the City’s historic and cultural resources allows decision-makers and
the public to make informed and supportable decisions about protection of such
resources and the appropriate place of development.
POLICIES:
P.3.1         The City shall conduct and update historic resource surveys on an on-
              going basis and, in compliance with CLG requirements, shall ensure
              that survey results are integrated into the statewide comprehensive
              historic preservation planning process.

              individual resources and districts in Long Beach.
P.3.3         The City shall conduct historic resources surveys pursuant to the
              Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for Archeology

              identified as potentially significant, including those identified through
              CEQA or Section 106 analysis.
P.3.5         The City shall work to better integrate information about historic
              resources and potential historic resources with other property
              databases maintained by the City’s Geographic Information Systems
              unit.
IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES:
I.M.3.1       The City will establish a work program for updating the historic
              resources survey.
I.M.3.2       The City will allocate resources on an annual or semi-annual basis as
              feasible to update the historic resources survey.
I.M.3.3       The City will prioritize unsurveyed areas and will consider updating
              existing surveys with the intention of creating a citywide historic
              resources survey.
I.M.3.4       The City will update the citywide historic context statement as needed.

 GOAL 4: Increase public awareness and appreciation of the City’s history
 and historic, cultural, and archaeological resources.
 Educating the citizens of Long Beach is essential to the development of an
 effective historic preservation program. Education and outreach to the
 community should include both information about the history of Long Beach and
 information about historic preservation policies and practices. A continued,
 strong commitment to public participation in historic preservation decision-
 making is needed. Citizen awareness of survey efforts, Cultural Heritage
 Commission meetings, and other processes will help ensure the protection of
 historic resources in Long Beach.
 Heritage education programs in local schools can create a sense of pride in
 Long Beach and a stronger connection to the community. Plaques, public art,
 and exhibits that direct attention to historic resources are a powerful way to
 illustrate and interpret the history of the City’s built environment.
 POLICIES:
 P.4.1        The City shall participate in efforts to increase public awareness,
              appreciation and stewardship of the important historic and cultural

 P.4.3        The City shall solicit and encourage public comment and participation
              in preservation decision-making.
 P.4.4        The City shall encourage the inclusion of historic preservation-related
              topics in the teaching of local history at Long Beach schools.

Long Beach 2030 Plan

              of the community; the donation of historic memorabilia and artifacts to
              the Historical Society and Long Beach Public Libraries; and other
              actions which further constituents’ understanding and appreciation of
              the history and cultural resources of Long Beach.
 P.4.6        The City shall encourage the installation of appropriate plaques and
              public art related to historic buildings, landmarks, districts, and sites in
              the community.
 P.4.7        The City shall ensure that historic preservation planning is inclusive of
              the unique histories and diverse neighborhoods found throughout Long
              Beach.

              in order to promote appreciation, maintenance, rehabilitation and
              preservation of the City historic resources. Information will be available
              at the Development Services Center, through the Neighborhood
              Resources Center, at other cultural and educational institutions, at City
              libraries, and on the City’s website.
I.M.4.3       The Planning Bureau, Cultural Heritage Commission, and Historic
              Preservation Officer will work with community partners to periodically
              conduct workshops for owners of historic properties, real estate agents
              and others describing the benefits and responsibilities of owning an
              historic property, and the incentives and technical assistance available
              for historic property rehabilitation work.
I.M.4.4       The City will use its regularly noticed meetings of the Cultural Heritage
              Commission to take public comment and consider public input before
              decisions are made. Meeting agendas, staff reports, and minutes will
              continue to be available on the City’s website.

Long Beach 2030 Plan

              books, newspapers, periodicals, documentaries, photographs, and
              other research materials relevant to historic preservation and cultural
              resources.
I.M.4.7       The City will work with historic district representatives to explore ways
              to increase homeowners’ awareness that they have or are buying a
              home in a designated historic district and what benefits and
              responsibilities this entails.
I.M.4.8       The City will work with owners of historic landmarks, historic district
              representatives and operators of historic sites to allow the installation
              of appropriate markers to call attention to the significance of historic
              resources.
I.M.4.9       The City will consider partnerships with local preservation
              organizations, the Long Beach Public Library, and the Long Beach

GOAL 5: Integrate historic preservation policies into City’s community
development, economic development, and sustainable-city strategies.
Commercial redevelopment, new housing construction, tourism promotion, and
business improvement strategies should consistently be integrated with historic
preservation considerations in order to facilitate a cohesive and holistic approach
to land use planning for an economically prosperous, socially equitable, and
environmentally sustainable community. Protecting and preserving historic
resources encourages community pride, stimulates investment, maintains quality
of life and neighborhood character, and is a sustainable practice.
POLICIES:
P.5.1         The City of Long Beach shall use the City Charter, General Plan, and
              Municipal Code to integrate historic preservation policies into the City’s
              community development, economic development, and sustainable-city
              strategies.

P.5.4         The City shall consult the State Office of Historic Preservation’s Main
              Street Principles when undertaking the rehabilitation and/or
              redevelopment of historic commercial corridors.
P.5.5         Prior to any City-owned property with historic designation potential
              being sold, traded, altered, or demolished, the City shall evaluate its
              potential to serve as a catalyst for neighborhood economic
              development or to otherwise fulfill a community development role.
City of Long Beach Historic Preservation Element                                          75
Long Beach 2030 Plan

P.5.6         The City shall encourage creative and adaptive reuse of historic
              buildings as a sustainable practice, as well as an opportunity to further
              cultural tourism, and the economic or community development
              objectives of the surrounding community.
P.5.7         The City shall promote historic preservation as a sustainable land use
              practice.
IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES:
I.M.5.1       The City will continue to use the General Plan (especially this Historic
              Preservation Element), City Charter, and Municipal Code to integrate
              historic preservation goals and policies into the City’s community
              development, economic development, and sustainable-city strategies.
I.M.5.2       The City will ensure that design review procedures are coordinated
              between all relevant City departments and Commissions in order to
              effectively protect historic properties and architectural features that
              have historic significance.
I.M.5.3       The City will identify projects which could use Community
              Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, HUD grants, the Home
              Improvement and Commercial Improvement Rebate Programs, the
              Low-income Homeowner Residential Rehabilitation Loan Program and
              the Neighborhood Partners Program for rehabilitation of historic
              properties.
I.M.5.4       The City will amend the Municipal Code to ensure that prior to any City
              or Redevelopment Agency-owned property with historic designation
              potential being sold, traded, altered, or demolished, the City will
              evaluate the potential of such property to serve as a catalyst for
              neighborhood economic development or otherwise fulfill a community
              development role.
I.M.5.5       The City will encourage historic preservation through adopted
              provisions for reduced parking and adaptive reuse of historically
              significant properties, and will uphold such provisions in future updates
              to the Municipal Code.
I.M.5.6       The City will develop sustainable guidelines for historic buildings,
              based on adopted green building standards and water-saving
              requirements in the Municipal Code, and will continue to consider
              sustainability issues in future updates to the Municipal Code.

Long Beach 2030 Plan

I.M.5.7       As a sustainable practice, the City will encourage repair rather than
              replacement of historic materials in accordance with the Secretary of
              the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation.
I.M.5.8       As a sustainable practice, the City will encourage salvaging
              architectural features for reuse prior to the demolition or rehabilitation
              of a building.
I.M.5.9       To facilitate the reuse of salvaged architectural features the City will
              seek to create a non-profit architectural storage and sales facility.

APPENDIX A: GLOSSARY
The California Historical Building Code (CHBC) is Title 24, Building
Standards, Part 8 California Code of Regulations. The intent of the CHBC is to
facilitate the preservation and continuing use of qualified historic buildings or
properties while providing reasonable safety for the building occupants and
access for people with disabilities.
The California Register of Historical Resources is a listing of archaeological
and Historic Resources that meet the criteria for designation in the California
Register as defined in California Public Resources Code Section 5020.1, as it
may be amended from time to time. It is the authoritative guide in California to be
used by state and local agencies, private groups, and citizens to identify the
state’s historical resources.
A certificate of appropriateness is an approved certificate issued for work on a
historic resource.
Character-defining features are those physical aspects of a property’s design
and form which identify it as belonging to a specific time and place. Design,
materials, form, and style of decorative features and spaces, both interior and
exterior, make up the character-defining features of a building.
A comprehensive survey includes a historic context statement, photographs,
architectural descriptions, statements of significance for all eligible properties,
analysis, and recommendations.
Designation is the act of recognizing, labeling, or listing a property as being
historic. Properties in the City may be designated at the federal level as a
National Historic Landmark or in the National Register of Historic Places, at the
state level in the California Register of Historical Resources or as a California
Historical Landmark or California Point of Interest, or as a historic site by the
Long Beach City Council. A designation formally establishes that a building or
site has significance.
Historic context is an organizing structure for interpreting history that groups
information about historic properties that share a common theme, a common
geographical area, and a common time period. The development of a historic
context serves as a foundation for decisions about the planning, identification,
evaluation, registration, and treatment of historic properties, based on
comparative historic significance.
A historic district is a significant concentration, linkage, or continuity of sites,
buildings, structures, or objects united historically or aesthetically in a
City of Long Beach Historic Preservation Element                                     A-1
Long Beach 2030 Plan

distinguishable way or in a geographically definable area that retain sufficient
integrity and meet at least one criteria for designation.
A historical resource is defined by CEQA as (1) a resource listed in, or
determined to be eligible by the State Historical Resources Commission, for
listing in the California Register of Historical Resources (Pub. Res. Code
§5024.1, Title 14 CCR, Section 4850 et seq.); (2) a resource included in a local
register of historical resources or identified as significant in an historical resource
survey; (3) determined by the lead agency to be historically significant. Generally,
a resource shall be considered by the lead agency to be "historically significant" if
the resource meets the criteria for listing on the California Register of Historical
Resources (Pub. Res. Code, § 5024.1, Title 14 CCR, Section 4852).
A historical resources inventory lists by address all properties in a city that
have been evaluated through historical resources surveys or other evaluations,
including those properties that have been identified as non-historic. “Status
codes” developed by the State Office of Historic Preservation are frequently used
to categorize properties listed in the inventory and their significance or non-
significance.
A historic resources survey is the systematic and standardized process,
including historical research and field work, for identifying and gathering data on
the City’s potential Historic Resources for the purpose of evaluating the
resources per local, State, and/or Federal criteria.
Historic significance is the reason why a property should be considered
historic. Establishing historic significance is important because it demonstrates
that the determination that a building is historic is based in sound reasoning. An
argument for historic significance must be based upon legally established criteria
such as those required for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, the
California Register of Historical Resources, or a local landmark program.
Integrity is the authenticity of a property’s historic identity, evidenced by the
survival of physical characteristics and materials that existed during the
property’s historic or pre-historic period of significance.
The National Register of Historic Places is the nation’s official inventory of
districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects significant in American history,

                  Adopted by the City Council on October 15, 2002


OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
                   OPEN SPACE and RECREATION ELEMENT
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS
The Open Space Element is one of the seven mandatory elements of a General Plan in
California. In adopting the open space legislation, the State made a point of saying that
providing for open space is a critical component of local land use planning. Beyond
this, the California Government Code specifies that local General Plans may include
other elements or address other subjects, which relate to the physical development of a
community. As Long Beach is a fully developed, densely populated City of nearly ½
million residents, and the current Open Space Element does not include a strong
analysis of open space for public recreation (a critical component in this community),
this new Open Space and Recreation Element addresses the requirements of open
space planning with a special emphasis on planning for public recreation.
Four topical areas are required to be covered by Open Space Elements: open space
for the preservation of natural resources, open space for the managed production of
resources, open space for public health and safety, and open space for outdoor
recreation. While each of these topics is covered in this new Open Space and
Recreation Element, efforts are underway to reduce redundancy and present a more
integrated, user-friendly General Plan for Long Beach. Hence, the material herein on
open space for the preservation and production of natural resources and open space for
public health and safety is somewhat condensed in this Open Space and Recreation
Element. It is recognized that in this large and diverse community these topics deserve
special focus. Therefore, they will be more comprehensively updated and addressed in
entirely new General Plan chapters on natural resources and environmental hazards. In
the meantime, the existing Land Use, Conservation, Seismic Safety and Public Safety
elements address these issues and plans.
THE PLANNING PROCESS
This updated element of the City’s General Plan has been a few years in the making.
An original Draft Open Space and Recreation Element was released in the summer of
1998 and public workshops were held on August 13th and December 3rd.
Coincidentally, a new Citywide strategic plan was undertaken to establish fresh policy
focuses for the community, which was just emerging from a severe economic recession.
Tangentially, the Parks, Recreation and Marine Department began their own strategic
planning effort. Ultimately, it was agreed that further development of the new Open
Space and Recreation Element should be postponed until these strategic planning
efforts were (largely) completed.
With adoption of the Long Beach Strategic Plan 2010 in June of 2000, and completion
of the new Parks, Recreation and Marine Department Strategic Plan slated for this
winter, the City is now proceeding with the Open Space and Recreation Element
adoption process. This document represents a new, modernized, streamlined approach
to updating the current (1973) Open Space Element. As explained below, this
City of Long Beach                        1                                   General Plan

OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
document relies heavily on the original 1998 draft plan and the new Department
strategic plan for background and technical information. However, the streamlined
nature of this new element emphasizes the policy plan and implementation measures
which are directed to addressing the community’s primary open space and recreation
issues.
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
In addition to the 1998 public workshops to discuss a new Open Space and Recreation
Element, in the spring of 2001 the City Council’s Housing and Neighborhoods
Committee held five public meetings. The first meeting was held in the City Council
Chambers. The next four public meetings were held in various park recreation centers
throughout the community. These forums were widely advertised, translators were
made available, and they were open to any member of the community with a desire to
address City park, recreation and open space issues.
Public input on the 2001 Draft Open Space and Recreation Element was solicited
through another citywide public meeting on Saturday, February 23, 2002 and at a
meeting of the Recreation Commission on March 21, 2002. Once again the draft will be
revised, as necessary, to meet community open space and recreation goals. The
culmination of all these meetings will result in final document adoption hearings held
before the City Planning Commission and City Council in accordance with the
provisions of Government Code Article 10.5 Sections 65302 (e) and 65560.
TECHNICAL SYNOPSIS
The material below summarizes information contained in the 1998 Draft Open Space
and Recreation Element and the 2001 Draft Parks, Recreation and Marine Department
Strategic Plan pertaining to existing open space and recreation resources in the City of
Long Beach.
A.       NATURAL RESOURCE OPEN SPACE
Because of our coastal setting, the City’s open space resources include both land and
water areas. There are approximately 11,600 water (surface) acres for fish and wildlife
habitat including: bays, rivers, creeks, channels and canals, lagoons, lakes and ponds,
and wetlands. Of these acres all but 1,000 acres are also considered areas for fishing
and marine life production. Wooded areas in DeForest Park and the El Dorado Nature
Center comprise approximately 115 acres. In addition to the San Gabriel and Los
Angeles rivers and Alamitos Bay, physiographic features of note include 11 linear miles
of beachfront property, 1.8 miles of bluffs or hillside areas, 42 acres on four man-made
islands (currently used for oil extraction) and Signal Hill. It is estimated that there are
approximately ten acres of land devoted to community gardens and at least 125 acres
of land at utility rights-of-way are still used for growing nursery plants. There are
approximately 275 landside acres devoted to oil and gas extraction, with about 85
percent of these acres located in the harbor district.

OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
B.        RECREATION AND RECREATION OPEN SPACE
          The City’s recreational resources include parks, community centers, golf courses,
          bike and equestrian trails, numerous special use recreation resources, and
          coastal amenities including beaches, a boardwalk, an esplanade, piers, fishing
          platforms, boat launches, a rowing center, a sailing center, harbors and marinas.
1.        Parks and Nature Preserves
          The City of Long Beach has 921 parks encompassing 1,4132 acres. There are 22
          mini parks totaling 21 acres, nine greenway parks totaling 71 acres, 19
          neighborhood parks totaling 147 acres, 13 community parks totaling 464 acres,
          El Dorado Regional Park with 401 “regional use” acres, and 28 special use parks
          totaling 310 acres and 12 acres of land at the two ranchos3. Greenway parks are
          largely undeveloped ribbons of green spaces. Special use parks include our
          riverfront recreation vehicle campground, two special events parks (Queen Mary
          and Rainbow Lagoon), the calm water swimming park at Colorado Lagoon, and
          Shoreline/Riverfront, Santa Cruz and Victory parks, a nature center park and a
          nature trail park. Some of the unique facilities found in local parks include a
          skateboard park, lawn bowling greens, an archery range, a model boat building
          shop, casting pond, paddleboat lake, duck pond and a dog park.
          The land has been acquired and future park facilities development is planned for
          Costa del Sol, End Beach and Dunster Parks at Marine Stadium, and the
          development of several mini parks. The four offshore islands are planned for
          recreation open space when oil extraction is no longer a viable use for them.
          The City is also working with the California Coastal Conservancy and others to
          rehabilitate wetland acreage at the Los Cerritos Wetlands in southeast Long
          Beach, and at Dominguez Gap and other areas along the Los Angeles River.
          With the creation of the Lower Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers and
          Mountains Conservancy, the City will also be exploring opportunities to further
          enhance habitat and recreation opportunities along the San Gabriel River as well.
2.        Parks, Recreation and Marine Programs
          The Parks, Recreation and Marine Department has one of the most extensive,
          award-winning programs in the United States. Their many offerings include all
          types of leisure time pursuits for all age groups. Special emphasis is placed on
          the diverse cultural backgrounds of our residents with a focus on meeting youth

         and senior citizen needs. Uniquely, the City is one of a handful in the nation
         sponsoring its own municipal band. Composed of professional musicians, free
         concerts are given throughout the summer in local City parks. The Parks,
         Recreation and Marine Department operates a Mobile Recreation Van and
         Mobile Skate Park programs that travel to neighborhoods which lack recreation
         resources, bringing them equipment and supervised play programs. The
         Department publishes a quarterly recreation schedule that is directly mailed to
         each residence. They sponsor affordable summer day camps including sports,
         music, sailing, counselor-in-training, teen and early teen programs, and aquatic
         camps. The City’s free youth sports program provides skill development and
         games in six different sports, serving almost 10,000 Long Beach youth. In
         addition, the City partners with the YMCA and boys and girls clubs to increase
         recreational opportunities for youth and teens. Today, school site recreation
         programs managed by the Parks, Recreation and Marine Department are held at
         16 elementary and five middle school locations. Additional offerings are outlined
         in the information below.
3.       Community Activity Centers
         There are 26 City-owned and operated community activity centers in Long
         Beach, varying in terms of both size and program offerings. The California
         Community Recreation Center, Cesar E. Chavez Park Community Center, El
         Dorado Park West Community Center, Recreation Park Bruins Den, Houghton
         Park Community Center, and the Silverado Park Community Center are among
         the largest centers and operate the widest array of health and recreation
         programs. Many of the community centers offer supervised after-school activities
         including arts and crafts, book clubs, boys and girls clubs, fitness instruction,
         cooking instruction, weight training, game room activities and meeting rooms.
         There are four community centers with gymnasiums, two centers that emphasize
         senior programs and six centers that emphasize teen programs. The Long
         Beach Senior Center is the largest such facility on the West Coast. Programs,
         clubs, dances, classes, and information and referral services are available to the
         senior community, with five satellite programs offered at community parks in the
         City.
         Teen programs offer tutoring, counseling, employment development, referral
         services, computer labs and life-skills workshops. The Homeland Cultural Center
         (1321 E. Anaheim) offers writing, music, acting and dance workshops, and a
         mural arts program. Mural arts also operate out of a park building at 340 Nieto
         Avenue. The Leeway Sailing Center rents non-motorized boats and offers
         instruction in sailing, kayaking and water safety.
4.       Swimming Pools
         There are five City swimming pools located at the Martin Luther King Junior Park,
         Silverado Park, and the Belmont Plaza Pool Complex (3). The City-owned
City of Long Beach                          4                                  General Plan

OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
         Recreation Vehicle Campground has a small pool. There are four swimming
         pools at Long Beach Unified School District (LBUSD) high schools that are open
         to the public in the summer through City/LBUSD joint use agreements. Also, the
         City Colleges and California State University at Long Beach add an additional
         four pools to the public pool inventory.
5.       Golf Courses
         There are five City-owned golf courses in Long Beach at Heartwell, El Dorado,
         Recreation and Skylinks. All together they have four driving ranges, three 18-
         hole courses, one 9-hole course and one 18-hole par three lighted course,
         encompassing 568 municipal golf acres. The City contracts with private
         concessionaires who operate the courses. There are also two private golf
         courses and one private driving range in the City. The courses are an 18-hole
         course at Virginia Country Club and a 9-hole course at Bixby Ranch. A new,
         publicly accessible driving range is located at the intersection of the I-405 San
         Diego Freeway and the Los Angeles River.
6.       Equestrian, Bicycle, Walking and Skating Trails
         There remains a segment of equestrian trail on the floodplain adjacent to the Los
         Angeles River, but only a handful of properties along the river allow horses to be
         kept. These trails lie on County of Los Angeles flood control property, which is
         being studied for various open space enhancements under the Los Angeles
         River Master Plan.
         According to the 2001 Long Beach Bicycle Master Plan, the City has an
         estimated 64 miles of bikeways, 35 of which are completely separated from
         roadway traffic. The shoreline, river and park trails accommodate pedestrians,
         skate boarders and skating as well. Although this chapter contains a policy and
         program recommending the development of an open space linkage and trails
         plan, the bicycle map and policies pertaining to walking and cycling in the
         community are largely contained in the Transportation (Circulation) Element.
7.       Long Beach Museum of Art
         Recently renovated and expanded, the Long Beach Museum of Art is located in
         Bluff Park at 2300 E. Ocean Boulevard. The Museum is very reasonably priced
         and is open to the public five days a week. It features applied and decorative arts
         including paintings, sculpture, video and children’s art. Summer concerts are
         performed in the courtyard area overlooking the Pacific Ocean.
8.       Beaches
         Located between the Los Angeles and San Gabriel rivers, Long Beach has
         approximately 247 acres of beaches and 11 miles of shoreline. Although the
         beach property is owned by the State, the City retains responsibility for

         maintaining the beach and beach facilities. Currently it is estimated that the
         annual visitation rate to these beaches is 7.5 million visitors. The water is
         relatively calm as a result of the extensive federal breakwater along the City’s
         coastline. But beach conditions and water quality are challenged when storms
         occur in the Los Angeles basin and polluted urban runoff flows down the Los
         Angeles and San Gabriel rivers and washes up on our shores. Policies and
         programs in this Element and in the Local Coastal Program are designed to
         address this major local issue.
9.       Belmont Pier, Fishing Spots and Platforms
         A major renovation of Belmont Pier is planned. Electrical and water conduits will
         be replaced, new lighting, signage and surfacing will be added, the old bait,
         tackle and snack building will be torn down, new fishing nodes will be installed,
         and a new restaurant and restrooms will be built. The adjoining public parking lot
         will be relandscaped and resurfaced, and the bike path will be rerouted to the
         beach side of the lot.
         In addition to the fishing bays at Belmont Pier, public fishing platforms line the
         edge of Shoreline Aquatic/Riverfront Park just south of the aquarium. People are
         also able to fish from the rock embankments along the rivers, at 72nd Place on
         the peninsula, and in select spots at Alamitos Bay.
10.      Rainbow Harbor and Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific
         Rainbow Harbor was recently constructed in the first phase of the Queensway
         Bay downtown waterfront redevelopment plan. It features eight public piers
         designed to accommodate visiting historic ships, water taxis, fishing and harbor
         dining and sightseeing boats. Special landscaping, lighting and music effects,
         and a double-tiered pedestrian esplanade surround the harbor contributing to
         both its daytime and evening ambiance.
11.      Marinas and Boat Launches
         The City owns and operates two large marinas and one smaller marina which
         constitute the largest municipally owned marina operation in the nation.
         Currently the downtown Rainbow Marina has 86 boat slips, the downtown
         Shoreline Marina has 1,744 slips and the Alamitos Bay Marina has 1,967 slips.
         Long Beach also has five public boat launches: Davies, Claremont, Granada,
         Marine Stadium and South Shore. Everything from powerboats and jet skis,
         sailboats, windsurfers, skulls, catamarans and kayaks can be launched from
         Long Beach shores.
C.       MEETING RECREATION NEEDS
         The current Open Space Element was adopted in 1973. Since then, tremendous
         population changes have occurred throughout the State, including the City of
         Long Beach. Not only are we much more ethnically diverse, (Long Beach is the
City of Long Beach                         6                                    General Plan

OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
         most ethnically diverse of the 65 largest cities in the nation), but over 100,000
         new residents live in our community. This 28 percent increase, larger family
         sizes and a sluggish housing development market over the last decade, have
         resulted in increased persons per household or increased population density. A
         greater proportion of the population is children, and the average resident is less
         affluent than thirty years ago.
         While population has soared, the City’s usable open space has not kept pace.
         Recreation open space in 1973 was estimated to be 2,500 acres. In 2001, we
         have an estimated 2,600 acres of recreation open space. The community has
         lost ground with respect to the ratio of open space per capita. In 1973 the ratio of
         recreation open space to population was 7.0 acres per 1,000 residents. Today
         this ratio is only 5.6 acres. Further, much of the recreation open space is located
         in the eastern and coastal sections of the community, while most of the
         population growth has occurred in the central, western and northern sections.
         This has made access to recreation open space problematic for much of our
         youth population. This plan seeks to address these fundamentals concerns.
         Answering the question, “how much open space is enough?” is not easy. In an
         attempt to do so, however, City staff has examined the National Recreation and
         Park Association (NRPA) recommendations and measured our community
         against others.
         Though in 1971 the NRPA initially recommended a national standard of ten (10)
         acres of parkland for each 1,000 residents in a community, by 1983 the NRPA
         officially changed this recommendation. Finding that no single standard was
         applicable to all jurisdictions and situations, since 1983 the NRPA has
         recommended that each jurisdiction develop and adopt their own local standard
         for open space per capita. This position was reaffirmed in the NRPA’s “1995
         Parks, Recreation and Open Space Guidelines.”
         Beyond NRPA recommendations, in formulating the Department’s Strategic Plan
         the authors benchmarked our community against major American cities similar to
         ours and found an average of 7.2 acres of recreation open space per 1,000
         residents. A significant difference was evident in that most of these cities do not
         have the water recreation resources Long Beach has.
         Given the amount of recreation open space available now, factoring in future
         possible open space acquisition opportunities and the City’s economic
         development efforts to become a viable tourist destination, it is felt that Long
         Beach could and should reach a recreation open space standard above the
         average. Thus, with adoption of this Element the City of Long Beach is
         establishing its recreation open space standard at eight (8) acres per 1,000
         residents. Based on the 2000 population of 461,522 and this standard, the City
         should have a total of 3,692 acres of recreation open space. The table below
         lists the City’s recreation acreages at this time.

                      Note: Table OSR–1 does not include water acres in the San
                      Pedro Bay off the Long Beach shoreline. Although these
                      waters are used for swimming, fishing, windsurfing and
                      boating, areas such as these are generally not included in
                      calculations of park and recreation open space.
         With 2,613 acres of recreation open space and a population of 461,522 the City
         of Long Beach is now providing approximately 5.6 acres of recreation open
         space per 1,000 residents. To meet the target of eight acres per 1,000 residents
         the City needs 1,080 acres over what currently exists. Additional acreage would
         also be required in order to keep pace with population growth. How do we get
         there?
         Even though many communities include the city’s public school campuses in
         recreation acreage counts, in Long Beach most of these sites are not freely
         accessible to the general public most of the time. Although there are currently 49
         acres of school recreation grounds available to the community for after school
         recreation, additional staff is needed to provide for more, safe after school use. If
         Long Beach public schools were more accessible, they would contribute an
         additional 359 open space recreation acres to our inventory.
         Figure OSR-2 illustrates where the schools are. Certainly better utilization of this
         resource would help fill the recreation open space gaps identified in Figure OSR-
         3.
         Today, there are over 96,000 students enrolled in the Long Beach Unified School
         District (LBUSD or the District), enough to fill the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. This
         population is projected to grow by about 1,500 students each year for the next
         five years. By 2005 the District is projecting a minimum of 102,000 students.
         Currently the District is planning to build ten new schools, expand existing
         campuses, and create some two-story buildings to absorb this increase. While
         the City is working with the LBUSD to accommodate these students and the new
         and expanded campuses, more needs to be done to open school grounds for

         community enrichment programs, including public recreation. This is a strong
         focus of the newly adopted Citywide 2010 Strategic Plan, which advocates a
         return to the city/school community partnership that once existed.               The
         implementation programs portion of this plan recommends that a new, high level,
         City/LBUSD committee be created to directly address these concerns.
         One method of maintaining necessary recreation resources is through
         development impact fees. Under California law, in-lieu or impact funds can be
         used for park renovation, acquisition and development. In 1989 the City Council
         enacted an ordinance requiring a park impact fee to be paid by new residential
         developments to help pay for the recreational needs of a growing population.
         However, this fee has been insufficient in terms of meeting its intent of preventing
         a worsening of the recreation open space to population ratio as it solely
         addresses growth based on new residential development. In contrast, more
         people occupying existing residences have accommodated most of our
         community’s growth since 1989; i.e., household sizes have become larger as
         housing prices have escalated. In light of these circumstances, economic
         inflation since the fee was adopted, and new recreation open space goals
         promulgated by this plan, the City’s park impact fee should be reviewed for
         possible adjustments
         Additionally, this Element recommends the establishment of a dedicated source
         of funds for park infrastructure maintenance and capital improvements. The park
         impact fee can be an important source of park acquisition and development
         funding, but it should not be the only source. Without a reliable flow of funds,
         park capital improvement planning is left to the caprices of changing political and
         economic climates. With dedicated annual funding, capital improvements can be
         better planned and budgeted.
         The following pages illustrate where parks and public schools are located in the
         City and list the recreation facilities in City parks and schools.

OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
ISSUES, GOALS/OBJECTIVES, POLICIES & PROGRAMS
Listed below are the major issues associated with open space and recreation in the
City, organized by the four topical areas required by State law. Immediately following
are the goals, objectives and policies associated with each issue. Following that are
tables that list the programs designed to employ the policies and attain the goals. Each
of the policies list the issue(s) it addresses and each of the programs list the policies
from which they emanate. They are purposely kept brief and broad in focus as this is a
“general plan.” More specific background and technical information is contained in the
1998 Draft Open Space and Recreation Element, the 2001 Parks, Recreation and
Marine Strategic Plan, and existing General Plan elements including the Conservation,
Seismic Safety, Public Safety and Local Coastal Program. Each is referenced herein to
create this less voluminous General Plan. Although at this time some redundancy will
occur with these issues and the goals and objectives, policies and programs associated
with addressing them, with the adoption of the updated General Plan these
redundancies will be eliminated.
1.       OPEN SPACE FOR THE PRESERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES
In our highly urbanized environment, areas of the City that retain natural resources are
quite limited. There are, however, a few remnant parcels of natural habitat both on the
land and in water bodies associated with the City. Perhaps foremost among this
locality’s concerns, shared with our neighbors along the rivers and coast, is saving what
we can of our once very fertile habitats - coastal and riparian ecosystems. Wetlands,
arguably the most biologically productive environments on the earth, are particularly
important in our uniquely mild Mediterranean climate here in Southern California. They
serve as a critical wildlife habitat, marine life nursery, and a stopping/feeding grounds
for migratory birds. With 90 to 95 percent of this region’s wetlands lost to development,
Long Beach and her neighbors that have remaining wetland acreages are in a unique
position to do something to preserve and restore wetlands. This concern is at the top of
the following list of issues pertaining to the preservation of our natural resources.
ISSUES
1.1      Preservation and rehabilitation of the Los Cerritos Wetlands
1.2      Creation of new wetland, woodland and riparian habitats
1.3      Enhancement of the El Dorado Nature Center and DeForest Park Nature Area
1.4      Beach deterioration and bluff erosion
1.5      Urban forestry and the use of native plants
1.6      Rainwater retention and reduced water importation
1.7      Contaminated sites (brownfields and water bodies)

2.       Open space for the managed production of resources
We examine open space for the managed production of resources to ensure that we
use our natural resources in a responsible way and that we do not use them up and
leave nothing to posterity. This is the premise behind becoming a “sustainable city,”
which is the foundation of the City’s 2010 Strategic Plan; natural resources are limited
and in order to sustain civilization we must use them wisely. When the State mandated
that communities include a section on open space for the managed production of
resources, there were numerous agricultural, timber and mineral/mining communities.
However, Long Beach has not been rural for a long time. There is little land devoted to
any of these natural resource areas, so once again this section, required by State law,
is not as extensive in more urbanized areas such as ours. Also, the existing
Conservation Element and a new natural resources element will address these
considerations more fully. Keeping that in mind, along with the focus on open space, is
important when reviewing the material that follows.

3.       OPEN SPACE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY
ISSUE
Significant geographic areas of the City are challenged by potential public health and
safety hazards, both man-made and natural. Potentially hazardous situations are
associated with conditions such as earthquake faults, unstable soils, areas subject to
flooding, areas of high fire or toxic exposure risk, and air traffic flight paths. The issue
examined herein is whether or not the local government is providing the appropriate
open spaces to protect the public health and safety of the community.
GOAL/OBJECTIVE
Provide for and maintain sufficient open space for adequate protection of lives and
property against natural and man-made safety hazards.
POLICY
Maintain open space buffers adequate to keep property and lives safe from natural and
man-made disasters within the City including: unstable soil areas, known active fault
zones, low-lying flood prone lands, airport flight paths, and areas of physical and noise
contamination.

4.       OPEN SPACE FOR OUTDOOR RECREATION & RECREATION FACILITIES
This chapter addresses the issues associated with providing adequate public
recreational opportunities in our community. As stated in the introduction of this
element of the General Plan, open space for public recreation is a preeminent Long
Beach concern. Both active and passive recreational opportunities are included in this
discussion, so there is some overlap with natural resource issues such as wetland and
riparian habitats. Definitions of specific terms used to create the park inventory and
analysis, and the following material, are provided in the glossary of terms (included at
the end of this chapter), which the reader may want to reference at this time for a better
understanding of the information presented below.
ISSUES
4.1      The ratio of recreation open space per capita in Long Beach has declined 18
         percent in the past 28 years
4.2      Outdoor recreation open space land is unevenly distributed in Long Beach;
         populations in the north, central and western areas of the City are underserved
4.3      Rising land costs and tightly constrained municipal budgets have made
         acquisition of additional open space for outdoor recreation difficult in heavily
         urbanized areas
4.4      Non-outdoor recreation uses, including police and fire facilities, are increasingly
         impinging on existing recreation open spaces
4.5      An inadequate number of recreation facilities has resulted in competition for
         outdoor recreation open space between adult and children’s sports leagues
4.6      Tight constraints on municipal funding have negatively impacted City recreation
         facilities and capital improvement budgets
4.7      Some recreation facilities are no longer popular and new recreation preferences
         require new facilities
4.8      Public school recreation facilities are often completely closed to the public
4.9      Recreation open spaces are not well linked; i.e., recreation trails are weak

OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
                                          GLOSSARY
Commercial Recreation. A recreational activity and/or facility for which a fee is
charged by a private, for-profit person, partnership or corporation where that entity has
the discretion to set the fee independent of the City’s Recreation Commission or City
Council, is defined as commercial recreation. Commercial recreation uses in Long
Beach parks are limited to uses consistent with the intent of the park district, the
General Plan, any applicable specific plans, and the following: the commercial
recreation use must provide a needed public recreation service otherwise unavailable to
the public; it may not permanently remove or impinge upon any significant public open
space or impede public access thereto; fees charged must not be so high as to exclude
participation by major segments of the community; and it must be found that the
commercial recreation use cannot reasonably be located to provide comparable public
recreation service on private land appropriately zoned for such a use. Examples of
commercial recreation uses are: video game arcades, miniature golf courses, water
slides and bicycle rentals at the beach.
Community Center. A building devoted to serving community needs, community
centers in Long Beach provide a multitude of recreational, cultural, health, safety,
transportation, educational, networking, personal and career development services.
Community Centers may be oriented to serving the needs of specific age groups, e.g.,
seniors, young children or teens; or they may offer programming oriented to meeting
specific neighborhood needs, e.g., gang member diversion or adult education courses.
These centers are also provided to encourage and increase the involvement of the
citizenry in the civic affairs of the City. Councilmanic and City-service offices, computer
labs, game and meeting rooms, are commonly found in community centers throughout
the City.
Community Park. Averaging 35 acres in size and serving neighborhoods within one
mile, community parks serve a broader purpose than neighborhood parks, focusing on
community recreation including sport fields, and preserving unique landscapes and
open spaces. Community parks permit all of the uses allowed in neighborhood parks
plus swimming pools. Building coverage in community parks is limited to ten percent of
the total park area.
Greenway Park. A largely undeveloped green space, often a remnant or odd shaped
piece of land left over from development, which can be used for casual recreation uses.
Greenways can serve to connect or link recreation opportunities throughout a
community. Building coverage in greenway parks is limited to one percent of the total
park area.
Interim Park. A temporary park subject to conversion to another use. Interim parks
must be approved by the City Council.
Mini Park. A small park serving neighbors within 1/8 mile, generally less than two
acres in size, it may include: landscaping, irrigation, walking paths, seating areas and
picnic tables, sand boxes/tot lots, playground equipment, play court, sculpture/art,

OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
drinking fountains and trash receptacles. Building coverage in mini parks is limited to
one percent of total park area.
Nature Center or Biological Reserve. A special use park devoted to the appreciation
and preservation of flora and fauna, including marine life. Human access is usually
restricted and designed for observational and educational purposes only.
Neighborhood Park. Averaging eight acres in size and serving neighbors within ¼
mile (high density areas) and ½ mile (low density areas), a neighborhood park permits
all of the uses allowed in mini parks plus: restroom buildings, recreation fields, courts
and rinks, water features, libraries, day care centers, community centers, and parking
and drive aisles. Building coverage in neighborhood parks is limited to seven percent of
total park area.
Non-Recreational Use. Any use that is not a “recreational use” as defined in this
glossary of terms. Non-recreational uses include those uses not permitted in each type
of park (as defined in this glossary of terms) and not intended to serve park user needs.
For example, police station and police training buildings, fire station and fire training
structures, non-recreation-associated commercial buildings, and the like, are considered
non-recreational uses.
Open Space. Open space is any area of land or water that is essentially unimproved
and largely devoted to an undeveloped or unconstructed type of use. Land that has
been graded or planted, has a walking/biking/skating path or nominal roadway system
or surface parking area for access, underground infrastructure, and/or insignificant or
portable structures or containers thereon, is considered open space. Beyond privately
held pools, yards, setback areas, rooftop gardens, balconies, porches and the like, open
space uses in Long Beach include the following: parks, plazas, promenades and
boardwalks, vacant lots, cemeteries, community gardens, golf courses, beaches, flood
control channels and basins, rivers and river levees, utility rights-of-way (e.g.
transmission tower areas), oil drilling sites, median strips and back up lots, offshore
islands, marinas, inland bodies of water, the ocean, estuaries and lagoons.
Park. A tract of land, most often publicly held, accessible to the general public, (usually
for free but sometimes with a parking/access fee), for purposes of preserving natural
areas and/or promoting the mental and physical health of the community through
recreational, cultural and relaxation pursuits. Parks are characterized by green (or
beach and water) open spaces devoted to leisure activities including the enjoyment of
nature, wildlife, cultural heritage, sports, and similar activities. Permitted park uses are
defined in this glossary of terms and in the zoning regulations for each type of park in
the City of Long Beach.
Recreational Center. A building devoted to serving community recreation needs,
recreation centers in Long Beach offer a variety of programs including but not limited to:
arts and crafts, games, gymnastics, dance workshops, and leasing of space for
meetings and parties. Recreation centers differ from community centers in that these
buildings are generally smaller in size, provide only Parks, Recreation and Marine

Department sponsored programs, and do not encompass the variety and scope of
activities and City programs and services available in community centers.
Recreational Use. A use pursued for human enjoyment and health, which refreshes
the body and/or spirit as a diversion from the stresses of life. Recreational uses include
both physical and mental activities; they can be both passive and active. Recreational
uses may include such things as reading and learning, playing or watching sports or
games, listening to music, pursuing hobbies, watching or being in a performance,
having new experiences, and enjoying the company of other living things.
Regional Park. 175 acres minimum in size and serving communities within ½ hour
drive time, a regional park permits all of the uses allowed in community parks plus other
desired features. Building coverage in regional parks is limited to two percent of the
total park area.
Special Use Park. A special use park provides unique cultural heritage and/or
educational features which attract a broad audience from near and far. Examples of
special use parks in Long Beach are the Long Beach Museum of Art, the nature
centers, aquarium and marine biological reserves. Significant development features of
special use parks are to be determined on a case-by-case basis with community input
and approved by the City Council.

This document is one of many which together comprise the new comprehensive
General Plan for the City of Long Beach, California. It not only complies with
California legislation regulating the preparation of official planning documents,
but also is expanded beyond the legislation to meet the special needs of Long
Beach.
 The General Plan is subdivided into a number of different subjects, entitled
 “elements.” Some elements are mandated by State law, while others are
 optional. The Long Beach General Plan will contain the following elements:
              Open Space*                               Circulation*
              Conservation*                             Population
              Seismic Safety*                           Environmental Management
              Noise*                                    Coastline
              Scenic Highways*                          Urban Design
              Public Safety*                            Others, as determined during the
              Housing*                                   course of the program
              Land Use*
               Elements identified by a star (*) are mandated by State law.
All of the elements are intimately interrelated and, therefore, none should be
viewed entirely alone without reference to other elements.
The elements will be prepared and issued sequentially, on a schedule
determined by mandated deadlines, manpower availability, informational needs,
and other variables.

General Plan program should be directed to the:

INTRODUCTIO

                                 I. INTRODUCTION
       The State of California requires a Safety Element as part of all city and
county general plans. Government Code Section 65302.1 mandates the creation
and adoption of this element. Furthermore, the California Council on
Intergovernmental Relations has promulgated advisory guidelines to be used in
developing this and other mandatory plan elements. According to these
guidelines, the Safety Element is to be tied in with social, economic, and
environmental factors in the general development plan.
Scope and Purpose of Study
       Aside from the matter of complying with State law, there are numerous
objectives to be attained in completing the Safety Element:
    1.    Identify all public safety items, which relate to the General Plan.
    2.    Incorporate public safety considerations into the overall planning
          process, to add another dimension of insight and greater
          comprehensiveness to the Long Beach General Plan.
    3.    Suggest methods for achieving maximum feasible safety for citizens.
    4.    Recommend measures to reduce the probability of loss of life, injuries,
          damage to property, and economic and social dislocation resulting
          from fire, dangerous geologic occurrences and most other natural and
          man-created hazards.
    5.    Provide Citizens with an increased sense of security and well-being.
    6.    Set forth means of correcting and/or mitigating hazards.
    7.    Inform citizens of potential safety problems and provide information
          regarding emergency situations.
    8.    Assist public safety officials in dealing with matters of safety and
          emergency occurrences.
                                         Page 1
    9.      Assure that physical manifestations of safety considerations are
            reflected in the General Plan.
        In completing the element, only considerations of “general public safety”
have been addressed. Private accidents or lesser hazards, which might only
involve single individuals, were not considered. Items such as automobile
accidents, swimming deaths, household safety and industrial plant safety are not
dealt with in this particular element. Attention is given primarily to those hazards,
which could affect large segments of the general population.
        The element is principally a planning document and is in no way an
“operations” plan or a “recovery” plan, although these matters are considered to
the extent that they may have a bearing upon the planning process. One must
understand, for example, the operations of those City departments which provide
direct disaster-assistance services to the public in order to provide meaningful
plans for lessening the risks and/or allowing the direct-service departments to
function more effectively. By and large, the Element is an exercise in
preventative planning. In other words, what planned improvements can be
effectuated so as to provide a safer environment for the citizens and visitors of
Long Beach? While information relating to manpower, rescue facilities, and so
forth is included as inventory items, improvements in such specialized
operations-oriented matters is largely an internal matter to be handled by the
departments and/or agencies directly responsible for providing the services.
However, it is hoped that the planning exercise will serve to assist the
departments in reviewing and up-dating their operations plans.
        Information presented in this report is not only of value for its own sake,
but will also be most beneficial as background knowledge for completing other
general plan elements, which will be undertaken later in the planning stages.
Interagency Cooperation
        As an initial effort to accumulate information and tap expert opinion in the
various specialized areas of public safety, all City Departments and numerous
                                         Page 2

private interests were sent questionnaires regarding hazards and the methods of
dealing with them. Subsequently, general meetings were held with all of the
involved individuals to gain further inputs and establish the scope and depth of
the element. Due to the vast array of public safety considerations, and the
interrelationships of potential hazardous events, general subject areas were
established. Each of these subject areas is discussed in a separate chapter of
the report, and is summarized below.
                                   Report Outline
Safety and Public Opinion
        In recent years there has been an increasing emphasis upon citizen
participation within the planning process. If plans and developmental policy are
to become realities, they must reflect public attitudes and opinions. As a means
of reaching the general citizenry, the City contracted with a professional public
opinion research group to survey a representative sample of the total Long
Beach population. This section discusses the respondent’s view of the
importance of public safety within the community.
Safety Goals
        After the preliminary gathering of all salient information, goals were
formulated and presented in this chapter.
Fire Protection
        This section presents established fire demand zones, which are
determined on the basis of hazards, station locations, manpower and equipment.
Specific fire hazardous land uses are delineated and fire protection measures are
recommended.
Geologic Hazards
        A thorough geologic profile is presented for Long Beach. Factual
information regarding soil types, groundwater levels, and topography is provided.
Furthermore, an evaluation is made of the following geologic hazards:
                                        Page 3

earthquakes, liquefaction, tsunamis, landslides, erosion, flooding, and
subsidence.
Crime Prevention
         An analysis of crime in Long Beach is presented, along with a general
discussion of law enforcement theory. The major emphasis in this chapter,
however, is the matter of crime prevention through physical planning.
Utilities
         Major utility operations are both a community resource and a potential
hazard. While risks are minimal, possible utility-related hazards are identified.
Industrial/Transportation
         Like utilities, industrial and transportation related activities are essential to
the livelihood and economic well being of the community. Nonetheless, certain
industrial land uses, and the transport of hazardous materials do pose certain
safety risks.
Disaster Operations
         Through the City’s Department of Emergency Preparedness, elaborate
provisions for disaster operations have been established. Manpower,
communications, evacuation, community resources, and safety for citizens are
discussed and reviewed.
Risk Management
         Due to recent changes in Federal and State laws requiring cities to better
insure themselves against all types of hazards, a relatively new field has
emerged which encompasses all aspects of public safety. This new area of
expertise is most often referred to as risk management. This section discusses
the concept of risk management and the process of establishing levels of
acceptable risk.
                                            Page 4

Recommendations
       Major findings are in this section and program and/or ordinance related
recommendations are proposed. Policy guidelines are also established in terms
of the safety considerations of land use planning.

SAFETY AND PUBLIC
OPINION

                         II. SAFETY AND PUBLIC OPINION
        In recent years there has been an increasing emphasis upon citizen
participation within the planning process. If plans and developmental policy are
to become realities, they must reflect public attitudes and opinions. While it is
impossible to obtain direct input from every resident, there is ample room for
participation by all population segments and interest groups.
        Citizen participation is actually a nebulous concept with its importance
determined by the way in which it is defined. It does not always appear in the
same form and thus cannot be assigned a single definition. In the strictest
sense, citizen participation might mean the active involvement of the public as an
integral part of the decision-making process of government. A broader
interpretation of the term refers to the individual’s privilege to express personal
desires and criticisms to a receptive government.
        An attempt is being made to involve Long Beach residents to the greatest
extent possible in the various elements of the General Plan. Meetings and work
sessions are held on a continual basis with numerous community officials and
bodies. As a means of reaching the “average” citizen, the City contracted with a
professional public opinion research group to survey a representative sample of
the total Long Beach population.
        602 “in-home” interviews were conducted with a representative cross-
section of adults residing in the City. The interviews lasted roughly one hour and
consisted of questions soliciting opinions regarding the future of Long Beach.
The questions and issues broached in the interviews were thoroughly reviewed
and critiqued prior to administering the survey to assure complete impartiality and
that substantive answers would be obtained.
        Numerous categories of opinions were revealed and in many instances
public priorities were established as a result of respondents choices. Of special
interest in this Element is the high priority respondents placed upon safety in the
community. “When respondents are asked to enunciate appropriate goals which
would contribute to making a city a good place to live, the most highly thought of
                                          Page 9

categories involve the provision of: good fire and police protection; good
hospitals and medical services; good schools; personal safety in the streets; and
a low crime rate.”1 In conducting the survey, the research group presented a list
of sixteen different items or characteristics and asked the respondents to rank
them in order of importance. This question was not intended to reflect current
conditions, but rather to evaluate goals for the City. “An examination of the
response disclosed one paramount fact: that the sample believes that a good
record in crime and personal safety-related areas is the most important goal to
which a city should aspire; three of the five most highly rated goals relate to this
area (i.e. good fire/police protection, low crime rate, personal safety in the
street).” 2

GOALS FOR PUBLIC
SAFETY

                         III. GOALS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY
        Public policy should ideally reflect the values held by the community at
large. The term “value” is abstract and difficult to define exactly. Generally,
values are the basics that govern human behavior. Because of the level of
abstraction involved, it is difficult to measure or discuss public safety in terms of
its consistency or conflict with community values. To discuss community values
in terms of public safety, these generalizations must be converted into a tangible
and understandable level. Values must be stated in terms of specific community
goals: in other words, the importance of public safety, as expressed in the public
opinion survey, must be reflected in a set of formulated goals.
        Goals give form to the community values, which reside in an urban area in
statements of aspiration. Thus, a goal may be defined as desired state or
condition toward which effort is directed. It is an end to be sought although it
may not be attainable. Goals should generally be stated in the “positive” and
should not be solution oriented. Goals should state the desired end results and
not be concerned with the specific actions necessary to achieve them. This
practice will avoid biases toward particular actions.
        Many City Departments have established goals for the operation of their
particular functions. Likewise, other elements of the general plan set forth goals
toward which the City should strive. In many instances, the public safety goals
are interrelated with other community aspirations. The interrelationship may be
complementary or conflicting. The attainment of a particular public safety goal
may produce a beneficial by-product, resulting in the achievement of other
related community goals. Contrarily, movement toward the attainment of a public
safety goal may be in conflict with other desired aspirations. When such is the
case, compromises and tradeoffs are essential. This does not imply that some of
the goals are invalid. Nor should it lessen the effort to attain all of the established
community goals. It simply means that each goal cannot be fully achieved and
that in some instances less than “ideal” circumstances will prevail. Just as
community values were put to work in establishing the various goals, so must
                                          Page 13

these abstract values come into play in determining the degree and direction of
compromise. It is essential that public safety considerations and goals be viewed
as single purpose objectives and that absolute public safety (absolute
achievement of the stated goals) is often unfeasible due to other constraints or
community desires.
        To be effective and operational, goals must be dynamic and flexible. The
importance and timely significance of various goals must be continually reviewed
if they are to remain of value to the community. Goals must often be altered,
updated, deleted, or added in response to changing circumstances within the
City. Thus, the following list of public safety related goals is not necessarily
exhaustive or immutable.
Management Goals
     1.    Develop mechanisms for implementing improved safety
           considerations.
     2.    Coordinate and cooperate with other political jurisdictions in
           implementing safety and disaster programs.
     3.    Continue to coordinate safety matters throughout the City and
           introduce methods of insuring improved safety.
     4.    Promote cooperation of the private sector in upgrading safety
           precautions.
     5.    Establish safety guidelines to evaluate all potential safety hazards and
           mitigate existing problems.
Development Goals
     1.    Promote the redevelopment of areas, which may present safety
           problems.
     2.    Utilize safety considerations, as a means of encouraging and
           enhancing desired land use patterns.
                                         Page 14
   3.     Provide an urban environment, which is as safe from all types of
          hazards as possible.
   4.     Continue to identify existing or proposed uses or activities that may
          pose safety hazards.
   5.     Use physical planning as a means of achieving greater degrees of
          protection from safety hazards.
   6.     Encourage transportation systems, utilities, industries, and similar uses
          to locate and operate in a manner consistent with public safety goals.
   7.     Assure continued safe accessibility to all urban land uses throughout
          the City.
   8.     Encourage development that would be most in harmony with nature
          and thus less vulnerable to natural disasters.
   9.     Encourage development that would augment efforts of other safety-
          related Departments of the City (i.e. design for adequate access for
          firefighting equipment and police surveillance).
   10.    Strive to encourage urbanizations patterns, which preserve and/or
          create greater safety for residents and visitors.
   11.    Critically evaluate proposed public or private actions, which may pose
          safety hazards to residents or visitors.
Protection Goals
   1.     Use safety precautions as one means of preventing blight and
          deterioration.
   2.     Protect existing land uses from the intrusion of safety hazards.
   3.     Reduce public exposure to safety hazards.
   4.     Effectively utilize natural or man-made landscape features to increase
          public protection from potential hazards.
                                         Page 15
    5.       Reduce the potential adverse economic, environmental, and social
             conditions, which could result from a major disaster.
    6.       Assure continued economic stability and growth minimizing potential
             safety hazards.
    7.       Protect the citizens against possible personal loss resulting from
             disaster events.
    8.       Assure continued safety measures for the preservation of property
             values.
    9.       Continue to inform the public of potential safety hazards and what to
             do in times of emergencies.
    10.      Provide the maximum feasible level of public safety protection
             services.
Remedial Action Goals
    1.       Isolate areas of hazardous concern from other portions of the City.
    2.       Eliminate uses which present safety hazards.
        It is important to note that the above listed goals serve to direct actions
and represent desired end-results. There are various specific methods and
strategies, which may be employed in implementing or achieving the established
public safety goals. The Recommendations section of this report will set forth
some of these specific actions.

FIRE PROTECTIO

                               IV. FIRE PROTECTION
        Fires are generally categorized into two major types: urban fires and
brush fires. As the City of Long Beach is virtually all developed, the latter
category is of little concern in matters of public safety. In many respects this is
advantageous in that precautions and controls are easier to implement in
urbanized areas than in undeveloped areas where access may be poor, water
pressure low or non-existent, and fire containment difficult. On the other hand,
urban areas present a greater demand for better fire protection, as the potential
loss of life and property is much greater, and where higher capital costs are
involved.
Organization
        Originally established in 1987 with two hose carts and a ladder wagon
manned by volunteers, today the Long Beach Fire Department consists of 466
employees, 431 whom are uniformed fire fighters. The department consists of
four major divisions; Fire Prevention, Fire Suppression, Bureau of Instruction and
the Bureau of Technical Services.
Fire Suppression
        The Fire Suppression Division, better known perhaps as Fire and Rescue,
is by far the largest division within the Fire Department. It is further divided into
four Battalion districts, each of which is commanded by a Battalion Chief. There
are presently 21 separate fire stations throughout the City, equipped with various
types of trucks and fire-fighting apparatuses. (See Table 1 for inventory and
Plate 1 for location.)

           In 1973 the per capita fire loss was $5.90, which is slightly higher than the
average per capita loss for the preceding 5-year period. There were 10 fire
causalities and 80 injuries attributable to fire during the 1973-74 fiscal year.1 The
number of responses by units of the Fire Department to fires and other
emergencies has continued to increase over the years. The most dramatic
increase in Fire Department responses have been for emergencies other than
those caused by fires. This increase can be attributed to the fact that four
Paramedic units, providing first aid rescue service to the community, were put
into full service during the fiscal year.
Bureau of Technical Services
           The Bureau of Technical Services is responsible for the maintenance and
installation of telephones, radios, fire alarm boxes, alarm communications within
the stations, and citywide cable system for the Fire Department.
Bureau of Fire Prevention
           Scheduled inspections of public assemblages, institutions, hospitals,
industrial plants, commercial plants, ships, hotels and many other facilities are
carried out by the Bureau of Fire Prevention. Inspections and the enforcing of
the codes and regulations of the State of California, County of Los Angeles and
City of Long Beach are increasing markedly; with the advent of more high rise
buildings and other major developments. The Bureau also investigates arson.
For fire inspection purposes, all types of buildings and structures are classified by
uses as follows:
           A – Public Assembly Facilities
           B – Lesser Public Assembly Facilities
           C – Schools
           D – Institutions
           E – Hazardous Operations

       During the 1973-74 fiscal year, 1,800 violations of the fire code were cited.
The most frequently cited problems were the lack of proper extinguishers and the
presence of combustible waste and dry vegetation.
Bureau of Instruction
       The third bureau within the Fire Department is the Bureau of Instruction.
This Bureau is responsible for the education of all members of the Fire
Department in the latest developments in the technology of the fire fighting
profession.
                                      Types of Fires
Fires by Occupancy
       Obviously, fires vary in terms of their potential threat to life and property.
Generally speaking, the risk is higher as the occupancy increases and as the
building size and value of contents become greater. While the potential risk is
greater, the actual risk, as based upon the frequency of occurrence, is often less.

Fires by Cause
                In any mechanized urban area there exists a great many potential
causes of fire. Many of the causes are a result of human carelessness or
mechanical failure that is difficult to predict and even harder to eliminate. In
some instances, however, potential fire hazards can be removed if they are
recognized as problems. Table 3 classifies the causes of fires for the 1973-74
fiscal year.

       It can be seen from this table that most fires are caused by arson and
carelessness involving matches and cigarettes (aside from the Undetermined
Cause category), and that other domestic-related causes also rank high.
Catastrophic causes (explosion, crash, etc.) actually appear to be much more
controllable in terms of prevention before they happen. This is important in
constructing a land use strategy related to public safety because it adds
perspective to the entire problem of fire causes.
Fires by Zones
       For dispatch purposes, the Fire Department has compartmented the City
into zones. Information has been compiled for each of these zones, giving the
number of fire incidents, and a number of non-fire incidents for the current year.
                                        Page 26

(See Table 4.) Plate 2 graphically delineates the number of fires by zones. Zone
17N, located just northeast of the downtown area recorded the largest number of
fires (283). Nine other zones throughout the city showed a high incidence of fire,
having over 100 in that past year. Generally, the older sector of the City,
bounded by Willow Street on the north, Signal Hill on the northeast, Redondo
Avenue on the east, the ocean on the south, and the Los Angeles River on the
west had the greatest number of fire. The incidents of fire vary from zone to
zone throughout north Long Beach. The fewest number of fires reported was in
east Long Beach, where the structures are newer and where density is quite low.
        Fire zones do not coincide with census boundaries or any other districts
where precise demographic information is recorded and thus it would be difficult
to determine the number of fires per capita or correlate fire incidents with
population data. The raw data relating to the number of fires, as presented on
Plate 2 does, however, give a general picture of fire occurrence throughout the
City.

Hazard Areas:
        As a part of the “ station relocator program” (to be discussed later) the
Long Beach Fire Department has identified fire hazard areas throughout the City.
Classifications were established as “Most Critical, “Critical,” and “Least Critical.”
Criteria for each of the categories are as follow:
        Most Critical
        High-rise
        Shopping Centers
        Hospitals, Convalescent homes
                                              Page 30

       Dense life hazard concentrations, concentrations of combustibles
       (tenements, etc.)
       Public assembly (including older 2 story schools)
       Hazardous industry
       Storage warehouses/areas (tank farms, lumber yards, etc.)
       Inaccessible properties
       Critical
       Multiple dwellings
       Accumulation of small businesses
       Mixed occupancies (residences, manufacturing, etc.)
       2 to 3 story wood frame buildings
       Small manufacturing
       Manufacturing for non-hazardous products
       Sales rooms, car lots
       Railroad and wharf property
       Schools
       Least Critical
       Residential
       Plate 3 shows what areas of the City fall within each of the three
       categories.
                           Factors Affecting Fire Potential
       One obvious factor that relates to fire hazard is the age and condition of
structures. As indicated on the fire zone map (Plate 2) and the fire hazard map
(Plate 3), the area of greatest concern in the City includes downtown and its
periphery. This area has the greatest percentage of old and deteriorated
structures, reflecting environ-mental and social problems often common to older
neighborhoods. (See Plates 4, 5, and 6.) An earlier study reported: “The
deterioration of this area has been hastened by the continual increase of low-
                                       Page 31

income elderly and young transient population which has spurred the demand for
the conversion of older homes into boarding houses or apartment unites”2
         Land use is another factor, which greatly affects fire potential. Industrial
and commercial areas having high concentrations of people pose fire threats of
some magnitude. It is imperative that adequate preventive measure be taken
and that fire alarm response be at its best in such higher life-hazard areas.
                         Insurance Services Rating for Long Beach
         The Insurance Services Office conducts a municipal survey and ranks
cities as to their degree of fire safety. Both the City as a whole and its Fire
Department are evaluated and rated. The Long Beach Fire Department is one of
only a few in the United States to receive a class one rating. Furthermore, the
City itself is very close to a class one rating. Long Beach is categorized as class
IIA, which is the highest rating attained by any city in the Country. Cities are
evaluated in terms of deficiency points and are then assigned a class ranking
between 1 and 10 (Table 5 shows the spectrum of classes and corresponding
deficiency point system.) The smaller the number the better the rating. Long
Beach received a total of 600 deficiency points, making it only 100 points from a
class one rating. In the entire history of fire ratings, no city has ever achieved a
class one status. By making necessary improvements and expenditures, Long
Beach is hopeful of reaching this classification in the next evaluation.
         In determining a city’s fire protection rating, the Insurance Services Office
produces a report evaluating various factors. Many of its findings are significant
in terms of public safety. The following informational factors are noteworthy and
are discussed in detail below. Recommended actions are those of the Insurance
Services Office.

 California, June 1973).
Water Supply
          The majority of the City is served by the municipal water system. A
residential area in the northwestern sector of the City is served by the
Dominguez Water Corporation and another small residential area in the
northeastern part of Long Beach is served by the Southern California Water
Company. The Harbor District is served by the Port of Long Beach. The
municipal system is backed up by reservoirs at two different locations.
Combined, these reservoirs have a capacity of 116.96 million gallons.
Throughout the City there are 6,142 hydrants. Hydrant spacing is mainly good*
                                                 Page 37

in commercial districts and fairly good* in residential districts. The hydrants are
mainly adequate* in size and are in generally good condition.3
            Fire flow tests show that water pressure and supply is good, with the
exception of one spot location where the quantity is slightly deficient. Overall, the
water supply is quite good and received only 98 points of deficiency out of a
possible 1950 from the Insurance Services Office. The water Department was
one of the few Departments in the United States to be rated as Class I.
Equipment and Training
            The survey indicates that the Fire Department has an adequate number of
engine and fireboat companies but recommends two additional ladder
companies. All other equipment is rated as adequate in terms of amount and
type. The training program and general department administration are both
considered good.4 The Fire Department as a whole received only 178 deficiency
points out of a total possible of 1950.
Communications
            The fire alarm system is rated as reliable and well maintained. There are
a total of 299 boxes in service throughout the City. These boxes are generally
well distributed. It is recommended, however, that additional boxes be installed
so that one will be visible from and be within 500 feet of every building in high-
value districts. It is suggested that reliability of the communications system could
also be improved by installing more sophisticated electronic devices. In terms of
the dispatching procedures, it is recommended that at least one of the two alarm
 3
   It is recommended by the Insurance Services Office, however, that hydrants be inspected semi-annually
 and that records of inspection, conditions, and repairs be maintained. Furthermore, additional hydrants
 should be installed so that each street intersection has a least one hydrant, with intermediate hydrants
 located no more than 300 feet apart in commercial districts or 500 feet apart in residential districts.
            *The terms “good,” “fairly good”, “mainly good,” and “quite good” are descriptive phrases employed
 by the Insurance Services Office in completing their evaluations. In view of the City’s classification, words
 such as “excellent” and “superior” might better reflect the prevailing conditions. While appropriate, the use
 of such superlatives was purposely avoided in an effort to directly reflect the actual language used in
 evaluating the City.

   The training facilities, however, could be expanded to include a fire building. Training activities could also
 be improved by conducting additional drills both during daylight hours and at night. In terms of manpower,
 it is recommended by the Insurance Services Office that each engine and ladder company have at least six
 members on duty at all times. This is considered standard manning.
                                                      Page 38

operators be on duty at all times. Overall, the fire safety communications are
considered good, receiving only 46 deficiency points out of a possible 450.
Fire Prevention
          Fire prevention laws and regulations at the State and local levels are
considered adequate. Hazardous fire conditions are well controlled via the
permit issuance program and the business licenses approval required by the Fire
Prevention Bureau. Special permits are required for most hazardous materials
and processes, and all business license applications must be filed annually and
approved by the Fire Prevention Bureau.
          In terms of codes, the City is fairly well protected. The City has adopted
the 1971 edition of the Uniform Fire Code with additions5 The Uniform Plumbing
Code was adopted by the City and contains good requirements for gas piping
and gas appliances. Electrical regulations over new electrical installations are
good. The City has adopted the 1971 edition of the National Electrical Code.
One shortcoming in this area is that no regular program is set up for the
inspection of old electrical work, and during recent inspections some poor
conditions were noted. A 1970 edition of the Uniform Building Code has been
adopted by the City with a number of amendments and additions. By the
Insurance Services Office standards, the Building Code provisions are
comprehensive, but are somewhat inadequate in areas pertaining to allowable
areas, thickness of walls, and fire-resistance construction.
          Aside from the municipal codes, the State Vehicle Code regulates the
transportation of explosives and the State Fire Marshal regulates the
transportation of flammable liquids. Specific routes of travel for transporting
explosives are designated by the State Highway Patrol.
          To further improve fire safety controls, the Insurance Service Office
recommends more detailed pre-fire plan examinations. Furthermore, it is

   The City is now reviewing and preparing for the adoption of the 1973 Uniform Fire and Building Codes
 with Amendments; the 1973 Uniform Mechanical Code; and the 1973 Uniform Housing Code with
 Amendments. These later editions reflect current thinking in these fields and provide for additional fire
 protective measures, which will be discussed later in this document.
                                                   Page 39
essential that complete inspections of old wiring be made and that defects be
corrected. The survey suggests that a regular program for such electrical
inspections should also be instituted.
         A further measure of effectuating better fire prevention would be to amend
the building code to include structural features necessary to provide life safety
and to restrict the spread of fires. It is recommended by the Insurance Service
Office that the National Building Code of the American Insurance Association be
used as a guide in framing these amendments. Overall improvements in the fire
safety control activities is perhaps the best opportunity the City has for improving
its fire rating in that the City received 152 deficiency points out of a possible 650.
Proportionately, more deficiency points were received in this area than in any of
the other factors considered in the evaluation.
                               Land Use and Loss Potential
         One objective in fire fighting is to contain a fire to its point of origin.
Accomplishing this objective is, of course, dependent to a great extent upon the
existing land use and structural type. As might be expected, the spreading of
fires is probable where building are congested, and should be held to the area of
origin where more space separates structures.
Commercial Districts
         Large conflagrations are most likely to occur in the downtown business
area because of building spacing and structural type and condition. Street widths
and general accessibility is good, however, and its is unlikely that a fire would
spread beyond the block of origin or cause a general conflagration to develop
except possibly during a major earthquake. Commercial developments on the
periphery of downtown consist of fairly well separated buildings and thus fires
could most probably be contained to the structure of origin.
         Smaller shopping centers and strip commercial developments are located
throughout the City. Due to the spacing of most structures, fires could most likely
be confined to the building of origin. Large fires could be expected, however, at
                                           Page 40
those locations having single, large area buildings where automatic sprinklers are
not provided.
Industrial Districts
        The harbor district with numerous underground petroleum pipelines, oil
terminals, and several tank farms presents a potential fire and explosion hazard
to the City. A major earthquake could be catastrophic in this district if water
service were disrupted and earthen dikes around tanks breached.
        The McDonnell Douglas aircraft plant consists of some extremely large
structures, but fires should be confined to the individual buildings of origin due to
generally good spacing and sprinkler protection.
        The area commonly referred to as the Westside Industrial Area consists
primarily of small manufacturing concerns. The potential of block fires does exist
in those areas where wood frame construction and poor building separation
exists. In most instances, however, fires should be confined to the building of
small group of origin.
Institutional Districts
        California State University at Long Beach covers roughly 296 areas and
consists of several buildings of varying heights. Fires should be confined to the
building of origin in most instances except where wood frame covered walkways
are constructed between structures.
        Veterans and Memorial Hospitals are the largest in the City and both are
constructed with fire-resistive materials. Generally the fire protection features are
good at the hospitals.
        When the Queen Mary was permanently docked off Pier J many fire safety
features were installed as part of the ship’s remodeling so as to minimize the
hazard from fire. This included the installation of a fire detection system and
sprinklers.
                                        Page 41

Residential Districts
       In most instances, residential fires could be confined to the building of
origin. This is particularly true in areas where single-family dwellings
predominate. In more densely developed residential areas, such as the area
east of the downtown business district, block fires are more possible. In
congested areas, fires could be expected to spread to neighboring buildings.
                          Existing and Proposed Fire Stations
       Fire Department officials find it necessary to continually re-evaluate plans
to meet fire protection needs resulting from changing conditions within the
community. Factors such as annexations, changing of building designs and
construction, building deterioration, zoning changes and possible contracting for
fire and rescue services with neighboring jurisdictions all add to the complexity
of planning adequate fire protection. To coordinate these factors, the Fire
Department has completely re-evaluated all sites for fire stations in an effort to
achieve maximum efficiency in their operations. The Department has worked
with Public Technology, Inc. in developing a more sophisticated system of
locating stations, as based upon fire demand zones. As part of this systematic
evaluation, travel distances were measured by computer processing techniques.
       This innovative approach to determining fire station locations involves a
process of identifying fire demand zones. The focal point of these zones consists
of large concentrations of people or major industrial or commercial
establishments. Desirable travel times are then determined for each of the focal
points. A list of all existing stations is then fed into the computer, which will
provide the estimated travel times from the nearest station to each of the fire
demand zone’s focal points. The desire response time can then be compared to
the existing travel times from the existing fire stations as they are now located.
Next, a list of all potential future fire station sites are fed into the computer and
again response times are established for each of the focal points in the City. The
outcome of this program is a set of ideal station locations. These ideal sites can
then be compared to the existing situation in determining where to relocate
                                            Page 42

stations or build new ones. “In summary, this program represents an effort to
reduce the cost of comprehensive fire protection to an absolute minimum and to
make the most effective use of fire suppression manpower and equipment.”6
          While this program is promising in terms of improving fire protection in
Long Beach, it should be kept in mind that the process of extinguishing a fire
involves a number of separate but related factors. Once a fire starts, it takes
time before it is detected, time to call the Fire Department, time to dispatch the
fire fighting company, time to travel to the location of the fire, and time to set up
the equipment and prepare to fight the fire. The above mentioned station locator
program would only affect the travel time between the stations and the fire
demand zones throughout the City. It would not affect the other variables
involved. Nonetheless, the importance of station locations cannot be overstated.
          As a result of this extensive Fire Station locator program, the Long Beach
City Council is now considering the appropriation of over five million dollars to be
spent over the next five-year period for the relocation of several fire stations. The
program is an alternative, which calls for greater immediate capital expenditures,
with a long-term savings in manpower and equipment costs. The bulk of the
program is to be implemented over a two-year period, reflecting priorities. While
the specific sites have not been selected, tentative locations and relocations for
fire stations are as follows:
          Phase I:           Relocation of fire stations 2 and 10 in the general vicinity of
                             8th Street and California and in the southeastern section of
                             Long Beach; and relocation of fire stations 3 and 15 and
                             Fireboat 21.
          Phase II:          Relocation of fire stations 9, 12, 13, and construction of a
                             new station #14; together with two internal truck company
                             moves to provide a more proper distribution of fire fighting
                             equipment.
          Currently there are 18 regular fire stations and three fireboat facilities.
Implementation of both phases of the new fire station locator program would
result in the closing of 8 existing stations and the construction of 8 new facilities.

(See Plate 7.) As the total number of stations will remain constant, additional
expenditures for manpower and new equipment will be minimized. If
implemented, the plan is expected to provide the City with comprehensive fire
protection for the next ten to fifteen years.

Station Location Factors
        In selecting specific sites for new stations, numerous factors must be
weighed and considered. Over the years, the American Insurance Association
(AIA) has established standards for the location of fire stations. These standards
(which are discussed in the following paragraphs) are generalized and should be
considered only as guidelines for fire station locations. It must be noted that
each potential site has varying characteristics and no two locations can be
similarly compared. As future sites are projected for construction, the total area
requiring protection must be considered. The anticipated type of development in
the area will help in determining the extensiveness of the fire defenses.
Land Use Factors
        One of the most important factors in locating fire stations is the type of
area to be protected. This means whether an area is used primarily as business,
industrial warehouse, institutional, residential, or a combination of uses. Stations
should be near extensive industrial or business districts and near areas where
there is a high life hazard. This is important even though such a decision
appears to be out of line with a plan of uniform fire defense distribution.
        Concerning high value districts (areas of intensive commercial and office
development), enough stations should be provided so that no point will be more
than one mile travel distance from an engine company or 1.25 miles travel
distance from a ladder company. This distribution should also allow for ready
concentration of companies to multiple alarm fires in any high value area. Such
a procedure should be developed so that other sections of the City are not
stripped of protection in the event of a second fire.
        In average residential areas (generally single family development) of the
community, service radius may be increased up to two miles for engine
companies and three miles for ladder companies. In residential areas where
densities are higher or where building are three or more stories in height; the
                                          Page 46
distances should be reduced to one and one-half miles and two miles,
respectively.
        It is important to note that the Station Locator program measures
distances in terms of travel time rather than in terms of travel distance. The
above-indicated guidelines are included here for comparison purposes in that the
standards should reflect relative consistency. In other words, proposed fire
station locations should meet or approximate the established standards of
desired travel times as well as travel distances.
Topography and Geography
        Topographical characteristics also affect the station location and the total
number required. For example, a location on a hillside or at the bottom of the hill
is not satisfactory when many responses must be made upgrade. As Long
Beach is relatively flat, this is a less important factor here than it might be
elsewhere in Southern California.
Traffic and Circulation Factors
        In situations relating to heavily traveled streets, a station may be
positioned on a parallel street or a cross street with traffic lights at the nearby
intersection arranged for control from the station. This permits response across
or onto the heavily traveled street. One-way streets pose another problem,
which may be resolved by traffic lights controlled from the station. Generally, a
site at an intersection is good since it permits response in more than two
directions.
Site Requirements
        Stations should be set well back from the curb line, especially where the
street is narrow. The lot should be of ample size so as to provide adequate
parking facilities for employee autos, to assure enough area for conduction
company drills, and to allow for any necessary expansion of the physical plant.
                                           Page 47
Generally, the maximum building coverage should not exceed 25 percent of the
site area.
New Fire Stations
        There are no precise standards concerning the design of fire stations.
Each facility must be examined as it relates to the surrounding area, which is to
be served. Municipal officials should work with duly qualified personnel in
preparing plans and specifications for fire station construction. Fire fighting
personnel should be involved in developing the final plans as the operation and
maintenance of the stations will ultimately be theirs. Plans for new stations
should also be given to the local fire-rating bureau so that it might comment and
make suggestions as to the adequacy of the proposed facility. It is important to
note that modern fire stations should possess an architectural design, which will
blend with the surrounding neighborhood. The interior design and the building
architecture are also significant factors relating to the attitudes and morale of the
members of each fire company.
        Many of the above mentioned considerations have long been an integral
part of the planning of fire stations in Long Beach for the past several years.
With the prospects of a major fire station relocation program in the offing it is felt
that particular attention should be directed to these factors.
                                  Codes and Standards
        Building and maintenance codes have been with governments since the
time of King Hammurabi of Babylon, c. 2100 B.C. Modern codes not only relate
to fire safety, but pertain to other aspects of contemporary living as well.
Minimum housing codes, electrical codes, plumbing codes are a few of the most
common. From the standpoint of fire safety, building codes and fire prevention
codes are the most important. “A building code, of course, applies principally to
new construction and alterations, though it is sometimes made retroactive and
applied to existing buildings if past deficiencies are discovered to be critical.
Once a building is constructed, a fire prevention code may govern the
                                         Page 48

maintenance of the building and the introduction of materials into the building for
the safe of fire safety.”7
High-Rise Structures
          The lack of developable land and the desire to live in close proximity to
natural and man-made amenities has perpetuated an increasing trend toward
high-rise construction. This trend is often justified from the viewpoint of
economics and life style. The movement has, however, raised issues relating to
public safety. Such structures generally depend upon internal support systems,
such as air conditioning, water pressure, elevators, and communications. These
support systems could fail in times of emergency, leaving inhabitants stranded.
In many cities, outside assistance is often difficult or nearly impossible to provide
inasmuch as most fire department capabilities are inadequate to meet the need.
          There is increasing evidence substantiating the need for built-in fire
protection measure in high-rise buildings. Without such protective devices, there
is a level of risk beyond which a fire department cannot be expected to operate at
maximum levels. From the cost standpoint, it becomes a matter of who shall
bear the expense of adequate fire protection to meet normal needs. “Above that
anticipated level of fire risk, built-in protection should be provided by the private
sector.”8
          Much of Long Beach’s future development is expected to consist of
recycled land use; that is, land being redeveloped at a greater intensity of use
than it previously had.9 Some of this recycling could manifest itself in high-rise
development, particularly in the downtown area. In an effort to provide better fire
safety to citizens, the City’s Fire Safety Building Code Committee has proposed
various ordinance changes, which were considered necessary to provide a
reasonable degree of safety to occupants of buildings in the City. These

recommended changes have been incorporated into a proposed package of
1973 Uniform Codes, which will be considered by the City Council in the near
future. The special requirements are consistent with recommendations set forth
by the International Conference of Building Officials and the National
Commission of Fire Prevention and Control.10 As spelled out in the proposed
codes, these requirements would apply to structures having floors used for
human occupancy located more than 55 feet above the lowest level of fire
Department vehicle access.11 Generally, this would apply to buildings of 5 stories
or more. The special requirements include fire alarm systems, fire detectors,
voice communication systems, central fire control stations, smoke control
systems, elevator specifications, standby power sources, seismic consideration,
building exits, and fire sprinkler systems. In short, when a building is of such
heights or where vehicular access is limited to the extent that external
accessibility of fire fighting equipment is impossible, an internal protective
mechanism must be provided.
Open Stair Wells
           Another special problem associated with fire safety is the matter of open
stairwells, which allows smoke and fire to spread from floor to floor throughout a
structure. Most buildings in Long Beach having open stairwells were constructed
prior to 1933. The age of these structures makes the problem even more
pressing. Roughly 200 of these hazardous structures are multi-storied hotels
that have been converted to permanent residential facilities, housing poor and
elderly populations. The problem has come into focus in recent years due to a
number of major fires, which have occurred in these types of structures in the
City of Los Angeles.
           In view of the seriousness of the problem, special recommended
provisions for stairway enclosures were set forth in the proposed 1973 Uniform
 10
    National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control, op. cit. p. 83.
 11
    State Law in the form of SB 941 mandates certain minimum life safety regulations covering new
 construction of buildings 75 feet in height. It was felt, however, by local fire protection personnel that the 55
 foot limitation was necessary in Long Beach in the interest of life safety and excessive property damage.
                                                     Page 50
Building Code. The provisions require existing buildings to meet fire prevention
standards in regard to doors, openings and corridor walls, stairway enclosures,
exits, stair construction, exterior stairways, fire escapes, exit signs, enclosure of
vertical openings, and separation of occupancies.
        While proposed regulations could present numerous social and economic
ramifications involving the fair treatment of building owner, the potential need to
relocate occupants, the preservation of a vibrant business community downtown
and the need for an adequate tax base, the safety of citizens must be considered
paramount.
Dense Developments
        The intensity of land use can present a fire safety problem similar to that
of high-rise. The major difference is that an entire area of a city may be affected
by over intensive land usage while the high-rise problem is somewhat isolated to
a particular structure. Setback requirements, open space allowances, and
adequate off-street parking facilities are three pertinent factors, which directly
affect the intensity of land use. In Long Beach this is a problem in many of the
areas zoned R-4. Sections of the City such as Belmont Shore and Naples also
pose special problems due primarily to limited access. While zoning involves the
consideration of numerous other factors, fire safety should be a major factor
influencing any changes in the existing zoning regulations.
Pre-Fire Preparation
        By the very nature of an urban area, there are bound to be problems
associated with the detection and quick extinguishment of a fire. Some of these
problems are virtually unavoidable and/or cannot be eliminated. Acknowledging
this fact, the fire department conducts pre-fire planning exercises. Firemen from
the various districts survey their area of responsibility and identify any potential
problems, which could hinder fire-fighting efforts. Specific hazard locations or
structures are photographed and studied more closely.
                                          Page 51
         The general layout of the area is reviewed, fire hydrant locations are
identified, access is examined, and other special circumstances are considered.
This practical approach allows the fire fighting crews to analyze anticipated
difficulties and set forth alternative approaches for the circumvention of whatever
obstacles may be present. This type of site-specific analysis is most often used
for critical structures such as hospitals and nursing homes or in areas where the
life-hazard rate is high due to the occupancy characteristics.

GEOLOGIC HAZARD

                                      V.    GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
         The most pervasive geologic hazard in Long Beach is that of an
earthquake. Because of the magnitude and complexity of this single hazard, a
separate element of the General Plan is being prepared regarding seismic safety.
Consequently, seismic considerations are only briefly discussed in this chapter of
the Safety Element. Other geologic hazards are also presented here and
evaluated as to their potential threat.
                                             General Geology1
         The City of Long Beach is located on the coastal margin of the Los
Angeles Basin, which is underlain by over 15,000 feet of stratified sedimentary
rocks of marine origin. This marine section is composed of interbedded units of
sandstone, siltstone, and shale. The central portion of Long Beach has been
elevated by regional uplift and local folding and faulting. The gap areas now
occupied by the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers represent filled channels,
which were cut deeply into the marine sediments by ancestral rivers during the
lower sea level stand of the last ice age in Late Pleistocene time. Over the last
10,000 to 15,000 years, the rivers have filled these channels to their present level
with relatively unconsolidated sand, silt and gravel.
         The above-mentioned subsurface geologic conditions reflect the
physiographic features within the City of Long Beach, which can be separated
into six rather distinct areas:
    3.        The row of low hills extending from Bixby Knolls southeasterly to Seal
              Beach and including Signal and Reservoir Hills;
    1.        The broad, slightly elevated marine terrace lying south of this row of
              hills;
    2.        The Los Angeles River flood plain, known as the Dominguez Gap,
              lying along the western side of Long Beach;
 1
   Much of the following material is taken directly from the Seismic Safety Study, City of Long Beach, by
 Woodward-McNeill and Associates.
                                                      Page 55
     3.        The San Gabriel River flood plain and channel, known as the Alamitos
               Gap, in the northeasterly portion of the city;
     4.        The alluvial plain lying to the north of Bixby Knolls and Signal Hill; and
     5.        The coastal area including the sea bluffs, beach and barrier bars
               across the gap areas.
          This latter area along the seaward portions of the gap areas have been
highly modified by dredging and landfill operations associated with construction
of recreational and harbor facilities. The gap areas are of particular concern
because of the large landfill areas and the shallow groundwater condition.
Seismic Hazards
          The two greatest seismic hazards are ground shaking and liquefaction. Of
less likely occurrence are the threats of fault rupture, tsunamis and seiches.
Flooding and slope instability, which can be triggered by an earthquake event,
are discussed individually in this section.
          In projecting future geologic hazards, the State Division of Mines and
Geology forecasts earthquake shaking to be the single most significant threat.
“Given a continuation of present conditions, it is estimated that losses due to
earthquake shaking will total $21 billion in California between 1970 and the year
2000.”2 Ground shaking can affect very large areas (up to 50,000 square miles
or more) during a very large earthquake and is usually the greatest cause of
damage, especially in urban areas. Structures of all types are susceptible to
ground shaking, and most deaths resulting from earthquakes historically are a
result of structural failure due to ground shaking. Structures most vulnerable to
collapse and or damage are those, which do not comply with the provisions of
the Field and Riley Acts of 1933. Like many cities, Long Beach has a special
problem with respect to old, un-reinforced buildings. Man of the older sections of
the City, particularly the downtown area and along the major corridors such as

Broadway, 4th, 7th, 10th, Anaheim, Atlantic, and Long Beach Boulevard have an
abundance of such structures. A rational remedial measure for reducing the
potential risk would be the rapid implementation of Subdivision 80 of the Long
Beach Municipal Code. Subdivision 80 relates to the Rehabilitation of Pre-1933
buildings. Economically, such rehabilitation and renovation is expensive. For
existing hazardous structures, the cost of remedial work can amount to a
relatively large percentage of total value of an existing structure, and the benefit
cost ratio, therefore, may be relatively small when considering property
improvements for earthquake resistance. However, the social value in reduction
to the threat of life loss justifies the existence of Subdivision 80. Furthermore,
Subdivision 80 provides interim measures, which can be instituted to reduce
occupancy and use of such buildings. As a means of expediting the removal of
many of these building, numerous redevelopment projects are now being
proposed and considered in and around the Long Beach central business district.
Removal of existing unsafe structures can best be accomplished by replacing
them with new developments. In this way the safety problems can be resolved
without an adverse economic impact upon the City or property owners.
        Liquefaction is essentially a phenomenon in which generally cohesionless
soils become fluid and mobile. This process can occur instantaneously as a
result of an earthquake, producing shear stresses that exceed the liquefaction
strength of the soil. To have potential for liquefaction, three simultaneous
conditions are necessary: a) generally cohesionless soils, b) high groundwater,
and c) ground shaking. Cohesionless soils are often closely associated with
marsh and fill areas. Plate 8 delineates the portions of Long Beach that were
historic marsh areas and man-made fill areas. High groundwater levels, the
second necessary condition for liquefaction, are shown in Plate 9. The third
condition, ground shaking, is of course unpredictable with precision. While
Plates 8 and 9 provide indications of areas, which may be subject to potential
liquefaction, more detailed and precise information will be available in the
Seismic Safety Element.
                                           Page 57
       By comparison to ground shaking, liquefaction has historically produced
less damage than structural response to ground shaking. However, in areas that
may be subject to the occurrence of liquefaction, the sudden loss potential may
be greater than for earth shaking. As liquefaction is a phenomenon that occurs
at shallow depths, it is possible to reduce the hazards by use of various geologic
techniques and structural design measures.

        Fault rupture or displacement is most likely to occur along an existing
fault. The only major active fault in Long Beach is the Newport-Inglewood
system, which runs diagonally through the City. A fault rupture is not a
necessary consequence of an earthquake and in the case of the Newport-
Inglewood system; there is no direct evidence of surface displacement in the last
10,000 years. While the resultant damage could be quite severe, the potential
for such fault rupture is considered to be less than the potential for damaging
ground shaking.
        The faults of the Newport-Inglewood Zone which are believed to cut the
surface or near-surface soils and the zone surrounding them have been defined.
(See Plate 10.) These zones were established by defining a band, which
extends one-eighth of a mile, or 660 feet, on each side of the approximate fault
trace. These zones are believed to be adequate to encompass the area within
which surface rupture would be most likely to occur for each identifiable fault.
The zones are in accordance with the State of California guidelines for Special
Studies Zones as specified by the Alquist-Priolo Geologic Hazards Zone Act. As
a result of this Act, the State Geologist will map the Newport-Inglewood zone
during the 1975/76 fiscal year. Prior to this action, the City’s Seismic Safety
Element will provide greater detail and set forth recommendations regarding the
fault zone.
        A tsunami is a sea wave usually generated by a large submarine
earthquake. A seiche is similar to a tsunami, but is generated in an enclosed
body of water such as a harbor, lake, or swimming pool. The potential damage,
of course, is much greater from a tsunami than seiche. Tsunamis travel across
the ocean as long, low waves.
                                        Page 61

Page 6
       Traveling at almost 500 mph in the Pacific, such a wave in the open
causes no problems, and, in fact, the slope of the wave front may be
imperceptible to a ship at sea. However, as the tsunami approaches the
coastline, it is affected by shallow bottom topography and the configuration of the
coastline, which transform it into very high and potentially devastating waves. If
large waves do no occur, strong currents can cause extensive damage. By
comparison to many other areas of Southern California, Long Beach is
somewhat protected by the surrounding geography and the breakwater. As a
substantial warning time of perhaps as much as 6 to 12 hours would be
anticipated, the potential for death or injury from a tsunami is not considered
great. Substantial shoreline property damage would likely occur, however.
Major damage would be to boats, harbor facilities and sea-front structures. In
terms of probability, published estimates of recurrence intervals indicate
maximum wave heights of 3 to 6 feet for 50 and 100-year recurrence intervals.
Mudslides and Landslides
       Mudslides and landslides can be generally categorized under the heading
of slope instability. Statewide, such slope instability is a major threat, estimated
to cause nearly 10 billion dollars worth of damage between 1970 and the year
2000. The areas most susceptible to this condition are those where: a) slopes
are steep, b) soils or soil lenses are weak, cohesionless, or not cemented, c)
bedding dips out of the slope, and d) groundwater is present. In Long Beach
slope instability is not a major problem as slopes generally are neither high nor
steep. While slope instability is not a major consideration in overall land
planning, it is a factor in designing individual sites. Chapter 70 of the Uniform
Building Code relates to grading on sites where safety hazards may be created.
As Chapter 70 has been adopted and is enforced in the City, slope instability is
not a significant or imminent threat to public safety.
                                         Page 63
Erosion
        Like slope instability, erosion alone does not present any significant threat
to public safety. Other beach communities throughout the State have a much
bigger problem with this phenomenon. Due primarily to the breakwater, which
protects the harbor and beach areas, erosion is a much lesser problem here.
Flooding
        A potential flooding hazard could be caused by two primary sources, rains
or earthquakes. Flood control measures to cope with infrequent but intense
rainfall have been taken throughout the entire Los Angeles Basin. These flood
control activities are under the auspices of the Los Angeles County Flood Control
District and the Corps of Engineers, which work in conjunction with local
municipalities. Cities and counties must take certain measures to qualify for the
National Flood Insurance Program of the Federal Department of Housing and
Urban Development. As a part of this program, the City has delineated areas,
which are subject to possible flooding on a 10-year recurrence probability (See
Plate 11). In the designated areas, site-specific drainage considerations are
reviewed prior to the approval of any construction.
        The second potential source of flooding is earthquake related.
Earthquake-induced flooding is the result of failure of water-retaining structures
during earthquakes or especially high seal level fluctuations due to a tsunami or
seiche. Structures involved in such potential flooding include dikes in the
waterfront area and flood-control dams, which lie upstream from Long Beach.
The former is expected to pose the most significant threat. Areas within 2 feet
above mean sea level are considered most susceptible and areas over 2 feet
above to 5 feet above mean sea level are considered secondary flooding zones.
Precise topographic control is required to estimate flooding potential. Flood
hazard areas, as identified in Plate 11, generally reflect the above-mentioned
criteria.
                                         Page 64
        Three flood control dams lie upstream from the City: Sepulveda Basin,
Hansen Basin, and Whittier Narrows Basin. The Sepulveda and Hansen Basins
lie more than 30 miles upstream from where the Los Angeles River passes
through the City. Due to the intervening low and flat ground and the distance
involved, flood waters resulting from a dam failure at either of these reservoirs
would be expected to dissipate before reaching Long Beach. In the event of
failure of the Whittier Narrows Dam while full, flooding could occur along both
sides of the San Gabriel River where it passes through Long Beach but would
probably be most severe on the eastside of the river channel. Due to the
infrequent periods of high precipitation and high river flow, the probability of
flooding as a result of seismically induced failure of these structures is
considered to be very low.
Subsidence
        There are four types of subsidence, based upon the following causative
factors: groundwater withdrawal subsidence; hydro compaction subsidence;
peat oxidation subsidence; and oil or gas withdrawal subsidence. The latter type
has taken place extensively in the Long Beach Harbor area. At the center of the
basin, subsidence amounted to as much as 30 feet at one time. To correct this
problem, a full-scale water injection operation was initiated in 1958. Extensive
repressurization of the reservoir through water injection has stabilized the area,
which, along with substantial remedial land fill operations, has allowed continued
use of port, petroleum production and commercial facilities.
        This water injection program is now monitored by a network of 5 micro-
earthquake monitoring stations that have been in operation since 1971. The
primary purpose of the system, operated by the University of Southern California
Geophysical Laboratory for the Long Beach Department of Oil Properties, is to
detect possible low-energy seismic events induced by water injection.
Apparently no such events have occurred during operation of the system. The
monitoring system will be continued as long as oil extraction operations exist in
the Wilmington Oil Field. Unless otherwise detected, it must be assumed that the
                                        Page 65
prevention measures of repressurization have alleviated the subsidence threat to
public safety.

CRIME PREVENTIO

                              VI.  CRIME PREVENTION
         The major emphasis in this chapter will be on the matter of crime
prevention through physical planning. Operational matters regarding specific
programs or staffing will not be discussed at length as specialists within the
Police Department can best address such subjects. Background information
regarding the organizational framework of the Police Department and crime
statistics is presented, however, so as to establish a better understanding of the
existing status of law enforcement in Long Beach.
                                  Police and Society
         As civilization developed and people began to live together in an
organized fashion, the need for rules and regulations inevitably became
apparent. Thus, laws were created establishing constraints upon individual
freedoms for the mutual good and safety of all the people. The laws alone
accomplished very little in the way of controlling anti-social behavior. The
established laws needed to be enforced if they were to be effective. Thus,
society created the policeman. Although the title was changed form time to time
and from one geographical area to another, the “policeman” has been with us
through all of civilization. The provision for law enforcement did not completely
fulfill desires for order, harmony, and public safety, however. To accomplish
criminal justice, impartial courts were needed to decide guilt or innocence and
determine the penalties to be imposed upon offenders. This action, of course,
created another problem: how does society handle offenders? Death,
confinement, or other constraints upon individual freedom have been the general
courses of action, the theory supposedly being that punishment of the offenders
would teach them “right” from “wrong” and “good” from “bad.” The severity of the
punishment was determined by how much the offender needed to “learn.” In
recent years, modern society has emphasized rehabilitation rather than merely
punishment for criminal offenders, although many do not hold to this view.
Various preventative measures have also been recognized by society as a
means of reorienting young people away form criminal tendencies. Improved
                                         Page 71

educational and employment opportunities exemplify such preventative and
remedial strategies.
           The above discussion was not intended to be a historical report on
criminal justice. The intention was to establish to major points in regard to the
role of police in society. First, it should be recognized that the need for law
enforcement and safety from crime is as old as society itself. Secondly, the
entire process of criminal justice and crime prevention involves more than just
police. Crime as it relates to personal safety in urban areas, must include
participation from various disciplinary fields as well as the citizenry at large.
                                        Long Beach Police Department
           The Long Beach Police Department has a current staff of 935 personnel.
Of this number, 280 are classified as patrolmen. The complete breakdown of
police department personnel by division is shown in Table 6. Overall, the police
manpower per capita is 1.94 per 1000 population.1 While this figure is lower than
the national average, the west coast as a whole has traditionally maintained
smaller law enforcement offices than many other portions of the nation.

        In terms of internal organization, Long Beach is undoubtedly rather typical
in its division of labor and assignment of duties. The fact that all Police
Department functions are located in one municipal building tends to facilitate
communications and coordination of activities.
Crime in Long Beach
        Crime statistics are complex, confusing, and often misleading. In
attempting to compare or analyze crime data, difficulties arise as a result of
differences in reporting procedures, political boundaries, operational policies,
population groupings and other factors. The F.B.I. annually publishes a “Uniform
Crime Repot for the United States.” Being cognizant of the various factors which
might lead to misinterpretation of statistics, the F.B.I. admonishes the reader
against drawing conclusions from crime figures without first considering the
factors involved. In any given area of consideration, various conditions exist
which will affect the extent of crime and the type of crime that occurs. Some of
the more significant conditions that affect crime include the following:
        •    Density and size of the community population;
        •    Economic status and values of the population;
        •    Age, sex, and ethnic composition of the population and the
             surrounding populations;
        •    Stability of the population;
        •    Educational, and cultural characteristics of the population;
        •    Effectiveness and strength of the police force;
        •    Attitude of the public toward law enforcement problems;
        •    Opportunity to successfully commit an offense.
        All crimes are divided into two major categories entitled Part I and Part II.
Part I consists of the most serious crimes including homicide, rape, robbery,
assault, burglary, larceny, and auto theft. The Part II category includes such
events as malicious mischief, suicide attempts, accidental injuries, accidental
deaths, missing persons, and others. During the year of 1974, a total of 25,916
                                          Page 73

Part I offenses and 9,560 Part II offenses were committed in Long Beach. Of this
total, 3,749 Part I, and, 3,671 Part II offenses were cleared by arrest.2 The more
serious Part I crimes not only present the greatest threat to the public safety from
the standpoint of frequency of occurrence, but also pose the greatest problem in
apprehension and arrest.
           Part I crimes, which are of primary concern to the Police Department, are
not increasing as rapidly in Long Beach as in may other cities throughout the
nation. However, every effort is being made to provide sufficient forces,
equipment and new techniques of police enforcement to cope with increased
criminal activity. Table 7 shows a breakdown of Part I crimes for the years
between 1967 and 1974.
           The rate of criminal activity fluctuates throughout the City. Generally,
violent and serious crimes have occurred more frequently in and surrounding the
central business district (CBD), North Long Beach, and the area west of the Los
Angeles River. In the CBD the socioeconomic status, particularly with respect to
substantial transient movement, appears to have been a contributing factor to the
rather high crime rate. This situation presents special problems for the City in
protecting the many senior citizens living in the area. As in many lower
socioeconomic neighborhoods of American cities, many permanent residents
have problems caused by limited economic resources. Revitalization and
renewal in this portion of the City should contribute positively to a deterrence of
criminal activities.
           North Long Beach as well as the area west of the Los Angeles River have
experienced an increased crime rate of relatively recent origin. It is postulated
that much of the increase in criminal activity is spillover from the neighboring
cities to the north. This entire matter of spillover cannot be ignored. Past
experiences of the Police Department indicate that activities in adjacent
municipalities can have a substantial effect upon the crime rate of Long Beach.

For example, a 1972 Crime-Specific Burglary Program in the City of Bellflower,
which consisted of a door-to-door campaign to inform citizens of burglary
prevention techniques and devices, resulted in the apparent displacement of
criminals to other communities. Residential burglaries in the City of Long Beach
increased by over 20 percent in that year. While a minimal increase could have
been anticipated, such a disproportionate increase can only be attributed to
outside factors. The primary point to be made is that Long Beach cannot deal
with the crime problem in isolation from neighboring communities within the Los
Angeles Basin.
        By contrast to the above-mentioned areas, east Long Beach, Bixby Knolls,
the Harbor area, and most other portions of the City are experiencing an increase
in crime against property as opposed to the more serious violation against
persons.
                     Crime Prevention Through Physical Planning
        Traditionally, crime has been viewed as a symptom of other factors, which
needed to be corrected. Police personnel are almost solely involved in the
apprehension of criminals and the suppression of crime. The matter of crime
prevention was primarily limited to initiating social programs, rehabilitating
offenders, tightening security and the like. Additional patrolmen would be added
to a force, more sophisticated equipment utilized, and residents sometimes
educated with regard to security hardware such as special locks and article
identification. In terms of urban form and the quality of life in urbanized areas,
this traditional approach has often resulted in the construction of fortresses,
which isolated the residents form the surrounding community.
               An example of this new lifestyle was presented by the National
               Commission of the Causes and Prevention of Violence: One new
               high cost subdivision under construction outside Washington, D.C.
               will be guarded by electronic alarms. The entire development will
               be surrounded by two fences, broken for entry at only two points,
               both with guardhouses. Residents will be telephone to approve
               visitors. The two miles of fencing will be surveyed by a closed
                                        Page 75
                      circuit television system and fortified by hidden electronic sensors.
                      All residents will carry special credentials for identification.3

    estimates for those years
            In view of the above-described dilemma, it has become increasingly
   apparent that the matter of crime prevention needed to be expanded and that the
   new approaches needed to be explored for effectuating a crime resistant
   environment that is also pleasant in other respects. Policing and urban planning
   could no longer remain isolated functions within a municipality. It is interesting to
   note that while Planning Departments have traditionally maintained liaison with
   Departments of Fire, Building and Safety, and Community Development, law
   enforcement has remained somewhat removed form the planning process.
   While this interaction is now only in its infancy, a number of research projects
   have been completed and the findings in may instances offer insight for both
   police and planning personnel.
            Much of the research conducted in this field is based upon the premise
   that for a crime to occur, three fundamental ingredients are necessary: motive,
   ability, and opportunity. Programs devised to treat various social ills are primarily
   focused upon the motives of crime. The ability to commit a crime is, to a large
   extent, a function of having the opportunity. Thus, research was oriented toward
    3

    (Washington, D.C., January, 1973). P.195.
                                                    Page 76
the reduction of crime via the removal of opportunity, without sacrificing
community cohesion or environmental quality.
        Perhaps the most noteworthy single author on the subject of crime
prevention via physical design is Oscar Newman, a New York City planner and
architect, who has published a book entitled Defensible Space. Additionally, an
excellent summary of information regarding the subject was compiled by the
National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals. As a
result of their efforts, this body set forth recommendations for various aspects of
crime prevention. Locally, the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) authored a “Study of Crime Prevention Through Physical Planning” in
1971. These sources can be examined by those who wish to have more detailed
information.
        While independent, academic research was not possible within the scope
of this Safety Element, the matter of public safety would not be complete without
directing attention to the most significant findings of other research efforts. The
facts, concepts, and recommendations, as discussed below, will be incorporated
in the land use allocation process, the formulation of housing policy, and other
general plan activities.
        In regard to criminal behavior as it relates to land uses, the following
factors are of significance:
        •   Criminal offenders tend to choose the “place” over the “victim.” The
            location is of greatest concern to the offender.
        •   Outside surveillance indicators tend to deter criminals more than inside
            surveillance devices.
        •   An offender will tend to select a neighborhood and specific site where
            opportunities for committing a successful offense are best.
        In examining the location of criminal activity, the following information is
applicable to land use and urban design considerations:
                                           Page 77

          •    Less violent crime or even anti-social behavior occurs in parks than on
               the streets. Access to recreation areas appears to be of greater
               concern than the design of the park itself.
          •    “The implementation of an adequate lighting system has been shown
               to have some correlation with the reduction and deterrence of crime.”4
          •    Within most high-crime areas, most criminal activity actually occurred
               at certain, limited spots where opportunity was best. In other words, a
               high-crime area may be only deficient at a single location due to
               circumstances of the physical setting.
          An examination of the available information clearly indicates that
opportunity is directly correlated with actual criminal activity and that through the
planning process, opportunity can be substantially lessened. Physical design
can be accomplished in such a manner that it contributes to the creation of public
spaces that serve to deter, rather than encourage crime. Specific areas of
consideration should include but not be limited to the following:
          •    Public access to parks and other urban uses should be designed in
               such a manner that surveillance is enhanced. On-street parking,
               foyers, and similar enclaves should be minimized.
          •    In multi-family structures, design provision should be made to allow
               mutual surveillance. Common areas and entranceways should be well
               lighted and in open view.
          •    Improved street lighting and pedestrian path illumination should be
               provided in public areas.
          •    Abandoned and vacant buildings should be demolished to reduce
               availability to potential violators.
          •    Parking garages should be located in close proximity to activity
               centers.

          •   Public areas should be improved so as to attract increased numbers of
              people and promote high activity levels, thereby increasing the number
              of observers, which promotes increased safety.
          •   Activity nodes should be centralized to avoid isolated crime
              opportunities.
          •   Neighborhood identity should be enhanced to encourage cohesion, so
              that potential violators might be more easily identified.
          •   Landscaping that would hinder visibility or increase user fear should be
              avoided.
          The above list is by no means exhaustive. As specific planning and/or
development considerations arise, other crime prevention measures may be
appropriate. To assure comprehensive project review, Police Department
personnel should become even more involved in the planning and development
process. Proposed developments, street alterations, public facilities, and other
similar projects should not be implemented without input from police personnel.
          In terms of codes and ordinances, many communities are attempting to
reduce crime through the adoption of new laws, which include security measures.
“California is preparing statewide security standards for most buildings.”5 These
Codes would serve as guidelines to assure the consideration of security factors
in the design of buildings. When these guidelines become available at the local
level, they should be reviewed as to their applicability and incorporated into the
existing building code if deemed adequate. If the peculiarities of Long Beach are
such that the State guidelines cannot be suitably applied, the City may exercise
the option of developing its own security code. The inclusion of such security
considerations is particularly important for developments in areas, which are
experiencing an increasing rate of serious crimes.

UTILITIE

                                       VII. UTILITIES
         Four major utility operations are established within the City of Long Beach:
Water, Gas Telephone, and Electricity. Both the Water and Gas operations are
provided to the citizens by the City itself. Telephone service is provided by
General and Pacific Telephone Companies, while electric power is generated
and distributed by Southern California Edison Company.
         Utilities in general provide life-sustaining services and are essential for
urban living. As such, utilities are an asset, which must be continually supplied.
In times of emergency, it is imperative that utilities be maintained and/or restored
should services be interrupted. At the same time the utility services themselves
may pose certain hazards to public safety should damage occur along the
established support system. Because of the magnitude of responsibility involved,
all of the existing utility systems have rather elaborate safeguards built into the
network. By and large, safety measure are dictated to utility services by City
ordinances, special commissions, State offices, or Federal requirements. Except
in special instances where additional safety precautions may be warranted, the
City is well protected from potential threats. In fact, the major threat is that the
interruption of one service may hinder another utility service form functioning at
its normal level. All of the utility services, however, have established networks
throughout the City in such a manner that an interruption at one location may be
by-passed and services provided via alternate channels.
                                  Utility-related Hazards
         The City Water Department has two elevated distribution reservoirs with a
combined storage capacity of 117,000,000 gallons of water. The Alamitos
Reservoir consists of 23 steel storage tanks, while the Dominguez Reservoir
consists of 12. Together these storage reservoirs could provide for
approximately two average day’s use in the even of an emergency. While these
storage reservoirs are essential as a safeguard of the water supply, the rupturing
of these tanks could be catastrophic. The Alamitos Reservoir, near the Traffic
Circle, would be of greater concern due to the number of tanks involved and the
                                            Page 83

proximity to the Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone. While the tanks are earthquake-
resistant and survived the 1933 quake undamaged, a substantial break along the
fault trace could rupture several tanks, causing significant flooding in the downhill
areas. The potential threat is substantially lessened by the fact that a fault
rupture is not considered to be a probably event (see Seismic Safety Element.)
        Southern California Edison Company maintains an electrical power
generating and distributing network throughout the City. As a part of this system,
overhead transformers and distribution lines have been installed in past years.
Today, these utility facilities are underground except in special instances where
surface or aboveground lines are required for technical reasons. Many of the
older overhead utilities remain, however, aside from the aesthetics involved,
these overhead transformers and lines are subject to falling in the event of an
earthquake. While the transformers switch off upon being grounded, a potential
safety threat exists as a result of their suspension. While the safety hazard is not
great, these suspended utilities should be installed at or below surface as is
feasible.

INDUSTRIAL/
TRANSPORTATION

Page 8
                         VIII. INDUSTRIAL/TRANSPORTATION
        Like utilities, industrial and transportation related activities are essential to
the livelihood and economic well being of the community. While these activities
are an asset, they also pose certain potential hazards. Industries and
transportation are controlled by numerous Commissions, State regulations, and
Federal guidelines. While a certain risk is created as a result of these activities,
hazards are usually minimal. No Safety Element, however, would be complete
without a review of the most salient industrial and transportation related hazards.
                                    Industrial Land Uses
        Long Beach has 1, 684 acres of industrial land use. For the most part the
industrial areas are concentrated in five locations of the City: the harbor area,
the Westside industrial area (just north of the harbor), in and surrounding the
airport, in north Long Beach, and on the eastside at the conjunction of
Westminster and Studebaker Road. (See Plate 12).
        From a public safety standpoint, the greatest threat is that of
encroachment of industrial activities into other areas of the City. This mixing of
incompatible land uses presents itself in the west Long Beach area. An
Economic Development Corporation has been formed in Long Beach to
effectuate industrial revitalization in this Westside area. The area as it now exists
is primarily composed of small-scale operations. The situation of incompatible
land uses also exists in the north Long Beach. Numerous remedial measures
have been considered for the area over the years. Most mitigating measures,
however, would be quite expensive and of limited benefit. In view of the
deleterious nature of such incompatibly placed land uses, it is incumbent upon
the City to avoid such mixtures in the future development of the City.
                             Transport of Hazardous Materials
        The California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS) sets forth
regulations and restrictions upon the transporting of dangerous fluids, chemicals,
or explosives. In the City of Long Beach, designated truck routes are
established. These routes are delineated on Plate 13, along with freeways and
                                           Page 88
railroads. Aside from the routine safety precautions, the City Fire and Police
Departments are alerted when shipments of particularly dangerous materials are
due to pass through the City. For the safety of the workmen, Longshoremen and
Teamster Unions also require shippers and transporters of dangerous materials
to take precautionary measures.
        In terms of public safety, the areas immediately adjacent to designated
truck routes should be allocated for low occupancy land uses, thereby exposing a
fewer number of people to potential risk. The difficulty, however, is that truck
routes are generally major arterials, offering ease of access for commercial and
multi-family residential uses. Through physical planning and spatial design,
however, an effort should be make to buffer all uses from passing dangerous
materials by way of set-backs or natural barriers.
         “In 1967, CALTRANS, the County of Los Angeles, and the California
Highway Patrol negotiated with the Pacific and General Telephone Companies
for the installation of call-boxes on approximately 310 miles of Los Angeles
County freeways.”1 The Long Beach Freeway south of Anaheim Street,
however, is not State maintained and thus was not equipped with emergency
phones. As this portion of the freeway is designated as Harbor District
responsibility, the area is patrolled rather regularly by Harbor Department
personnel. Because of the close observation of the area, accidents are likely to
be detected rather quickly. Nonetheless, a number of recent freeway accidents
have occurred, involving such things as gasoline carriers and the potential
hazard may justify the installation of phones along this stretch of the freeway
from Anaheim Street to the Harbor area. A cost benefit analysis of freeway
phones installations in this area should be further examined.
                                            Aircraft Safety
        Annual operations at Long Beach Airport are at a level of approximately
560,000. The majority of operations at Long Beach are general aviation aircraft,

                                                Page 89

with business jets and large jet operations constituting the remainder.2 Potential
aircraft crashes pose a certain public safety hazard to residents of the area, but
aircraft safety regulations are strictly enforced by the Federal Aviation
Administration and accidents are relatively few. Nonetheless, some tank farms
and above ground storage of other dangerous fuels are incompatibly located in
close proximity to airport operations. Future land use planning must recognize
such hazards and provide for adequate spacing of these incompatible uses. It is
particularly important to avoid placing fuel storage facilities in line with the
established flight pattern.

Page 9
                           IX.    DISASTER OPERATIONS
        Disasters may be caused by man or nature. The ability to survive disaster
adversities is dependent to a great extent upon the degree of preparedness that
exists prior to the event. Emergency preparedness includes the process of
evaluating and attempting to minimize potential disaster occurrences. Should a
disaster take place, emergency preparedness would minimize the ill effects and
effectuate a rapid recovery. The primary purpose of disaster operation and civil
defense is to protect lives and property, preserve the continuity of civil order, and
restore a viable and functional economy. While it is hoped that such disaster
operations need never be activated, the City would be remiss in its obligation to
the citizens if such preparedness were not provided.
                         Emergency Operating Center (EOC)
        The Long Beach Department of Emergency Preparedness is located at
4040 East Spring Street near the Airport. (See Plate 14.) Its underground facility
was originally a Nike Ajax Missile Site, but now serves as the central operating
base for all civil defense activities. In the event of a disaster, this Emergency
Operating Center (EOC) would become the command post for coordinating
manpower, equipment, resources and facilities. Through the use of the
communications network, the disaster coordinator can assemble information from
the field, assess existing situations throughout the City, provide resources,
organize disaster services, and keep the public informed.
        The underground Emergency Operation Center consists of three separate
activity areas, divided by corridor walkways. The east chamber is the
administrative headquarters and provides an assembly and briefing area. The
walls of this area are surrounded by displays and graphic illustrations, which can
be used to record events as they occur during a time of emergency. The east
chamber also houses the communications and operations groups. The center
chamber houses the utilities and supporting staff. This supporting staff may
analyze or interpret information so it may be forwarded to the administrative
advisors and chiefs in the assembly area. The west chamber of the Center
                                          Page 95
consists of living facilities to be used by the “Operations Group” during a disaster
event. This area has an infirmary, kitchen, dining room, and dormitories. While
the facility is designed to handle disaster relief activities, the City makes day-to-
day use of the available space for conducting training courses, holding
conferences, and so forth.
Manpower
       All City employees are registered disaster service workers. When the
emergency organization is activated, the City Manager or his designated
alternate directs disaster response activities. Department heads and other
designated City officials will serve as deputy directors and service chiefs in the
emergency operation. These key personnel will locate themselves in the
assembly area in the east chamber of the EOC facility. Additional City
employees will serve as support personnel for providing specific information,
analysis, and services. These support services include the areas of
communications and warning, situation analysis, housing and shelter, health and
medical, welfare, fire and rescue, law enforcement and traffic control, public
works, economic stabilization, utilities, transportation, building and safety, and
others.
Communications
       In the event of a disaster, communications are essential for the
coordination of various service operators and field workers. Furthermore, it is
imperative that the public be kept informed. Through the Emergency Operating
Center, the City has access to a variety of radio, telephone, and teletype
resources, including the following:
       •    EOC-City Government radio networks, including the mobile
            communications center.
       •    Existing radio networks of the Police, Fire, Health, Public Service, and
            Marine Departments.
       •    RACES (the amateur radio operators)
                                          Page 96

       •   REACT (the citizen band radio operators)
       •   GTE mobile radio telephone service
       •   Radio networks used by local commercial companies
       •   Municipal telephone system
       •   GTE facilities
       •   Police Department Teletype network, which is an intra- and inter-State
           system.
       A great deal of the communications flow will be received and transmitted
through the communications room of the EOC. Numerous telephones are
provided in the assembly area for the continuous use of service chiefs and
advisors.
       In addition to the elaborate communications network throughout the City
and surrounding area, national communications is assured by two direct
connections with NAWAS, the national warning system. Information regarding
disasters anywhere in the U.S. are reported to the NORAD headquarters near
Denver, Colorado. Long Beach can become informed of disaster situations in
other locales or potential dangers that may be anticipated via two direct taps into
this national warning system. One communication terminal is located in the
underground Emergency Operating Center and the other is tied into the fire
dispatch system at Fire Department headquarters.
Evacuation
       To protect the populace from potential or imminent danger, it may be
necessary to evacuate portions of the City. Evacuation procedures would need
to be coordinated through the Police Department so as to avoid chaos and panic.
Through radio announcements and helicopter loudspeakers, residents of an
evacuation area could be alerted. It is not practical to establish firm routes of
evacuation, as the areas to be affected and the possible routes to be used would
vary depending upon the disaster and the street conditions at the time.
                                       Page 97

         While it is impossible to determine exact areas that may be subject to
evacuation or to establish definite routes of evacuation, degree of preparation is
possible by an examination of causative factors and constraints in
implementation. Plausible events, which could necessitate evacuation, include
earthquakes, tsunamis, major fires, leakage of dangerous fuels, chemical
explosions, and flooding. In many instances it is difficult to anticipate where
hazards may present themselves. In terms of the geologic hazards, however,
available information serves as indicators of potentially hazardous areas in the
event of an earthquake or flooding. The areas with the greatest potential for
major damage are shown on Plate 11. Essentially, these areas include the
western and eastern extremities of the City and the Shoreline area, which
connects them. In view of this information, alternate strategies for evacuating
these areas should be developed.
         Regardless of the areas affected by possible evacuation, good reliable
information is of the greatest importance. The extent of the problem of potential
danger, what areas could be affected, what direction provides the safest route of
escape, and other similar types of information are essential to an evacuation
operation. As time would be of the essence, pre-disaster strategies are
imperative. As a matter of preparation, a determination should be made of
critical points throughout the City, which would be necessary in order to evacuate
various areas. Critical points would include major arterials and traffic
interchanges. Teams of police personnel could be assigned to specific critical
points. In the event of a disaster, these personnel would be responsible for
checking and reporting the condition of the major evacuation points to the EOC.
With this information readily available, disaster coordinators could more quickly
determine the most appropriate evacuation strategy.
         For the most part, evacuation of any portion of the City would be
accomplished by private automobile. Senior citizens, low-income residents,
hospital patients, and others, however, may not have immediate access to
private transportation. To provide mobility for these groups the disaster director
has the authority to direct all public buses to the endangered area. The matter of
                                         Page 98
coordinating bus pick-up points and notifying the people to be evacuated is
another matter, which is largely dependent upon the immediate availability or
reliable information.
        In the event of a major earthquake, extensive land areas throughout the
City may be affected. It is conceivable that numerous traffic corridors could be
severed. Freeways, in particular, have proven to be unreliable sources of
passage. Primarily because of the numerous bridge structures, freeways often
survive poorly during major quakes. The partial collapse of any one-bridge
structure or embankment fill cripples that artery. Also some, bur probably not all,
roads which pass below or over freeways will not be passable after a major
event. Should damages be that extensive, the City could be isolated in terms of
ingress or egress. As it would involve a great deal of time to repair these
roadways, the problem could arise of sustaining the population with food staples,
medical supplies, and other essentials. Fortunately, Long Beach is fronted by
water and has airport facilities. Should the streets and freeway systems be so
impaired as to cut-off supplies form other areas, access to the City is possible by
water or air.
Community Resources
        Within the City there are numerous physical resources, which could be
utilized to provide needed shelter, medical treatment, or other necessary
services. In terms of protection, there are 220 licensed fallout shelters in the
City. For hospital care, Long Beach is served by 10 separate institutions:
Memorial, St. Mary’s, Community, Pacific, Veterans, Los Altos, Woodruff
Community, U.S. Naval, El Cerrito, and Long Beach General. Furthermore, the
City has established 13 First Aid Centers. Most of these centers are school or
public facilities, which can be quickly converted for this use. Emergency Shelters
can also be provided throughout the City at various recreation facilities. (Plate 14
shows the locations of Hospitals, First Aid Centers, and Emergency Shelters.)
The Queen Mary is another community resource, which could shelter and protect
an estimated 8,000 people if necessary. In addition to the above, Long Beach
                                        Page 99

has numerous auxiliary and convalescent hospitals which could be used for
treatment and care of disaster victims.
Disaster Assistance
       Emergency Preparedness in Long Beach is an integral part of an overall
system, which connects the City with higher levels of Government. The City may
call upon the County, State of California, or the Federal Government to obtain
assistance in handling any disaster. Los Angeles County is sub-divided into
seven civil defense areas, with Long Beach, Lakewood and Signal Hill being
Area “F”. Civil Defense operations from other jurisdictions will provide recovery
aid should it be warranted under the States Mutual Aid Pact. Both the State and
Federal governments have established programs allowing local communities to
apply for financial and other types of assistance. Monies may be allocated to
local communities when a major disaster occurs. Assistance formulas are set
forth based upon the type and degree of disaster. Through the various State and
Federal agencies and private organizations, individuals affected by the disaster
may be eligible for grants, food stamps, commodity programs, unemployment
compensation, temporary housing, rent and mortgage payment, legal aid, and so
forth.
Disaster Exercises
       So as to assure a state of readiness, the City’s Department of Emergency
Preparedness conducts periodic disaster exercises. City personnel form every
department are assigned to participate in the drills, performing functions
comparable to those, which may be required in a time of actual emergency.
Various conceivable disasters are then simulated so that alternative solutions
may be tested. Most recently the City conducted a disaster simulation exercise
in conjunction with the University of Southern California and the System
Development Corporation. This was part of a research effort to develop
guidelines for the response of government to natural disasters. The research
was designed to improve conceptual planning for the operational management of
                                       Page 100

natural disasters. Continual involvement in these types of emergency operations
is of great benefit to the City in terms of learning to effectively deal with possible
disasters.
Citizen Safety
        While the Department of Emergency Preparedness will keep the citizens
informed during a time of disaster, the process of evaluating the extent of the
problem and mobilizing disaster operations involves time. During a disaster, this
time can be precious and can affect the safety and well being of citizens.
Simulated disaster operations, as discussed above, reduce the response time
and assure the citizen of a greater degree of safety. Nonetheless, it is essential
that citizens themselves become aware of how to prepare for and react to an
emergency situation. Appendix “A” provides some valuable tips on what to do
and what not to do in cases of fire, earthquake, and flood.
        The Departments of Emergency Preparedness, Fire and Police now have
public education programs. Greater emphasis upon public awareness, however,
is always warranted. Through the media, the public education programs, citizen
participation, and other lines of communication, a greater dissemination of Safety
information should be implemented.
        In an effort to assure immediate emergency services, in 1972 the State of
California adopted legislation requiring Cities to establish a “911” emergency
telephone system. Through the “911” system, all emergency services, including
police, fire, ambulance and medical assistance, can be obtained by dialing a
single number: 911. This emergency telephone system is now being planned by
the City, with inputs from all safety oriented departments and General Telephone
Company. A tentative City-wide Plan was completed in January 1975 and the
system itself is expected to be operational by July of 1977. During a time of
disaster, this system will provide citizens a direct line of communications with
disaster coordinators.

RISK MANAGEMEN

                               X.   RISK MANAGEMENT
        Within the framework of local City government, there is a division of labor
in terms of public safety. Basically all Departments and agencies involved can
be categorized into one of the four following organizational groups:
            1.      Planning and preventative groups.
            2.      Action-oriented groups (i.e. handling the immediate crisis)
            3.      Resource groups (i.e. assisting in handling the immediate crisis)
            4.      Recover groups (i.e. administrative assistance with grants, aid,
                    programs, etc.)
        While there may be a certain degree of overlap involved, most City
departments and agencies are primarily oriented toward one of the above listed
activity groups. The principal emphasis of this document is one of planning and
prevention. To accomplish the desired results, the scope was by necessity,
rather broad. Specific safety aspects of a particular site, project, development, or
activity were not examined in depth. It is imperative, however, that such
scrutinizing of necessary safety precautions be employed.
        The City of Long Beach now has a position of City Safety Officer. The
City Safety Officer is involved in preventing injury to City employees, matters of
workmen’s compensation, traffic problems, limited public liability difficulties, and
similar matters. Due to recent changes in Federal and State laws requiring cities
to better insure themselves against all types of hazards, many communities are
expanding the role of safety personnel. A relatively new field has emerged which
encompasses all aspects of public safety. This new area to expertise is most
often referred to as risk management. It originated out of a need to evaluate
insurance needs and programs, but has been expanded to include the following
types of functions:
        •   Identifying hazards with significant potential to create large financial
            losses;
        •   Prioritizing hazards as to potential loss, extent of risk, and remedial
            costs to reduce the hazard;
        •   Estimating economic effects of predictable losses;
                                        Page 105

        •   Establishing insurance needs in view of probable loss;
        •   Designing insurance coverage that meets the particular needs of the
            City;
        •   Continual risk re-evaluation based upon new or changing exposures to
            employees or the general public;
        •   Coordinating safety activities with safety personnel working in the
            private sector (i.e. work closely with harbor and airport safety experts
            to assure safe operations on the ground as well as reducing potential
            risk to nearby residents);
        •   Establishing mechanisms to accumulate funds to pay losses.
        While many of these activities are now conducted by the City, coordination
is often difficult. The practicality of establishing a formal Risk Management
Program in the City should be examined. The primary responsibility of such a
program would be to make systematic and continuous reviews of all safety and
insurance matters.
                                      Levels of Risk
        The process of risk management involves a thorough examination of
numerous factors. The probability of occurrence, cost of remedial actions,
potential economic losses, human safety considerations, and a host of other
variables come into play. Even with expert review, establishing a level of
acceptable risk is often a very subjective process. How safe is safe enough, is
always open to question. In most instances, decisions regarding subjective
judgments should be made by groups of experts from various disciplinary fields
rather than single individuals. Risk management could include committee
activities so as to assure comprehensiveness and eliminate bias. With adequate
information, this group approach offers reliability and good cross-sectional
representation.
        In formulating the approach and scope of this element, an initial step was
taken toward group decision-making in evaluating various risks in terms of
acceptability to the community. A list of potential risks was sent to 48 separate
                                          Page 106

City Departments and private organizations, including local hospitals, industries,
and utility companies. The respondents were selected because of their expertise
or close association with matters of public safety. While more broad-based
citizen input is usually preferred, it was felt that this group would be in a better
position to subjectively evaluate the level of risks presented in regards to this
particular project. Unless one has at least a rudimentary knowledge of potential
risk factors, it is difficult to estimate a degree of possible danger.
        The respondents were asked to rate each of the listed risks as either
“Acceptable” or “Unacceptable.” As no factual information was provided, the
rating was largely an exercise in subjective judgments. Nonetheless, the over all
response is of interest and serves as an indicator of community feelings. Table 8
shows the list of risks with the acceptability rating. In general, it was felt that
exposure to risk within the community is acceptable. Upon closer examination,
comparison, and groupings of the responses, however, some specific and
significant attitudes can be extrapolated:
        •   Industrial hazards were generally considered acceptable risks. It was
            either felt that the amount of risk was not substantial or that the level of
            risk was justifiable in view of the economic benefits derived from the
            industrial activity.
        •   The possible rupture of a water, oil, or chemical tank was the only
            industrial risk, which received a substantial number of “Unacceptable”
            ratings. In terms of industrial land uses, this would imply a desire to
            discourage the large-scale storage of these liquids within the City,
            particularly in areas of greatest potential seismic activity.
        •   Minor seismic events were considered “Acceptable,” while major
            events were “Unacceptable” by over 50 per cent of the respondents.
            The variation in response suggests that planning and preparation be
            geared to coping with the maximum probable catastrophe. In other
            words, the City should make provisions for handling the worst possible
            eventuality.
                                           Page 107

• The response for the risks of tsunamis and seiches were almost
  equally divided between “Acceptable” and “Unacceptable.” By
  comparison to the ratings in general, tsunamis and seiches were
  considered substantially less acceptable. As a warning time is usually
  possible, adequate evacuation procedures are of particular concern in
  areas susceptible to these seismic hazards.
• A significant proportion (near 50 percent) of the respondents felt that
  building collapse was an “Unacceptable” risk. This suggests a need to
  accelerate programs for the removal of unsafe structures and a further
  implementation of subdivision 80 of the existing building code. Unlike
  a seismic event, which there is little or no control over, the soundness
  of structures within the City is a factor, which can be influenced by City
  action.
• In terms of aircraft safety, the levels of Acceptability were nearly
  equivalent for large and small aircraft. This implies that the “crash” is
  more of an important consideration than the size of the crash. Of
  greatest concern was the location of the crash. Possible aircraft
  crashes on the Airport grounds or in water were more “Acceptable”
  than possible crashes on land off the Airport properties.
• Panic during a catastrophic event received the largest number of
  “Unacceptable” ratings. It can be surmised that while many potential
  disasters cannot be removed or alleviated, preparedness in dealing
  with the problem and maintaining order is of paramount importance.

RECOMMENDATION

                              XI.    RECOMMENDATIONS
        This section indicates areas of improvement and suggests
recommendations necessary for attaining the established public safety goals.
Because of the rather large array of public safety considerations covered in the
report, recommendations include a variety of City activities. In terms of an
implementation timetable, the recommendations are short, intermediate, and long
range. For discussion purposes, however, the proposed actions are divided into
two major categories: Immediate action recommendations, and Advance
Planning recommendations. The former relate to matters of immediate interest,
while the latter type are more policy oriented and serve primarily as guidelines for
future land use allocations and continued urban development. While the
immediate action recommendations may have a greater impact upon current City
activities, the Advance Planning Recommendations often relate to developmental
policy and may have a more significant effect upon the City’s future.
                          Immediate Action Recommendations
    1.      In an effort to further improve the insurance services rating for Long
            Beach, implementation of recommendations of the Insurance Services
            Office for improving fire protection in the City should be considered
            seriously. Removal of 100 deficiency points from the Insurance
            Services Office Survey would allow Long Beach to be rated in Class I.
            There has never been a city in the history of fire ratings to achieve this
            classification. The effect would be lesser fire insurance cost for non-
            residential land users.
    2.      The fire station relocation program should be implemented as specified
            in the Capitol Improvement Program. Based upon computer analysis,
            the station relocator program recommends the phasing out of 8
            existing stations and the construction of 8 new facilities. In actual site
            selection for the new fire stations, inputs should be obtained from other
            City Departments, including the City Planning Department.
                                         Page 113

3. Evidence has substantiated the need for built-in fire protection
   measures in high-rise buildings. As much of Long Beach’s future
   development is expected to consist of recycled land use, that is, land
   being redeveloped at a greater intensity of use than it has been
   previously, it is reasonable to anticipate some new high-rise
   construction. In an effort to provide better fire safety to the citizens, it
   is recommended that the 1973 Uniform Fire and Building Codes with
   amendments be adopted by the City. This proposed ordinance
   specifies built-in fire protection equipment for structures of more than
   55 feet in height.
4. Many of the older buildings in the City do not meet good fire protection
   standards. Of particular concern is the problem of open stairways.
   Chapter 13 of the appendix of the proposed 1973 Uniform Building
   Code recommends provisions for stairway enclosures. To provide a
   reasonable degree of life safety to occupants of such buildings, it is
   essential that these provisions be adopted.
5. The City of Long Beach has an abundance of old un-reinforced
   structures, which serve as potential risks in the event of an
   earthquake. Subdivision 80 of the Long Beach Municipal Code relates
   to the Rehabilitation of these Pre-1933 buildings. Due to the
   magnitude of the problem, particularly in the CBD, enforcement of the
   ordinance has been accomplished on a gradual and incremental basis.
   In view of the safety hazards presented by these un-reinforced
   buildings, however, consideration should be given to accelerating the
   implementation of Subdivision 80.
6. Consideration should be given to retaining the services of a structural
   engineer to recommend methods of revising existing building
   regulations to provide for adequate damage-control features in regards
   to earthquake resistant requirements.
                                 Page 114

7.  As a part of the Southern California Edison Company’s distribution
    network, a number of overhead transformers and lines are located
    throughout the City. These suspended utilities should be installed
    below or at surface as is feasible so as to avoid the risks of having the
    equipment fall in the event of an earthquake.
8.  The Long Beach Freeway south of Anaheim Street is not State
    maintained and thus is not equipped with emergency phones. The
    installation of phones along this stretch of the Freeway from Anaheim
    Street to the Harbor area may be warranted. A cost benefit analysis of
    the installation of emergency phones in this area should be conducted.
9.  While it is impossible to determine exact areas that may be subject to
    evacuation a determination should be made of critical points
    throughout the City which would be necessary in order to evacuate
    various areas. Critical points would include major arterials and traffic
    interchanges.
10. When the City is involved in disaster operations at the EOC it is
    imperative that the decisions (which must often be quickly arrived at
    and usually under considerable stress) be based on the latest and
    most comprehensive information available. The system currently used
    in the EOC for placing information in the hands of the decision makers
    may not be completely adequate during an actual disaster.
    Consideration should be given to augmenting the existing system with
    modern electronic display equipment.
11. In an effort to assure immediate emergency services, in 1972 the State
    of California adopted legislation requiring cities to establish a “911”
    emergency telephone system. It is recommended that the City
    continue to give priority to this project so it may become operational by
    the target date of July 1977.
                                  Page 115

12. Consideration should be given to establishing a Risk Management
    program, which would allow the City to make a systematic and
    continuous review of all safety and insurance matters.
            ADVANCE PLANNING RECOMMENDATIONS
13. As the occurrence of fires appears to be associated with the conditions
    and age of the structures, an effort should be made to recycle areas,
    supplanting deteriorated structures with new developments.
14. Density is a public safety factor in that a higher occupancy would result
    in an exposure of more people to a hazard. Therefore, from a public
    safety point of view, lower density is preferred.
15. As public safety problems such as fires and crime appear to be
    correlated with socio-economic factors, efforts should be made to
    improve opportunities for better education, employment, and self-
    improvements.
16. Accessibility is essential for fire-fighting and rescue vehicles, thus it is
    imperative that adequate street width be allowed for such equipment.
    At least two directions of ingress and egress should be available to all
    structures or grouping of structures. This allows people to leave an
    endangered area, while fire-fighting equipment may be entering the
    area simultaneously.
17. In terms of industrial growth, the City should strive to attract the least
    hazardous types of industries.
18. Setback requirements, open space allowances, and adequate off-
    street parking facilities are three pertinent factors, which directly affect
    the intensity of land use. The problems associates with intensive land
    use and property coverage are evident in areas zoned R-4. While
    zoning involves the consideration of numerous other factors, fire safety
    should be a major factor influencing any changes in the existing zoning
    regulations.
                                  Page 116
19. New development should be responsive to seismic considerations.
    (See Seismic Safety Element).
20. Pre-1933 structures should continue to be the first priority for recycling.
21. Crime is associated with an unstable population element and efforts
    should be made in the planning process to encourage developments
    that would tend to stabilize an area.
22. Special considerations should be given to the needs of senior citizens,
    particularly in the downtown area. Specific areas should be
    designated in the land use allocation model for development of senior
    citizen centers, which could include residential and localized
    commercial uses. Public transportation should be readily available to
    allow access to other areas of the City.
23. In terms of crime prevention, access to recreation areas appears to be
    of greater concern than the design of a park or recreation site.
    Therefore, public access to parks and other urban uses should be
    designed in such a manner that surveillance is enhanced. On-street
    parking, foyers, and similar enclaves should be minimized.
24. In most high crimes areas, much criminal activity actually occurred at
    certain, limited spots where opportunity was best. These locations
    should be identified and corrected in terms of the land usage.
25. In Multi-family structures design provisions should be made to allow for
    mutual surveillance. Common areas and entranceways should be well
    lighted and in open view.
26. Improved street lighting and pedestrian path illumination should be
    provided in public areas.
27. Abandoned and condemned buildings should be demolished to reduce
    availability to potential law violators.
28. Parking garages should be located in close proximity to activity
    centers.
                                  Page 117
29. Public areas should be improved so as to attract increased numbers of
    people and promote high activity levels, thereby increasing the number
    of observers, which promotes increased safety.
30. Activity nodes should be centralized so as to avoid isolated crime
    opportunities.
31. Neighborhood identity should be enhanced to encourage cohesion, so
    that potential violators might be more easily identified.
32. Landscaping that would hinder visibility or increase user fear should be
    avoided.
33. To assure comprehensive project review, Police Department personnel
    should become even more involved in the planning and development
    process. Proposed developments, street alterations, public facilities,
    and other similar projects should not be implemented without input
    from police personnel.
34. Consideration should be given to incorporating security factors into the
    existing building code. The inclusion of such security considerations is
    particularly important for developments in areas, which are
    experiencing an increasing rate of serious crimes.
35. Industrial land uses should be isolated or well buffered from any
    adjoining residential uses.
36. Through physical planning and spatial design (e.g. setbacks, or natural
    barriers), an effort should be made to buffer all urban uses from routes
    designated for transporting dangerous fluids, chemicals, or explosives.
37. Above ground fuel storage facilities should not be located in close
    proximity to the flight pattern at the Long Beach Airport.
38. Through the media, public education programs, citizen participation,
    and other lines of communication, a greater dissemination of safety
    information should be implemented.
                                  Page 118
39. It is recommended that the City encourage the use of new technology
    in the area of Public Safety.

                         NATURAL DISASTERS IN LONG BEACH
                  FIRE        EARTHQUAKE           FLOOD       FIRES
       Destructive fires are an ever-present danger. There are specific things
that can be done, however, to prevent fires and to control fire.
                                      WHAT TO DO
IN YOUR HOME
       IF - you suspect that any part of your house may be on fire
       DO NOT open an inside door without first placing palm of hand against it
       IF - there is heat OR
       IF you see smoke seeping around the edge
       DO NOT open the door! You could be overcome by smoke, heat or
flames.
       IF – the fire is out of control
       Get away from the danger…ESCAPE…then call the Fire Department.
                       Keep the telephone number of your fire department near
                       your phone.
                       Be sure to give the fire department the correct address of the
                       fire.
                       Have heating appliances checked at least once a year.
                       Check correct size and use of extension cords.
                       Keep matches and lighters our of children’s reach.
                       Don’t let children play in canyons.

                             APPENDIX A – CONTINUED
                      Use and store flammable liquids correctly.
                      Don’t smoke in bed.
       IF – your clothing catches on fire….DO NOT RUN….
                      Wrap yourself in a blanket or rug…and roll.
       IF – you must rescue someone in a room that is on fire
                      Wrap a wet handkerchief, towel or similar article, around
                      your face, open the door cautiously, and keep as close to the
                      floor as possible, crawl to the victim. Then remove him to
                      safety, remaining close to the floor.
       IF – you detect the fire in time and can control it, use the following
methods to extinguish the blaze:
              1. Put out Electrical, Grease, Oil or Gasoline fires by smothering
                  with handfuls of SALT, BAKING SODA, SAND or DIRT.
                           a.    Never use flour………it’s Explosive!
                           b.    Never use water on Grease, Oil or Gasoline fires.
                                 It will only spread them!
                           c.    Don’t throw water on electrical fires until electrical
                                 fires until electricity has been first shut off at
                                 master switch or fuse box.
              2. Extinguish burning paper, rags or other non-oily trash fires by
                  throwing water at the base of the flames.
OUTDOORS
       IF – your neighbor’s property is on fire, help prevent its spreading by
wetting the roof of your house and garage with the garden hose.
                                          Page 124

                            APPENDIX A – CONTINUED
       IF – your house, garage or other building are on fire, call your Fire
Department, then try to keep it under control by using your garden hose. (It is
wise to have sufficient hose to reach any portion of your house or other buildings
on your property.)
BRUSH FIRES
              1.     Keep the area around your property clear of trash and
                     rubbish.
              2.     Keep a supply of gunnysacks handy. When wet, they will
                     aid in fighting fires.
              3.     Surround your property with Ice Plants. It is a big help in
                     controlling the spread of fires.
              4.     If there is a fire in your neighborhood, keep the exterior of
                     your buildings as wet as possible until the Fire Department
                     arrives.
              5.     Do not hesitate to leave for safer areas when advised to do
                     so by Fire Department officials.
FIRE FIGHTING TIPS
              1.     Give your house and yard a good cleaning.
              2.     Keep plenty of water on hand.

                                   EARTHQUAKES
        A major earthquake must be considered as an ever-present possibility
here, even though none has occurred in recent years. Two-thirds of the
earthquake activity in the United States is centered in the Pacific coastal ranges
and mostly in California.
WHAT TO DO
        IF INDOORS, STAY INDOORS
        Take cover under a desk, table, or bench, or in doorways, halls, or against
inside walls. Stay away from glass windows or skylights. DO NOT run
outdoors!! Your may be hit by falling debris or live electrical wires.
        IF OUTDOORS, GET AWAY FROM BUILDINGS
        Go to clear areas and stay away from walls, utility poles and downed wires
that could cause serious injury or death.
        KEEP CALM – USE COMMON SENSE
        DO NOT run through or outside buildings. The greatest point of danger is
just outside doorways and close to outer walls.
IN CASE OF FIRE
        Call the Fire Department. Then take what steps you can to control the fire
until help arrives.
DO NOT TURN OFF UTILITIES
        (Gas, water, and electricity) unless the lines are damaged. If broken pipes
or wires are found, take the following steps:
                                        Page 126

                             APPENDIX A – CONTINUED
        WATER – if pipes are broken inside the house, shut off main valve on
pipe bringing the water into the house.
        ELECTRICITY – If the house is properly wired, trouble is very unlikely. If
you are sure there is a short circuit, turn off electricity at meter box by pulling
switch.
        GAS – If gas pipes are broken inside the house, close valve at meter and
call your gas company. Only the Gas Company should reopen meter to prevent
explosions.
                                       FLOODS
Floods in Southern California are not expected every year as they are in other
parts of North America. However, the records show that flood conditions could
hit Long Beach.
WHAT TO DO
        During heavy rains, check your floor furnace often. If it becomes flooded,
turn off the pilot light and main burner. Remove water as soon as possible by
using a pump, siphon or by bailing.
        IF – The water rises above floor level, turn off electricity at main switch. If
water enters wall or floor plug-ins, a short circuit may result, causing a fire.
        IF – You have any suspicion that water coming from the faucets has been
contaminated, be sure that it is purified before use. Purify by boiling, use of
purification tablets, or adding ten drops of household bleach per gallon of water
and allow to stand for 30 minutes. (If tablets are used, follow instructions on
package.)
        IF – The area in which you live is so badly flooded as to make escape
impossible, move your emergency food, water supply, and blankets to an upper
                                        Page 127

                             APPENDIX A – CONTINUED
floor or to the roof. Keep calm and wait for rescue. Do not hesitate to leave for
safer areas when advised to do so.
        Note: Sandbags may be useful in protecting your property from
floodwaters. You should maintain supply if you live in low area.
DRIVING IN FLOODED STREETS
        IF – The brakes on your car are wet, they are useless. You can keep
them relatively dry by keeping light pressure on the brake pedal while going
through shallow water. Avoid driving on flooded streets or highways. Particularly
avoid dips and low places.
                                     CAUTION
                       KEEP AWAY FROM DISASTER AREAS
DO –
                  Turn on television or radio for information and instructions. (Use
                  your automobile or portable battery powered radio if electrical
                  service is discontinued.)
                  Keep flashlight handy.
                  Know the telephone number of your family doctor or nearest one
                  available in case of need.
                  Learn simple first aid procedures.
DO NOT –
                  Use candles, matches or other open flames.
                  Enter damaged building until they have been inspected and
                  approved by the Department of Building and Safety.
                  Make unnecessary phone calls.
