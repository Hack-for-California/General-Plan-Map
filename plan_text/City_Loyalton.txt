1.   HOUSING ELEMENT INTRODUCTION
The Housing Element is an integral component of the City’s General Plan. It addresses existing
and future housing needs of all types for persons of all economic groups in the City. The
housing element is a tool for use by citizens and public officials in understanding and meeting
the housing needs in Loyalton.
The State of California (“State”) has mandated a Housing Element as one of seven required
elements of every General Plan since 1969. Article 10.6, Section 65580 – 65589.8, Chapter 3 of
Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code sets forth the legal requirements of the Housing
Element and encourages the provision of affordable and decent housing in all communities to
meet statewide goals.
California Government Code § 65580 states the element shall consist of:
         . . . An identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a
         statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, financial resources and
         scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement, and development of
         housing.
The Housing Element must also contain a five-year housing plan with quantified objectives for
the implementation of the goals and objectives of the Housing Element. The contents of the
Housing Element must be consistent with all elements of the General Plan.
Meeting the housing needs established by the State of California is an important goal for the
City of Loyalton. As the population of the State continues to grow and scarce resources decline,
it becomes more difficult for local agencies to create adequate housing opportunities while
maintaining a high standard of living for all citizens in the community. State law recognizes that
housing needs may exceed available resources and, therefore, does not require that the City's
quantified objectives be identical to the identified housing needs. Recognizing policy limitations
is critical, especially during this period of financial uncertainties in both the public and private
sectors.
According to California Government Code Section 65583(b) (2) it is recognized that the total
housing needs may exceed available resources and the communities’ ability to satisfy the need.
Under these circumstances, the quantified objectives need not be identical to the identified
existing housing needs but should establish the maximum number of housing units that can be
constructed, rehabilitated, and conserved over a five-year time frame.
This Housing Element (2014-19) was developed in compliance with State General Plan
law pertaining to Housing Elements.
     City of Loyalton Housing Element               1              Adopted June 16, 2015

1.1 Housing Element Purpose
The State of California has declared that “the availability of housing is of vital statewide
importance and the early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for
every California family is a priority of the highest order.” Cooperation between government and
private enterprise is essential to accommodate regional housing needs. Each Housing Element
is developed by creating a dialogue within that particular community to determine the
community goals and policies that should control in the provision of housing.
State Housing Element law requires an assessment of housing needs and an inventory of
resources and constraints relevant to the meeting of these needs (California Government Code
§65583).
         The State Law requires the following:
         1.       Analysis of population and employment trends.
         2.       Analysis of the City’s fair share of the regional housing needs.
         3.       Analysis of household characteristics.
         4.       Inventory of suitable land for residential development.
         5.       Analysis of the governmental and non-governmental constraints on the
                  improvement, maintenance and development of housing.
         6.       Analysis of special housing needs.
         7.       Analysis of opportunities for energy conservation.
         8.       Analysis of publicly-assisted housing developments that may convert to non-
                  assisted housing developments.
         9.       Analysis of the housing stock and identification of any housing units that are in
                  need of rehabilitation, or substantial repair.
         10.      Comprehensive program for implementation.
The purpose of these requirements is to develop an understanding of the existing and projected
housing needs within the community as well as to set forth policies and schedules which
promote preservation, improvement and development of diverse types and costs of housing
throughout Loyalton.
Recent legislation pertinent to the preparation of the housing element and housing element law
includes the following:
1.          AB 1866 (Second Units),
2.         SB 1087 (Water and Sewer Service Priority for Affordable Housing),
     City of Loyalton Housing Element                2               Adopted June 16, 2015

3.         SB 2 (Local Planning and Approval for Emergency Shelters),
4.         AB 2348 (Land Inventory Requirements),
5.         AB 1233 (Provision of Adequate Sites for RHNP),
6.         AB 2511 (promotes the development of affordable housing),
7.         AB 2634 (requires analysis of population and employment trends for all income levels,
           including extremely low-income households),
8.         SB 812 (requires analysis of housing needs for the developmentally disabled),
9.         SB1087 (requires objectives, policies and standards for allocation of water and sewer
           services for affordable housing developments) and
10.        SB 244 (requires review of disadvantaged communities within the City’s Sphere of
           Influence).
This updated Housing Element has been prepared to respond to all of these changes in
legislation.
1.2 Housing Element Organization
Loyalton’s Housing Element is organized into three sections as follows:
         1.     Summary of Existing Conditions:
This section includes an inventory of resources, housing costs and affordability, at-risk units,
suitable land for development, and a section discussing constraints, efforts and opportunities.
         2.     Housing Needs, Issues/Trends:
This section includes a discussion of state issues and policies, regional housing policies, and
Loyalton’ s Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) and housing issues.
         3.     Housing Program:
This section identifies housing goals, objectives, policies and programs. Funding sources are
identified and schedules for implementation are set forth. In addition, a quantified objectives
summary is provided.
     City of Loyalton Housing Element             3             Adopted June 16, 2015

1.3 Housing Element Relationship to Other Elements
State law requires that “…the General Plan and elements and parts thereof comprise an
integrated, internally consistent, and compatible statement of policies…” Section 65300.5 of the
Government Code states that the general plan and the parts and elements thereof shall
comprise an integrated and internally consistent and compatible statement of goals. The
purpose of requiring internal consistency is to avoid policy conflict and provide a clear policy
guide for the future maintenance, improvement and development of housing within the City.
This Housing Element will be part of the comprehensive Loyalton General Plan which was
adopted in 2008. Pursuant to Government Code Section 65200.5, this Housing Element Update
was reviewed and found to be internally consistent with other elements of the current 2008
General Plan.
1.4 Housing Element Citizen Participation
Public participation in preparation of the Housing Element is required under
Government Code Section 65588(c). This housing element was developed through the
combined efforts of City staff, the City Council, and the City's consultant. Public input
was received through a public workshop conducted on August 13, 2014. The City
Council offered several comments, but no one from the public made comments.
Subsequently, a public hearing was conducted by the City Council on June____, 2015.
Notices were both e-mailed and sent through the U.S. mail to public agencies as
referenced in Appendix A of this document. In addition, some organizations, that
represent interests of low-income and special needs households, such as the Plumas
County Community Development Commission and the Sierra Economic Development
Corporation, were contacted during the preparation of this element as specified above.
To comply with Senate Bill 18, the City consulted the Native American Heritage
Commission and various Native American Tribes on the City’s list. No comments or
requests for consultations were made by any of the tribes on the list.
The draft Housing Element has been available in City Hall and was posted on the City’s
website for review and comments.
The City will continue to engage the community through the adoption and
implementation of the element. The City will make diligent efforts to engage the
community in the progress of the housing element implementation, including specifically
contacting developers, service providers and other community interests to gather
comments, consider them and revise or adjust the housing element and programs as
appropriate.
Further details of this Public Participation Program can be found in “Appendix A” of this
document.

1.5      City of Loyalton Background
The City of Loyalton is located in the eastern portion of Sierra County, in the northeast quadrant
of the State of California. Loyalton is a General Law City, incorporated in 1901, and is the only
incorporated city in Sierra County. The City covers approximately 225 acres, with an east-west
width two-thirds of a mile, and a north-south width of one-half miles. Loyalton is governed by a
five-member City Council, where one of members serves as Mayor.
The climate in Loyalton is characteristic of the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada and is
generally described as semi-arid. Summers are commonly dry, with moderate to high daytime
temperatures and cool nights.
Winters are typically wet, with an average annual rainfall of approximately 25-30 inches per
year. Almost all precipitation falls between November and May, most in the form of snow. Winter
temperatures often fall below 32º F. Moderate to high winds occur during the summer months
and strong down slope winds are not uncommon. Thunderstorms are also common during the
summer.
Though Loyalton receives a fair amount of snowfall, Sierra County (and Loyalton) can be
accessed year round. Highways 49 and 89 are well maintained and rarely close due to
inclement weather.
Smithneck Creek is a central feature within the City. The Creek runs south to north dividing the
City. The Creek provides essential recreational opportunities, but has also been the source of
recurring flooding.
Agricultural lands surrounding the City are important both locally and have statewide
significance. Conserving these lands is important in supporting continued economic
development and maintaining the rural character and desirability of the City.

1.6 Housing Element Priorities for Loyalton
The City of Loyalton has nine priorities for this Housing Element as follows:
1.       To maintain and improve the quality of the existing housing stock and the neighborhoods
         in which it is located.
2.       To provide for a choice of housing locations and types for all residents.
3.       To encourage the construction of special needs housing including, but not limited to,
         domestic violence issues, senior housing, disabled housing, farmworker housing and
         homeless shelters.
4.       To promote access to safe and decent housing for all economic groups.
5.       To increase the availability of affordable housing for all households in Loyalton through
         public and private channels.
6.       To manage housing and community development in a manner that will promote the long-
         term integrity and value of each new housing unit and the environment in which it is
         located.
7.       To promote energy and water conservation activities in all residential neighborhoods.
8.       To ensure that all housing programs are available without discrimination on the basis of
         race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, marital status, age, household
         composition, income, size, or any other arbitrary factor.
9.       To ensure that adequate land inventory exists to allow for production of HCD’s Regional
         Housing Needs Allocation for the City of Loyalton during this planning period (2014-
         2019).
1.7 Data and Methodology
To understand the context of local housing in Loyalton, a review and analysis of the
community's population characteristics and housing stock was performed. The primary data
source for the 2014-19 Housing Element Update is the Sierra County Housing Element Data
Package (2014 Data Package) prepared by HCD staff. Additional data sources include the U.S.
Census Bureau (2010 Census, and 2008-2012 American Community Survey (ACS), California
Department of Finance, California Employment Development Department, and other sources as
noted in the document. Data from the 2007-2011 ACS and the 2008-2012 ACS are referred to
as “2010” data. Due to the use of multiple data sources, there are slight variations in the total
population and household numbers for 2010. However, these variations do not significantly
affect the analysis and discussion of overall housing trends and changes.

2.3.2      Households by Tenure
In the City of Loyalton, the owner rate increased over the 10-year period between 2000
and 2010. In 2000, 67 percent of ownership households increased to 73 percent in
2010. The number of renters in Loyalton significantly lowered from 106 to 83 during this
same period. This reduction in renter households may have been a result of closing the
lumber mill in 2006, which at that time may have been the largest employer in Loyalton.

2.3.3            Households Overpaying
Households are considered to be overpaying if payment (rent or mortgage) is 30 percent or
greater than household income. Overpayment is a significant problem for lower-income
households as the proportion of their income going toward housing costs leaves less for other
necessities. Housing overpayment can also have adverse effects on the local economy, since
money going toward living expenses could otherwise support local businesses. While some
higher-income households may choose to spend greater portions of their income for housing,
the cost burden for some low-income households, especially large households, reflects choices
limited by a lack of adequate affordable housing supply. Households that pay over 30 percent of
their income towards housing are considered to be overpaying for housing. Overall, 36.7
percent of the households in the City of Loyalton are overpaying for shelter. Overpayment was
most pronounced those households with incomes in the extremely low- to the middle range of
very low-income Over 80 percent of the 37 households in the City with annual incomes of less
than about $35,000 were paying more than 30 percent of their income for shelter.
Extremely low-income is defined as households with income less than 30 percent of area
median income. The area median income in Sierra County is $71,900. For extremely low-
income households, this results in an income of less than $21,100 for a four-person household
or less than $14,800 for a one-person household. Households with extremely low-income have
a variety of housing situations and needs. For example, most families and individuals receiving
public assistance, such as social security insurance (SSI) or disability insurance are considered
extremely low-income households. At the same time, a minimum wage worker could be
considered an extremely low-income household due to extremely low pay in relation to the cost
of living.

and renters and the cost of constructing new housing and affordability factors are discussed in
more detail in Section 2.5.9 of this document.
2.3.4       Overcrowded Households
The United States Census Bureau defines overcrowding as a housing unit in which more than
one person occupies a room (not including kitchens and bathrooms). Units with more than 1.5
persons per room are considered severely overcrowded and indicate a significant housing need.
Overcrowding increases health and safety concerns and stresses the condition of the housing
stock and infrastructure. Between 1980 and 1990, the percentage of overcrowded households
in California nearly doubled from 6.9 percent to 12.3 percent. However, this trend has been
reversed as only 8.5 percent of California households were overcrowded in 2010. According to
the 2010 Census, only 4 housing units or 1.3 percent (all of which are owner occupied) of the
occupied housing stock was overcrowded. As compared to 2000, when there were 10
overcrowded housing units, the City has experienced a significant reduction in overcrowding
over the last ten years.

2.5     Special Housing Needs
As noted in Government Code Section 65583(a)(6), within the overall housing needs
assessments there are segments of the population that require special housing needs.
Generally, these are people who are low income and have less access to housing choices.
Groups of the population that require special housing needs include the elderly, disabled,
female-headed households, large households, farmworkers, and the homeless.
2.5.1 Persons with Disabilities
There are three types of disabled persons that are considered as having special housing needs
as follows:
                              Physically Impaired
                              Mentally Disabled
                              Developmentally Disabled
Each type is unique and requires specific attention in terms of access to housing, employment,
social services, medical services and accessibility to housing. A disability is defined as a mental,
physical, or health condition that lasts over six months.
In the City of Loyalton, 21.9 percent of the population is reported as having a disability
according to the 2000 Census. Of those with a disability, 40.2 percent are employed while 59.8
percent are not employed. Seniors age 65 and over comprise 24.9 percent of the people with
disabilities. Seniors age 65 and over are considered not employed.
Housing needs of disabled persons vary depending on the nature and severity of the disability.
Physically disabled persons generally require modifications to the housing units such as
wheelchair ramps, elevators or lifts, wide doorways, accessible cabinetry, modified fixtures and
appliances. If the disability prevents the person from the operation a vehicle, then access to
services and public transportation are also important. People with severe physical and/or mental
disabilities may also require supportive housing, nursing facilities or care facilities. Because
disabilities vary, this group does not congregate toward a single service organization, making it
difficult to estimate the number of individuals and their specific needs.

The disability-by-disability type should not be used to measure the percentage of the population
that has a disability due to the fact that disabilities are not mutually exclusive; instead a person
may have multiple disabilities and therefore would be counted twice. This difference between
total number of disabilities tallied (329) and persons with disability by employment status (189)
is 140. This difference can be attributed to persons having multiple disabilities.
Of the disabilities reported, the most frequently occurring type for those ages 5 to 64 is an
employment disability while for those ages 65 and above it is a physical disability. Physical
disabilities are the second most common type of disabilities for those ages 5 to 64; while for
those ages 65 and above a go-outside-home disability is the next most frequent disability.

Persons with a disability category includes persons with developmental disabilities.
"Developmental disability" means a disability that originates before an individual attains age 18
years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial
disability for that individual.” This term includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy,
autism, and disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to require
treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but does not include
other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature. Those categorized as disabled
due to mental disorder or developmental disability of some nature do not necessarily require
physical improvements to housing. Social Services organizations offer assistance with medical
attention and counseling for those in need of these types of services.
While the Census reports on mental disabilities, which include developmental disabilities, it does
not identify the subpopulation that has a developmental disability. The California Department of
Developmental Services (DDS) maintains data regarding people with developmental disabilities.
They are defined as those with severe, life-long disabilities attributable to mental and/or physical
impairments. The DDS data is reported by zip code, so the data reflects a larger area than the
City of Loyalton, however the majority of the population within the zip code resides in Loyalton.
The DDS data indicates that approximately 6 developmentally disabled persons reside in zip
code 96118.

Severe physical or mental disability often prevents individuals from working, limits their
opportunities for job advancement, and thereby limits their income, which results in the cost of
housing being a greater concern. Many of the disabled rely solely on Social Security Income,
which would typically place them within extremely low- to very low-income categories with
market-rate housing unaffordable to these households. New multi-family housing is subject to
state and federal design requirements for disabled accessibility and is required to provide some
units specifically designed to be accessible by those with disabilities.
Senate Bill 520 (SB 520) prohibits any local governmental agency from enacting ordinances that
prohibit or discriminate against any residential development or emergency shelter because of
the method of financing or the race, sex, color, religion, ethnicity, national origin, ancestry, lawful
occupation, familial status, disability, or age of owners or intended occupants of the residential
development of the emergency shelter. Section 4 of this element identifies programs and
policies to accommodate the need for accessible housing. By providing programs that facilitate
supportive multi-family or single-family housing for the disabled in any residential zone, the City
of Loyalton will comply with SB 520. The City has updated the Zoning Code (May, 2014) to
include new Article 12.08.27, Reasonable Accommodation, to provide a procedure for persons
with disabilities seeking equal access to housing to receive relief from constraints imposed from
City zoning laws and other land use regulations, policies and procedures (refer to Appendix F,
Zoning Code Revisions).

2.5.2        Seniors
Elderly persons often age in-place; living in housing that is too expensive for their fixed incomes
or structurally does not accommodate specific needs for assistance. Even though senior citizens
may have difficulty living in their own home, they often do not have the option of mobility that is
afforded to other segments of the population. They commonly have to leave their
home/community and relocate away from family and friends once they do find a suitable unit.
The purpose of this section is to determine the housing needs for all segments of the elderly
community. The senior population is defined as persons over the age of 65 years.
According to the 2010 US Census, 26.8 percent of Loyalton’s households were above the age
of 65. Over 23 percent of the households age 65 and above were renters. Senior renters are
somewhat dependent on the quantity of housing options depending on their income.

There are some services and facilities available for senior citizens in Loyalton. The following is a
list of the current services and facilities that exist:
1.        Care Facilities:
There is one skilled nursing facility, Eastern Plumas Health Care Loyalton Campus, in the City
that is licensed to care for 39 patients. The administrator stated that the beds are designated for
the disabled or seniors who need long term assistance. The facility operates with approximately
3 vacancies per month.
The nearest additional facility is in Portola, approximately 23 miles from Loyalton. The facility
offers a variety of physical and speech therapy services, adjacent medical care, and
entertainment activities for the residents. Skilled nursing is not identified in the zoning ordinance
and a policy of the City will be to amend the zoning ordinance to identify and allow this type of
housing without a conditional use permit.
2.        Senior Housing:
The City of Loyalton does not have any senior designated housing. However just outside the
city limits is Sierra Valley Senior Apartments; an independent, affordable senior apartment
      City of Loyalton Housing Element              17            Adopted June 16, 2015

complex for use by residents of Loyalton, that was constructed in 1998 with USDA financing.
The City extends water and sewer services to this complex. Because of its close proximity to
Loyalton, Sierra Valley Senior Apartment residents are really part of the Loyalton community.
Also there are a variety of in-home care giving options provided as referenced in the Services
Section below.
3.       Services:
The Loyalton Senior Center provides a variety of services to the senior population, including
lunches served during weekdays, counselling services, information assistance and referral
services. In home services, such as care to seniors and disabled is provided by the Nevada
Sierra Regional In Home Support Services Public Authority located in Truckee, CA. Similar
services are also provided by the Western Sierra Residential Center, located in Downieville, CA.
The Sierra County Social Services Department, through the Area 4 Agency on Aging, provides
senior protective services, including money management, counselling, and out of home
placement, maintains an office is Loyalton. They promote citizen involvement in planning and
delivering programs and services necessary to ensure maximum independence and dignity for
older individuals and functionally impaired adults in Loyalton and Sierra County.
The Agency provides information regarding the following: health insurance counseling,
employment or volunteer opportunities, congregate or home-delivered meals, lists of senior
centers, adult day care, homemaker, chores, home health or personal care services, telephone
reassurance, friendly visitation, energy assistance, senior housing, legal assistance, need to
reach ombudsmen programs that help resolve complaints involving long-term care facilities, or
have elder abuse questions, we can help.
4.       Transportation:
Senior Citizens of Loyalton, Inc. operates a transportation service for senior citizens in the
Loyalton area. SCL operates a 3 passenger handicapped accessible van and transports both
within the City of Loyalton as well as occasional trips to Reno, Truckee, Sacramento and other
areas for medical service, shopping and other needs. This service is offered only for seniors.
2.5.3 Large Families
Large families are defined as households with more than five persons. In the City of Loyalton,
2.1 percent of the owner households are considered to be large families. There are no large
renter households in Loyalton. In some circumstances, where the housing market does not
meet large household housing needs, overcrowding can be a result of the lack of adequate
housing.

2.5.4 Farmworkers
The State of California defines seasonal farm laborers as those who are employed fewer than
150 consecutive days by the same employer. The State differentiates between local and
migrant seasonal farm laborers in terms of their residence—whether they reside close enough
to the job sites so that they can return to their permanent homes each night. The housing needs
of permanent farm workers are no different from those of other employment groups and consist
of housing that is affordable in relation to income, meets acceptable housing standards, and is
reasonably accessible to the site of employment. Seasonal or part-time farm workers who do
not leave the area and have to seek year-round residency in the area have similar needs; but
their income is likely to be considerably less than year-round employees, and these individuals
may require subsidized housing or employer-based housing. Seasonal migrant workers typically
have even less income available for housing because of their need to minimize expenses to
meet off-season needs. As a result, migrant farm workers may seek housing in a labor camp or
may rent an available and inexpensive unit (which may be shared among several workers). If
such housing is not available, migrant farm workers may resort to substandard shelters—
ranging from vehicles to tents or other forms of temporary shelter. Because migrant farm
workers desire to reside near the work sites, most farm worker housing should be provided in
these unincorporated areas, farm workers with reliable transportation could reside within the
City limits.
The Census groups "Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, and Mining" are lumped
together. Consequently, there is no method for separating farmworkers from other employment
groups to determine that actual number of farmworkers living in Loyalton. Based on the 2010
Census, there were 10 workers reported in Loyalton as being employed in this broad
employment category. This represents about 2.7 percent of the City’s employment force.
Therefore, farmworker housing needs are not significant in Loyalton.
No parcels in the City are used for growing agricultural crops. However, the agricultural area
around Loyalton creates a demand for both permanent agriculture workers and seasonal farm
workers. Agriculture in Sierra County is dominated by cattle ranching with very limited acreage
devoted to crops. Based on the 2012 County Agricultural Commission Report, Sierra County
ranks 56 of 58 in gross value of agricultural production in California. This report indicates that
over 99 percent of the agricultural product in Sierra County is cattle related with only 35 acres
devoted to crop production. Farms with a year-round operation have historically provided on-site
     City of Loyalton Housing Element             19            Adopted June 16, 2015

housing for their employees. There are no formal migratory labor housing facilities in Sierra
County or Loyalton.
The Zoning Code was recently updated (May 2014) to define farmworker housing and allow it in
residential districts in Loyalton and treated the same as other residential development. As noted
in Section 3 of this document) there are over 10 acres of vacant land in these residential zoning
districts that should provide sufficient inventory for future farmworker housing for typically very
low and extremely low income households. This would include permanent housing for farm
workers and their families.
The recent Code revision removes governmental constraints to the production of future potential
farmworker housing. However, most farmworkers in the area are employed in unincorporated
areas and their immediate housing needs should be addressed by Sierra County, where most of
the employment demand is located.
2.5.5 Single Parent Households
Single Parent Households: Single Parent Households have special needs in that they require
services, such as child-care if they are to be working, and often need special health care and
nutritional assistance when their incomes are such that they cannot afford to take care of their
children. Female heads of households are of even more of a concern as they generally maintain
less incomes then male heads of households. In 2010, 23 households (10.8 percent) of families
that have children, were single headed parent households. All of these households consisted of
female-headed households.
Single-parent households can benefit from the programs administered by the Sierra County
Social Services Department. These programs include the administration of the federal
CalWORKs program, the countywide food stamp program, On-The-Job-Training program, as
well as County Medical services and child protective services.
Battered women with children comprise a sub-group of female-headed households that are
especially in need. The Sierra County Social Services Department, located in Downtown
Loyalton, administers an Adult Protective Service program for victims of physical and/or mental
abuse where people can obtain information regarding assistance including shelter in the event
they find themselves homeless.

2.5.6 Extremely Low Income
Households in the extremely low-income category have special housing needs because they
are unlikely to find market-rate housing that is affordable at any price. This section outlines the
number and percentage of extremely low-income households and actions the City may take to
better serve them. Extremely low-income (ELI) households may be homeless or in danger of
being homeless because of their inability to find appropriately priced housing. The extremely
low-income category focuses on those households that make up less than 30 percent of the
area median income, which equates to $21,100 or less for a family of four.
Over 18 percent of all households in Loyalton are paying more than 30 percent of their income
towards housing expenses. About 18 people in Loyalton with annual incomes of less than
$21,100 were paying more than 30 percent of their income for shelter. That constitutes over 90
percent of this extremely low-income category. Because of these cost burdens, extremely low-
income households may require specific housing solutions, including subsidies, housing with
supportive services, shared housing, and/or single-room occupancy units.
The homes of the ELI residents who own their homes are very likely to be in extremely poor
condition. The City currently has 19 housing units in mobile home parks. The majority of the
renters with incomes below the poverty line live in these parks. Several of these residents are
expected to be living on welfare.
For extremely low and very low-income families who need rental assistance, the Section 8
Rental Assistance program provides a limited number of housing vouchers to those that qualify
and are accepted into the program. Vouchers, in the form of direct payment to the property
owner are provided to tenants to fill in the financial gap between what they can afford to pay and
the market rate of the rental unit. The Plumas County Community Development Commission
and Housing Authority, located in Quincy, administers this program for Sierra County, including
the City. They indicated that 3 families in Loyalton are being served by this program (2014).
There is a waiting list of at least 25 families in Loyalton for this program. The waiting list has
been closed due to funding constraints. This all indicates there is a strong demand for housing
subsidies for extremely low-income families in Loyalton.
There currently is no publically assisted or public financed housing located in Loyalton’s
jurisdictional boundaries. However, the Sierra Valley Senior Apartments, located at 100 Hill
Street, is a public housing project, and is located adjacent to the City. This complex provides 48
rent restricted units to a number of seniors in the Loyalton community. Lower income seniors in
need of this type of housing, are often referred to this project by the City. Those who live at this
apartment complex, become part of the Loyalton community, as they have to travel through
town to get to their homes and, due to its proximity to the City, they use City services and
facilities. Program 1-3-2c of this Plan provides that the City encourage Sierra County to
negotiate an extension to the affordability rental restrictions with the property owner that are due
to expire on October 1, 2018. Also, to reduce constraints to the production of housing for lower
income families in Loyalton, including those with extremely low incomes, the City amended the
Zoning Code in May, 2014 to include the following (refer to Appendix F, Zoning Code
Amendment Excepts):
      City of Loyalton Housing Element            21              Adopted June 16, 2015

1. To comply with AB 1866, provided for secondary dwellings as allowed in all residential
    zoning districts.
2.    To comply with SB 2, allow emergency housing shelters in R-2 Zoning Districts.
3. To comply with SB 2, allow transitional and supportive housing in all residential   zoning
    districts subject to the same standards and other residential uses.
4.    Allow manufactured housing in residential zoning districts.
5.    Provided for Single Room Occupancy units in R-2 and commercial zoning districts.
2.5.7 Homeless Population
Homeless individuals, generally in the extremely low-income category, include, but are not
limited to victims of domestic violence, persons with mental illness, persons suffering from
addiction, families with single heads-of-household, and unaccompanied minors. Homeless also
include individuals who have purchased parcels of land, but are unable to afford site
improvements or a home (and are often found living year-round in tents, small trailers, or other
permanent camp-type arrangements). The homeless do not include individuals imprisoned or
otherwise detained pursuant to an Act of Congress or a State law (U.S. Code Section 11302).
For the purposes of the housing needs analysis, a person is considered homeless who lacks a
fixed, regular and adequate nighttime residence; and an individual who has a primary nighttime
residence that is:
      1. A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living
          accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, and transitional
          housing;
      2. An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be
          institutionalized; or
      3. A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping
          accommodation for people.
Discussions with the Sierra County Sherriff’s Office confirm that there are no permanently
homeless people in Loyalton, due primarily to cold weather in the winter. However, there are
occasionally some transient homeless that travel through Loyalton during the summer months in
the order of between 3 and 5 persons per year.
There are no permanent emergency shelters in Sierra County available to homeless people.
However, due to inclimate weather in Loyalton, there does not appear to be a demand for these
facilities. However, to reduce constraints to the development of homeless shelters (per SB 18)
the City updated the Zoning Code (in May, 2014) to allow emergency shelters in the R-2 District
and allow transitional and supportive housing in all zones that allow residential subject to the
same standards as other residential uses.
This update also allows Single Room Occupancy units in C-1 Zoning Districts. Program 1-3-1
provides City support of efforts to provide housing for extremely low income families. Program
6-2-1 targets promotion of the production of workforce infill housing in Loyalton. Program 6-1-1
provides assistance to those in need of rental housing subsidies (Section 8 Housing Vouchers).

Program 1-3-4 reserves water and sewer capacity for the future development of low income
housing in the City.
2.5.8           Disadvantaged Unincorporated Communities
Senate Bill 244, signed into law on October 7, 2011, requires that the General Plan identify and
address needs of disadvantaged communities located within the City’s Sphere of Influence,
“fringe areas” outside the City’s jurisdictional boundaries (unincorporated areas). Under Local
Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) Cortese-Knox-Hertz Code Section 56033.5, a
disadvantaged community is defined to mean inhabited territory (12 or more registered voters),
or as determined by LAFCO policy, that constitutes all or a portion of a "disadvantaged
community," which is defined in the Water Code (§79505.5) to be "a community with an annual
median household income (MHI) that is less than 80 percent of the statewide annual median
household income.”. There are no disadvantaged communities within Loyalton’s Sphere of
Influence. Therefore, the City is not required to further analyze or update the Housing or Land
Use Elements of the General Plan as provided in SB 244.
2.5.9      Availability of Affordable Housing
Housing affordability, for the purpose of housing element analysis, is a function of two primary
factors:
     1. The proportion of total income a household is able to reasonably be expected to expend
          on housing costs and still meet other essential needs (e. g., the “overpayment”
          threshold); and
     2. The cost of available housing, in the form of mortgage payments and taxes for owner
          occupants or monthly rent.
Section 2.3.3 of this document on households overpaying for housing explained how various
household income categories were developed ranging from extremely low to above moderate
income. This analysis of housing affordability considers the affordability level for all very low-
income and low-income households as 30% of gross income. The affordability level for
moderate- and above-moderate-income households was assumed to be 35 percent of gross
income.
The determination of housing affordability within each defined income category is based on a
household’s annual income and the number of persons in that household. Table 6 (Section
2.3.3 on Households Overpaying) provides the annual income limits for each income category
for households of various sizes. Affordability of housing for each income category is typically
based on income limits for a four-person household. (Note: These income levels have been
established by the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) as limits
for qualification for certain state programs and do not necessarily reflect household incomes
within the City of Loyalton).
Table 16 identifies the income range and corresponding affordable monthly payment for each
income category.

a average sales price a household with a 10 percent down payment would pay a monthly
mortgage of about $465 and would, therefore, need to have annual income of around $16,740,
based on a 30 percent front-end or loan-to-income ratio and a conventional 30-year mortgage
taken out at a 7 percent interest rate, with 1.25 percent property tax and 0.5 percent mortgage
insurance. This income requirement would make housing affordable to households in the Very
Low Income and in some cases Extremely Low Income households. This calculation assumes
that the household could provide a 10 percent down payment and does not have a large
outstanding consumer debt (i.e. credit cards, revolving loans, or car loans).
Renters: Based on the monthly rental rates given in Table 18 and the HUD affordability standard
of rent plus utilities being equal to 33 percent of gross income, a household would need to earn
approximately $19,800 a year to afford a mid-priced apartment. Therefore, apartments can be
made available to extremely low income households in Loyalton. House rentals range between
$750 and $1,000 a month requires an annual gross household income of between $27,000 and
$36,000 depending on the size of the house. Therefore, house rentals can be made available to
Very Low to Low Income households. The least costly rentals in Loyalton are mobile homes
which rent for an average of $275 per month which requires a gross annual income of at least
$9,900. Mobile homes, therefore, are affordable to Extremely Low and Very Low Income
Households.

A.         New Construction – Market Rate Affordability
  A.1.          Purchase
No large-scale residential development has occurred in the City on which an analysis of new
construction affordability could be based. Also, no new infill housing was built during the 2009-
14 planning period. However, in discussions with several local housing contractors and based
on estimated fees, a new infill single-family house in Loyalton would cost approximately
$191,402 to construct (Refer to Table 20). Based on a ten percent down payment, with a seven
percent fixed rate 30 year mortgage, the monthly cost of a new single family unit would be about
$1,300 per month. The current market monthly rental rate for a single family house is about
$1,000. Consequently, there currently is no profit incentive to build single family rental housing
in Loyalton. Exceptions to this would be the construction of housing by non-profit housing
     City of Loyalton Housing Element             25            Adopted June 16, 2015

developers. Habitat for Humanity, a non-profit affordable housing development agency, for
example, could construct lower income ownership houses in the City. This program requires
future lower-income owners to cooperate in constructing their own homes on lots that have
been donated to the agency at greatly reduced costs so they are able to afford their own homes.
A typical house for this program, if the land and labor is donated, would be about $105,000. At
this lower monthly production cost, lower income households could afford to purchase new
single family housing in Loyalton.
   A.2.          Multiple Family Construction
The City did not experience any multi-family residential development within the 2009-14
planning period. However, based on further discussion with local building contractors and
estimated fees for new apartment development, a typical cost was developed for comparative
purposes. Table 19 indicates that if a market multiple family complex was constructed in
Loyalton it would cost $117,870 to build one unit (within a four unit complex). Monthly rental
rates of at least $1,400 would be necessary to recoup this investment. Although Loyalton has a
very limited multiple family housing market, typical rents for existing units are about $550.
Consequently, there is currently no profit incentive for the development of new market rate
multiple family units in Loyalton. Any meaningful construction of new multiple family housing in
Loyalton would have to be subsidized to be made available to lower income households.

   A.3.         Assisted Housing Developments
Affordable housing is typically provided through government funding of rental housing. Rental
restrictions on this level of affordable housing is normally applied to assure rental rates are
maintained at an affordable level. The Housing Element must disclose the City’s supply of this
type of housing and report the status of any of this assisted housing development as to whether
or not it is at risk of converting to market rate housing. The City of Loyalton does not have any
assisted housing development.
3.    LOYALTON HOUSING NEEDS, ISSUES AND TRENDS
3.1 Regional Housing Needs Assessment - RHNA
Regional growth needs are defined as the number of units that would have to be added in each
jurisdiction to accommodate the forecasted household growth by different income categories. It
is also recognized as the number of units that would have to be compensated for anticipated
demolitions and changes to achieve an “ideal” vacancy rate. Construction needs are derived
from the Sierra County population and household growth projections. The income group
proportions are then applied toward the construction need, which results in a goal for the
number of housing units to be developed by income group within the City of Loyalton.
The RHNA distributes the future housing need by four income categories:
                    extremely low income (less than 30 percent AMI)
                    very low income (30% to 50 percent of the area median income)
                    low (51 to 80 percent)
                    moderate (81 to 120 percent)
                    above moderate (more than 120 percent)
In 2014, the median income for a four-person household, according to HUD, in Sierra County
was $71,800. State Law requires quantification of the needs of Extremely Low Income
individuals and families in Housing Elements. The table below breaks down various income
levels by income groups:

* Sierra County Regional Housing Need Allocation Plan provides for 1 Very-Low income unit for the
2014-19 planning period. Very-low income has been further divided into the Housing Element to include
Very Low Income and Extremely Low Income. Therefore, the City has allocated this to 1 unit of Very Low
income and no units for Extremely Low Income which meets the minimum requirement by State Law.
3.2          Available Land to Accommodate Future Housing Needs
3.2.1    Analysis of Zoning that Facilitates Development for Lower Income Housing
General Plan
Residential growth areas and densities are among issues and policies addressed in the 2008
General Plan (including the 2008-13 Housing Element Update). Residential densities are
specified for each residential land use designation, and the 2008 General Plan provides for a
wide range of residential densities. Single-family detached housing densities range from four to
six dwellings per acre. Multifamily densities, including but not limited to, attached and zero lot
line types, are up to 20 units per acre. The General Plan (being updated concurrently with this
Housing Element Update) includes programs to accommodate future housing growth needs
(refer to Appendix F). Several programs in this Plan have been implemented to address future
housing growth needs for a range of income levels. Figure 2 presents the City’s General Plan
Land Uses including various areas designated residential use and development. With adoption
of the Housing Element Update, the Land Use Element will be updated to address higher
density needs within the Medium Density Residential land use designation to make the General
Plan fully consistent with the Zoning Code. In accordance with California Government Code
Section 65583, the City’s default density standard in the Medium Density Residential land use
designated properties (outside the 100 Year Floodplain) is a minimum 16 units per acre.
Consequently, new criteria in Medium Density Residential has been revised from 12 to 16 units
per acre. Applying this to existing vacant land in this area will assure future higher default
density mandates by the State of California are complied with by the City of Loyalton.
In accordance with California Government Code Section 65589.7, the Health and Safety
Element has been amended to prioritize and reserve future water and sewer service for lower
income households.

Zoning
Title VIII of the Loyalton Zoning Ordinance sets forth the zoning provisions for the City. The
Ordinance was last amended in May 2014 to address housing related State statutes and to
implement (refer to Appendix G). The California Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) reviewed the draft Zoning Code Amendment document and found it to
comply with State Housing Law. To further reduce constraints to developing future housing, and
more affordable housing, amendments to the Zoning Code include:
         Defining supportive and transitional housing and allowing these uses
          under the same provisions as other housing within various residential
          zoning districts.
         Defining emergency housing and allowing it by right in R-2 Zoning District.
         New provisions for Single Room Occupancy development.
          Defining secondary dwelling units and allowing them by right in the R-1,
          Single Family Residential Zoning District.
         Defining manufactured housing and allowing these by right in the R-1,
          Single Family Residential Zoning District.
         Added new section to allow density bonuses.
         Added new section addressing reasonable accommodation.
 The 2014 Zoning Code for the City of Loyalton includes the following
descriptions:
5-1 “R-1, Single Family Residential” or “PD, Planned Development”
This Residential Zone will allow up to 7 residential units per gross acre. Development
standards have been added to this district that includes allowances to varied building
setbacks and lots widths, which should result in allowing a greater variety of building
designs and densities. However, some additional design requirements have been
added, such as varied façade, fencing and driveway designs to improve the appearance
of new residential structures. These additional design provisions are not expected to
significant effect the production of new housing,
5-2 R-2 Multiple Family Residence District
This zone permits a variety of residential development based on minimum density
standards specified in the General Plan. In areas located outside the 100 Year
Floodplain, minimum density is 16 units per acre. Development guidelines have been
added to enhance the appearance of future residential development including
considering minimum roof pitch, minimum roof overhangs, providing patio covers, and
screening of HVAC units. None of these multifamily development standards are
      City of Loyalton Housing Element          29             Adopted June 16, 2015

expected to constrain the development of affordable housing, because housing
providers typically meet, or exceed, these minimum standards.
5-3 Commercial Land Use Designation (CC)
The Commercial Land Use Designation includes high activity land uses. These include retail,
service, repair and storage uses. New provisions were added to encourage housing, such as
mixed use, single room occupancy, multiple family and single family housing as allowed.

General Development Policies Relating to All Residential Land Use Categories
Residential growth areas and densities are among issues and policies addressed in the
General Plan. Residential densities are specified for each residential land use
designation, and the 2008 General Plan provides for a wide range of residential densities.
Single-family detached housing densities range from four to six dwellings per acre.
Multifamily densities, including but not limited to, attached and zero lot line types, are up
to 20 units per acre.
Planned Development districts will allow for the use of special design criteria for maximum
utility of the site and to allow maximum design flexibility within density limitations. These
limitations will be determined by the City using acceptable planning practices and
standards. Within these project areas special residential development such as clustering
and density transfers are encouraged. Planned development areas are allowed in all the
residential districts with a conditional use permit.
The City’s development standards are applicable to residential zoning districts.
Development standards include, but are not limited to, building height, yard setbacks, lot
area, site plan review, parking space requirements, and parkland requirements. These
requirements were adopted through the public hearing process at City Council meetings
and reflect the minimum standards thought necessary for protection of the public.
When a developer proposes a housing development, State Law requires that the City
provide incentives for the production of low-income housing. In accordance with California
Government Code Section 65915, the City of Loyalton provides density bonuses to
qualified residential projects as described in the Zoning Code.
3.2.2       Analysis of Suitability: Physical and Environmental
The City will continue to meet with the development community to ensure that the available
multifamily land is sufficient to meet market demand, will monitor zone change requests, will
monitor demand at the time of the Annual Update as required by the Governor’s Office of
Planning and Research (OPR), and will initiate zone changes, including annexations, as
necessary to meet demand. In addition the City will make sure that the Low and Very low-
income housing needs are monitored and met.
The City will encourage universal design which is an approach to the design of products,
services and environments to be useable by as many people as possible regardless of age,
ability or circumstance. Universal design strives to be a broad-spectrum solution that helps
everyone, not just people with disabilities. Moreover, it recognizes the importance of how things
look. Examples of universal design are as follows: smooth ground surfaces of entranceways,
without stairs; wide interior doors and hallways; lever handles for opening doors rather than
twisting knobs; light switches with large flat panels rather than small toggle switches.
3.2.3       Availability of Infrastructure /Adequate Sites
The City of Loyalton can supply water and sewer services to all areas within the City limits.
According to the General plan Land Use Element; the City of Loyalton has enough water and
sewer existing capacity to accommodate the City’s regional housing needs allocation. In
      City of Loyalton Housing Element            31              Adopted June 16, 2015

accordance with California Government Code Section 65589.7, the Health and Safety Element
has been amended to prioritize and reserve future water and sewer service for lower income
households. With exception of some lands located within the 100-Year Floodplain, there are no
environmental constraints such as wetlands or contamination that would inhibit developers from
building on the parcels identified in a vacant land survey that was conducted in 2014. The area
is immediately adjacent to the Smithneck Creek is within a designated Federal Emergency
Agency (FEMA) floodplain. This floodplain could be a special flood hazard area that is
inundated by a 100-year flood. The use of the land within the 100-year flood plain is regulated
by standards that require all dwelling development to be above the predicted flood elevation.
The parcels identified in the vacant land survey are characterized by flat or hilly land, and in
some areas, some grading may be required. In addition none of the identified parcels fall under
the provisions of the Williamson Act. The vacant parcels identified in the Vacant Land Inventory
(Figure 3) are of general parcel size, can accommodate the densities of the designated zoning,
and are suitable for development.
State law requires that the City provide an adequate number of sites to allow for and facilitate
production of the City’s regional share of housing. To determine whether the City has sufficient
land to accommodate its share of regional housing needs for all income groups, the City must
identify “adequate sites.” Under State law (California Government Code section 65583[c] [1]),
adequate sites are those with appropriate zoning and development standards, with services and
facilities, needed to facilitate and encourage the development of a variety of housing for all
income levels. The California Department of Housing and Community Development, in its
guidelines that interpret State law (Housing Element Questions and Answers, Question #23)
states that:
          The locality’s sites are adequate if the land inventory demonstrates sufficient
          realistic capacity at appropriate densities and development standards to permit
          development of a range of housing types and prices to accommodate the
          community's share of the regional housing need by income level. A two-part
          analysis is necessary to make this determination:
           The locality’s sites are adequate if the land inventory demonstrates:
               1. There is realistic development capacity of suitable land, which is or will be
                   served by facilities and infrastructure, accommodate the locality’s total
                   new construction need by income group over the next five years;
               2. That these available sites appropriately zoned (considering local
                   development standards and land costs) for a variety of housing types
                   (single-family, multifamily, mobile homes, etc.) and at appropriate
                   densities to facilitate the development of housing to meet the locality’s
                   regional housing need by income level category, including the need for
                   very low- and low-income households.
Residential sites identified in this section meet the criteria listed above, and are within the
definition of “adequate sites,” in accordance with State law as discussed below.
As noted in Figure 3, there are three parcels comprising a total 0.76 acres (33,106 square feet)
identified as R-2, Residential Multiple Family, that are shown to be located outside the 100 Year
Floodplain. Parcel No. 017-083-008 (0.71 acres) contains mixed zoning with 0.46 acres zoned
      City of Loyalton Housing Element               32             Adopted June 16, 2015

C-1-Commercial and 0.25 acres zoned R-2. Based on the default density of Medium Density
Residential in the General Plan for these R-2 Zoned sites, at least 12 multiple family dwelling
units would be expected to potentially be developed in Loyalton. The RHNA for this level of
housing is two units. Since these parcels are located outside the 100-Year Flood Plain, these
properties would not be constrained to be developed at this minimum density.

3.2.4    Analysis of Sites and Zoning that Facilitates Housing for Farmworkers and
         Homeless
All sites that are residentially zoned (R-1 and R-2) could accommodate housing for
farmworkers. Also, sites zoned R-2 could accommodate emergency housing facilities (allowed
use in the R-2).
Additionally, according to the Sierra County Sheriff’s Department, due to the inclement weather
in the winter there are no permanent homeless persons in the City. The Officer stated that local
churches and the regional Salvation Army provide services to these people and they do have
shelter at night.
3.2.5      Analysis of Realistic Capacity and Available Land by Zoning
The City has 9.96 acres of vacant land that can currently accommodate a maximum of 94
dwelling units with a potential and likely development yield of 53 dwelling units (refer to Table
24). The first three parcels referenced in Table 24 are zoned R-2 with no substantive
development constraints. Based on the General Plan default density requirements for these
parcels, they should generate 12 units of higher density dwelling units which are potentially
affordable by low income households. This exceeds the Regional Housing Needs Allocation for
2014-19 of one Very Low and one Low income housing unit. The remaining 41 dwelling units
shown in Table 21 that are either R-1 Zoned or are R-2 Zoned-located in the floodplain, are
shown to be allocated to Moderate and Above Moderate income households. This exceeds the
two units identified as needed in the Regional Housing Needs Allocation for Moderate and
Above Moderate Income households. This potential and likely development yield was based on
an analysis conducted on each of the 21 residentially zoned vacant parcels in the City related to
development expectations based on zoning and General Plan regulations and an evaluation of
various development constraints for each of the parcels, such as parcel size, location within a
floodplain, whether or not the parcel has mixed zoning, and applying a reasonable development.
Table 23 cross references each of the parcels identified in Figure 3 which shows all vacant
residentially zoned parcels. These conclusions also don’t take into consideration other potential
development of future residential dwellings, such as mixed use development of residential with
commercial in commercially zoned areas and the potential of developing single occupancy units
in commercial zones.

City of Loyalton Housing Element                                  36                      Adopted June 16, 2015

3.3.       Analysis of Constraints to Housing Production
The provision of adequate and affordable housing is constrained by a number of factors. This
section assesses the various markets, governmental, non-governmental and environmental
factors that may serve as potential constraints to housing development and improvement in
Loyalton.
3.3.1      Land Use Controls
The General Plan is the primary land use control document. This policy document not only
establishes the location and amount of land that will be allocated to residential development, but
also establishes the intensity of development (in terms of unit densities and total number of
units) that will be permitted. While nearly all components or elements of the General Plan
contain goals and policies that influence residential development, it is the Land Use Element
that has the most direct influence.
The zoning guide establishes and controls the type, location, and standards of residential
development in the City. The zoning regulations serve to protect and promote the health, safety,
and general welfare of the community residents and also implement the goals and policies of
the general plan.
The City of Loyalton Residential Development Standards does not contain any unduly restrictive
provisions. Building height, setbacks, lot areas, parking requirements, and design guidelines are
generally within the range of other similar sized cities in the State. None of these development
standards or guidelines is expected to constrain the development of affordable housing,
because housing providers typically meet, or exceed, these minimum standards.
The maximum height allowed in the City’s residential districts is 45 feet for multifamily zones.
This height limit is consistent with height limits of other similarly sized cities and will allow for the
maximum allowable densities to be built in the multifamily zone. The maximum lot coverage
allowed in multifamily zones is 70 percent, which allow for a builder to take advantage of the
maximum allowable densities while still maintaining the overall feel of the City of Loyalton.
Front, side and rear yard setbacks are also required of all residential development, but include
allowed variation to encourage streetscape visual interest. Parking standards require two
parking spaces for all single-family, duplex and mobile home development per dwelling unit and
a reduction to 1.5 spaces for studio apartments. Also, single occupancy units, newly introduced
to the Zoning Code in 2014, requires one space per unit.
The City of Loyalton Development Standards does not contain any unduly restrictive provisions.
Building height, setbacks, lot areas, and parking are generally within the range of other small
cities in the state. Also, development design can take advantage of the Planned Development
regulations of the Zoning Code which allows for variations to various minimum development
standards enable to maximize density. None of the development standards or guidelines in the
Zoning Code is expected to constrain the development of affordable housing, because housing
providers typically meet, or exceed, these minimum standards.
     City of Loyalton Housing Element              37               Adopted June 16, 2015

Properties located generally along the Highway 49 corridor are within the Historic Combining
District (see Figure 3). All residential projects which don’t fully comply with the use and
development standards of the Zoning Code and are within this Historic District are subject to an
administrative review by the City Council. There has been very limited use of this process. The
administrative review process has been designed to take no more than 30 days to complete. It
was not used during the 2009-14 Housing Element Planning Cycle. Projects generally comply
with the Zoning Code unless the buildings or grounds have historic significance. Therefore, this
regulation does not constrain residential development.
Properties located within the AE 100 Year Floodplain, per FEMA, generally located along both
sides of Smithneck Creek, are located within the Flood Fringe Combining District. All projects
located in this district are subject to administrative review by the City Council to assure
compliance with Chapter 19.01 of the Municipal Code regarding Floodplain Management. If the
project complies with Chapter 19.01, then the administrative review process is not applicable.
This administrative process was not used during the 2009-14 Housing Element Planning Cycle.
The administrative review process has been designed to take no more than 30 days to
complete.
The City is updating Chapter 19.01, concerning floodplain management, to comply with more
recent FEMA mapping and regulations. However, the regulations have not changed
substantively from the perspective of new housing development. Generally, the floor elevation of
development within this district must be constructed three feet higher than normal ground
elevation (above base floodplain elevation). This three foot taller construction design is
considered somewhat of a constraint on new development. Therefore, minimum density
requirements for R-2 zoned properties that are also located within this Flood Fringe Combining
District is not subject to the minimum default density requirement of 16 units per acre. This
constraint has been expressed in the development capacity analysis for future residential
development in Table 23.

3.3.2      Codes and Enforcement
Compliance with Building Code standards often adds to the cost of construction, but is seen as
necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens. Compliance results in greater
construction costs up front but ensures that the buildings retain their structural integrity. The City
of Loyalton does not have any amendments to its building codes that might diminish the ability
to accommodate persons with disabilities. However, the City’s Zoning Code, updated in 2014,
includes a new section on reasonable accommodation which allows staff to approve variations
to design to accommodate persons with disabilities and persons with developmental disabilities.
     City of Loyalton Housing Element                    39                 Adopted June 16, 2015

The City of Loyalton recently adopted the 2014 Uniform Building Code (UBC), Uniform Housing
Code, and the Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous Buildings. New structures must
conform to the standards of the UBC.
3.3.3       On/Off-site Improvement Standards
Costs associated with site improvements are an important component of new residential
development costs. Site improvements costs are applied to provide sanitary sewer and water
service to a project, to make necessary transportation improvements, and to provide other
infrastructure to the project.
Developers of new residential projects are required to construct all onsite streets, sidewalks,
curb, gutter, and may be required to contribute fair share contribution on off-site improvements
that the development may impact, such as affected portions of an offsite arterial.
Curbs, gutters and drainage facilities direct storm and runoff water out of residential
developments. City roadways are required to be paved. Pavement creates an all-weather
roadway, facilitates roadway drainage, and reduces dust. It also produces a high-speed
circulation system and facilitates relatively safe traffic movement. Roadways are classified by
the City according to traffic needs. They are as follows:
        Traditional Local Street 2 twelve foot lanes with curb, gutter and sidewalk
        Special Local Street with a 40 feet right-of-way
        Collector – 2 lanes, with a 60 feet right–of-way
        Minor Arterial Street – 2 lanes, 96 foot right-of-way
Arterials and collectors are designated on the General Plan according to existing and projected
needs. Developers of larger subdivision projects are responsible for the development of
roadways associated with the residential project. However, infill development of a residential
project may result in very limited or no development of roadways or other off-site improvements.
Development of and connection to municipal water and sewer services are required as a
condition of approving tract maps. Water service is necessary for a constant supply of potable
water. Sewer services are necessary for the sanitary disposal of wastewater. These off-site
requirements allow for the development of much higher residential densities.
3.3.4      Fees and Exactions
The City of Loyalton collects fees from new development projects to cover the costs of planning
review and processing permits, which includes plan checks and inspection fees. Further
discussion of the development permit and approval processing is provided in the next section.
A variety of development impact fees are often assessed on new residential projects that
include City controlled fees such as water and sewer hook-up fees and non-City controlled fees
(such as school impact fees and utility connection fees).
The various planning review and processing fees, development impact fees, and utility service
connection fees collectively can add significant costs on housing Table 25 illustrates the

3.3.5.      Processing and Permit Procedures
The development review and permitting process is utilized to receive, evaluate, and approve
new development applications. The development review and permitting process ensures that
new residential projects reflect the goals and polices of the General Plan and meet the intent
and requirements of the zoning code.
Applications for development permits are made in writing to the Planning Department.
Applications vary depending on the permit being requested. In addition, some planning
applications require public hearings. Various development review activities, such as general
plan amendments, rezones, and specific plans require the preparation of an environmental
document (i.e., environmental impact report, mitigated negative declaration, or negative
declaration) before a project can be approved.
The requirement to prepare an environmental document can substantially lengthen the
development review process, sometimes taking a year, or longer to obtain project approval. On
average, however, development permits are processed in less than three months. Overall, the
development permit approval processing in Loyalton does not create any unnecessary delays or
increases to the cost of housing. Table 26 shows the development plan review process for
proposed residential projects.
Total processing time for residential development projects, including multiple family units is
estimated to be one to three months. Additional time required for any other entitlements such as
CEQA review, may increase the time necessary for processing. Additional coordination required
between other agencies, such as with the County, may account for increased processing times.

 *Emergency Shelters is housing with minimal supportive services, for homeless persons that is limited to
 occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person. Single Room Occupancy is a small residential
 room designed to provide living facilities for one person. Transitional and/or Supportive Housing is
 defined as interim housing helping families move from homelessness to self-sufficiency by providing
 short-term housing (usually two years) at extremely low rent to qualified families.
3.3.6       Constraints on Persons with Disabilities
In the General Plan, the City of Loyalton shall conscientiously and specifically implement and
monitor compliance with Section 65583 (a) (4) and Section 65583 (c) (3) of the Government
Code in the review of its General Plan, zoning ordinances, development codes, construction
and reconstruction regulations, and in the development and rehabilitation of multifamily and
single family homes.
Supportive, transitional, multifamily, or single-family housing for the disabled and persons with
developmental disabilities is allowed in all zones that allow residential uses subject to the same
development/design requirements for residential development.
3.3.7       Constraints on Special Needs Housing
Persons with special needs include those who are disabled, persons with developmental
disabilities, persons in residential care facilities, farm workers, persons in need of transitional
shelter or transitional living arrangements, and single-room-occupancy units. The Housing
Element must analyze potential and actual constraints upon the development, maintenance,
and improvement of housing for these groups. The County must also demonstrate efforts to
remove constraints to housing for these groups, and provide reasonable accommodations for
housing designed for those with special needs. The County’s provisions for these housing types
are discussed below.
      City of Loyalton Housing Element                43               Adopted June 16, 2015

A.   Housing for Person with Disabilities
SB 520 – Government Constraints and Persons with Disabilities
State Planning and Zoning Law requires a housing element to make adequate provision for the
housing needs of all economic segments of the community, to include, among other things, an
analysis of the special housing needs of the disabled, including those with developmental
disabilities, and a program to address, remove constraints to, and promote housing to
accommodate the disabled. The following is a discussion that supplements the governmental
constraints section above.
B.   Siting and Concentration Requirements
As discussed above, the City has analyzed its land use, zoning and building code provisions
and processes to determine what accommodations and constraints exist to housing production
for persons with disabilities, including those with developmental disabilities. Individuals within
this special needs group may reside in residential or community care facilities units in any
zoning district that allows residential uses. Some may choose to reside in a licensed residential
community care facility designed for occupancy by or with supportive services for persons with
disabilities. The zoning ordinance does not differentiate between related and unrelated persons
in the occupancy of residential units. Pursuant to state law, the zoning ordinance allows group
homes of six or fewer persons by right in all residential zoning districts that permit single-family
residences. The zoning ordinance includes no restriction as to minimum distances between
residential care facilities.
C. Special Accommodations for Persons with Disabilities
The City recognizes that access to a residence can require special accommodations for persons
with physical disabilities that limit their mobility, particularly when the access features are
retrofitted to existing units. A zoning ordinance provision, which allows open porches, platforms
or landing places and the associated ramps to encroach into setback areas facilitates external
retrofits for access. (Note: a building permit is not required for access ramps when the platform
or landing height does not exceed 30 inches.) The Code also requires all new multi-family
development projects to incorporate reasonable accommodation design standards into new
development project design. These provisions do not discriminate between physical or
developmental disabilities.
D. Americans with Disabilities Act Requirements
The City reviews projects for compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. §
12101 et seq), which specifies that a number of the residential units in new multi-family
construction of three or more apartments or four or more condominiums must be accessible or
adaptable.
E.   Residential Care Facilities
Pursuant to state law, the City allows group homes for six or fewer individuals by right in all
residential zone districts.
     City of Loyalton Housing Element             44              Adopted June 16, 2015

F.    Emergency Shelters, Transitional and Supportive Housing
California Health and Safety Code (Section 50801) defines an emergency shelter as “housing
with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six
months or less by a homeless person. No individual or household may be denied emergency
shelter because of an inability to pay.”
Pursuant State law (SB 2), jurisdictions with an unmet need for emergency shelters are required
to identify a zone(s) where emergency shelters will be allowed as a permitted use without a
conditional use permit or other discretionary permit. The identified zone must have sufficient
capacity to accommodate the shelter need, and at a minimum provide capacity for at least one
year-round shelter. Permit processing, development and management standards for emergency
shelters must be objective and facilitate the development of, or conversion to, emergency
shelters. The City’s recently updated zoning code allows emergency shelters in the R-2
(Multiple Family Residential District, These sites are centrally located in the City (4 parcels
containing a total of 1.27 acres (refer to Figure 3, Vacant Land Inventory). This zoning district
permits emergency shelters by right subject only to similar residential standards (building height
limits, lighting, landscaping, etc.). These properties are located in an area where access, transit,
jobs and needed services are available in close proximity; such as shopping in the downtown.
Transitional and supportive housing are defined in the Zoning Code which considers these
facilities as residential uses of property subject only to those restriction that apply to other
residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone. In accordance with SB-2, these
housing uses are allowed in all residential zoning districts.
G. Farm Worker Housing
Farm Worker Housing is defined as housing configured to accommodate a maximum of 36 beds
in group quarters or up to 12 individual units designed for use by a single household that
complies with the State of California program standards for farmworker housing. The term also
includes employee housing that may allow housing for six or fewer individuals. The City’s R-2
District allows farmworker housing by right.
H. Single-Room-Occupancy
Single-room-occupancy units (SRO)’s consist of small studio-type efficiency living units
designed to provide living facilities for one person. The recently updated zoning code allows by
right SROs in the C-1, Commercial District.
3.3.8       Building Codes
The City Building Department administers building code and enforcement services. The City
regularly adopts updated versions of the Uniform Building Code (UBC) as it becomes available.
The City is currently using the 2011 UBC for implementation. The City will need to consider
further updates to the 2013 UBC and potentially the 2015 “Green” Building Code. This most
recent UBC has significant enhancements, such as required water conservation/storage,
landscaping, and other provisions, that result in significant costs to residential construction.
      City of Loyalton Housing Element           45              Adopted June 16, 2015

 3.3.9       California Environmental Quality Act
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), as mandated by the State of California,
requires the City to review projects that undergo discretionary review, such as a residential
subdivision, to undergo exhaustive review for environmental impacts. These reviews can
include requiring preparations of Environmental Impact Reports and cause a project to either
not be economically feasible or denied based on the level of impacts discovered. This would be
considered a major constraint to larger residential development projects. Regulations by the
State and Federal Governments addressing impacts on biological resources, for example, can
be a significant constraint to future residential development (refer to Section 3.10 regarding
biological resources). However, for the several small residential infill sites identified in this
Housing Element, not located in the floodplain, residential development here would be
considered exempt from CEQA and, therefore, would not be considered a constraint to
development.
3.3.10      Biological Regulations
Two laws related to the protection of Biological Resources are the Federal Endangered Species
Act and the California Endangered Species Act. The Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) is
administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This Act applies to impacts to federally listed
species, or to habitat occupied by federally listed species. ESA Section 9 forbids specified acts
that directly or indirectly harm listed species. Section 9 also prohibits “taking” any species of
wildlife or fish listed as endangered. These restrictions apply to all Federal agencies and to all
persons subject to United States jurisdiction. The California Endangered Species Act (CESA) is
a State program similar in scope and nature to the federal ESA, but focused on plant and
wildlife species identified as threatened and endangered within the State of California. The
California Department of Fish and Game administers the CESA regulations. Both the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service and California Department of Fish and Game have regulations to protect
wildlife resources. Special permits are required for the alteration, dredging, or activity in any lake
or stream, as well as other activities that may affect fish and game habitat. Both agencies also
regulate impacts to sensitive plant and animal species. Future development in Loyalton
potentially affecting wildlife habitat will be subject to the regulations of both of these Federal and
State agencies.
Waters of the U.S. include a range of wet environments such as lakes, rivers, streams (including
intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, and wet meadow. The U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulates discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the
U.S. under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). In addition, Section 401 of the CWA (33
U.S.C. 1341) requires any applicant for a Federal license or permit to conduct any activity that
may result in a discharge of a pollutant into water of the U.S. to obtain a certification that the
discharge will comply with the applicable effluent limitations and water quality standards.
Applying these regulations to future, more substantial residential development proposals could
be considered a significant constraint. However, for the several small residential infill sites
identified in this Housing Element, not located in the floodplain, residential development here
would typically not require these permits, and therefore, would not be considered a constraint to
development.
3.3.11       Housing Element Update
The City is mandated by State Law to regularly update the General Plan Housing Element and
often other elements of the General Plan to assure internal consistency. If the Housing Element
     City of Loyalton Housing Element               46              Adopted June 16, 2015

is not regularly updated, the City is precluded from access to a number of housing programs
that can either improve the City’s existing or expand its housing stock. Also, as there are no
grants available to defray the cost of updating the Housing Element, the City is required to
utilize resources to prepare these updates instead of potentially using these resources to
improve the City’s housing stock, such as allocating funds towards a housing rehabilitation
program. Due to mandated requirements to prepare the Housing Element, however, the benefit
to the City for accessing housing grants probably exceeds the cost to the City in preparing
Housing Element Updates.
3.3.12        Military Compatibility
Senate Bills SB 1462 and SB 1468 require that the General Plan disclose any land use conflicts
with military air space, and/or training routes. In addition, the law requires disclosure of any
military operations or installations within 1,000 feet of the City. Potentially, land use conflicts to
these resources could constrain housing production. Based on mapping analysis conducted by
the California Office of Planning and Research indicate there are no conflicts with military land
or air uses in or around Loyalton. Please refer to Figure 4 below.

3.3.13        Density Bonus
The Zoning Ordinance has recently been amended which allows the City to grant a density
bonus of up to 35 percent, or provide other incentives of equivalent financial value, if the
developer agrees to construct at least 25 percent of the total units of a housing development for
low- and moderate-income families. However, the City has never received an application for a
density bonus. Providing this density bonus, however, does provide opportunities to develop
higher density housing in the City which potentially could be made available to lower income
households.
      City of Loyalton Housing Element                                  47                                  Adopted June 16, 2015

3.3.14 Construction Costs
Many factors can affect the cost of building a dwelling or dwellings, including the type of
construction, custom versus tract development, materials, site conditions, finishing details,
amenities, square footage, and structural configuration. According to the Building Valuation
Data published by the Building Safety Journal, construction costs for a single-family home range
from $102 to $140 per square foot. Multifamily units typically cost $94 to $137 per square foot. A
reduction in amenities and the quality of building materials can result in lower sales prices. The
cost of a 1,200 square foot single family home would range from $122,400 to $168,000. These
estimates do not include the cost of the land. These costs are confirmed in Section 2.5.9 of this
document which includes a complete analysis of new stick built housing costs in Loyalton (refer
to Table 19.
Prefabricated factory-built or manufactured housing, which is permitted under the City’s Zoning
Ordinance, is a more cost effective alternative than the development of standard construction.
These types of housing units are approved administratively by staff. The review is limited to
determining compliance with parking, setbacks, coverage, height regulations in all residential
districts (in accordance with State law). Cost can range from $85,000 to $132,000 for a mobile
home purchase and installation. These estimates do not include the cost of land.
Although construction costs are a significant portion of the overall development cost, the City
can do little to mitigate its impact. Because construction costs in Loyalton are similar to those in
other parts of the area, the cost of construction is not considered a major constraint to housing
production.
3.3.15 Site Improvements
Site improvements are an important component of new development and include streets, water,
sewer, and other infrastructure necessary to serve new development. Site Improvement
Standards are regulated by the City’s Design and Construction Standards. The City can reduce
the cost of the improvements by assisting affordable housing developers in obtaining state and
federal financing for their projects, providing density bonuses, and by deferring or reducing fees
in exchange for long-term affordability of the assisted housing units.
3.3.16     Water Supply
As more development occurs there will be an increased demand on groundwater resources.
Based on the Department of Water Resources information on the Sierra Valley Groundwater
Sub-Basin, groundwater recharge from winter precipitation far exceeds agricultural and
municipal well extraction, so water supply is not a constraint to new residential development.
Also, recent improvements to the City’s water supply and distribution system has sufficient
capacity to provide for additional housing growth as anticipated by the General Plan. Water
supply and treatment facilities are not constraining factors to accommodating future
development anticipated during the 2014-19 planning period. In accordance with Senate Bill
1087, the City will reserve water capacity for a minimum 2 equivalent dwelling units during the
2014-19 planning period as identified in Loyalton’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation for Low
Income households (refer to Policy 1-3-4 of this Document).

3.3.17      Wastewater Facilities
The City provides wastewater treatment within the City. Recent improvements to the City’s
wastewater treatment system has sufficient capacity to provide for additional housing growth as
anticipated by the General Plan. Wastewater supply and treatment facilities are not constraining
factors to accommodating future development anticipated during the 2014-19 planning period.
In accordance with Senate Bill 1087, the City will reserve wastewater capacity for a minimum 2
equivalent dwelling units during the 2014-19 planning period as identified in Loyalton’ s
Regional Housing Needs Allocation for Low Income households (refer to Policy 1-3-4 of this
Document)
3.3.18      Flooding and Drainage
The area immediately adjacent to the Smithneck Creek is located within a designated Federal
Emergency Agency (FEMA) floodplain. This floodplain is a special flood hazard area that maybe
inundated by a 100-year flood zone. The use of the land within the 100-year flood plain is
regulated by standards that require all livable development to be above the predicted flood
elevation. The City requires developers to pay the entire cost of all on-site storm drainage
facilities including underground storm drain pipelines, catch basins, detention basins, and other
facilities that may be needed. In certain situations, the City requires that off-site improvements
be constructed. However, for the several small residential infill sites identified in this Housing
Element, for future multiple family residential development, not located in the floodplain,
residential development here would not be considered a constraint to development.
3.3.19      Land Costs
Another key component of the total cost of housing is the price of raw land and any necessary
improvements. The diminishing supply of land available for residential construction combined
with a fairly high demand for such development has served to keep the cost of land relatively
high.
Higher land costs have resulted in homebuilders developing more high-priced homes in order to
preserve profits. In Loyalton, residential land costs vary from $3.00 to $6.00 per square foot,
depending on the size, location, and zoning of the property.
3.3.20      Impact Fees
Development Impact Fees are commonly charged by other local governments to off-set the
impact on services, such as traffic, fire and police facilities, recreation and City facilities and
schools. These fees can have a significant impact on the overall cost of building housing. The
City currently does not require payment of impact fees, however. Due to declining enrollment in
the area, the school district does not charge impact fees either. There are a couple of policies
in this Housing Element that discuss impact fees and that such fees need to be reduced for
lower income housing in the event the City chooses to establish impact fees in the future.
3.3.21      Availability of Mortgage and Rehabilitation Financing
The availability of financing also affects the ability to purchase or improve a home. Interest rates
are determined by national policies and economic conditions, and local governments can do
little to affect these rates. Jurisdictions can, however, offer interest rate write-downs and
      City of Loyalton Housing Element            49              Adopted June 16, 2015

deferred payment loans associated with state and federal grants in order to extend home
purchasing opportunities to a broader economic segment of the population.
In addition, government insured loan programs may be available to reduce mortgage down
payment requirements. Currently there are no programs in place that deal with First Time Home
Buyers, or rehabilitation. The City should consider applying for funds from the State, so that
implementation of such programs may occur.
3.3.22      Historical and Archaeological Resources
The City has a rich historical history so alterations of existing buildings to accommodate
residential use could undergo some additional review and costs associated with applying the US
Department of Interior Secretary Standards for the Treatment of Historic Buildings. As noted in
Section 3.3.1 of this document, the City has a historic preservation overlay district that may
require some discretionary review of alterations to historic buildings. Also, there is some history
of the Maidu and Washoe Indians who inhabited the Sierra Valley, so if archaeological
resources are found on a particular residential building site, these resources would require
mitigation. Also, the City’s Open Space and Conservation Element of the General Plan requires
that the City consult local Indian tribes in the review of development that requires discretionary
approval through the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). These could be considered
significant constraints to future residential development. However, for the several small
residential infill sites identified in this Housing Element, for future multiple family residential
development, not located in the floodplain, residential development here would be considered
exempt from CEQA and, therefore, would not be considered a constraint to development.
3.3.23      Habitats
The City’s Plan Area supports a diverse assemblage of plant and wildlife species throughout
several habitat types. Sensitive habitat areas in Loyalton contain valuable Biological Resources.
If a future residential project is located within a sensitive biological habitat, it may not be feasible
to develop, which is a constraint. As noted in Section 3.3.9 of this Element, additional
environmental review is required for larger residential development. This could be considered a
significant constraint to future larger scale residential development. However, for the several
small residential infill sites identified in this Housing Element, for future multiple family
residential development, not located in the floodplain, residential development here would be
considered exempt from CEQA and, therefore, would not be considered a constraint to
development.
3.3.24 Energy Conservation
As residential energy costs rise, increasing utility costs reduce the affordability of housing.
California in particular is currently experiencing energy problems; increased costs and
decreased power availability have resulted in “rolling blackouts” across the state.
Though the City of Loyalton has mild summers, Loyalton’s relatively cold winters make energy
conservation particularly important. Energy conserving tactics are as follows:
Efficient land use patterns                           Code enforcement
Building standards and materials                 Rehabilitation programs
      City of Loyalton Housing Element              50              Adopted June 16, 2015

Energy conservation techniques should be focused on reducing the amount of energy being
spent for heating and cooling through encouraging efficient energy design in new construction
and retrofitting of existing development in the case of rehabilitation. Landscaping treatment
around residential neighborhoods can increase the amount of shade available during the
summer months, therefore decreasing indoor temperatures.
Unfortunately, the additional costs associated with energy conservation can increase the cost of
housing. The City encourages energy efficiency and associated lower service costs and, as
described in the General Plan, will be developing a public education program to increase public
participation in energy conservation.
3.3.25 Fair Housing Constraints
The provision of equal housing opportunities for all persons is an important goal of the Housing
Element. The City addresses complaints regarding fair housing issues through its Planning
Department. City staff monitors complaints and if necessary, refers fair housing matters to
California Rural Legal Assistance, U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
and/or the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing in order to ensure that
housing opportunities are open to all without regard to race, color, age, sex, religion, national
origin, family status, or physical handicap and to apprise the general population regarding State
and federal laws related to the provision of fair and equal housing opportunities for all.
4        LOYALTON HOUSING PROGRAM
4.1 Loyalton Housing Progress
Under State Housing Element Law, communities are required to assess their progress under
their adopted housing programs as part of the five-year update to their housing elements. These
results should be quantifiable where possible (e.g. the number of units that were rehabilitated),
but may be qualitative where necessary (e.g. mitigation of government constraints). Although
much has been accomplished in terms of completing revised policies the City did not experience
any new residential development over the 2009-14 Housing Element Planning Cycle. Table 28
shows the RHNA goals and housing production accomplishments. Table 29 presents an
overview of the 2009-14 Housing Element goals, objectives, policies and programs and status
of progress. . The results compare with what was projected or planned in the Housing Element.
Where significant shortfalls exist between what was planned and what was achieved, and the
reasons for such differences.

                                                   charge development impact fees. The fees
                                                   they charge defray the cost of providing the
                                                   service so any fee reductions would impact

4.3 Quantified Objectives
The purpose of this section is to establish quantified objectives to meet the City’s share of the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). It is important to recognize the quantified
objectives do not represent a ceiling on development, but rather a target goal based on needs,
resources, and constraints.
The housing element process begins with the California Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) allocating a region's share of the statewide housing need to Sierra
Planning Organization (SPO) through what is known as the Regional Housing Need
Determination. This determination is based on Department of Finance population projections
and regional population forecasts used in preparing regional transportation plans. SPO then
further revised the allocations and developed the Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP). The
RHNP identifies the number of dwelling units, including the number of affordable dwelling units,
by income group, that Loyalton and Sierra County must accommodate for between June 1,
2014 and June 30, 2019. According to the RHNP Plan, 4 new housing units are allocated to the
City of Loyalton (refer to Table 31). Two of the allocated housing units are intended to be
developed at densities and prices affordable to very low- and low-income households.
Loyalton’s Housing Element must demonstrate how it will accommodate the production of these
units—the City must show that there is adequate land properly zoned to accommodate its
allocation of units and that barriers to the production of dwelling units are minimized or
eliminated. The quantified objectives are shown below in Table 32 and they are based on what
is financially feasible. The City of Loyalton has established quantified (numerical) objectives for
several program categories to provide measurable standards for monitoring and evaluating
program achievements. The quantified objectives for the City’s share of Sierra County’s future
housing needs and housing construction differ because the housing objective is based on the
City’s estimate of the number homes that will actually be constructed, rehabilitated, etc. and
affordable to each income group. The future housing needs objective addresses the City’s
ability to accommodate housing based on the availability of appropriately zoned vacant and
underutilized land, with public services and facilities. These homes may or may not be built
depending on market trends and the availability of funding assistance to developers of
affordable housing.

addition, organizations that represent the interests of low-income and special needs
households, or are otherwise involved in the development of affordable housing, were
consulted during the preparation of this element as specified above.
To comply with Senate Bill 18, the City consulted the Native American Heritage
Commission and various Native American Tribes on the City’s list. No comments or
requests for consultations were made by any of the tribes on the list.
The draft Housing Element has been available in City Hall and was posted on the City’s
website for review and comments.
The City will continue to engage the community through the adoption and
implementation of the element. The City will make diligent efforts to engage the
community in the progress of the housing element implementation, including specifically
contacting developers, service providers and other community interests to gather
comments, consider them and revise or adjust the housing element and programs as
appropriate.

CITY COUNCIL STAFF REPORT
MEETING OF: August 13, 2014
Subject: 2014-19 Housing Element Update Workshop
From:       John Benoit, City Planner                          II                                II
Recommended Action:         Housing Element Update: No action taken at this time. Open up the
                            meeting for public comment, consider any comments from the public
                            and offer comments and recommended updates to the document.
BACKGROUND:
The Housing Element, one of seven State mandated elements that comprise the General Plan, is a
policy document that provides an assessment of housing characteristics and needs in the
community and establishes programs to improve housing to meet these needs. In accordance
with California Government Code Sections 65580-65589, the Housing Element must be updated,
generally, every five years. Loyalton’s current Housing Element was approved by the State
Department of Housing and Community Development (“HCD”) for the period 2009-2014.
Also, for the City to access important grants, such as from the Community Development Block
Grant Program, the City must have an up-to-date HCD-approved Housing Element.
Consequently, the City is pursuing an update of the Housing element for the period 2014-19.
DISCUSSION/EVALUATION:
Background
With each housing element cycle, HCD allocates projected housing unit needs for each County
or Region of Counties to accommodate projected household growth needs for all household
income levels. This is then further translated into distributions by the Sierra Planning
Organization. The three critical income levels are Very Low, Low, and Moderate (affordable
ranges). This allocation is called RHNA or Regional Housing Need Allocation. The current,
2009-2014 RHNA allocation for Loyalton is 12 affordable dwelling units. The current housing
element identifies various sites throughout the City that are available for at least this many units
for these income categories, in addition to the “Above Moderate Income” category.

The HNA allocation for the 2014-2019 Planning Cycle calls a five-year objective of 3affordable
housing units (refer to Table 1 below).

affected public agencies on housing information and policies contained in the current 2009-14
Housing Element for update to the next 2014-19 planning cycle. This is also an opportunity to
review any new information that needs to be updated regarding the City’s housing characteristics
and future housing needs and to provide the City Council an opportunity to weigh in on the
document and provide the staff/consultant team input on areas in the document that need to be
changed to bring it current. Based on these comment, the Housing Element Update consultant,
Gary Price, will prepare a draft update to the document.
Related Zoning Code Amendments
Concurrently with this Housing Element Update process, Zoning Code was updated to also
include changes for compliance with State mandated housing law. Many of these changes also
implemented a number of programs identified in the current Housing Element, so the City is in
good shape to be completing the Housing Element Update.
Other General Plan Actions:
As addressed in the Zoning Code Update and the current Housing Element, the Land Use
Element will require some updating to bring minimum higher density residential regulations into
consistency with the new Zoning Code. This will include revising the Medium Density
Residential Land Use Designation to allow up to 16 units per acre per State requirements. Other
minor amendments are expected to be made to create an internally consistent General Plan.

Next Steps
The Council will review the draft, updated housing element. This draft document will then be
submitted to HCD for streamline review. Once HCD has reviewed the document and issues
comments, the staff/consultant team will coordinate responses to comments and possible
document revisions and coordinate a revised housing element draft. The City Council would then
conduct a public hearing to consider the draft housing element update to adopt the Housing
Element Update. The City would then send the document back to HCD for final approval.
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW:
The housing element project is subject to environmental review in accordance with the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). However, as a policy document, the initial determination
would be that the City finds that the project will not have any potential for any significant
environmental effect and, therefore would tentatively conclude that it would be exempt from CEQA
in accordance with Sections 15061(b)(3) and 15062 of the CEQA Guidelines (General Rule). The
Council and the public is welcome to offer staff comments on the potential environmental impacts
the project might generate.
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
Housing Element Update: No action taken at this time. Open up the meeting for public comment,
consider any comments from the public and offer comments and recommended changes to the
document.

The City conducted a public workshop on the Housing Element Update with the City Council on August 13,

public agencies and the general public to obtain comments and any feedback concerning this update. The

Appendix C - City of Loyalton, Housing Rental Market Summary
Prepared by Price Consulting Services on December 5, 2014
Background: There are no known property management agencies that serve rental units in Loyalton. Therefore, it
is difficult to develop precise numbers on actual rental rates according to housing type. However, due to the small
number of housing units in Loyalton and working with community representatives who have knowledge of the local
housing market, a good understanding of rental market conditions has been developed. Price Consulting Services
conducted a survey of rental housing in Loyalton between December 3 and 5, 2014, consisting of a series of phone
conversations with realtors and local community members to determine the residential rental market characteristics.
Dixon, Sierra Valley and Sierra County Realty responded to a number of questions as well as did Jan Buck, Editor
of the Sierra Mountain Messenger, who regularly posts advertisements on rental availability and helps market rental
units in Loyalton. Also, PCS met with Jim Riminer, Manager of the Loyalton Mobile Home Park, to discuss mobile
home market characteristic. Results of the survey were then validated by the 2010 Census and summarized as
follows.
Housing Rental Market Summary: As noted in the 2010 Census, there were 59 renter occupied housing units in
Loyalton. Based on the survey, rental market conditions have not significantly changed from 2010. No new
housing units were constructed during the 2008-13 planning period. Some of the more affordable rental units for
these households consist of the 19 mobile homes and three (3) from the existing six unit apartment building
(occupied units), known as the “AJ Misshot Building”. The other two multiple family residential buildings in
Loyalton, consist of a tri-plex and a duplex which are vacant and for sale. This leaves 41 units consisting of
occupied single family rental units. A summary of rental housing characteristics based on the 2010 Census and the
Rental Market Survey is presented in Table 1 below. Several of the mobile homes in Loyalton are in deteriorated
condition, several of which have been recently demolished as a result of code enforcement action. Those in mobile
home parks range in monthly rental rates of between $200 and $350 per month. Three vacant apartments are
available for rent (all one bedroom units) for $550 per month. The 41 single family houses, were presumably rented
out by individual homeowners. Vacancy is very limited for these units with only one three bedroom house known to
be available for rent (as of December 5, 2014). In fact the 2010 Census indicates that the overall vacancy rate for
Loyalton was 21.5 percent. However, about 30 percent of these units are used for seasonal purposes. According to
Jan Buck, Sierra Messenger, there are several houses in the community that are owned by residents in Loyalton who
choose not to rent their other owned houses and keep them permanently vacant. This is confirmed by the 2010
Census which indicates that over 70 percent (or 59 housing units) of Loyalton’s vacant housing units remain vacant
that are not available for rent or occupancy. Most of the single family rental houses in Loyalton consist of smaller
two bedroom/one bath homes. This is also supported by the 2010 Census which indicates that over 60 percent of the
occupied rental units were two bedroom housing units. Based on the results of the survey, most two-bedroom
housing units rent for between $600 and $750 per month (average of $675/month). Larger three bedroom homes
rent for between $800 and $1,200 per month (average of $1,000). Results from the survey were confirmed by the
2010 Census which cross references the number of bedrooms by gross rent. (See Table 3). As noted in the Housing
Income Analysis below, most all households that rent houses in Loyalton could be considered to be occupied by
lower income families as these average rents are considered to be within an affordable range in relation to the
median income of Sierra County.

Vacancy Rate for Mobile Homes is 20%-due to some undergoing demolition or code enforcement action.
Qualifying Income consists of 33% of annual household income to pay rent.
Renter Household Income Analysis: Based on an average household size of three (2010 Census indicates an
average household size of 2.4 persons per household), most families who occupy mobile homes in Loyalton would
be considered to have extremely low incomes ($19,000 or less annual income), most occupying multiple family
homes would be considered to have very low incomes (between $19,001 and $31,650 annual income), most
occupying two bedroom single family units would be conserved to have very low incomes (between $19,001 and
$31,650 annual income), and most occupying three bedroom single family units would be considered to have low
incomes (between $31,651 and $50,650). Refer to Table 2 for reference to the State Income Limits for income
classifications. From this it can be interpreted that Loyalton‘s rental market provides housing to about 15 extremely
low income families, mostly 25 very low income families and about 19 low income families.

                                HAM RADIO OPERATORS
HAM (amateur) radios can play an extremely important role in emergencies, because they provide
a method of communication when cell phones and other communication channels fail. HAM radios
can be used to keep the community informed or to get extra assistance in the event of a disaster.
Sierra County residents are encouraged to take their amateur radio license exam, as those listed below
have done, so they can help their neighbors and communicate with others in extreme circumstances.
For information call Lee Brown in the Sierra County Office of Emergency Services at 530-289-2850.

9-1-1 calls made from cell phones in Sierra County are often routed to larger dis-
patch centers before being transferred back locally, causing a large delay in get-
ting assistance.
Specify you are in Sierra County.
To expedite the handling of an emergency call from your cell phone, call the Sher-
iff’s Office Dispatch in Sierra County, instead of 9-1-1.

The American Red Cross is able to provide for the immediate emergency needs of those displaced in-
dividuals which may include food, clothing and a hotel for up to 3 nights. In the case where approxi-
mately 10 families or 20-30 people are involved, the Red Cross may choose to open a shelter. Red Cross
Disaster Mental Health services are available for the emotional support of clients, as well as Health Ser-
vices to assist clients with the replacement of their medications or glasses.
Canteen The American Red Cross may also provide canteen services when requested for a larger inci-
dent (fire, bus crash, etc.) to provide snacks, water & coffee to utility workers, fire crews, law enforce-
ment, etc.
Evacuation Center An Evacuation Center is a temporary center for evacuees who have been displaced
due to an incident. This center would not be for overnight use. Clients can receive briefings, get a snack,
and find temporary shelter until the incident comes to an end or a decision is made to open a shelter.
Shelters A Red Cross shelter is for evacuees who have been displaced overnight by disaster. Red Cross
shelters are carefully chosen by the Red Cross in conjunction with Health and Human Services and are
capable of serving meals & housing large groups. Red Cross shelters are staffed by Red Cross volunteers
and staff including Mental Health Services and Health Services.

                                                      Household Fires
                      Fires in homes are most often caused by cooking accidents, smoking, or un-
                     safe use of woodstoves or space heaters. Here are some things you can do to
                                        avoid a home fire or protect yourself during a fire.
                                               Protecting against fires
                      Install smoke detectors near all sleeping areas and on every level of your home,
 including the basement. Check smoke detectors and replace the batteries twice yearly.
 Have A-B-C type fire extinguishers. Teach family members how to use them.
 Know the location of all exits including windows. If you live in an apartment, count the number of door-
    ways between your apartment and the two nearest exits.
 Know two ways out of every room in case smoke or flames block your primary exit.
 Choose a meeting place outside the home.
 Have an escape plan and practice it with your family. This will help ensure you can get out quickly.
 Never use gas ovens, gas ranges, barbecues, or most portable or propane heaters for indoor heating.
 Make sure your house number is clearly visible from the street and that fire trucks can reach your home.
 Have fire-fighting materials available: dry powder, fire extinguisher, heavy tarp or blanket, and water.
                                                   If fire strikes
 If there is a fire — evacuate. Do not go back inside. Call 9-1-1 from a neighbor’s house.
 Never use water on an electrical fire.
 Smother oil and grease fires in the kitchen with baking soda or salt, or put a lid over the flame if it is burning
    in a pan.
 If caught in smoke — drop to your hands and knees and crawl; breathe shallowly through your nose and use
    your blouse, shirt, or jacket as a filter.
 If you must move through flames — hold your breath, move quickly, cover your head and hair, keep your
    head down, and close your eyes as much as possible.
 If your clothes catch fire, “stop, drop and roll” until the fire is out.
 If you are in a room and cannot escape, leave the door closed, stay low to the floor and hang a white or
    light-colored sheet outside the window.
 Be sure all family members are accounted for. If someone is missing, let the fire department know.

                                                  Floods
                     Floods are the most common and widespread of all natural disasters. If you
                        live in an area where floods occur, you should know the following:
                                            What to do before a flood
                       Plan for evacuation, including where you will go and the route you will take.
 Purchase flood insurance, and keep all insurance policies in a safe place.
 Take photos or a videotape of the valuables you keep in your home.
 Listen to your radio or television for reports of flood danger.
 Keep your car filled with gas.
                                           What to do during a flood
 Do not try to walk or drive through flooded areas. Water can be deeper than it appears and water levels
      rise quickly. If your car stalls in floodwater, get out quickly and move to higher ground.
 Stay away from moving water; moving water six inches deep can sweep you off your feet. Cars are easily
      swept away in just two feet of water.
 Stay away from disaster areas unless authorities ask for volunteers.
 Stay away from downed power lines.
 If your home is flooded, turn the utilities off until emergency officials tell you it is safe to turn them on.
 Do not pump the basement out until floodwater recedes.
 Avoid weakened floors, walls and rooftops.
 Wash your hands frequently with soap and clean water if you come in contact with floodwaters.
                                            What to do after a flood
 Wear gloves and boots when cleaning up.
 Open all doors and windows. Use fans if possible to air out the building.
 Wash all clothes and linens in hot water.
 Discard mattresses and stuffed furniture; they can’t be adequately cleaned.
 Wash dirt and mud from walls, counters and hard surfaced floors with soap and water.
 Discard all food that has come into contact with floodwater; canned food is okay.
 If your well is flooded, your tap water is probably unsafe. If you have public water, the health department
      will let you know if your water is not safe to drink. Until your water is safe, use clean bottled water.
 Do not use your septic system when water is standing on the ground around it.

                                              Hot Weather Precautions
                        Severe heat may cause illness or even death. When temperatures rise to
                               extreme highs, reduce risks by taking the following precautions:
                      Hot weather precautions to reduce the risk of heat exhaustion and heat stroke
                       Stay indoors and in an air-conditioned environment as much as possible unless
                           you’re sure your body has a high tolerance for heat.
 Drink plenty of fluids but avoid beverages that contain alcohol, caffeine or a lot of sugar.
 Eat more frequently but make sure meals are balanced and light.
 Never leave any person or pet in a parked vehicle.
 Avoid dressing babies in heavy clothing or wrapping them in warm blankets.
 Make sure pets have plenty of water.
 If you take prescription diuretics, antihistamines, mood-altering or antispasmodic drugs, check with a
      doctor about the effects of sun and heat exposure.
 Cover windows that receive morning or afternoon sun. Awnings can reduce the heat entering a house.
                                                If you go outside
 Plan strenuous outdoor activities for early or late in the day when temperatures are cooler; then gradually
      build up tolerance for warmer conditions.
 Take frequent breaks when working outdoors.
 Wear a wide-brimmed hat, sun block and light-colored, loose-fitting clothes when outdoors.
 At first signs of heat illness (dizziness, nausea, headaches), move to a cooler location, rest for a few minutes
      and slowly drink a cool beverage. Seek medical attention immediately if you do not feel better.
 Avoid sunburn: it slows the skin’s ability to cool itself. Use a sunscreen lotion with a high SPF rating.
 Avoid extreme temperature changes. A cool shower immediately after coming in from hot temperatures
      can result in hypothermia, particularly for elderly or very young people.
                       If the power goes out or air conditioning is not available
 Ask your doctor about any prescription medicine you keep refrigerated. (If the power goes out, most
      medicine will be fine to leave in a closed refrigerator for at least three hours.)
 Keep a few bottles of water in your freezer; if the power goes out, move them to your refrigerator and
      keep the doors shut.

                           Prepare Your Household for Emergencies
                    After a disaster, you and your family should be prepared to be on your own for
                    at least three days. In some emergencies, such as an influenza pandemic, you
                    may need to prepare for a week or more. Emergency response teams will be
                    very busy and may not be able to provide immediate care to all who need it.
                                          Before disaster strikes
                       Choose a place for your family to meet after a disaster.
  Choose a person outside the immediate area for family members to contact in case you get separated.
      This person should live far enough away so he or she won’t be involved in the same emergency.
 Know how to contact your children at their school and how to pick them up after a disaster. Let the
      school know who is authorized to pick them up.
 Put together an emergency supply kit for your home and workplace.
 Learn first aid and CPR. Have a first aid kit and extra medicine for family members.
 Learn how to shut off your water, gas and electricity. Know where to find shut-off valves and switches.
 Keep a small amount of cash available. If the power is out, ATMs won’t work.
 Make copies of your vital records and store them in a safe deposit box in another city or state.
 Make sure all family members agree on an emergency plan. Give emergency information to caregivers.
                                    During an emergency or disaster
 Keep calm and take time to think. Give assistance where needed.
 Listen to your radio or television for official information and instructions.
 Use the telephone for emergency calls only.
 If you are ordered to evacuate, take your emergency kit and follow directions to a safe place or shelter.
                                 After the emergency or disaster is over
 Use caution in entering damaged buildings and homes.
 Stay away from damaged electrical wires and wet appliances.
 Check food and water supplies for contamination.
 Notify your relatives that you are safe, but don’t tie up phone lines.

                                                       Pandemic Flu
                                An influenza pandemic is a worldwide outbreak of a new flu virus.
                          An influenza — or flu — pandemic is an outbreak of a new type of flu virus
                        that spreads rapidly from one country to another. Because the virus is new,
                        people have no natural immunity to it and vaccine will not be available for
                        many months. Without vaccine or immunity, the virus passes rapidly from per-
                        son to person. Hundreds of thousands could get sick, and many could die.
There were three large flu pandemics in the 20th century – 1918, 1957 and 1968. No one knows where
  or when the next flu pandemic will begin, but health officials agree that it is only a matter of time.
                                      What to expect if an outbreak occurs
 A flu pandemic could be devastating, so everyone should be prepared for the worst. With up to one-third of
    the workforce sick or staying home, supplies and services could be limited or disrupted.
 You may be asked to stay away from other people, and schools could be closed. Health officials may order to
    keep people with the virus at home or in special facilities.
 A flu pandemic could last a long time. The 1918 flu pandemic lasted 18 months.
                                                 What to do now
 Be ready to help family and neighbors who are elderly or have special needs.
 Know school policies about illness and absence. Make a plan for taking care of your children if schools are
    closed for long periods.
 Be ready to stay home from work when sick. Know work policies about sick leave, absences, and time off.
 Explore ways to get your work done with less personal contact, such as use of e-mail and telephones.
   Be prepared to live for a week or more on what you have at home. Stores may have limited supplies
                                           Prevent the spread of germs
 The flu virus is spread from person to person when an infected person coughs, sneezes or touches things
    that others use. To protect yourself and others:
        Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Cough into your sleeve or use a tissue.
        Wash your hands with soap and warm water.
        Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
        Stay home when you’re sick or have flu symptoms. Drink extra water and get plenty of rest.
                                            Learn home-care basics
 The flu virus causes the body to dehydrate, or lose water through fever and sweating. Watch for weakness, dry
   mouth, dark concentrated urine, or a fast pulse when lying or sitting down. These are signs of dehydration. To
   prevent dehydration, it is very important for a person with the flu to drink up to 12 glasses of water a day.

                                                     Power Outages
                  Power outages can cause many safety concerns; knowing the following information can help.
                                           Before a power outage
                      Register life-sustaining and medical equipment with your utility company.
                      Consider buying a generator. Keep your generator outside and run a cord inside.
                        Don’t connect your generator to main service panels — it’s dangerous!
 Your disaster preparedness kit should contain flashlights, a battery- powered radio, and a wind-up clock.
 Have a corded telephone available — cordless phones will not work when the power is out.
 Have a safe alternative heat source and supply of fuel. Never burn charcoal or use a generator indoors.
                                             During a power outage
 Turn off lights and electrical appliances except for the refrigerator and freezer.
 Even if it is dark, turn light switches and buttons on lamps or appliances to the “off” position.
 Unplug computers and other sensitive equipment to protect them from possible surges.
 Leave one lamp on so you will know when power is restored. Wait at least 15 minutes after power is
      restored before turning on other appliances.
 Conserve water, especially if you use well water.
 Never use gas ovens, gas ranges, barbecues or portable or propane heaters for indoor heating—they use
      oxygen and create carbon monoxide that can cause suffocation.
 Candles can cause a fire. It’s far better to use battery-operated flashlights or glow sticks for lighting.
 Using a kerosene heater, gas lantern or stove inside the house can be dangerous. Maintain proper ventilation
      at all times to avoid a build up of toxic fumes, and be sure to have a carbon monoxide detector.
 Stay away from downed power lines and sagging trees with broken limbs.
                                                  Keep food safe
 Use and store food carefully to prevent foodborne illness when power outages make refrigeration unavailable.
 Use foods first that can spoil most rapidly.
 Keep doors to refrigerators and freezers closed. Your refrigerator’s freezer will keep food frozen for a day.

                               Disaster Tips for People with Special
                                                    Medical Needs
                     In a disaster, people with special medical needs have extra concerns. This
                              information will help you and your family prepare for an emergency.
                                                Medications
                     Always have at least a three-day supply of all your medications. In some
                             emergencies, you may need to prepare for a week or more.
 Store your medications in one location in their original containers.
 Have a list of all of your medications: name, dose, frequency, and the name of the doctor.
                                               Medical supplies
 Have a three-day supply of any medical supplies you use, such as bandages, ostomy bags, or syringes.
                                      Oxygen and breathing equipment
 If you use oxygen, have an emergency supply (enough for at least a three-day period).
 If you use breathing equipment, have a three-day supply of tubing, solutions and medications.
                                Intravenous (IV) and feeding tube equipment
 Know if your infusion pump has battery back-up, and how long it would last in an emergency.
 Ask your home care provider about manual infusion techniques in case of a power outage.
 Have written operating instructions attached to all equipment.
                                                Emergency bag
In the event that you have to leave your home, keep a bag packed at all times that contains:
      A medication list.
      Medical supplies for at least three days.
      Copies of vital medical papers such as insurance.
                                            People who can help
 An important part of being prepared for a disaster is planning with family, friends and neighbors. Know
        who can walk to your home to assist you if no other means of transportation is available.

                                                      Windstorms
                      Every fall and winter, windstorms cause extensive damage, including the loss of
                   electricity throughout the Pacific Northwest. By taking action now, you can save lives
                    and reduce the damage caused by windstorms and other weather-related hazards.
                                    What to do before a windstorm
                   Assemble a disaster supply kit.
 If you have a home generator, make sure you know how to use it safely. Improper use of a generator
      can cause carbon monoxide poisoning.
 Know what emergency plans are in place at your workplace, school, and daycare center.
 Conduct a home safety evaluation to find out which nearby trees could fall in a windstorm.
 If you have an electric garage door opener, locate the manual override.
                                     What to do during a windstorm
 Don’t panic. Take quick action to protect yourself and help others.
 Turn off the stove if you’re cooking when the power goes out, and turn off natural gas appliances.
 Never use a gas stove for heat.
 Never burn charcoal indoors.
 If you are indoors, move away from windows or objects that could fall. Go to lower floors.
 If you are outdoors, move into a building. Avoid downed electric power lines, utility poles, and trees.
 If you are driving, pull off the road and stop away from trees. If possible, walk into a safe building.
      Avoid overpasses, power lines and other hazards.
 Listen to your radio for emergency instructions.
                                  What to do after a windstorm
 Check yourself and those around you for injuries.
 Evacuate damaged buildings. Do not re- enter until declared safe by authorities.
 Call 9-1-1 only to report a life threatening emergency.
 If you smell gas or hear a hissing sound indoors — open windows and leave the building. Turn off
  the gas source and call your gas company. Do not use matches, candles, open flames or electric
  switches indoors.
 Try to make contact with your out-of-area phone contact, but avoid making local telephone calls.
 Monitor your weather radio for instructions or an official “all clear” notice.

                                    Preparing for Winter Storms
                    Winter storms can range from moderate snow over a few hours to blizzard
                   conditions with blinding, wind-driven snow that lasts several days. Prepare
                                        before the snow falls and the ice freezes.
                                                 Preparing for winter storms
                   Listen to your radio or television for winter storm forecasts and other information.
 Prepare your home for cold weather. Install storm windows. Insulate outside walls, attics and crawl
  spaces. Wrap pipes, especially those near cold outer walls, or in attics or crawl spaces. Repair leaks in
  the roof, around the doors and in the windows.
 Have appropriate cold weather clothing available.
 If you have a kerosene heater, refuel your heater outside and remember to keep it at least three feet
  from flammable objects.
 Make sure your fireplace functions properly.
 Have rock salt and sand on hand for traction on ice.
 Fill your gas tank before the snow starts falling.
                                           During a winter storm
 Wear several layers of loose fitting, light weight, warm clothing rather than one layer of heavy cloth-
  ing. Wear mittens rather than gloves. Wear a warm, woolen cap.
 Reduce the temperature in your home to conserve fuel.
 Heat only the areas of your home you are using. Close doors and curtains.
 Be sure to eat regularly. Food provides calories that maintain body heat.
 Watch for signs of frostbite and hypothermia — slurred speech, disorientation, uncontrollable shiv-
  ering, stumbling, drowsiness and body temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit or less.
                                               In your vehicle
 Make sure someone knows where you are going. Stay on the main roads.
 If trapped in a blizzard, clear your tail pipe and run your engine and heater for 10 minutes every hour.
  Open your window slightly.
 During night hours, keep the dome light on in the car so rescue crews can see your vehicle.
 Keep an emergency kit in your vehicle. Include a three-day supply of water and non-perishable food
  that can be eaten without being cooked. Include a blanket or sleeping bag for each passenger, a flash-
  light, cell phone, shovel, sack of sand or kitty litter, booster cables, flare, and toilet paper.

on 2.58 persons per unit this would allow a
population density of up to 50 people per
acre. Due to development constraints of
constructing higher density residential in
flood plains, this minimum density provision
does not apply to those properties
designated for Medium Density Residential
within sections of the City that are located
within the AE, 100 year Flood Plain as
determined by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA). Details of
those properties are identified in the
Housing Element.        The housing types
planned for this density are duplexes,
triplexes, four-plexes, townhouses and
similar        multiple-unit       residential
development. Apartment, condominium or
cooperative       units      with    Planned
Development Zoning are permitted within
this density category.
Urban services required for this increased
density make location more selective than
for lower density. Concerns regarding
access, proximity to commercial services,
impacts from adjoining uses and meeting
housing needs should be addressed when
applying this density to the plan.
Mobilehome parks would be placed in this
category.
The zoning districts which implement this
density are “R-2, Duplex Residential” or
“PD, Planned Development” of a density up
to 20 dwelling units per acre.
2.5.3 Commercial              Land       Use
Designation
The Commercial Land Use Designation
includes high activity land uses. These
include retail, service, repair and storage
uses. Additional uses would include

This plan strives to provide the necessary
functions of commercial development
without       resulting    in      unacceptable
consequences for adjoining areas and the
City’s circulation and public facilities.
The various types of commercial land use
will be separated by the zoning districts
within this land use designation. Zoning
districts appropriate for this category are “C-
1, General Commercial District”, “C-2,
Highway Commercial District” and “C-3,
Heavy Commercial District.”
2.5.4 Industrial (Manufacturing)            Land
        Use Designation
The Industrial (Manufacturing) Land Use
Designation       includes    all     types    of
manufacturing and industrial use. Two
zoning districts are compatible with this land
use designation: “M-1, Light Industrial” and
“M-2, Heavy Industrial”. The intensity factor
would be 80% land coverage.                 Light
industrial uses do not have smoke, fumes,
risk of explosion or other noxious effects.
Heavy industrial uses may have such
effects if they cannot be fully avoided.
2.5.5    Public and Semi-Public Land and
         Open         Space       Land       Use
         Designation
The Public Land and Open Space Land Use
Designation includes a variety of uses such
as cemeteries, churches, fairgrounds,
parks, recreation centers, public buildings,
open space, and schools. These uses do
not usually have adverse effects on other
land uses. Public and non-profit agencies
usually own and operate these facilities.

1-4.    Determination of uncertain boundaries
        Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various zones, the following rules
        shall apply:
        A.            Streets or Alleys. Where the indicated zoning boundaries are approximately street or
                      alley lines, the centerlines of such streets or alleys shall be construed to be such
                      boundaries.
        B.            Lot Lines. Where the zoning boundaries are not shown to be streets or alleys, and where
                      the indicated boundaries are approximately lot lines, the lot lines shall be construed to be
                      the boundaries of such zone, unless such boundaries are otherwise indicated.
        C.            Scale on Map – Determination by City Council. Where property is indicated on a zoning
                      map as acreage and not subdivided into lots and blocks, or where the zone boundary lines
                      are not approximately street, alley or lot lines, the zone boundary line shall be determined
                      by the City Council.
1-5.    Classification applies to all incorporated territory
        All incorporated territory of the city shall be classified as specified by the zoning map as adopted
        in this part.
1-6.    Prezones
        Property shall be prezoned prior to annexation. Property hereafter annexed to the city shall be
        classified in accordance with the provision of Section 65859 of the California Government Code.
        Prezoning will be accomplished in the same manner as zoning within the city and the application
        fee shall be set by resolution of the city council.
1-7.    Split zoning
        Parcels with split zoning may be developed in conformance with the applicable zone district as
        long as each zoned area meets the minimum parcel size requirement for the zone. If the zoned
        area does not have sufficient area to meet the minimum parcel size requirement for the zone
        district, such area may only be used for purposes permitted in the applicable zone district upon
        approval of a Conditional Use Permit.
1-8.    Zoning Ordinance Adopted
        There is adopted a zoning ordinance for the City of Loyalton, State of California, as provided by
        Title 7 of the Government Code of the State of California. This ordinance constitutes a specific
        plan for the use of land and structures.
1-9.    Zoning Ordinance Purpose
Loyalton	  City	  Zoning	  Ordinance	  #306	            5

        provide a plan for sound and orderly development, to ensure social and economic stability within
        the various zones established in this part, to provide for consistency of land use regulations with
        the adopted general plan.
1-10.   Interpretation authority
        A.            Additionally, under direction of the City Council, city staff is responsible for
                      administering this ordinance and may interpret the provisions of all zones. City staff
                      interpretations shall not circumvent other available established procedures such as
                      conditional use permits and variances, and findings shall clearly be set forth by City staff
                      documenting the interpretation. The City Council shall review and make a
                      determination with respect to any appeals of a staff interpretation.
        B.            The City Council, by written findings, may interpret any of the provisions of the part and
                      may determine what additional uses may be permitted with or without use permits in any
                      zone because of similarity and compatibility with listed uses. Said findings shall clearly
                      set forth the justification for the interpretation. Such interpretations shall not be used to
                      circumvent other available established procedures such as conditional use permits and
                      variances.
1-11.   Limitations on land use and structures (except as otherwise provided in this part)
        A.            Use Requirements. No building or part thereof or other structure shall be erected, altered,

5-4.    R-1 Design Objective Guidelines
        A.            R-1 Design Objective Guidelines are as follows:
                      1)         To create variety along local streets;
                      2)         To provide variety in building placement and street scenes;
                      3)         To provide visual interest and aesthetic diversity;
                      4)         To create a sense of neighborhood uniqueness.
        B.            Varied Setbacks:
                      Distance between adjoining homes, garages, or between homes and fences, shall be
                      varied to create visually interesting patterns of open space and landscaping, to add
                      diversity to the view and to promote “front porch” interaction with pedestrians thus
                      enhancing a sense of community and belonging, encouraging walking, and serving as a
                      deterrent to crime.
        C.            Varied Lot Widths:
                      1)         Vary lot widths to provide different amounts of open areas between structures.
                      2)         Vary placement, shapes and sizes of homes.

        H.            Roof Design Objectives
                      1)         Varied roof designs and materials that create visual interest are required. Varied
                                 roof design may be achieved by changes in plane such as the use of gables and
                                 dormers.
                      2)         For sloped roofs, both vertical and horizontal elements are required.
                      3)         A-frame roofs should be used only when appropriate to the architectural style.
                      4)         Flat roofs are not permitted.
                      5)         Roof-mounted heating and air-conditioning is not allowed.

                                                     CHAPTER 12.08.13
                                         P-D PLANNED DEVELOPMENT ZONE
13-1.   Planned Development Purpose and Applicability
        The planned development or P-D zone is intended to apply to parcels of undeveloped land, which
        are suitable for, and of sufficient size to contain, a completely planned development. Planned
        developments involving the careful application of design are encouraged to achieve a more
        functional, aesthetically pleasing and harmonious living and working environment within the city
        which might not be otherwise possible by strict adherence to the regulations of this part. A
        planned development may include a combination of different dwelling types and/or a variety of
        land uses which are made to complement each other and harmonize with existing and proposed
        land uses in the vicinity, by design. The PD designation must meet the required densities in the
        low and medium density residential designations in the City’s General Plan. The following
        regulations shall apply in all planned development or P-D zones:
13-2.   Planned Development Establishment Master Plan and Conditional Use Permit
        A.            A planned development is approved through the following process:
                      1)         Submittal of a planned development master plan to the City Council following
                                 the hearing and notification requirements for use permits.
                      2)         The detail provided shall be sufficient to show the intended use, density, intensity
                                 and plan concepts proposed within the project.
                      3)         Within one year of approval of the planned development master plan and prior to
                                 any development, an application shall be submitted to rezone the site (or a
                                 portion thereof) of to P-D. The P-D zone change request is submitted with a use
                                 permit application for the phase(s) of the project included in the requested P-D
                                 zone change area. If the site has been previously zoned P-D, a rezone application
                                 is not necessary.
                      4)         Where lots/parcels are to be sold as part of the planned development, a tentative
                                 subdivision or parcel map application shall also accompany the use permit and
                                 zone change request.
                      5)         If the project is small and the master plan is sufficiently detailed, the use permit
                                 approving the master plan may be all that is necessary to authorize project
                                 implementation along with a P-D zone change and tentative map application, if
                                 applicable.

                      6)         If the project is larger and/or the master plan is general in nature, implementation
                                 will require a detailed use permit application along with the P-D zone change
                                 request and tentative map if necessary. As noted in subsection 4 above,
                                 implementation of the planned development occurs through the submittal and
                                 approval only of the detailed use permit and a tentative subdivision map if
                                 lots/parcels are to be sold.
        B.            The City Council shall provide a recommendation on the planned development
                      applications to the city council, by forwarding their recommendation to the city clerk
                      within ten (10) days of their action. The city council shall follow the notification, hearing
                      and action requirements for use permits, zone changes, and tentative maps as provided in
                      this part.
        C.            Approval of the planned development shall only occur when such plan is consistent with
                      the general plan, and any deviation from normal zoning standards is found to not have
                      any negative effect on the neighborhood and will benefit the future residents and users of
                      the project site.
        D.            To qualify for a planned development, the minimum size of the project shall be two
                      acres.
        E.            The average population density per net acre shall not exceed the maximum population
                      density prescribed by the general plan for the area ( 20 dwelling units per acre)unless the
                      applicant can demonstrate, by the design proposal and such additional evidence as may
                      be submitted, that the objectives of this part will be achieved. However, an increase in
                      density may be authorized by the city council upon receipt of a recommendation from the
                      City Council, of up to, but not exceeding, twenty-five (25) percent of the amount
                      prescribed by the general plan.
13-3.   Planned Development Use Permit Application Plan of Detailed Development
        Application for use permits for the development of land in existing or proposed planned
        development zones shall be accomplished by a plan of detailed development. Such plan shall
        include a map or maps and such written material as may be required to show:
        A.            Topography of land and contour intervals;
        B.             Proposed access, traffic and pedestrian ways;
        C.             Lot design and easements;
        D.            Areas proposed to be dedicated or reserved for parks, parkways, playgrounds, school
                      sites, public or quasi-public buildings and other such uses;
Loyalton	  City	  Zoning	  Ordinance	  #306	  
                                                               83	  
	  

        E.            Areas proposed for commercial or industrial uses, off-street parking, multiple and single-
                      family dwellings, and all other uses proposed to be established within the zone;
        F.            Proposed location of buildings on the land, including all dimensions necessary to indicate
                      size of structure, setback and yard areas;
        G.            Proposed landscaping, fencing and screening;
        H.            Such other detailed elevations, plans and other information as may be required by the
                      City Council to enable it to evaluate adequately the proposed development.
13-4.   Planned Development Deviation from regulations allowed when
        A.            All uses shall conform to the height, area, width, depth, ground coverage and yard
                      regulations normally required for such uses except where the overall development will be
                      improved by a deviation from such regulations. In all cases each structure shall conform
                      to the precise development plan, which shall be made a part of the approved Conditional
                      Use Permit.
        B.            The standards (setbacks, building height, design requirements, etc) to be applied to a
                      project shall be clearly delineated within the application and included in the project
                      development plan. Where specific deviations from required standards have not been
                      approved, and if project standards are not clear within the approved project, the zoning
                      standards most applicable to the project shall be applied.
        C.            Minor modifications to the approved plan, not exceeding ten (10) percent of the most
                      applicable standard, may be approved by the planning director when it can be determined
                      that such modification is consistent with the intent of the approved plan and will have no
                      detrimental effect on adjacent uses and property.
13-5.   Planned Development Delineation on zoning map – Supplemental regulations
        Planned development zones shall be delineated on the zoning map by the P-D designation
        followed by consecutive numbers to indicate the consecutive order of establishment of each such
        zone, and the approved plans and use permits shall constitute supplemental regulations for such
        zones.
13-6.   Planned Development Use permits – Additional information.
        Use permits may specify development completion dates and provide authorization for city
        initiation of reversion to prior zoning classification should the project not proceed within a timely
        manner, or otherwise be inconsistent with the conditions of use permit approval.

        fringe, as determined by the Federal Insurance Administration’s Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for
        the City of Loyalton, dated September 1, 1988, as amended and incorporated herein. The district
        may also be applied to other areas subject to inundation.
17-3.   Uses permitted:
        Those uses permitted in the base zoning district.
17-4.   Uses permitted subject to first obtaining a Use Permit in each case:
        A.            Those uses permitted in the base zoning district when not in compliance with any
                      performance standard set forth in Ordinance 14.01, Floodplain Management of the City
                      Code.
        B.            Floor level: All habitable floor levels shall have an elevation of three (3) feet above the
                      water surface elevation of the one hundred (100) year flood as determined by the Federal
                      Insurance Administration’s Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for the City of Loyalton dated

                      for will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be materially detrimental to

                      working in the neighborhood of such proposed use or be materially detrimental to

        C.            The granting of any Conditional Use Permit may be made subject to terms and conditions
                      as deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the intent and purposes of the entire city
                      code.
        D.            Failure of the City Council to act within the time set out in this chapter shall be deemed
                      to be denial of the application on that date.

                      permit shall expire and become void, unless a written request for extension is received by

                                                      VARIANCES
20-1.   Variances
        Variances may be granted in order to prevent unnecessary hardships that would result from a
        strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of certain regulations prescribed by this part. A
        practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship may result from the size, shape or dimensions of a
        site or the location of existing structures thereon, from geographic, topographic or other physical
        conditions on the site or in the immediate vicinity. A variance shall not be granted to permit a use
        not permitted in the zone by this part. All variances are to be processed as set forth below.
20-2.   Variances Application and Fee
        Application for a variance shall be made to the City in writing on a form prescribed by the City.
        Said application shall be accompanied by a fee set by resolution adopted by the City Council.
20-3.   Variances Public Hearing
        A public hearing and ten calendar day notice thereof shall be required on an application for a
        variance in the manner specified in the California Government Code.
20-4    Variances Findings
        Approval or conditional approval of a variance shall be granted only when the City Council
        makes the following findings:
        A.            Due to special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape,
                      topography, location or surroundings, the strict application of the zoning ordinance
                      deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under
                      identical zoning classification.
        B.            The adjustment authorized by the variance shall not constitute a grant of special
                      privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zone
                      in which such property is situated. The City Council shall impose such conditions as will
                      assure continued compliance with this finding.
        C.            The variance does not authorize a use or activity, which is not otherwise expressly
                      authorized by the zone regulation governing the parcel of real property.

20-5.   Variances Limitation on Filing Identical Application
        After denial of any variance application, reapplication for the same request shall not be accepted
        for filing within six (6) months after the effective date of the denial.
20-6.   Variances Revocation/Modification
        A.            Whenever in the opinion of the City Council the conditions of any variance issued have
                      not been complied with, the City Council shall give the property owner and lessee of the
                      subject roperty a ten (10) calendar days written notice to comply.
        B.            If, at the end of the ten (10) calendar day period, the property owner and lessee still fail to
                      comply with the conditions of approval of the variance, the City Council shall
                      immediately set a hearing before the City Council to determine why the variance should
                      not be revoked/modified. Notice of the hearing shall only be mailed to the property
                      owner and lessee of the subject property involved ten (10) calendar days prior to the
                      hearing. The notice shall state the violations and shall request appearance of the owner
                      and lessee at the time and place specified for the hearing to show cause why the variance
                      should not be revoked or modified. At the conclusion of the hearing, if the City Council
                      determines that any condition of the variance has not been complied with, the City
                      Council shall have the right to revoke or modify the variance. Such revocation or
                      modification shall be subject to the right of appeal in the same manner as set forth in
                      Chapter 12.08.24.

                                     NONCONFORMING USES AND PROPERTY
22-1.   Nonconforming Uses
        A.            Use of Land: Any lawful use of land existing at the time of the adoption of this part or
                      any zoning ordinances or amendment thereto may be continued, although such use does
                      not conform to the regulation specified in such enactment chapter for the zone in which
                      such land is located. A conditional use permit shall first be obtained for any enlargement
                      or expansion of such non-conforming use by 50% or more in size or area.
        B.            Use of Building: Any lawful use of a building existing at the time of the adoption of any
                      zoning ordinance, may be continued, although such use does not conform to the
                      regulations specified for the zone in which such building is located. A conditional use
                      permit shall first be obtained for any enlargement or expansion of such non-conforming
                      use by 50% or more in size or area. However, except as otherwise provided by law,
                      nothing in this part shall prevent the restoring to a safe condition of any part of a building
                      or structure declared unsafe by proper authority.
        C.            Reconstruction of Nonconforming Building: A nonconforming building or structure
                      damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, flood, earthquake or other act, may be restored
                      only if made to conform to all regulations, other than use restrictions, specified by this
                      Part, provided, that such building may be restored to a total floor area not exceeding that
                      of the former building.
        D.            Abandonment: If the actual operation of a nonconforming use ceases for a continuous
                      period of three years, the nonconforming use shall be considered abandoned; unless the
                      legal owner can establish valid proof to the contrary, then without further action by the
                      City Council, the use of such land or building shall be subject to all the regulations
                      specified by this Part.
22-2.   Nonconforming Uses Continued
        The lawful use of lands or buildings existing at the time they become subject to any regulations of
        this part to which they do not conform, may be continued, except that the following provisions
        shall apply unless a use permit allowing such modification and/or expansion is approved:
        A.            No such use shall be enlarged, increased or structurally altered, nor be extended to
                      occupy a greater area than that existing on the effective date of the application of these
                      regulations to the subject property. This includes converting enclosed garage space.

        B.            Any use for which a use permit is required by these regulations shall be considered a

                      1)         No sign shall be erected, constructed or maintained if which sign displays or
                                 makes use of the words “stop”, “danger”, or any other word, phrase, symbol or
                                 character, in such a manner as to interfere with, mislead or confuse traffic.

                                 vehicular traffic. Such colors are not prohibited where, by the design of the sign
                                 or lights used, it is extremely unlikely that such lights could be confused with
                                 traffic signals by the driving public.

        F.            Parking of advertising vehicles prohibited

                      thereon any sign or advertising device for the basic purpose of providing advertisement
                      of products or directing people to a business. This chapter is not intended to apply to
                      standard advertising or identification practices where such signs or advertising devices

                      from Planning Director. Upon failure to comply with such notice within the time
                      specified in such order, the Planning Director is authorized to cause the removal of the
                      advertising copy or message, and the expense incident to such removal shall be the
                      obligation of the owner of the building, or structure or premises on which the advertising

                                             REASONABLE ACCOMODATION
26-1.   Purpose
        This article establishes reasonable and necessary standards for the City of Loyalton, pursuant to
        the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and California Fair Employment and Housing
        Act, Gov. Code Section 12901 et.seq, to provide people with disabilities reasonable
        accommodation in rules, policies, practices and procedures that may be necessary to ensure equal
        access to housing. The purpose of this Article is to provide a process for individuals with
        disabilities to make requests for reasonable accommodation in regard to relief from the various
        land use, zoning or building laws, rules, policies, practices and/or procedures of the City.
26-2.    Requests for reasonable accommodation:
        In order to make specific housing available to an individual with a disability, a disabled person
        and/or their authorized representative may request reasonable accommodation relating to the
        various land use, zoning, or building laws, rules, policies, practices and/or procedures of the City.
        A request for reasonable accommodation in laws, rules, policies, practices and/or procedures may
        be filed at any time that the accommodation may be necessary to ensure equal access to housing.
        If an individual needs assistance in making the request for reasonable accommodation, or
