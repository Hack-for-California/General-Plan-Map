                         CITY OF CORONADO GENERAL PLAN
                                             Introduction
        It is the fundamental goal of the Coronado City Council and the function of this “General
Plan Policy Document” to preserve and improve Coronado primarily as a beautiful, pleasant
residential community in which to live, work, shop, and pursue leisure-time activities.
        State planning and zoning law requires both cities and counties to prepare and adopt a
"comprehensive, long-range general plan" which shall serve as a guide in land use decisions.
The General Plan is considered the jurisdiction’s “Constitution”. The functions performed by a
city General Plan are many and complex, but they can be grouped under three principal
categories:
        1.       First, the plan is an expression of what a community wants. It is a statement of
                 goals, a listing of objectives, and a vision of what might be.
        2.       Second, the plan serves as a guide to decision making. It provides the means for
                 guiding and influencing the many public and private decisions that create the
                 future city.
        3.       Third, the plan in California represents the fulfillment of a legal requirement, and
                 provides legal support for those actions that are taken to implement the plan.
        Each of the following Chapters of this document is a mandatory or permissive “element”
of the Coronado General Plan. (Once adopted, permissive elements have the same force of law
as those elements mandated by the State.) Some elements, like land use, encompass a number of
issues, while others, like noise, focus on a single topic. The requirements for the seven mandated
elements also overlap; several issues, such as the regulation of open space, are mentioned more
than once. While elements may overlap in content, they must be consistent with each other,
internally consistent, and City policies and actions must be consistent with the General Plan.
Each element is identified by a different letter in its page numbers, and has it own “Table of
Contents”, “List of Figures”, and bibliography/ footnote system. The General Plan Policy
Document incorporates the following elements (listed with their chapter letters in brackets):

Introduction
A. City Profile
The City of Coronado is a “general law” city in San Diego County. Coronado (Spanish for “The
Crowned One”) is one of the oldest cities in the region. Incorporated in 1890, Coronado is one of
five cities in the San Diego region to be incorporated before the turn of the century. Coronado is
located on a narrow peninsula of land at the southwestern edge of the San Diego region as shown in
Figure 1. Bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the east by the San Diego Bay, the City
is accessible by the two-mile long San Diego-Coronado Bridge from the east and Silver Strand
Highway from the south.
Coronado is one of the region’s most famous resort communities with the historic Hotel Del
Coronado, two other world-class hotels, and a world-renowned public beach. Military and tourism
are the City’s two major industries. The U.S. Navy, with three bases in the City, has a strong
presence in Coronado. Naval Air Station, North Island was commissioned as a Naval Air Station in
1917 and is the largest aviation industrial complex on the West Coast. The Naval Amphibious Base
Coronado, situated on the Silver Strand, is the West Coast center of special and expeditionary
warfare training and operations. A naval communication station in Coronado, also on the Silver
Strand, borders the City of Imperial Beach to the south.
The City’s proximity to the ocean and its island-like characteristics have resulted in high land and
housing values. The community is nearly built out, with virtually no developable vacant land. With
its bases and recreational resources, it has both a large military population and a substantial transient
daytime tourist population. The community experiences extensive cross-commuting, with many of
its residents working elsewhere in the region and numerous commuters crossing the City to work on
its bases and in its tourist facilities.

B. Housing Element State Policy, Purpose, and Authorization
The California State Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and suitable living
environment for every Californian as the State’s main housing goal. Recognizing the important part
that local planning programs play in pursuit of this goal, the Legislature has mandated that all cities
and counties prepare a Housing Element as part of their comprehensive general plans. The Housing
Element is intended to be an important planning tool for each jurisdiction. State law requires
Housing Elements to be updated periodically according to statutory deadlines to identify the housing
needs of the jurisdiction and establish a strategic plan to meet these needs. The updated Housing
Elements must be submitted to the California Department of Housing and Community
Development for review.
This 2013-2021 Housing Element represents the City of Coronado’s fifth Housing Element and
covers the period of January 1, 2013 through April 30, 2021.
C. Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The City of Coronado’s General Plan contains goals and policies for urban development,
community design, housing, natural hazards, historic preservation, transportation, open space and
conservation, recreation, parking, circulation, noise, and public services and facilities. The content of
this Housing Element is consistent with the goals and policies of all elements of the General Plan. If
any elements of the General Plan are amended during the Housing Element cycle, the City will
ensure that the Housing Element remains consistent.
New State law requires that the Safety and Conservation Elements include an analysis and policies
regarding flood hazard and management information upon revisions to the Housing Element. The
City will ensure compliance with this requirement by reviewing its Safety and Conservation
Elements.
D. Organization of the Housing Element
This Housing Element is organized into the following main components:
        Introduction: Provides a brief overview of the purpose and background for the Housing
         Element.
        Community Profile: Provides an assessment of Coronado’s demographic and housing
         market characteristics and their correlation to housing needs in the community.
        Constraints to the Provision of Housing: Analyzes the various market, governmental, and
         environmental constraints in the City and their impact on the development and preservation
         of housing in Coronado.
        Housing Opportunities and Resources: Provides an inventory of land, financial, and
         administrative resources available to facilitate housing development in Coronado.
         Opportunities for energy conservation are also discussed.

        Housing Plan: Outlines the City’s proposed actions and objectives over the next eight years
         in addressing the housing needs of the community and complying with State law.
The Housing Element also contains a number of appendices, including an evaluation of the City’s
achievements in implementing the previous Housing Element, and a description of the community
outreach activities conducted for this update.
E. Public Participation
The City conducted a public hearing before the Planning Commission on August 14 and a public
hearing before the City Council on September 18 to review to the draft Housing Element. To solicit
input from supportive service and housing providers, the City sent special notices of the public
hearings to housing developers and professionals, as well as agencies that serve or represent the
interest of low and moderate income households and persons with special housing needs. The
Housing Element outreach list is presented in Appendix B. Comments received at these hearings
have been summarized in Appendix B.
F. Data Sources
This Housing Element was updated with various sources of data, including:
        2010 Census and 2006-2010 American Community Survey (ACS)1
        Dataquick home sales
        Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) lending data
        Regional Homeless Task Force Point-in-Time Homeless Census
        Coronado Police Department
        State Department of Social Services database on residential care facilities
        State Employment Development Department data on wage and labor statistics

    Since the 2000 Census, the Bureau of the Census has completely restructured the way it enumerates the U.S.
    population. Specifically, the 2010 Census no longer contains the “long form” that provided detailed information on
    socioeconomic and housing characteristics. To replace the “long form” that occurs only once every decade, the
    Census Bureau conducts the “American Community Survey” that takes a snapshot of the communities based on a
    small sample but relatively frequently. Survey results are then averaged to provide a description of the community
    over time.
                                                                                                     City of Coronado
Page 4                                                                                   2013-2021 Housing Element

Community Profile
This section of the Housing Element discusses the major components of housing need in Coronado.
The major components of this assessment are the City’s population, household, land use, economic,
and housing stock characteristics. Each of these components is presented in a regional context, and,
where relevant, in the context of the other South and East County cities of Chula Vista, Imperial
Beach, La Mesa, Lemon Grove, National City, and San Diego City, as well as cities with
comparable socio-economic demographics such as Del Mar, Encinitas, and Solana Beach. This
needs assessment serves as the basis for identifying the appropriate goals, policies, and programs for
the City to implement during the 2013-2021 Housing Element cycle.
A. Population Characteristics
Understanding the characteristics of a population is vital in the process of planning for the future
needs of a community. Population characteristics affect the type and amount of housing need in a
community. Issues such as population growth, race/ethnicity, age, and employment trends are
factors that combine to influence the type of housing needed in a community and a household’s
ability to afford housing. The following section describes and analyzes the various population
characteristics and trends that affect housing need in Coronado.
1. Population Growth
The Census reported that Coronado’s population declined from 26,540 in 1990 to 24,697 in 2010
(Table 1). The City of Coronado, like the San Diego region as a whole, experienced higher levels of
population growth between 1970 and 1990 than in recent years. The City experienced the greatest
population growth between 1980 and 1990 (57 percent). Some of this growth was due to the
annexation of the Naval Air Station, North Island during that decade. Between 1990 and 2000,
however, Coronado’s population decreased by 9 percent. This decrease was the result of a naval
aircraft carrier (identified as 1990 Census Tract 113.99) that was counted by the 1990 Census and
deployed before the 2000 Census. By 2010, the City’s population increased by approximately three
percent from the previous decade. An increase in population was also experienced by other coastal
communities in the San Diego region, including Encinitas, and San Diego.
The City’s demographic fluctuations are mostly due to its sensitivity to changes in military
population. In 2010, approximately 22 percent of Coronado’s population lived within Census Tracts
113 and 216, which were occupied primarily by the United States military. Tract 113 is entirely
military and consists of the Naval Air Station North Island base. Tract 216 is primarily military, but
does include the Coronado Shores Residential Development that has approximately 714 residents as
of the 2010 Census. However, detailed Census data is not available to allow exclusion of the 714
residents from Tract 216 for most demographic variables. Demographic data for these two Census
tracts are identified whenever possible to estimate the characteristics of the City’s military
population.

In the past, the City has had issues with the Census Bureau’s method of counting its military
population, particularly the tabulation of persons residing on the City’s aircraft carriers. San Diego is
the homeport of 60 vessels for the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard – both of which share piers
in the San Diego Bay. The San Diego Bay is similar to a parking lot that does not have reserved
spaces. The Bay covers three jurisdictions: the City of San Diego; National City; and the City of
Coronado. Vessels are not assigned to any particular jurisdiction. Generally, vessels coming into the
port are given a space based on availability and the depth as well as the draft of the vessel. The
special procedures for counting vessels in San Diego for the 2010 Census are as follows:
       If a vessel was docked in the San Diego Bay on April 1, 2010, then the vessel was attributed
        to the jurisdiction where the vessel was docked.
       If a vessel was out at sea on April 1, 2010, then the vessel was attributed to the jurisdiction
        where the vessel was last docked in the San Diego Bay.
       If the vessel was an aircraft carrier, then the vessel was automatically attributed to
        Coronado, since Naval Air Station North Island’s piers are the only ones that are deep
        enough to dock an aircraft carrier.
In the past, vessels assigned to San Diego Bay that were out at sea during a Census count were
counted as part of the City of San Diego as a default. The exception was for aircraft carriers, which
were counted as part of the City of Coronado. This default method of counting vessels at sea has left
the City of Coronado vulnerable to misleading population fluctuations. The updated method of
counting vessels at sea (used during the 2010 Census) should provide a more accurate representation
of the City’s population.
All military vessels assigned to a homeport in San Diego were placed into one of five collection
blocks according to the special procedures outlined above. The following are the five collection
blocks for the San Diego area:
                                                                                                    City of Coronado
Page 6                                                                                    2013-2021 Housing Element

        U.S. Navy - City of San Diego (block 27529) (Piers 1-5)
        U.S. Navy - Point Loma (which is part of City of San Diego) (block 24208)
        U.S. Navy - National City (block 27878) (Piers 6 – 14 and Mole Pier)
        U.S. Navy - Coronado (block 29625)
        U.S. Coast Guard - Point Loma (City of San Diego) (block 24855)
Unfortunately, during the 2010 Census, an issue arose with the San Diego homeport. In selecting the
collection block to represent vessels located in Coronado, the Census Bureau unknowingly selected a
collection block that contained five tabulation blocks, one of which was located in the City of San
Diego. The vessels that were located in Coronado ended up being tabulated in the one tabulation
block located in the City of San Diego. As a result, vessels were incorrectly tabulated to the City of
San Diego, when they should have been tabulated to Coronado. This error resulted in a
misrepresentation of the population for the City of Coronado, which has since been corrected. This
correction was documented on a letter to the City from the Census Bureau but was not reflected in
all Census or American Community Survey tables as of the writing of this Housing Element.
2. Age Characteristics
A community’s current and future housing needs are determined in part by the age characteristics of
residents. Typically, each age group has distinct lifestyles, family types and sizes, ability to earn
incomes, and therefore, housing preferences. As people move through each stage of life, housing
needs and preferences change. Traditional assumptions are that the young adult population (20 to
34 years old) tends to favor apartments, low to moderate cost townhomes/condominiums, and
smaller single-family units. The adult population (35 to 64 years old) represents the major market
for moderate to relatively high cost condominiums and single-family homes. The senior population
(65 years and older) tends to generate demand for low to moderate cost apartments and
condominiums, small single-family homes, group housing, and mobile homes. In order to create a
balanced community, it is important to provide housing options that suit the needs of various age
groups.
Because of the inaccuracies associated with the 2010 Census, estimates by the San Diego
Association of Governments (SANDAG) has been used to supplement the Census data. The
population of Coronado is, as measured by the median age of its residents, slightly younger than the
population of most neighboring communities and the County as a whole. In 2000, the median age
in Coronado was 34.1 years, higher than the regional median age of 33.2. By 2010, Coronado’s
median age was 31.3 years; roughly three years younger than the County’s median age.
Like with the City’s population trends, Coronado’s age profile fluctuates depending on changes to its
military population. An increase in the City’s military population is often associated with a lowering
of the median age for the City. Conversely, the median age is much higher when military personnel
are deployed and are not tabulated. Figure 2 compares changes in the age composition of
Coronado’s population from 1990 to 2010, while Table 2 compares the percentage of individuals
under 18, over 65, and the median age of Coronado with nearby communities.

3. Race/Ethnicity Characteristics
Race/ethnicity of the population is important to an analysis of housing needs and conditions for
several reasons. A community’s racial and ethnic composition may have implications for housing
needs to the extent that different groups have different household characteristics, income levels, and
cultural backgrounds that may affect their housing needs and preferences. Studies have suggested
that different racial and ethnic groups differ in their attitudes toward and/or tolerance for “housing
problems” as defined by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),
including overcrowding and housing cost burden.2 According to these studies, perceptions regarding
housing density and overcrowding, as well as the cultural practices of living with extended families,
tend to vary among racial and ethnic groups.

In 2010, roughly 73 percent of Coronado residents were White, six percent Black, 14 percent
Hispanic, four percent Asian and Pacific Islander, less than one percent American Indian, and three
percent other races. The City’s proportion of residents of all other racial and ethnic backgrounds is
noticeably lower than that of neighboring jurisdictions and the County. And, when looking only at

Coronado’s non-military Census tracts, the City’s population becomes even less racially/ethnically
diverse. Most notably, Coronado has a higher proportion of White residents and smaller proportion
of Hispanic residents compared to most other neighboring jurisdictions and the County. This
racial/ethnic profile is similar to that of other smaller, coastal communities in the San Diego region,
including Del Mar, Encinitas and Solana Beach.

4. Economic Characteristics
Employment has an important impact on housing needs. Incomes associated with different jobs and
the number of workers in a household determines the type and size of housing a household can
afford. In some cases, the types of jobs themselves can affect housing needs and demand (such as in
communities with military installations, college campuses, and large amounts of seasonal
agriculture). Employment growth typically leads to strong housing demand, while the reverse is true
when employment contracts.
In 2000, the military was the largest employer in Coronado, with 33 percent of the City’s residents
employed in that industry. Only seven percent of the County’s residents were employed in the
military during that time, which demonstrates Coronado’s distinctiveness as a military town.
According to the 2006-2010 ACS, 26 percent of Coronado residents were in the military, compared
to just three percent of the County.
Table 4 summarizes the employment characteristics of the City’s civilian population. In 2000, the
two largest occupational categories for City residents were education/health/social services and
professional services. These categories accounted for over one-third (38 percent) of jobs held by
Coronado residents. Similarly, these occupations comprised 33 percent of jobs held by County

professional services occupations.

single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood and unrelated individuals
living together all constitute a household. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes,
dormitories or other group living situations are not considered households. Household type and
size, income levels, the presence of special needs populations, and other household characteristics
determine the type of housing needed by residents, their preferences, and their ability to obtain
housing the meets their needs. For example, single-person households, often seniors or young adults,
tend to reside in apartment units or smaller single-family homes. Families typically prefer and
occupy single-family homes. This section details the various household characteristics affecting
housing needs.

1. Household Type and Size
a) Household Type
According to the 2010 Census, there were 1,086,865 households in San Diego County. Of these,
7,409 households, or less than one percent, resided in Coronado. Among the Coronado households,
31 percent were single-person households, and households headed by seniors (65+) also comprised
31 percent of all households. Both single-person and senior-headed households represented a much
larger proportion of Coronado’s total households than nearly all neighboring jurisdictions and the
County. When excluding the City’s military tracts, Coronado’s proportion of single-person
households increased slightly; however, the proportion of senior-headed households decreased. In
addition, 29 percent of Coronado households consisted of families with children; a much smaller
proportion than that found in most neighboring jurisdictions and countywide (Table 6).

Table 7 shows that in 2010, Coronado households consisted mostly of families (64 percent). More
of these families were married couples with no children (2,298 or 31 percent), compared to married
couple families with children (1,602 or 22 percent). When looking at the City’s military and non-
military tracts separately, however, different trends in household type can be seen. For example, in
the City’s military tracts, 35 percent of married couples had children while just 26 percent did not
have any children. The greatest change from 2000 to 2010 was the 15 percent increase in other
families (such as grandparents living with grandchildren, siblings or other extended family members
sharing housing arrangements), followed by the 14 percent decrease in other non-family households
(unrelated persons living together).

b) Household Size
Household size is a significant factor in housing demand. Often, household size can be used to
predict the unit size that a household will select. For example, small households (one and two
persons per household) traditionally can find suitable housing in units with zero to two bedrooms
while large households (five or more persons per household) can usually find suitable housing in
units with three to four bedrooms.
People’s choices, however, also reflect preference and economics. Especially during the housing
boom when mortgage credit was readily available, many households extended beyond their financial
means and purchased large homes. In 2010, the average number of persons per household in the San
Diego region ranged from 2.10 to 3.50, with a regionwide average of 2.75 persons per household.
Coronado had an average of 2.31 persons per household, representing a small increase from 2000,
when an average of 2.27 persons per household was recorded. Household size varied among the
cities, with Del Mar, Solana Beach, and Coronado having the lowest average household size among
surrounding and comparable jurisdictions (Table 8).

2. Household Income
Household income is one indicator of the wealth of a community and therefore is directly connected
to the ability to afford housing. As household income increases, the more likely that household is to
be a homeowner. As household income decreases, households tend to pay a disproportionate
amount of their income for housing and the number of persons occupying unsound and
overcrowded housing increases.
For planning and funding purposes, the California State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) has developed the following income categories based on the Area Median
Income (AMI) of a metropolitan area (such as San Diego County):
         Extremely Low Income: households earning up to 30 percent of the AMI
         Very Low Income: households earning between 31 and 50 percent of the AMI
         Low Income: households earning between 51 percent and 80 percent of the AMI
         Moderate Income: households earning between 81 percent and 120 percent of the AMI
         Above Moderate Income: households earning over 120 percent of the AMI
Combined, the extremely low, very low, and low income groups are referred to as lower income.3
Between 2006 and 2008, approximately 70 percent of Coronado households earned moderate or
above moderate incomes (Table 9), while 30 percent of households had incomes in the extremely
low, very low, and low income levels.4 It should be noted that many households in the City may be
considered lower income even if they are rich in assets. In other words, a household could have a
fairly low level of annual earnings, but still be wealthy in other assets.

Household incomes in Coronado tend to be significantly higher than those in the region as a whole.
Median household income in the City was $66,544 in 2000, compared to the San Diego County
3
     Federal housing and community development programs typically assist households with incomes up to 80 percent of
     the AMI and use different terminology. For example, the Federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
     program refers households with incomes between 51 and 80 percent AMI as moderate income (compared to low
     income based on State definition).
4
     Data was obtained from CHAS prepared for HUD by the Census Bureau using 2000 Census data. CHAS data does
     not provide a breakdown of household income for those with more than 80 percent AMI as those households are not
     qualified for federal housing programs.

According to the 2006-2010 ACS, only 13 percent of Coronado households earned less than $25,000
(Figure 5). About 44 percent of Coronado households, however, earned $100,000 or more between
2006 and 2010. Like Coronado, the County’s income distribution between 2006 and 2010 was
skewed toward the higher income categories.

Healthcare and professional service occupations such as legal, architecture, and engineering service
occupations are among the highest paying in the region (Table 4 and Table 5). The significant
proportion of Coronado’s employed population work in these occupations helps to explain the
income disparity between Coronado households and County.
C. Housing Problems
The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) developed by HUD provides detailed
information on housing needs by income level for different types of households in Coronado.
Detailed CHAS data based on the 2006-2008 ACS data is displayed in Table 11. It should be noted
that the data presented in this table are based on special tabulations from the American Community
Survey (ACS) data. Due to the small sample size, the margins of error can be significant especially
for a small community like Coronado. Furthermore, given the high proportion of senior households
in the City, many may be technically considered lower income but are rich in assets.

Housing problems considered by CHAS include:
         Units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom);
         Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room);
         Housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 30 percent of gross income; or
         Severe housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50 percent of gross income.

The types of problems vary according to household income, type, and tenure. Some highlights
include:
         Elderly renter-households had the highest level of housing problems regardless of income
          level (70 percent).
         Approximately 93 percent of very low income (households earning between 31 and 50
          percent of the AMI) and 79 percent of low income households (households earning between
          51 and 80 percent of the AMI) had housing problems.

There are 487 military family housing units in Coronado. Given the generally lower pay scales of
the military, it can be extrapolated that a significant portion of these households may fall under the
lower income groups and many of them experience housing problems such as overcrowding and
overpayment. Military personnel housed in Bachelor Enlisted Quarters or Unaccompanied Housing
are not included in this analysis as they are not considered as “households” by the Census or by
HUD.
1. Overcrowding
A combination of low incomes and high housing costs can force many households to live in
overcrowded housing conditions. “Overcrowding” is generally defined as a housing unit occupied
by more than one person per room in house (including living room and dining rooms, but excluding
hallways, kitchen, and bathrooms). Overcrowding can indicate that a community does not have an
adequate supply of affordable housing, especially for large families.
Overcrowding typically occurs when there are not enough adequately sized units within a
community, when high housing costs relative to income force too many individuals to share a
housing unit than it can adequately accommodate, or when families reside in smaller units than they
need to devote income to other necessities, such as food and health care. Overcrowding tends to
accelerate the deterioration of housing. Therefore, maintaining a reasonable level of occupancy and
alleviating overcrowding are critical to enhancing quality of life.
In 2000, three percent of Coronado households lived in overcrowded conditions (Table 12).
Overcrowding disproportionately affected renters (six percent of renters versus less than one percent
of owners); indicating overcrowding in the City may be the result of an inadequate supply of larger
sized rental units. The City had the smallest percentage of overcrowded units in the San Diego
region in 2000, with the exception of the City of Del Mar. Coronado’s overcrowded housing units
constituted less than one percent of the total overcrowded units in the San Diego region.
The 2010 Census does not contain information of detailed occupancy status. However, the 2006-
2010 ACS provides estimates on overcrowding status. According to the ACS, overcrowding in
Coronado improved slightly between 2000 and 2010, with only two percent of the City’s households
estimated to be overcrowded. However, in close examination, the ACS documents large margins of
errors for these estimates.

2. Overpayment (Cost Burden)
Measuring the portion of a household’s gross income that is spent for housing is an indicator of the
dynamics of demand and supply. This measurement is often expressed in terms of “over payers”:
households paying an excessive amount of their income for housing, therefore decreasing the
amount of disposable income available for other needs. This indicator is an important measurement
of local housing market conditions as it reflects the affordability of housing in the community.
Federal and state agencies use overpayment indicators to determine the extent and level of funding
and support that should be allocated to a community. State and federal programs typically define
over-payers as those lower income households paying over 30 percent of household income for
housing costs. A household is considered experiencing a severe cost burden if it spends more than
50 percent of its gross income on housing.
Table 11 presented earlier provides overpayment detail by income group and household type for
Coronado between 2006 and 2008. Approximately 81 percent of lower income households in the
City overpaid versus 27 percent of moderate and above moderate income households.

D. Special Needs Groups
Certain segments of the population may have more difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing
due to their special needs. Special circumstances may be related to one’s employment and income,
household characteristics, and disability, among other factors. Consequently, certain residents in
Coronado may experience higher incidences of housing overpayment (cost burden), overcrowding,
or other housing problems. The special needs groups analyzed in this Housing Element include
seniors, persons with disabilities, homeless people, single parents, large households, military
personnel, and farmworkers (Table 13). Some of these groups overlap, for example many seniors
have a disability of some type. The majority of these special needs groups could be assisted by an
increase in affordable housing.

The following sections provide a detailed discussion of the housing needs facing each particular
group in Coronado as well as programs and services available to address their housing needs.
1. Seniors
a) Nature and Extent of Needs
Senior-headed households tend to have special needs due to relatively low or fixed incomes,
disabilities or limitations, and health care or dependency needs. Limited discretionary income and

impaired physical mobility can make it difficult for seniors to maintain their homes. Many elderly
also rely on public transportation; especially those with disabilities.
Table 14 shows that 3,479 persons were age 65 and over in Coronado in 2010. This accounted for
about 14 percent of residents, noticeably higher than the percentage found in the region as a whole.
In 2010, 31 percent of the City’s households were headed by someone 65 years old or older. Of these
households, the majority (77 percent) owned their homes, while the remainder (23 percent) rented
their homes.

Roughly 31 percent of Coronado’s senior population was listed as having one or more disabilities in
2000 by the Census. Among these disabilities, the most common were physical disabilities (36
percent) and disabilities that limited/prevented seniors from going outside the home (20 percent).
No updated data on disabilities is available from the 2010 Census or 2006-2010 ACS.
b) Resources
Licensed residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons are permitted by right in all residential
zones. The City’s Zoning Ordinance also accommodates limited residential special care facilities
located in close proximity to hospital services. These facilities are intended to provide the elderly an
opportunity for care and housing within the community that addresses their unique needs and
facilitates their continued participation in community activities. Convalescent hospitals are allowed
in all the Residential Planned Community (RPCD) zone. In January 2012, Coronado was home to
one residential care facility for seniors licensed by the State, which had a total capacity of 120 beds.

2. Persons with Disabilities (including Developmental Disabilities)
a) Types of Disabilities
Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities may prevent a person from working, restrict
one’s mobility, or make it difficult to care for oneself. Thus, disabled persons often have special
housing needs related to limited earning capacity, a lack of accessible and affordable housing, and
higher health costs associated with a disability. Some residents suffer from disabilities that require
living in a supportive or institutional setting.
No updated data on disabilities is available from the 2010 Census or 2006-2010 ACS for Coronado.
The 2005-2007 ACS defines six types of disabilities: sensory, physical, mental, self-care, go-outside-
home and employment. The Census defines sensory and physical disabilities as “long-lasting
conditions.” Mental, self-care, go-outside-home and employment disabilities are defined as
conditions lasting six months or more that makes it difficult to perform certain activities. A more
detailed description of each disability is provided below:
        Sensory disability: Refers to blindness, deafness or severe vision or hearing impairment.
        Physical disability: Refers to a condition that substantially limits one or more basic, physical
         activities, such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting or carrying.
        Mental disability: Refers to a mental condition lasting more than six months that impairs
         learning, remembering or concentrating.
        Self-care disability: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to dress, bathe, or get around
         inside the home.
        Go-outside-home: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to go outside the home alone to
         shop or visit a doctor’s office.
        Employment disability: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to work at a job or
         business.
According to the 2005-2007 ACS, approximately 16 percent of Coronado residents over five years of
age had one type of disability, while 10 percent had two or more types of disabilities. The ACS
tallied the number of disabilities by type for residents with one or more disabilities. Among the
disabilities tallied, physical disabilities were most prevalent, followed by mental and go-outside
home disabilities (Table 15). The higher percentage of residents with disabilities in Coronado is
related to the City’s higher percentage of senior residents.

b) Persons with Developmental Disabilities
A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element discuss the housing needs of persons
with developmental disabilities. As defined by federal law, “developmental disability” means a
severe, chronic disability of an individual that:
        Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical
         impairments;
        Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
        Is likely to continue indefinitely;
        Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major
         life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-
         direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic self- sufficiency; and
        Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or
         generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong or
         extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated.
The Census does not collect or report statistics for developmental disabilities and no other source is
known to have this data for Coronado. According to the State’s Department of Developmental
Services, as of August 2011, about 100 Coronado residents with developmental disabilities were
being assisted at the Developmental Center and Regional Center in San Diego. Most of these
individuals were residing in a private home with their parent or guardian and 37 of these persons
with developmental disabilities were under the age of 18.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional
housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where
supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional
environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental
disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally
                                                                                                            City of Coronado
Page 24                                                                                           2013-2021 Housing Element

disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of
independence as an adult.
c) Housing Needs of Persons with Disabilities
The most obvious housing need for persons with disabilities is housing that is adapted to their needs.
Most single-family homes are inaccessible to people with mobility and sensory limitations. Some
housing units are not easily adaptable to accommodate widened doorways and hallways, access
ramps, larger bathrooms, lowered countertops, and other features necessary for accessibility.
Location of housing is also an important factor for many persons with disabilities, as they often rely
upon public transportation to travel to necessary services and shops. “Barrier free design” housing,
accessibility modifications, proximity to services and transit, and group living opportunities are
important in serving this group. Incorporating barrier-free design in new multi-family housing
developments is especially important to provide the widest range of choices for the disabled.
d) Resources
State and federal legislation mandate that a specified number of units in new or rehabilitated multi-
family apartment complexes be accessible to individuals with limited physical mobility. The City
also has a ministerial procedure to review and approve requests for reasonable accommodation for
persons with disabilities. A request for reasonable accommodation may include an application for a
modification or exception to the application of zoning and building standards and use of housing or
housing-related facilities in order to eliminate identifiable regulatory barriers to provide a person
with a disability an equal opportunity to housing.
3. Large Households
a) Nature and Extent of Needs
Large households are defined as those consisting of five or more members. These households
comprise a special need group because of the often limited supply of adequately sized and affordable
housing units in a community, especially large rental housing. To save for other basic necessities
such as food, clothing and medical care, it is common for lower income large households to reside in
smaller units, which frequently results in overcrowding and can result in accelerated unit
deterioration.
Table 16 compares the number of large households in Coronado to that of the San Diego region. In
2010, just six percent of households in Coronado consisted of five or more persons, compared to 14
percent region wide. Among large households in Coronado, the 2010 Census reported 42 percent
were owner-households and 58 percent were renter-households.

              Source: Bureau of the Census, 2010 Census.
Overall, a greater percentage of larger households (53 percent) had housing problems than all
households (44 percent) in Coronado between 2006 and 2008. According to the 2006-2008 ACS, the
majority of owner-occupied large households (63 percent) had a housing problem (cost burden),
while just under half of renter-occupied large households (48 percent) had one or more housing
problems. It should be noted however, that this data is based on special tabulations from the
American Community Survey (ACS) data and due to the small sample size, the margins of error can
be significant (see Table 11). Furthermore, this measurement is based on income, excluding assets
such as savings and equity.
b) Resources
Given the high costs of housing in Coronado, few households in the City can take advantage of
housing programs funded through State and federal funds. For example, the Housing Choice
Voucher program (formerly known as Section 8 Certificates) is a rent subsidy program for lower
income renter-households. However, the high rents in Coronado render most units ineligible to
participate in this program. Only about 20 households in Coronado utilize Housing Choice
Vouchers. In response, the former Community Development Agency of the City of Coronado
partnered with nonprofit housing developers to create permanent affordable housing for its residents
(see Table 26 on page 39 of this Housing Element for an inventory of affordable rental housing
available in Coronado).
4. Single-Parent Households
a) Nature and Extent of Needs
Single-parent households, particularly female-headed families with children, often require special
consideration and assistance because of their greater need for affordable housing and accessible day
care, health care, and other supportive services. Female-headed families with children are
considered a vulnerable group because they must balance the needs of their children with work
responsibilities, often while earning limited incomes.
An estimated seven percent of Coronado households were headed by single parents in 2010 (Table
17), the large majority of which were headed by females (78 percent). According to the 2006-2010
ACS, 39 percent of female-headed single-parent households had incomes below the poverty level.

b) Resources
Lower income single-parent households can benefit from programs that provide direct rental
assistance or that will facilitate the development of affordable housing (see Table 26 on page 39 of
this Housing Element for an inventory of affordable rental housing available in Coronado).
5. Homeless
a) Nature and Extent of Needs
With the long-lasting recession, homelessness is a persistent issue in the San Diego region.
However, budget cuts at the federal, State, and local levels have impaired the ability of local
governments in addressing the homeless needs.
Section 65583(a)(7) of the Government Code mandates that municipalities address the special needs
of homeless persons within their jurisdictional boundaries. “Homelessness” as defined by the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), describes an individual (not imprisoned or
otherwise detained) who:
        Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; and
        Has a primary nighttime residence that is:
         o A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living
              accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, and transitional housing
              for the mentally ill);
         o An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be
              institutionalized; or
         o A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping
              accommodation for human beings.
This definition does not include persons living in substandard housing, unless it has been officially
condemned; persons living in overcrowded housing (for example, doubled up with others); persons
being discharged from mental health facilities (unless the person was homeless when entering and is
considered to be homeless at discharge); or persons who may be at risk of homelessness (for
example, living temporarily with family or friends).
The Regional Task Force on the Homeless (RTFH) is San Diego County’s leading resource for
information on issues of homelessness. RTFH is a public/private effort to build a base of
City of Coronado
2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                            Page 27

understanding about the multiple causes and conditions of homelessness. RTFH compiles data from
a physical Point-In-Time (PIT) count of sheltered (emergency and transitional) and street homeless
persons. The 2012 RTFH Count provided a statistically adjusted homeless population of 36 persons
in Coronado.5 However, according to a Coronado Police Department memorandum from April
2012, a more accurate homeless count for the City is six persons. This estimate was based on
observations and direct contacts by police officers.
b) Resources
Given the City’s location and small homeless population, no homeless shelters or service agencies
are located in the City. However, homeless persons in needs are directed to services and facilities
available in Downtown San Diego. Specifically, the Rescue Mission operates a 60-bed facility for
women with children who are victims of domestic violence, Catholic Charities operates a 35-bed
facility for homeless women, and Volunteers of America operates a 34-bed facility for homeless men
and women with substance abuse issues.
6. Farmworkers
a) Nature and Extent of Needs
Agricultural workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farm laborers work in the fields, processing
plants, or support activities on a generally year-round basis. When workload increases during
harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal labor, often supplied by a labor
contractor. For some crops, farms may employ migrant workers, defined as those whose travel
distance to work prevents them from returning to their primary residence every evening.
Determining the true size of the agricultural labor force is problematic. Government agencies that
track farm labor do not consistently define farmworkers (e.g., field laborers versus workers in
processing plants), length of employment (e.g., permanent or seasonal), or place of work (e.g., the
location of the business or field). Further limiting the ability to ascertain an accurate number of
agricultural workers within Coronado is the limited data available on the City due to its relatively
small size. Therefore, the Census is the only source of information that can be referenced. According
to both the 2000 Census and 2006-2010 ACS, only about 0.5 percent of Coronado’s residents were
employed in farming, forestry, or fishing occupations. Given that the City does not have any
agricultural land and is relatively isolated from land in agricultural production, residents employed
in these occupations are likely owners or managers and not laborers.

    The Regional Housing Task Force on Homeless study indicates Coronado has 36 homeless. There were actually only
    4 individuals that were witnessed, along with 16 vehicles that were identified as potential living quarters. The study
    uses a multiplier of two persons per vehicle, resulting in a total homeless population of 36 persons. However, seven
    were identified at the Tidelands Parking lot and those could be vehicles of boat owners living in close proximity who
    store their vehicles at Tidelands. Therefore, the City does not believe the RHTF study accurately reflects the extent of
    homelessness in the community.
                                                                                                       City of Coronado
Page 28                                                                                    2013-2021 Housing Element

Because a negligible portion of community residents are employed in farming, fishing, and forestry
occupations and there is no potential for significant expansion within this occupational category
during the planning period, no housing programs or policies are needed to address the needs of
farmworkers.
7. Military Households
a) Nature and Extent of Needs
The military population’s influence on the demand for housing takes two forms: (1) existing
military households trying to find housing; and (2) former military households trying to remain in
the community. Often, the housing needs of military personnel are affected by lower incomes and an
uncertain length of residency. In the San Diego region, military populations are centered around
Naval Base Coronado, Camp Pendleton, Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, and other Navy
stations in the San Diego Bay areas.
b) Resources
The housing needs of most military personnel based in Coronado are met by the United States
Navy. As shown in Table 18, Coronado has a mixture of on-base and privatized off-base housing.
There are 487 military family housing units in Coronado. In addition, there are 2,310 permanent
and 880 transient Bachelor Enlisted Quarters (BEQ) or “Unaccompanied Housing” at Naval Air
Station North Island and Naval Amphibious Base. These living quarters are designed community
housing for two persons per unit; however, they are not always occupied by two persons.

For military personnel that are not accommodated in base housing, the federal Servicemembers
Civil Relief Act (SCRA), signed into law in 2003, offers protections and benefits if they are relocated
or activated for military duty. The SCRA affords military personnel and their families an early lease
termination option, eviction protection, mortgage relief, interest rate caps, and the ability to reopen
default judgments under certain circumstances.

E. Housing Stock Characteristics
The characteristics of the housing stock, including growth, type, tenure, vacancy rates, age and
condition, housing costs, and affordability are important in determining the housing needs for the
community. This section details the housing stock characteristics of Coronado to identify how well
the current housing stock meets the needs of current and future residents of the City.
1. Housing Growth
Consistent with an urbanized, largely built-out community, Coronado has experienced relatively
little housing growth since 1990. The City has very little vacant land available for new housing
construction. Thus, structures must be demolished before new housing is built. The housing stock in
the City grew from 9,145 units in 1990 to 9,634 units in 2010, or a five-percent increase over 20 years
(Table 19). Specifically, 180 of these dwelling units were constructed at Silver Strand II. Overall,
housing growth in suburban South County areas has been limited, compared to countywide growth;
Chula Vista, the notable exception, experienced substantial growth with build out of several large
master plans over the last 20 years.

2. Housing Type
Coronado maintains a diverse housing stock. Figure 6 shows that in 2010, a majority of Coronado’s
housing stock was made up of single-family dwellings (57 percent); however, the City has a
substantial proportion of multi-family units. Multi-family units accounted for 43 percent of the City’s
housing stock, compared to only 36 percent of units region wide.

3. Housing Tenure and Availability
a) Tenure
Housing tenure and vacancy rates are important indicators of the supply and demand of housing.
Housing tenure refers to whether a unit is owned or rented. The tenure distribution of a
community’s housing stock can be an indicator of several aspects of the housing market, including
the affordability of units, household stability and residential mobility, among others. In most
communities, tenure distribution generally correlates with household income, composition and age
of the householder.
In 2000, among the City’s occupied housing units, approximately 52 percent were owner-occupied,
while 48 percent were renter-occupied (Table 20). The homeownership rate for the City has
remained relatively steady over the past 10 years. According to the 2010 Census, the home
ownership rate in Coronado decreased only slightly to 49 percent of occupied units. Renter-occupied
housing units made up just over one-half (51 percent) of the City’s occupied housing stock. In the
City’s military tracts, however, renters made up a much larger proportion of occupied housing units
(65 percent).

b) Household Size by Tenure
As shown in Table 21, renter-occupied households had a slightly higher average household size than
owner-occupied households in 2010. The average renter-household size in 2010 was 2.35 persons
compared to 2.26 persons for the average owner-household. In 2000, average household size was
nearly identical for renters and owners.

c) Vacancy Rates
Vacancy rates are an important housing indicator because they indicate the degree of choice
available. High vacancy rates usually indicate low demand and/or high supply conditions in the
housing market. Too high of a vacancy rate can be difficult for owners trying to sell or rent. Low
vacancy rates usually indicate high demand and/or low supply conditions in the housing market.
Too low of a vacancy rate can force prices up, making it more difficult for lower and moderate
income households to find housing. Vacancy rates between two to three percent are usually
considered healthy for single-family or ownership housing; and five to six percent for multi-family or
rental housing.
According to the 2010 Census, the overall vacancy rate in Coronado was 23 percent; however, a vast
majority of these vacant units were for seasonal, recreational, or occasional use. Excluding these
units, the City has a vacancy rate of approximately five percent. Specifically, ownership housing had
a vacancy rate of 2.4 percent and rental housing had a vacancy rate of 4.8 percent. Additional
vacancy information was obtained in fall 2011 from the San Diego County Apartment Association
(SDCAA) and is shown in Table 22. Vacancy rates in Coronado were slightly lower than those in
neighboring communities and the County as a whole.

In addition to data from the San Diego County Apartment Association, the City of Coronado
conducts an Apartment Vacancy Survey to determine the vacancy rate for its apartment rental
housing stock. For 2010, the vacancy rate was two percent.
4. Housing Age and Condition
Housing age can be an important indicator of housing condition within a community. Typically,
housing over 30 years of age is more likely to have rehabilitation needs that may include new
plumbing, roof repairs, foundation work and other repairs.
Coronado is one of the oldest cities in San Diego County, subdivided in 1886, it was incorporated in
1890. Accordingly, the City’s housing stock is significantly older than the County’s housing stock
(Figure 7); about 78 percent of the City’s housing stock was constructed over 30 years ago, while
only 57 percent of the County’s housing stock is of this age. Despite the age of its housing stock, the
City has a minimal number of units in need of repair and/or rehabilitation. Most Coronado
residents have the means to maintain and improve their properties over time. For other properties
that begin to exhibit a need for maintenance, high land costs and market pressures facilitate turnover
that often results in improvement or redevelopment. Based upon a combination of previous
“windshield surveys,” observations, and experiences of the code enforcement and planning staff, and
indicators from other surveys, the City staff has estimated that less than 0.05 percent of housing units
in the City need some degree of rehabilitation or replacement to meet minimum housing standards.

5. Housing Costs and Affordability
Housing costs are indicative of housing accessibility to all economic segments of the community.
This section discusses the costs and affordability of the Coronado housing stock.
a) Home Ownership Market
In 2010, median home prices in the South County area ranged from $201,000 in National City to
$1,100,000 in the City of Coronado (Figure 8). Coronado’s median home price was one of the
highest in the entire County, but comparable to the other beachside communities of Del Mar and
Solana Beach. Median home sale prices in Coronado did not change significantly between 2009 and
2010. Other San Diego cities, however, saw noticeable increases in their median home prices during
this time period after significant decreases between 2007 and 2009.

b) Rental Market
The primary source of information on rental costs in the San Diego region is the San Diego County
Apartment Association (SDCAA). The SDCAA mailed 6,000 surveys in August of 2011 to rental
property owners and managers throughout San Diego County. Responses were received from
owners and managers of 19,915 units. Table 24 shows that in the fall of 2011, average monthly rents
in Coronado ranged from $1,288 for a one-bedroom apartment to $1,647 for a two-bedroom
apartment. Apartment rents in Coronado are among the highest in all of San Diego County.

c) Housing Affordability by Income Level
Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning a home in the City
with the maximum affordable housing costs for households at different income levels. Taken
together, this information can generally show who can afford what size and type of housing and
indicate the type of households most likely to experience overcrowding and overpayment.
The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts annual household
income surveys nationwide to determine a household’s eligibility for federal housing assistance.
Based on this survey, the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
developed income limits, based on the Area Median Income (AMI), which can be used to determine
the maximum price that could be affordable to households in the upper range of their respective
income category. Households in the lower end of each category can afford less by comparison than
those at the upper end.
Table 25 shows the maximum amount that a household at the upper end of each income category
can pay for housing each month without incurring a cost burden (overpayment). This amount can
be compared to current housing asking prices (Table 23) and market rental rates (Table 24) to
approximate what types of housing opportunities a household in Coronado can afford.
Extremely Low income Households
Extremely low income households earn 30 percent or less of the County AMI – up to $17,200 for a
one-person household and up to $26,550 for a five-person household in 2012. Extremely low
income households cannot afford market-rate rental or ownership housing in Coronado.
Very Low income Households
Very low income households earn between 31 percent and 50 percent of the County AMI – up to
$28,700 for a one-person household and up to $44,250 for a five-person household in 2012. Given
the high cost of housing in Coronado, very low income households could not afford to rent or
purchase a home in the City.
Low income Households
Low income households earn between 51 percent and 80 percent of the County AMI - up to $45,850
for a one-person household and up to $70,750 for a five-person household in 2012. Low income
households cannot afford homeownership in Coronado. Some low income households may be able
get very small rental units in the City but would not be able to find adequately sized affordable
apartment units in the City (Table 24).
Moderate income Households
Moderate income households earn between 81 percent and 120 percent of the County AMI – up to
$97,100 depending on household size in 2011. Appropriately-sized market-rate rental housing is
generally affordable to households in this income group but homeownership in Coronado is still
beyond the financial means of moderate income households.

2. Preservation of At-Risk Housing
State law requires that the City identify, analyze, and propose programs to preserve existing
affordable multi-family rental units that are eligible to convert to market rate uses due to termination
of subsidy contract, mortgage prepayment, or expiring use restrictions during the next ten years.
Thus, this at-risk housing analysis covers the period from January 1, 2013 through December 31,
2022. Consistent with State law, this section identifies publicly assisted housing units in Coronado
and analyzes their potential to convert to market rate housing uses.
Within the 2013-2022 “at-risk” housing analysis period, no properties are considered at risk of
converting to market-rate housing.

G. Housing in the Coastal Zone
1. Coastal Housing Requirements
The entire City of Coronado is located within the coastal zone. California law requires the Housing
Element to include an analysis of units constructed, demolished and replaced within three miles of
the coastal zone. The purpose is to ensure the affordable housing stock within the coastal zone is
being protected and provided as required by Government Code.                    Specifically, California
Government Code Section 65588(c) requires each periodic revision of the Housing Element to
include the following information relating to housing in the Coastal Zone:
       The number of new housing units approved for construction within the coastal zone since
        January 1, 1982;
       The number of housing units for persons and families of low or moderate income required to
        be provided in new housing developments either within the coastal zone or within three
        miles of the coastal zone as a replacement for the conversion or demolition of existing
        coastal units occupied by low or moderate income persons;
       The number of existing residential units occupied by persons and families of low or
        moderate income that have been authorized to be demolished or converted since January 1,

       The number of residential units for persons and families of low or moderate income that
        have been required for replacement units.
The coastal replacement housing requirements do not apply to the following:
       The conversion or demolition of a residential structure which contains less than three
        dwelling units, or, in the event that a proposed conversion or demolition involves more than
        one residential structure, the conversion or demolition of 10 or fewer dwelling units.
       The conversion or demolition of a residential structure for purposes of a nonresidential use
        which is either "coastal dependent” or “coastal related”, such as visitor-serving commercial
        or recreational facilities, coastal-dependent industry, or boating or harbor facilities.
       The conversion or demolition of a residential structure located within the jurisdiction of a
        local government which has within the area encompassing the coastal zone, and three miles
        inland therefrom, less than 50 acres, in aggregate, of land which is vacant, privately owned
        and available for residential use.
       The conversion or demolition of a residential structure located within the jurisdiction of a
        local government which has established a procedure under which an applicant for
                                                                                         City of Coronado

         conversion or demolition will pay an in-lieu fee into a program, the various provisions of
         which, in aggregate, will result in the replacement of the number of dwelling units which
         would otherwise have been required.
2. Housing in Coronado Coastal Zone
a)       New Construction
As of April 2012, 1,561 housing units have been newly constructed since 1982. All of these units
have been within the Coastal Zone.
b) Affordable Housing
Government Code Section 65590 (d) (also known as the Mello Act) states that “new housing
developments constructed within the coastal zone shall, where feasible, provide housing units for
persons and families of low and moderate income, as defined in Section 50093 of the Health and
Safety Code. Where it is not feasible to provide these housing units in a proposed new housing
development, the local government shall require the developer to provide such housing, if feasible to
do so, at another location within the same city or county, either within the coastal zone or within
three miles of.”
This City of Coronado has established an inclusionary housing policy. The inclusionary housing
program requires that parcel or subdivision maps involving two or more lots or two or more
dwelling units provide 20 percent of the total units in the development for rent to lower-income
households, or “for sale” to moderate-income households, or pay an in-lieu fee. No “inclusionary”
units have ever been constructed, but in-lieu fees have contributed to the Community Development
Agency’s housing inventory.
c) Demolished/Converted Low and Moderate Income Housing
Since 1982, 632 housing units have been demolished in the City, resulting in a net gain of 929
housing units over an approximately 30-year period. None of the units demolished were affordable.
It should be noted that a majority of this housing development occurred in the 1980s and 1990s with
the build-out of the Coronado Cays, Coronado Point, and many condominium development
projects. In the previous decade, there has only been an average net gain of five to six housing units
annually, reflecting the fairly built out nature of the community.
d) Replacement Housing
Construction in the City occurs primarily as recycling of older single-family units into new single-
family homes or small multi-family complexes. Furthermore, the City is primarily built out and has
less than 50 acres of land within the Coastal Zone that is vacant and designated for residential uses.
Therefore, the City is not subject to the replacement requirement.

Constraints to the Provision of Housing
Actual or potential constraints to the provision of housing affect the development of new housing
and the maintenance of existing units for all income levels. Both governmental and non-
governmental constraints can affect the cost, supply, and demand for housing. Governmental
constraints can include such factors as government land use controls and development standards,
while non-governmental constraints would encompass factors such as market mechanisms, physical
or environmental constraints, and the health of the economy. This chapter addresses those
constraints that are relevant to the people who live and work in Coronado.
A. Governmental Constraints
Governmental constraints can limit the operations of the public, private, and nonprofit sectors,
making it difficult to meet the demand for affordable housing and limiting supply in a region. Such
constraints can limit access to housing to or from various ethnic, racial, or social groups, or prevent
lower-income segments of society from attaining adequate housing opportunities. Potential
governmental constraints include, but are not limited to, growth management measures,
inclusionary zoning, land use controls, building codes, processing fees and procedures, exactions,
property taxes, and site improvement costs.
1. Land Use Controls
a) General Plan Land Use Element
Land use controls take a number of forms that affect the development of residential units. The
General Plan, a comprehensive, long-range, and general policy statement, establishes the overall
character and development of the community. The City’s General Plan identifies a broad range of
residential land use categories. The plan provisions do not constrain the opportunity for a broad
range of housing types and densities. General Plan residential land use categories are summarized
below:
        Very Low Density Residential (up to 8 units / acre) (R1A, R1CC-1, R1CC-2, R1CC-3
         Zones): This category is intended to preserve the character of existing neighborhoods by
         assuring that reconstruction and replacement activities are totally compatible with the
         current very low-density residential patterns of the neighborhoods. While this designation
         typically denotes neighborhoods composed of detached single-family dwellings, occupying
         separate lots, in certain areas of this land use designation, duplex construction or
         construction of a second detached single-family dwelling is permissible on lots that are at
         least twice the size of the minimum lot size required in the corresponding R-1A Zone.
        Low Density Residential (12 units / acre) (R-1B Zone): This category is intended to
         preserve the character of existing neighborhoods by assuring that reconstruction and
         replacement activities are compatible with the current low-density residential patterns of the
City of Coronado
2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                       Page 43

        neighborhoods. This designation typically denotes neighborhoods composed of detached
        single-family dwellings, occupying separate lots, or duplex construction. On a 7,000 square
        foot lot, two dwelling units are permitted.
       Medium Density Residential (28 units / acre): This category is intended to provide medium
        density residential opportunities typified by apartment or condominium development,
        interspersed with lower density duplex and single-family dwellings. The designation
        corresponds with the R-3 Zone.
       High Density Residential (40 units / acre): This category is intended to provide high density
        residential opportunities typified by apartment or condominium development. This
        designation corresponds with the R-4 Zone and designation in the Orange Avenue Corridor
        Specific Plan.
       Very High Density Residential: (47 units / acre): This category denotes the Coronado
        Shores Condominium development consisting of ten sixteen-story condominium buildings
        and accessory residential and club facilities. This designation corresponds to the R-5 Zone.
        No additional development potential exists in this designation and zone.
b) Orange Avenue Corridor Specific Plan
The City adopted a specific plan for the Orange Avenue Corridor in 2003 to provide development
standards and design criteria intended to enhance downtown Coronado and maintain its “village”
character. The specific plan area stretches from First Street in the north and continues to Adella
Avenue in the south. In addition to Orange Avenue, the project area includes some blocks adjacent
to Orange Avenue at both its north and south ends. The specific plan includes approximately 14.5
acres of land designated and zoned R-4, which is intended for high density multi-family residential
use up to 40 units per acre. Policy direction, development standards, and design criteria for the R-4
Zone is contained in the Specific Plan.
c) Coronado Cays Specific Plan
The Coronado Cays is a planned residential community on the Silver Strand in the Southerly
portion of Coronado. The Coronado Cays is surrounded by bay and State beach. The development
was governed by a Special Use Permit issued by the City in 1968, and later superseded by the
Coronado Cays Specific Plan adopted in 2001. The plan details land uses and regulations. The
Specific Plan permits multiple family, townhouse and detached single family residential construction
not to exceed an average density for the total project of 10.89 dwelling units per acre. The Coronado
Cays is built out with little capacity for additional residential development.
                                                                                         City of Coronado

2. Citywide Development Standards
Zoning ordinances directly shape the form and intensity of residential development by providing
controls over land use, heights and volumes of buildings, and open space on a site. Table 27 provides
a summary of Coronado’s residential zoning regulations. The residential zones that have the greatest
opportunities for additional development are the R-1B, R-3, and R-4 Zones. The R-1 Zone is the
lowest density zone and is the only zone that has sub-zones differing in the required minimum lot
size. This zone, while expected to experience some minor redevelopment during this Housing
Element cycle, is not expected to have a significant net increase in dwelling unit numbers. The R-5
Zone is composed solely of the Coronado Shores, which is a condominium complex built at a
density of 47 dwelling units per acre with no possibility of any additional development or increase in
density.
In general, all new dwelling units require two parking spaces. However, the R-5 Zone requires only
1.5 spaces per unit, affordable housing requires only 1.5 spaces per unit, and senior housing requires
only one space per unit. For example, the City approved a 30-unit housing project available to very
low and low income senior tenants, aged 55 and over. This project received a reduction in parking
due to the provision of senior and affordable housing. Overall, the City’s parking standards for large
units (regardless of affordability) either match, or are lower than, the parking standards set forth in
the State Density Bonus law. To facilitate the development of smaller affordable units, the City’s
Density Bonus Ordinance allows the parking standard for multi-family development to be reduced
upon developer request to just one space per studio or one-bedroom unit, meeting the State Density
Bonus law requirements.
Both the R-3 and R-4 Zones require that a minimum of 25 percent of the total site area of new
residential developments be landscaped. “Landscaping” is defined to include water features and
“decorative screens, fences, ornamental post lamps, decorative rock or other paved surfaces, decks,
fixed seating, fire pits and similar garden hard surfaces features…” However, the Municipal Code
states for multi-family dwelling development, not more than three-quarters of the landscaping
required may be provided by the use of either water features or by the use of water features and
decorative hard surfaces, and not more than one-half may be provided by just decorative hard
surfaces.
In addition to the residential categories listed in Table 27, three other zones, the Residential Planned
Community Development Zone (R-PCD), Planned Community Development Overlay Zone (PCD),
and Residential-Special Care Development (R-SCD) allow for residential development. The R-PCD
Zone provides for orderly, comprehensively planned residential development, including related open
space and accessory community services consisting of desirable recreational and commercial
facilities, as well as maintenance and operational facilities essential to the development. The PCD
Zone allows for residential land development consisting of a related group of residential housing
types. Any combination of residential housing types, such as single-family dwelling buildings or
duplexes, cluster housing, patio homes, townhouses, apartments, condominiums or cooperatives,
along with open spaces and community services, can be planned in this zone. The R-SCD helps to
provide limited residential special care facilities in close proximity to hospital services. All three of

these zones are presently fully developed with either relatively new condominium complexes or
operating special care facilities. Additional development in these zones seems unlikely during the
timeframe of this Housing Element.
Residential project applications are reviewed for compliance with the City’s General Plan elements
and Zoning Ordinance, which is a standard process required under state law. Design review is
required for multi-family dwellings and projects that require a Special Use Permit (SUP). For
properties designated historic, the Historical Resource Commission serves as the Design Review
Commission rather than having two separate commissions reviewing a single project. This helps to
streamline the process for developers.
The City’s review process ensures that the goals, policies, and purpose of the General Plan elements
and Zoning Ordinance are carried out in the physical plan of a residential development. This review
includes density, height, setbacks, open space, infrastructure, and other improvements to promote
harmonious and workable relationships among land uses in accordance with the planned long-term
build-out of community areas. As detailed below, the City’s project review process, which uses the
State-mandated land use tools of General Plan Elements and Zoning Ordinance, neither creates
impediments or onerous governmental constraints to residential development, nor unduly lengthens
the development process.
Finally, the City has carefully gauged the development standards of its residential zones to the
residential density permitted in them. During multiple comprehensive reviews since 2000, ad hoc
task forces, with professional assistance, the City developed theoretical model projects with varying
development standards to test whether typical projects could achieve the maximum density in each
zone. For example, parking areas were designed on typically configured lots to assure that the
number of required parking spaces could be provided for the density allowed by the zoning within
the area that was developable given the site’s allowed setbacks, structural coverage, floor area ratio,
height, number of stories, and required landscaping. Therefore, the cumulative impact of
development standards such as parking standards, yard setbacks, required landscaping, height, and
number of stories permitted, et cetera, do not impede a development project to achieve the intensity
that is designated for the property.

Note 1: Affordable housing requires only 1.5 spaces per unit; senior housing requires only one space per unit. To facilitate the development of smaller affordable units, the City’s Density Bonus
Ordinance allows the parking standard for multi-family development to be reduced upon developer request to just one space per studio or one-bedroom unit, meeting the State Density Bonus law
requirements.

3. Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types
Housing element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made available
through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the development of a variety of
types of housing for all income levels. This section describes the City’s provisions for single-family
housing, duplexes, multi-family housing, manufactured housing, carriage houses, residential care
facilities, boarding houses, transitional housing, and emergency shelters. Table 28 summarizes the
City’s zoning provisions for various types of housing.

a) Manufactured Housing
In 2010, the City implemented a program of the 2005-2010 Housing Element by amending the
Zoning Ordinance to accommodate manufactured housing. The Zoning Ordinance defines
“manufactured housing” as a type of housing unit that is largely assembled in factories and then
transported to sites of use and installed on a foundation system, pursuant to Section 18551 of the
Health and Safety Code, and certified under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and
Safety Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5401 et. seq.). This type of housing is permitted by right in
the R-1A, R-1A(BF), R-1B, and R-3 zones. Manufactured housing must conform to the
development standards for the zone in which the structure is located with the exception of
architectural requirements concerning the manufactured home’s roof overhang, roofing materials,
and siding materials as follows:
          A minimum roof overhang shall be provided that is at least one-third the required side yard
           setback.
          Roofing materials shall consist of composition shingle, asphalt or other material typically
           found on a wood frame house.
          Exterior materials shall be of natural material including but not limited to wood, stucco, and
           siding. Prefabricated siding is prohibited.
                                                                                                           City of Coronado
Page 48                                                                                          2013-2021 Housing Element

b) Carriage House
The Coronado Zoning Ordinance defines a “carriage house” as a two-story accessory building or
structure containing an enclosed garage on the first story and a “habitable unit” on the second story
and is detached from the main building. “Habitable unit” means one or more connected habitable
rooms, not containing kitchen, kitchenette or cooking facilities, but designed for use by a single-
family as a separate accommodation for living or sleeping purposes. Carriage Houses are permitted
in the R-1A, R-1B, R-3, and R-4 Zones provided that the lots and structures meet certain
development and occupancy standards specified in the Zoning Ordinance. For example, the
habitable unit cannot exceed 400 square feet in size and may be only for use by the resident of the
main building or such resident’s guests. The units cannot be separately leased from the main
building. The City has approved building permits for many carriage houses within each residential
zone on lots ranging in size from 3,500 square feet to over 10,500 square feet.
c) Second Dwelling Unit
A second unit is permitted in the R-1AE zone if the minimum lot size is 10,500 square feet. State
law requires that local jurisdictions allow for ministerial approval of “second dwelling units.”
Second dwelling units are attached or detached dwelling units that provide complete independent
living facilities for one or more persons including permanent provisions for living, sleeping, cooking
and sanitation (Government Code Section 65852.2). The City has never received a request to
construct a second dwelling unit. Should such a request be received, the City would, without
discretionary review, apply the criteria established in California Government Code Section
65852.2(b).
d) Residential Care Facility
In 2010, the City implemented a program of the 2005-2010 Housing Element by amending the
Zoning Ordinance and Orange Avenue Corridor Specific Plan to accommodate residential care
facilities serving six or fewer persons. These facilities are defined as State-authorized, certified, or
licensed family care homes, foster homes, or group homes serving six or fewer mentally disordered
or otherwise handicapped persons or dependent and neglected children where care is provided on a
24-hour-a-day basis. Residential care facilities serving six or fewer residents are permitted by right in
all residential zones in accordance with State law.
e) Boarding House
 “Boarding house” is broadly defined in the Zoning Ordinance to encompass buildings that contain
two or more habitable units with common kitchen and dining facilities. These facilities require a
Major SUP in the R-3 and R-4 Zones. Given the City’s limited supply of R-4 land, boarding houses
in this zone must be combined with a residential use (as opposed to a commercial use).

2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                        Page 49

f) Supportive Housing
Supportive housing links the provision of housing and social services for the homeless, people with
disabilities, and a variety of other special needs populations. State law defines “supportive housing”
as housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the low income adults with
disabilities, and that is linked to on-site or off-site services that assist the supportive housing resident
in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live
and, when possible, work in the community (California Health and Safety Code Section 50675.2).
Senate Bill 2, which took effect in January 2008, sought to ensure that local governments do not
unreasonably deny approval for transitional housing or supportive housing and clarifies that
jurisdictions must permit supportive housing pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section
50675.14(a)(B)(2) in all zones where housing is permitted and subject to the same development
standards as the same type of housing in that zone. Currently, the City’s Zoning Ordinance does not
directly address supportive housing.
g) Transitional Housing
In 2010, the City implemented a program of the 2005-2010 Housing Element by amending the
Zoning Ordinance and Orange Avenue Corridor Specific Plan to accommodate transitional housing
facilities. “Transitional housing” is defined in the Zoning Ordinance as temporary housing,
generally provided for two weeks to two years, in multi-family complexes with supportive services
that prepare individuals or families with the ability to transition from emergency or homeless
shelters to permanent housing. Such housing may be configured for specialized groups within the
homeless population, such as people with substance abuse problems, mental illness, domestic
violence victims, veterans, or people with illnesses such as AIDS/HIV. Such housing could be
provided as apartment houses, single room occupancy (SRO) units, boarding house complexes, or
single-family homes.
However, the Coronado Zoning Ordinance lists “Boarding House Complexes” in the definition of
Transitional Housing, which transitional housing is allowed by right in the R-3 and R-4 zones, while
boarding houses require Major SUP in the R-3 and R-4 zones. Furthermore, transitional housing
pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 50801(i) should be permitted in all zones where housing
is permitted and subject to the same development standards as the same type of housing in that
zone.
h) Emergency Shelters
In 2010, the City implemented a program of the 2005-2010 Housing Element by amending the
Zoning Ordinance and Orange Avenue Corridor Specific Plan to accommodate emergency shelters.
Per the Zoning Ordinance, an “emergency shelter” is housing with minimal supportive services for
homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person. The 2010
amendment allows emergency shelters in the C-U and C Zones with approval of a Minor SUP.
Parking requirements are based upon anticipated need and evaluated during the special use permit
                                                                                             City of Coronado
Page 50                                                                            2013-2021 Housing Element

process. To ensure the use will not be detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of persons
residing or working in the vicinity, the use permit may determine the:
        Maximum number of beds or persons permitted to be served nightly by the facility;
        Size and location of exterior and interior on-site waiting and client intake areas;
        Provision of on-site management;
        Proximity to other emergency shelters (provided, that emergency shelters are not required to
         be more than 300 feet apart);
     Length of stay;
     Exterior lighting; and
     Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation.
Since adoption of the 2005-2010 Housing Element, State law pre-empted the City’s land use controls
and development standards for emergency shelters. Government Code Section 65583 now requires
the City to identify at least one zone to permit emergency shelters without a use permit or other
discretionary approval. The zone must have sufficient capacity to meet the seasonal shelter need for
the City’s unsheltered homeless population plus at least one year-round emergency shelter.
With 9.9 acres on 38 properties (none of which are located along Orange Avenue), the C Zone has
adequate capacity to accommodate a seasonal emergency shelter for at least six homeless individuals
(identified unsheltered homeless population in Coronado) and at least one year-round emergency
shelter.6 The Orange Avenue Corridor Specific Plan establishes a minimum lot size of 3,500 square
feet making possible the subdivision of many parcels into small building sites. The C Zone
properties are located within a few blocks of the Orange Avenue corridor, which traverses the heart
of the City and potential emergency shelter sites would be near services and along major
transportation corridors. These properties can either be redeveloped or adapted to accommodate
emergency shelters. For example, one 7,000-square-foot property is a parking lot and another 2,920-
square-foot parcel is a car storage lot for adjoining auto repair service business. Both of these lots are
located on C Avenue, which runs parallel to Orange Avenue. Another 6,000-square-foot lot, located
on B Avenue (also parallel to Orange Avenue), includes a non-conforming six-unit apartment
building that could be converted to an emergency shelter.
i) Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Units
SRO units are one-room units intended for occupancy by a single individual. They are distinct from
a studio or efficiency unit, in that a studio is a one-room unit that must contain a kitchen and
bathroom. Although SRO units are not required to have a kitchen or bathroom, many SROs have
one or the other. The City includes SRO units in its definition of “transitional housing.”
j) Farmworker Housing
California law requires that housing elements identify adequate sites which will be made available
through appropriate zoning and development standards and with services and facilities, to facilitate

2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                         Page 51

and encourage the development of housing for agricultural employees. However, Coronado has no
land in agricultural production, and little agricultural land is located near the City. Given the high
cost of housing in Coronado and the distance from the community to farm lands, those few
individuals noted by the Census as City residents employed in the agricultural industry are likely
owners of farms located in the interior of the county. Therefore, as discussed in the “Needs
Assessment” (Chapter 3 of this document), there is no need for farmworker housing in Coronado.
4. Building Codes and Enforcement
The City of Coronado adopted and enforces the 2010 California Building Standards Code, including
the 2010 California Residential Code. The code is determined by the State of California and ensures
that all housing units are built to specified standards. No local amendment to the code with
potential to directly impact housing standards or permit processes has been initiated or approved.
New requirements in the latest edition of the code can increase the cost of new housing. For
example, the Residential Code now requires fire sprinklers in all one- and two-family dwellings and
townhomes. And the new CALGREEN Code imposes new requirements aimed to conserve energy
and resources.
The goal of the City’s Code Enforcement program is to help maintain the quality of life for the
residents of Coronado. To accomplish this, the Code Enforcement Officer assists property owners
regarding code violations, and educates the public regarding the requirements of the Municipal
Code. Pursuant to Coronado City Council policy, staff only responds to written complaints. To
enforce the Code, the Code Enforcement Officer issues Notices of Violations to obtain compliance,
in accordance with the Municipal Code. The program relies on voluntary non-judicial compliance,
emphasizing public awareness of the City of Coronado regulatory provisions.
Common code enforcement problems consist of remodeling without a permit and occasional garage
conversions to living space, which tend to create parking problems that are more noticeable in multi-
family residential areas, where parking is limited. The code enforcement program is based on
voluntary compliance through education of the public about the codes.
The number of units needing rehabilitation continues to decline as older units are remodeled or
replaced with new housing. Despite the recent downturn in the housing market, land prices in
Coronado remain very high. There are very few underdeveloped properties and this scarcity
coupled with the community’s desirable location adjacent to the Pacific Ocean and San Diego Bay
has led to sustained high prices despite the economic conditions that have lowered land costs
elsewhere in the region. As a result, many Coronado owners have elected to either demolish their
existing home and rebuild on-site or remodel. Such activities have been facilitated by the City’s
processes and fees that have been designed and implemented in a manner to assure that they are
reasonable and in no way inhibit achievement of the City’s regional fair share of housing,
particularly affordable housing.
                                                                                       City of Coronado
Page 52                                                                      2013-2021 Housing Element

5. On- and Off- Site Improvements
Site improvements in the City consist of those typically associated with development for on-site
improvements (fronting streets, curbs, gutters, sewers/water, and sidewalks) and off-site
improvements (drainage, parks, traffic, schools, and sewer/water). Coronado is basically a fully
developed City with curbs, gutters, sidewalks, infrastructure, et cetera, and therefore, has minimal
requirements for on- and off-site improvements. Since parcel maps and subdivisions are the
precursors of new construction that could damage such physical infrastructure, it is common that
such subdivision map act activities would require the replacement of some of the impacted
infrastructure. However, Coronado has scrupulously endeavored to ensure that such exactions are
warranted and reasonable and do not impose an obstacle to the City obtaining its regional housing
share objectives. Given the completely developed nature of the City’s infrastructure, the cost to
developers of providing public facilities is relatively low when compared to other parts of the region
where is not already available or inadequate to serve new development.
6. Development Impact and Development Service Fees
Development impact and Development Service fees for new development are summarized in Table
29. Residential development in Coronado is subject to development impact fees for public facilities,
affordable housing, transportation congestion improvement, and schools. Impact fees for public
facilities and affordable housing are local fees established by the City of Coronado. The Regional
Transportation Congestion Improvement Program (RTCIP) is approved by voters of San Diego
County and the school impact fees are established by State law. The City has no ability to influence
these two fees.
The Development Service Fee Schedule, based upon a City-wide Development Service Fee Study,
became effective January 1, 2012. Most fees are adjusted annually by the Annual Average
Consumer Price index (CPI) for the San Diego Region beginning July 1, 2013.
The development service fees adhere to a general policy approach of full-cost recovery for these
services. Full cost includes direct salaries and benefits, services and supplies, and indirect costs such
as supervision and support, cross-department support, facility use, amortization of equipment, etc.
In those areas where there is some public benefit for a lower fee, the City adopted a partial cost
recovery fee. In these instances, the balance of the cost to provide the service is subsidized by the
City. The subsidized fees, denoted with an “S” next to the dollar figure on the attached fee
schedule, are not adjusted annually by the CPI.
The City charges an itemized fee for services that vary greatly in processing time from one
application to another. Itemized fees (designated on the attached fee schedule by a “D” next to the
dollar figure) require a deposit to be paid in the amount that is estimated to be the cost to process
said application. During the course of providing the service, the cost may exceed the amount of the
deposit collected. If the deposit is insufficient to cover the actual cost to the City, the applicant must
make additional deposits. The City provides an itemized accounting of all cost incurred for itemized

overhead is returned to the depositor.

Relatively few additional processes are common for residential development in Coronado because of
the City’s developed nature. For example, while re-zonings or General Plan amendments are
addressed in this handout, they are virtually never required for residential development in the City.
In fact, the City has not processed a re-zoning or general plan amendment for a private developer in
over 25 years. Most new residential development only requires a parcel map or design review. The
projects are exempt from CEQA and Coastal and many cases, unless three units or more, Design
Review.
Table 30 shows permit fees for a prototype home in Coronado. Permit fees are based on a one-story,
single-family detached residential dwelling unit with 2,500 square feet of living area and a 400-
square-foot garage. The estimated construction cost for this prototype unit before permit fees is
$288,375.7 The plan check, permit, and impact fees account for an additional sum of $7,359, or less
than three percent of the estimated construction cost.

                    Estimated Cost of Construction: $288,375
Table 31 shows permit fees for a prototype multi-family development in Coronado. The fees are
based on a four-unit apartment building with 6,300 square feet of living area and a 1,600-square-foot
garage. The estimated construction cost for this prototype unit before permit fees is $1,250,000.8 The
prototype assumes development which typically occurs on a 50-foot by 140-foot parcel (7,000 square
feet). Each unit contains 1,575 square feet living area two-garage spaces per the R-3 Zone. It also
assumes the lot contains an existing 1,000 square feet single-family dwelling since most multi-family
development in Coronado involves demolition of an existing single-family home. The fees include
connecting the three net new units to the sewer system ($4,478 per net new unit).
Table 31 also includes State and regional fees that are neither established by nor within control of the
City of Coronado. Seismic and building standards fees are transmitted to the State. The SANDAG
Public Regional Transportation Fee of $6,495 is established (for three net new units) and mandated
by the SANDAG as a condition to receive Trans Net funds. The City is required to use these fees
on major congestion relief projects within the SR-75 transit corridor. New residential development
in Coronado must also pay school impact fees.
In summary, the net fees for plan check, permits, and development impact total $45,761, or $11,441
per unit. This constitutes less than four percent of the estimated construction cost. Despite all of
these various fees for single-family and multi-family development, the fees are necessary and are
reasonable since they constitute less than three percent of estimated building costs. Permit
processing and development impact fees will not impede the City’s ability to achieve its regional
housing share objectives.

7. Permit Processing Procedures and Timeframes
Processing times for permits in the City of Coronado vary based upon the scope and type of project.
The City complies with requirements under the State’s Streamlining Review Act, and makes all
attempts to expedite permit processing. For example, all applicable permits and reviews are
completed concurrently; timeframes summarized in Table 32 are not cumulative. The amount of
time involved in processing applications/permits depends on the type and the applicant’s
compliance with the City’s ordinances and the completeness of the applications.

 Source: City of Coronado, Fee Schedule, effective January 1, 2012.
The processing time periods listed in Table 32 are estimates from the date the City determines the
application is complete and are subject to variables (e.g. appeals, litigation, background studies, etc.)
that may contribute to an extended process period. These time periods are for the specific
applications and do not include other permits and approvals that must be obtained from the City of
Coronado or other agencies.
The majority of single-family units constructed within the City are processed administratively and
do not require discretionary permits (public hearings and additional processing time). A
discretionary permit is required for single-family projects only when the applicant chooses to apply
for a deviation/variance from code requirements. Multi-family structures require discretionary
permits, which include Design Review (for aesthetics) and Planning Commission and City Council
approval (for subdivision maps).
The Design Review Commission convened its first meeting in July of 1972. The Commission was
established by the City to enhance the design quality of new development, which occasionally had
been perceived by the public as mediocre. Given the limited opportunity for new development in
Coronado, the community felt that all new development should contribute to and not detract from
the quality of the City’s physical character. The Design Review Commission and the Historic
Resource Commission (since February 2002) do not increase the length of time needed to obtain
development approval because they are fully integrated into the development review process, and
their efforts have been well received by the community. These commissions conduct their review
during the processing time limits established by State law, with a typical multi-family project
processed in less than two months.
City of Coronado
2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                                          Page 57

No unique decision-making criteria or procedural step is hidden in the City’s multi-family
development process that would, in any way, inhibit development potential or contribute to project
approval uncertainty. An applicant can be assured that his or her project will be approved at the
density permitted by the underlying zoning so long as the proposal complies with the specified
development standards for the zone such as density, height, setbacks, floor area ratio, structural
coverage, et cetera. One slight exception to the prior statement is that occasionally the Design
Review Commission may ask for aesthetics changes to a project that could result in added costs to
incorporate design features.
Residential land uses subject to a Special Use Permit (SUP) approval include Boarding Houses
(Major) and Emergency Shelters (Minor). The City Council hears and decides Major SUP
applications. Minor SUP applications go before the Planning Commission. Per the Zoning
Ordinance, the Community Development Department has 60 days to bring a complete SUP
application to the City Council or Planning Commission for public hearing. A notice is published in
a newspaper no less than 14 days prior to the hearing and all property owners within 300 feet of the
proposed use location are notified. The Zoning Ordinance also specifies that a SUP must be granted
unless the reviewing body reaches any of the following conclusions:
       The use as proposed will be detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of persons
        residing or working in the vicinity;
       The use as proposed will be injurious to property or improvements in the vicinity;
       The use as proposed is inconsistent with the General Plan, any applicable specific plan, or a
        zoning regulation; or
       The location or operating characteristics of the proposed use will be incompatible with or
        will adversely affect or will be materially detrimental to impacted uses, residences, buildings,
        structures or natural resources, with consideration given to, but not limited to:
        1. The inadequacy of public facilities, services and utilities to serve the proposed use;
        2. The harmful effect, if any, upon a desirable neighborhood character;
        3. The inability of the capacity and physical character of surrounding streets to safely deal
            with traffic that will be generated by the proposed use;
        4. The unsuitability of the site for the type or intensity of use which is proposed; and
        5. The harmful effect, if any, upon the environmental quality and natural resources of the
            City.
The findings are uniformly applied to all uses that require SUP approval and are necessary to
regulate certain uses with potential to impact public health, safety, and welfare. However, as
discussed earlier in this document, the Minor SUP requirement for emergency shelters may be a
constraint to the provision of this type of housing for Coronado’s homeless population. To address
this constraint, the City will amend the Orange Avenue Corridor Specific Plan and Zoning
Ordinance to remove the Minor SUP requirement and allow emergency shelters by right within the
C Zone so long as the property is not located along Orange Avenue.
A residential developer is informed at the counter whether a proposed project is large enough to
require separate California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) analysis. Most projects in Coronado
                                                                                        City of Coronado
Page 58                                                                       2013-2021 Housing Element

are of six units or less and are categorically exempt from CEQA. An Initial Study and a Negative
Declaration, processed per the State CEQA Guidelines, is otherwise usually not required for such
projects. The applicant then undergoes Design Review, and may concurrently apply for a Tentative
Parcel Map or Subdivision Map (for condominiums) per the requirements of the California
Subdivision Map Act. (Apartment complexes can be built without a map, and therefore, do not
undergo this extra map review.) Construction plans are then submitted for building permit plan
check, which are plan checked by a planner to assure that they conform to the zone’s development
standards, the Design Review Commission approval, and the Map granted for the project. Finally,
after plan check, the building permit is issued, and project construction can proceed. Many of the
projects in Coronado involve a parcel map of two units, which do not require Design Review. Also,
to expedite the process, the developer often begins construction before the parcel map is filed to
minimize costs of carrying a loan and upfront costs associated with a parcel map.
In summary, since the City’s processing and permit procedures neither unduly impact the permitted
density of a residential project nor contribute to project approval uncertainty, the supply of new
housing units is not inhibited by such regulations. Moreover, the City’s actions neither negatively
impact the cost of housing through its regulations, procedures or processing timeframes nor through
its permit fees or required project conditions or exactions. Therefore, extensive modification of City
housing regulations and policies is unnecessary, and those few revisions that are appropriate are
detailed in the Programs presented in this Housing Element.
The design review process successfully preserves the City’s character and ambiance without
prescribing any particular style of architecture or involving submittal of extraordinary materials.
Materials boards and colored elevations are required as part of project submission. However, these
requirements are typical of project approval processes. Colored elevations facilitate understanding of
how the project will fit into the surrounding area. Like site plan review, design review also facilitates
the process of issuing a building permit, ensures compatible development that contributes to an
attractive and well-designed urban environment, and builds in an extra level of community support
for discretionary projects.
To streamline the subdivision process, final parcel maps are approved by staff and final subdivision
maps are approved by the City Council on their consent calendar. The City has also streamlined its
building permit and inspection procedures. A contractor calls 24 hours in advance for an inspection
and can request a morning or afternoon inspection, as well as request a call before the inspector
arrives. Additionally, a contractor can request an inspection on line. Both of these measures have
streamlined the building inspection process for contractors, as well as improving service to the
public. Additionally, the building permit is computerized, allowing for some types of permits such as
re-roofing, plumbing, water heaters, et cetera, to be called in on the phone. When an individual
arrives at the building permit counter, the permit is ready and only fees have to be paid. This
modification also saves time for the contractors.
The City consistently makes every effort to assure the speedy processing of permit applications, and
where possible, minimizes the steps and/or processes that a particular project may require to reduce
the applicant’s development processing costs. For example, the Planning Department routinely

2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                       Page 59

completes it zoning compliance plan check review for single family homes and subdivision projects
within 15 days of submittal to the building department. Similarly, ESGIL, the firm contracted to
complete building code compliance plan check review also completes its first check within 15 days.
8. Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Persons with disabilities have a number of specific housing needs, including those related to design
and location. Design needs generally include the removal of architectural barriers that limit the
accessibility of dwelling units and construction of wheelchair ramps, railings, etc. Location needs
include accessibility to public transportation, commercial services, healthcare, and supportive
services. Some persons with disabilities need group housing opportunities, especially those who are
lower-income or homeless.
Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act direct
local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e., modifications or exceptions) in their
zoning laws and other land use regulations to allow disabled persons an equal opportunity to use
and enjoy a dwelling. For example, it may be a reasonable accommodation to waive a setback
requirement so that elevated ramping can be constructed to provide access to a dwelling unit for a
resident who has mobility impairments. Whether a particular modification is reasonable depends on
the circumstances and must be decided on a case-by-case basis.
California statutes require that the Housing Element include an analysis of the Zoning Ordinance,
permitting procedures, development standards, building codes, and permit processing fees to identify
potential constraints for housing for persons with disabilities. The following discussion addresses
these issues and determines that no specific City policy or regulation serves to impede the access that
persons with disabilities have to housing that have reasonable accommodations to their specific
needs.
a) Procedures for Ensuring Reasonable Accommodations
The City ensures that new housing developments comply with Title 24 of the California Code of
Regulations. The City implements and enforces the California Building Standards Code, which has
regulations comparable to those found in the American Disabilities Act (ADA). However, for
residential development, these standards apply only to multi-family projects of three units or more.
The City provides information to applicants or those inquiring of City regulations regarding
accommodations in zoning, permit processes, and application of building codes for persons with
disabilities.
In 2010, the City implemented a program of the prior Housing Element by adopting an Ordinance
to establish a formal procedure for requesting reasonable accommodation for persons with
disabilities who seek equal access to housing under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California
Fair Employment and Housing Act. A request for reasonable accommodation may include an
application for a modification or exception to the application of zoning and building standards and
use of housing or housing-related facilities in order to eliminate identifiable regulatory barriers to
                                                                                       City of Coronado
Page 60                                                                      2013-2021 Housing Element
provide a person with a disability an equal opportunity to housing. The fee for reviewing reasonable
accommodation requests is $330. In 2012, the Community Development Department processed its
first Reasonable Accommodation Request and the fee is relatively small and did not serve as a
constraint. The accommodation allowed for required parking to be located in the front yard setback
to facilitate access to the front door of a residence for an elderly senior, with mental and physical
mobility limitations and disabilities.
An application request for reasonable accommodation associated with a ministerial land use,
building, or similar determination is reviewed by the Building Official. The Building Official must
make a written determination within 30 days and either grant, grant with modifications or deny such
a request for reasonable accommodation. For the application described above, the reasonable
accommodation request was processed and approved within five days of submittal.
An application for reasonable accommodation associated with a discretionary land use, building, or
similar determination shall be reviewed by the decision-making body which is authorized to approve
the discretionary permit for the project. Notice and hearing is required for the associated
discretionary land use, building, or other determination. The decision-making body must make a
written determination and either grant, grant with modifications or deny such a request for
reasonable accommodation.
b) Encroachment Permit Procedure
Encroachment permits for structures within public right-of-way are handled administratively by the
Engineering and Project Development Department. Improvements designed to enhance accessibility
(e.g., a wheelchair ramp) that encroach on the public right-of-way need an encroachment permit.
The applicant provides a drawing of the proposed improvements in relation to the public right-of-
way, which is then reviewed by the City Engineer, and ultimately City Council. The improvements
must be completed by a licensed and insured general contractor. There is a nominal permit fee.
While the City’s permit process is relatively simple and does not require a public hearing, it can
require a few weeks to process and agendize for City Council consideration under City Council
business; however, this does not constitute a constraint to reasonable accommodations for persons
with disabilities.
c) Efforts to Remove Regulatory Constraints for Persons with Disabilities
Since adoption of the 2005-2010 Housing Element (extended by legislation to 2013), the City
amended the Zoning Ordinance to allow residential care facilities serving six or fewer individuals by
right in all residential zones in accordance with State law. The City also revised its definition of
family to remove a potential impediment to fair housing choice. Per the Zoning Ordinance, the City
now defines “Family” as one or more persons, whether or not related by blood, marriage or
adoption, sharing a dwelling unit in a living arrangement usually characterized by sharing living
expenses, such as rent or mortgage payments, food costs and utilities, as well as maintaining a single
lease or rental agreement for all members of the family and other similar characteristics.
City of Coronado
2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                     Page 61

The City allows residential retrofitting to increase the suitability of homes for persons with
disabilities in compliance with ADA and Title 24 requirements. Such retrofitting is specifically
permitted for multi-family residential complexes under the California Building Standards Code. The
City works with applicants who need special accommodations in their homes to ensure that
application of building code requirements does not create a constraint.
Residential parking standards for persons with disabilities are not different from other parking
standards. Title 24 or ADA-required extra-large parking spaces count toward compliance with a
project’s overall parking requirement. Not only does the City not require extra parking to comply to
such standards, the City also allows a 25-percent reduction of the parking space requirement for
affordable housing projects and a 50 percent reduction of the parking space requirement for senior
housing projects. Moreover, the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance allows the parking standard for
multi-family development to be reduced upon developer request to just one space per studio or one-
bedroom unit.
d) Permits and Processing
The City does not impose special permit procedures or requirements that could impede the
retrofitting of homes for accessibility. The City’s requirements for building permits and inspections
are the same as for other residential projects. City officials are not aware of any instances in which
an applicant experienced delays or rejection of a retrofitting proposal for accessibility to persons with
disabilities.
The City does not impose special occupancy permit requirements for the establishment or retrofitting
of structures for residential use by persons with disabilities. Generally, if structural improvements
were required for an existing group home, a building permit would be required. If a new structure
were proposed for a group home use, appropriate review would be required as for any other new
residential structure, and it would be conducted per State law.
e) Building Codes
The City adopted and implements the 2010 California Building Standards Code, including the 2010
California Residential Code. The City provides reasonable accommodation for persons with
disabilities in the enforcement of building codes and the issuance of building permits through its
flexible approaches to retrofitting or converting existing buildings and construction of new buildings
that meet the shelter needs of persons with disabilities.
f) Conclusion
Current and proposed planning policies and zoning regulations have mitigated potential constraints
to the availability of housing for persons with disabilities. The City has analyzed its zoning
ordinance and procedures to ensure that it is providing flexibility in, and not constraining the
development of, housing for persons with disabilities.
                                                                                         City of Coronado
Page 62                                                                       2013-2021 Housing Element

9. Inclusionary Housing and In-lieu Fee
The City of Coronado’s inclusionary housing program requires that parcel or subdivision maps
involving two or more lots or two or more dwelling units provide 20 percent of the total units in the
development for rent to lower-income households, or “for sale” to moderate-income households, or
pay an in-lieu fee. To increase the flexibility of the program, affordable units can be provided on- or
off-site, through new construction, or acquisition and rehabilitation of existing units. If the developer
elects to pay the in-lieu fee, the amount of the fee is fixed by a schedule adopted, from time to time,
by resolution of the City Council. In-lieu fees are deposited into the City’s Affordable Housing
Special Reserve Fund, which provides funding for affordable housing consistent with the goals and
policies of the City’s Housing Element.
The impact of the inclusionary housing program on Coronado housing market cost is minimal. The
high cost housing market in Coronado suggests that it is highly unlikely that the inclusionary
requirement would have any substantial impact on the price of market rate housing. All developers
to date have chosen to pay the in-lieu fee as opposed to constructing affordable units directly. The
in-lieu fee was originally established in 1983 at a rate of $2,100. The fee was increased in 1993 to
$7,000 per unit. As of March 2012, the in-lieu fee remains at $7,000 per inclusionary unit required.
This fee constitutes a minute portion of the overall development costs in Coronado and an even
smaller portion of a developer’s profit. With elimination of the City’s redevelopment agency (and
associated affordable housing set-aside funding), the City may explore increasing the in-lieu fee as a
means to provide additional opportunities for affordable housing.
10. Historic Preservation
The City of Coronado recognizes the unique and valuable resources within the community reflecting
its cultural and historical heritage. In an effort to preserve those attributes which enhance the
community character and to develop awareness of the City's historic resources and encourage the
retention of these historical resources, the City of Coronado has incorporated a Historic Preservation
Element into the General Plan. The City has also adopted a Historic Preservation Ordinance to
implement the policies contained within the Preservation Element. Coronado's Historic Preservation
Program is intended to energize a preservation system that responds to the needs of individuals and
the community at large, and to assist in enriching the community environment with reference to its
past, its present and its future.
As of January 2012, the City has 141 designated historic resources and 54 with Mills Act contracts
that are receiving property tax reductions. Over the last housing element cycle, 88 homes were
designated historic, 36 were issued Mills Act contracts, and 41 permits were issued allowing
relaxation of zoning standards. Designation of properties as historic is primarily voluntarily and
regulations only apply to the exterior of the structure. The City subsidizes this program and no
application fee is required to apply for Historic Designation. The City’s program does not regulate
the interior of a residence so homeowners can remodel kitchens, upgrade bathrooms, and make
other modifications to enable the residence to be more livable in the 21st century. The City has
provided building permit fee reductions for all approved alterations to properties designated historic.

Historically designated homes are also able to apply for a Mills Act Agreement to allow reduced
property taxes for the historic home as well as exceptions to zoning standards to encourage the
preservation and retention of historic housing stock.
B. Regional, State, and Federal Policies and Regulations
1. San Diego County Department of Housing and Community Development and
    Housing Authority
The County administers several housing programs that are available for Coronado residents.
However, many residents are ineligible to qualify for these programs due to their higher income
levels or assets.
Ranking them in order of impact or effect, the most prominent of the limitations on use of the
programs is that of affluence. Relatively few people in Coronado qualify for the County’s programs.
For example, if their income meets the program criteria, they usually have assets that disqualify
them for applying for a loan. Second, although efforts have been made by the San Diego County
Housing and Community Development Department staff to inform Coronado residents about their
rehabilitation program, many people are suspicious of getting involved in government programs and
reject any consideration of them. Furthermore, most rehabilitation programs offered by the County
have a maximum limit on the home value. Most properties in Coronado would exceed that home
value threshold to qualify for assistance.
Most of the households seeking assistance in Coronado are elderly, and many live in rental units.
The rehabilitation program does have funds that are allocated to investor units or rental units. In
Coronado, however, there are not many incentives for an apartment owner to use a County
rehabilitation loan to refurbish a unit. Providing a unit for a subsidized tenant (by keeping the rents
within County guidelines) results in an income loss for the landlord when the unit can be left as is
and command higher rents.
2. Coastal Commission
Coronado has adopted a Local Coastal Program (LCP), and retains permit jurisdiction over the
majority of development within the community. Most residential development does not require a
separate coastal permit from the City which streamlines the development review process for
applicants. There are a few portions of the City where the Coastal Commission has retained original
permit jurisdiction. This original “permit jurisdiction” includes lands between the ocean and the
designated first public road paralleling the ocean. Additionally, there are residential properties in the
Coastal Commission’s appeal jurisdiction. The appeal jurisdiction is generally within 300’ of the
public bay or beachfront road.
Figure 9 and Figure 10 show where the California Coastal Commission retains post-LCP
certification permit and appeal jurisdiction. If questions arise concerning the precise location of the
                                                                                        City of Coronado
Page 64                                                                      2013-2021 Housing Element

boundary of any area defined in the above sections, the matter is referred to the local government
and/or the Executive Director of the Commission for clarification and information. The City’s LCP
may be updated as appropriate and may not include any lands where post-LCP certification permit
and appeal jurisdiction is retained by the Commission.
The following maps illustrate the appeal jurisdiction areas (darkly shaded areas) where a land use
decision (permit granted or denied in this area by the City) can be appealed to the Coastal
Commission. Also shown are areas covered by a striped pattern, which designate the jurisdiction of
the California Coastal Commission. Unmarked areas surrounded by California Coastal Commission
jurisdiction are under San Diego Unified Port District Coastal Permit jurisdiction. The City has no
authority over these areas; therefore, no overlapping jurisdiction issues exist.
While it is not anticipated that conflict over residential development would occur in any of the
coastal appeal jurisdiction areas, the process does have the potential to constrain development. As of
this time, the City has not encountered any conflict with the Coastal Commission concerning coastal
permit authority over the appeals jurisdiction areas. In fact, single family and multi-family
residential development is usually exempt from any coastal permit requirements; thereby reducing
costs and time for a developer and minimizing development constraints

3. Environmental Protection
State regulations require environmental review of proposed discretionary projects (e.g., subdivision
maps, use permits, etc.). Costs resulting from fees charged by local government and private
consultants to complete the environmental analysis and from delays caused by the mandated public
review periods are added to the costs of housing and eventually passed on to the consumer.
Moreover, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) compliance process determines the
time frames for approval of many discretionary projects. Given the small size of development that
occurs in Coronado most residential projects are handled through the categorical exemption process,
which does not contribute to added time delays for an applicant. Additionally, categorical
exemptions are processed concurrently with other discretionary approval processes. A minimum of
six months is added to the approval process when an Environmental Impact Report is required for a
project. However, the presence of these regulations helps preserve the environment and ensure
environmental safety in the community.
4. Fish and Game Department Fee Process
State environmental review regulations require payment of California Department of Fish and
Game filing fees for CEQA Notices of Determinations before the notices can be filed or effective.
As of January 1, 2012, the fee for Negative Declarations or Mitigated Negative Declarations was
$2,101.50 and $2,919 for Environmental Impact Reports. County Clerks have in-turn added their
own fee ($50 for San Diego County) applied to filing Notices of Exemption as required under
CEQA. The additional processing time and cost of these fees further complicates and inhibits
residential development.
5. State Prevailing Wage Requirements
The State Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) has, over the years, greatly expanded the kinds
of projects that require the payment of prevailing wages. Labor Code Section 1720, which applies
prevailing wage rates to public works of over $1,000, now defines public works to mean
construction, alteration, installation, demolition, or repair work done under contract and paid for in
whole or part out of public funds. For example, public transfer of an asset for less than fair market
value, such as a land write-down, would now be construed to be paid for in part out of public funds
and trigger prevailing wage requirements. In 2008, a California appellate court ruled that granting
government tax credits to facilitate the construction of a low-income housing project did not bring
the project within the purview of California’s prevailing wage law.9 Although the cost differential in
prevailing and standard wages varies based on the skill level of the occupation, requiring payment of
prevailing wages tend to add to the overall cost of development. In the case of affordable housing
projects, prevailing wage requirements could effectively reduce the number of affordable units that
can be achieved with public subsidies.

6. Article 34 of the California Constitution
Article 34 of the California State Constitution requires a majority vote of the electorate to approve
the development, construction, or acquisition by a public body of a “low-rent housing project”
within that jurisdiction. In other words, for projects to be built and/or operated by a public agency
where at least 50 percent of the occupants are low-income and rents are restricted to affordable
levels, the jurisdiction must seek voter approval known as “Article 34 authority” to authorize that
number of units. Lack of widespread community support for affordable housing and “nimby” (not in
my backyard) attitudes can make obtaining electorate approval for affordable housing projects
problematic. The City’s only Article 34 ballot measure failed to pass in the mid-1970s. Therefore,
this statute may have prevented the building of some affordable housing and may still hinder the
approval of affordable housing projects in the future.
While the Article 34 allows for some flexibility for project structuring to avoid the need for a ballot
measure, the constitutional provision can needlessly affect project design and viability. In current
practice, Coronado and most other public agencies that seek to provide affordable housing within
their jurisdictions structure such projects to avoid triggering Article 34. By doing so, these
jurisdictions risk legal and political challenges to achieve the State’s housing mandates and
objectives. While the State legislature has clarified ambiguities relating to the scope of the
applicability of Article 34, more needs to be done. Because in spite of these efforts, Article 34 can
still be viewed as an impediment to the provision of affordable housing.
7. Dissolution of Redevelopment Agencies
The City monitored and opposed the State legislation to eliminate redevelopment agencies due to
the significant impact this legislation would have on the City’s ability to continue to produce or
rehabilitate affordable housing using 20 percent housing set aside funds. Unfortunately, the City
and other agencies were not successful and the legislation passed and was recently upheld by the
courts.
In accordance with State law, the City’s redevelopment agency, the Community Development
Agency (CDA) of the City of Coronado, dissolved on February 1, 2012. Prior to dissolution, the
City Council elected to become the Successor Agency and to retain the housing assets and functions
previously performed by the CDA. Redevelopment projects that were in progress will be completed.
The 20 percent housing set aside funds generated by redevelopment activity constituted the primary
source of funding for affordable housing in Coronado. Recently proposed legislation may allow the
City to retain its housing set aside balance, but does not provide an alternative funding source in the
future. Dissolution of the CDA will be a significant constraint to the City’s ability to subsidize
future affordable housing projects.

C. Environmental Constraints
Both the City’s geology and its topology affect Coronado’s development potential. The City of
Coronado is a peninsula bounded by the Pacific Ocean and San Diego Bay, with extensive portions
either beach or sensitive habitat on Federal or State lands. The City is basically flat, with its highest
points at about 40 feet above sea level. Three Naval bases occupy the Federal lands, and the State
lands host various public or private recreational uses controlled by the San Diego Unified Port
District, the State Lands Commission, or the California Parks Service. Naval Air Base North Island
contains an airfield whose runway ends near the City’s western residential neighborhoods, thereby
restricting how they can be re-developed. Active earthquake faults cross the City, and soils that are
susceptible to liquefaction and a high water table further constrain development in areas of the
community. Moreover, only one road up the peninsula and one bridge across the bay (both SR 75)
provide traffic links to the rest of the region. Portions of State Route 75 are occasionally highly
congested, and can be disrupted by disasters or emergencies. These environmental constraints limit
the possible expansion and densification of the City.
D. North Island Naval Air Station Operations
In April of 2012, the U.S. Navy provided the City with a copy of its final Air Installation
Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ) Update for Naval Air Station North Island and NOLF Imperial
Beach. This document contains recommendations regarding Noise, Safety and Land Use measures
that Coronado should consider for appropriate land uses and zoning in proximity to NASNI airport
operations. The San Diego County Regional Airport Authority (SDCRAA) must incorporate the
recommendations of the AICUZ when developing the State mandated Airport Land Use
Compatibility Plan (ALUCP) for Coronado. The City’s General Plan and zoning must be consistent
with the ALUCP. The City is carefully evaluating what land use restrictions and noise attenuation
requirements may be placed on development within the community. Per the Knight Act of 2002,
The City has no control over the development restrictions assigned to new development by the
AICUZ and ALUCP.
E. Infrastructure Constraints
The City is essentially built-out with only a few vacant properties remaining. All public services and
infrastructure are in place to serve existing development and limited future growth. Water is
provided to the City by the California American Water Company. The Wastewater Division of the
City’s Public Services Department manages the system that collects and transmits wastewater to San
Diego’s Metropolitan Sewerage System (Metro) for treatment.
State law requires that water and sewer providers develop written policies that grant priority to
proposed development that includes housing affordable to lower-income households. The
legislation also prohibits water providers from denying or conditioning the approval of development
that includes housing affordable to lower-income households, unless specific written findings are
made. The City will provide a copy of the adopted Housing Element to the California American
                                                                                        City of Coronado

Water Company and Metro within 30 days of adoption in accordance with Government Code
Section 65589.7(a). The City will coordinate with these providers to ensure priority service
provision to affordable housing developments.
F. Non-Governmental Constraints
A number of private sector factors also contribute to the cost of housing. The following is a
discussion of these and other non-governmental factors and their impact on housing development.
1. Economic Factors
The effects of market forces on the construction industry may act as a barrier to affordable housing.
The forces of supply and demand can affect the timing and level of housing construction. For
instance, in the early 1990s a number of factors cumulatively dampened the real estate market and
slowed housing construction in Southern California despite the fact that interest rates were at
relatively low levels. Yet, by the mid-1990s the housing market began to turn around, and by the
mid-2000s, housing prices skyrocketed, rendering the region as one of the most expensive
metropolitan areas in the nation. According to the California Association of Realtors (CAR), only
nine percent of the households in San Diego County could afford a median-priced home in
September 2005. In 2008, the bubble burst and housing prices have moderated significantly. The
median home price in San Diego County dropped more than $200,000 (approximately 36 percent)
and sales dropped 50 percent between 2005 and 2010.10 As of the fourth quarter of 2011, 45 percent
of the households in San Diego County could afford a median-priced home. The cyclical nature of
the real estate market has a significant impact on the supply and demand for housing, which in turn
affects the timing and cost of construction in the region.
However, in the City of Coronado, the local housing market has sustained its high values. In 2005,
the median home price in the City was $1,214,000 (as documented in the 2005-2010 Housing
Element). The median home price in 2011 decreased only slightly to $1,100,000.
2. Construction Costs
Factors such as type of construction, custom versus tract development, materials, site conditions,
finishing details, amenities, size, and structural configuration can increase the cost of housing. The
International Code Council (ICC) provides estimates for the average cost of labor and materials for
typical Type V wood-frame housing. Estimates are based on “good-quality” construction, providing
for materials and fixtures well above the minimum required by state and local building codes. In
February 2011, the ICC estimated that the average per square-foot cost for good-quality housing in
the San Diego region was approximately $97 for multi-family housing and $109 for single-family
homes. Although construction costs are a significant portion of the overall development cost, they

are consistent throughout the region and therefore are not considered a major constraint to housing
production.
3. Land Costs
High land costs represent the overriding factor affecting the feasibility of residential development in
the City. In Coronado, little vacant residential land is available to base estimates of land costs. For
example, only one undeveloped property was listed for sale in January 2012. The 10,500 square-foot
lot is zoned R4 and could potentially accommodate up to nine new multi-family units. The
$2,099,000 asking price represents $200 per square foot of land or $233,222 per potential dwelling
unit. Given that Coronado is nearly built-out and most future development will rely upon the
acquisition of potentially developable parcels (such as properties that can accommodate additional
units under existing zoning and General Plan policies) and demolition of existing structures, the cost
of a finished residential site can be expected to increase substantially over the planning period.
4. Availability of Financing
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a home. Under the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to disclose information
on the disposition of loan applications and the income, gender, and race of loan applicants. The
primary concern in a review of lending activity is to determine whether home financing is available
to a City’s residents. The data presented in this section include the disposition of loan applications
submitted to financial institutions for home purchase, home improvement, and refinance loans in
Coronado.
In 2010, a total of 144 households applied for conventional mortgage loans in Coronado.11 As
shown in Table 33, 67 percent of the conventional mortgage applications were approved, 16 percent
were denied, and 17 percent were withdrawn or closed for incompleteness.
In the past, government-backed loans were a significant source of financing for lower and moderate
income households. However, between 2000 and 2006, other loan options including zero percent
down, interest-only, or adjustable rate loans were available and often marketed to these households.
As a result, government-backed loans became less attractive. Recent tightening of underwriting
standards has limited the availability of these “creative” financing options suggesting that
government-backed loans may again become a significant source of financing for home purchases.
In 2010, 35 households applied to use government-backed loans to purchase homes in Coronado,
although the approval rate of these loans (68 percent) was roughly the same as the approval rate of
conventional loans (67 percent).
Another 21 Coronado households applied for home improvement loans in 2010; of these, 62 percent
were approved and 25 percent were denied. In general, home improvement financing is less

    Government-backed loans include loans insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA),
    Veteran Administration (VA), and Farm Service Agency (FSA)/Rural Housing Services (RHS).

accessible during market downturns when compared to home purchase financing. High debt-to-
income ratios coupled with lower property appraisals can make it more difficult for homeowners to
qualify for additional financing. Refinance applications were most common with a total of 702
applications. The approval rate for refinance loans was 63 percent. Tightening credit markets and
narrowed lending criteria in recent years has made refinancing existing loans more difficult since
2006.
More than 80 percent of loan applicants had incomes that exceeded 120 percent of the Area Median
Income (AMI). Approximately 66 percent of applications filed by these above moderate income
households were approved and 19 percent were denied. Lower income households, particularly very
low income households had the lowest loan approval rates and highest denial rates. Only 21 percent
of very low income and 57 percent of low Income applicants were approved.
Given the relatively high rates of approval for home purchase, improvement, and refinance loans,
home financing is generally available and not considered to be a significant constraint to the
provision and maintenance of housing in Coronado.

Housing Opportunities and Resources
This section evaluates the potential residential development, rehabilitation, and preservation that
could occur within the community based upon the City of Coronado’s General Plan and Zoning
Ordinance. California law mandates that a city must show within its Housing Element that it has
adequate sites with required public services and facilities for a variety of housing types for all income
levels. This section focuses on the availability of land resources for future housing development, the
City’s ability to satisfy its share of the region’s future housing need, the availability of the public
services and facilities to provide the necessary infrastructure for additional residential development,
the financial resources available to support housing activities, and the administrative resources
available to assist in implementing the City’s housing programs. The section concludes with an
outline of opportunities for energy conservation.
A. Regional Share Goals
The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) developed the Regional Housing Needs
Allocation (RHNA) Plan for the San Diego region, utilizing an estimated housing stock projection
for the region that was accepted by the State’s Housing and Community Development Department
(HCD). The Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) Plan covers an eleven-year growth
projection and planning period (January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2020).12 In consultation
with the County and the cities within the region, SANDAG assigned a housing production goal to
each jurisdiction in the region. This section discusses how Coronado has adequate existing
residential site capacity to accommodate its share of regional housing needs during the planning
period.
According to the RHNA, Coronado’s share of regional future housing needs is a total of 50 new
units between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2020. This allocation is distributed into four
income categories, as shown below in Table 34. The RHNA includes a fair share adjustment which
allocates future (construction) need by each income category in a way that meets the State mandate
to reduce over-concentration of lower income households in historically lower income communities
or areas within the region.
The RHNA is a planning goal. Jurisdictions can meet this goal either by production of housing
units or by providing a potential capacity for additional units through appropriate land use policies
and development standards.
12
    Please note that the RHNA planning period (January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2020) is different from the
    Housing Element planning period (April 28, 2013 through April 30, 2021).

1. Credits toward the RHNA
The RHNA is an 11-year planning goal and, therefore, housing units built since January 1, 2010 can
be credited towards meeting the City’s RHNA. Table 35 summarizes the City’s progress toward the
RHNA as of April 2012.

Since the start of this RHNA cycle, a total of 27 new units have been constructed. The City’s former
Community Development Agency facilitated the construction of 12 lower income units at 450
Orange Avenue (APNs: 536-302-20 & -21). The 12-unit Orange Villa housing project was developed
with funding by the former Coronado Community Development Agency and in collaboration with
the San Diego Interfaith Housing. The facility opened in June 2011 and all units are used as very
low income housing. The project is deed restricted as long-term affordable housing until 2066.
Another 15 market rate-units were constructed at various locations. These units can be subtracted
from the City’s share of regional housing needs. The City must demonstrate in this Housing

    The City has a RHNA allocation of 13 very low income units (inclusive of extremely low income units). Pursuant to
    State law (AB 2634), the City must project the number of extremely low income housing needs based on Census
    income distribution or assume 50 percent of the very low income units as extremely low. However, for purposes of
    identifying adequate sites for the RHNA allocation, State law does not mandate the separate accounting for the
    extremely low income category. According to the CHAS data developed by HUD, 16 percent of City households
    earned less than 50 percent of the AMI. Among these households, 56 percent earned incomes between 31 and 50
    percent (very low) and 44 percent earned incomes below 30 percent (extremely low). Therefore the City’s RHNA
    allocation of 13 very low income units may be split into seven very low and six extremely low income units.

Element its ability to meet the remaining housing needs, through the provision of sites, after
subtracting units constructed as of April 2012.
2. Remaining Housing Need to be Accommodated
After accounting for units built since January 1, 2010, a remaining need of 23 units exists, including
ten lower income, nine moderate income units, and four above moderate income units. The City
must demonstrate the availability of sites with appropriate zoning and development standards that
can facilitate and encourage the development of such units by April 30, 2021.
B. Residential Sites Inventory
Table 36 includes the detailed inventory of vacant and potentially developable sites in Coronado to
accommodate the City’s remaining RHNA. Potentially developable sites primarily refer to sites that
under the City’s current zoning and General Plan designations, additional units can be
accommodated. As shown in Figure 11, each identified site is adjacent to developed land and can
be readily served with existing infrastructure.

1. Realistic Capacity Assumptions
Given the high land and home values in Coronado, the City has historically seen developments
occurring at close to the maximum density allowed, and for affordable housing to exceed the
allowable density (utilizing the density bonus provisions). For example, the City approved an eight-
unit project at 575-579 Orange Avenue (APN: 546-381-23) that would have yielded 89 percent of the
maximum allowable density on a 10,500-square-foot lot within the R-4 zone. The recently
completed affordable 12-unit Orange Villa was constructed on a site of 10,500 square feet, yielding a
density of 50 units per acre or 125 percent of the maximum allowable density. Given how valuable
land is in Coronado, and based on recent examples, the City can reasonable expect that cumulative
application of development standards does allow a project to yield 100 percent of the maximum
density in the R-4 zone.
2. Vacant Sites
As an older urban community, the City’s inventory of vacant residential land is limited. Only two
parcels (total 17,500 square feet) within the R-4 zone are undeveloped and available for future
housing development. These two lots have a maximum capacity of 16 units.
3. Potentially Developable Sites
Development activity within Coronado has slowed over the past five years; however, demand for
new housing in the City remains strong resulting in a viable market for redevelopment of potentially
developable sites. The City has identified 16 parcels (total 85,473 square feet) zoned R-4 that are
potentially developable and ripe for redevelopment. Although each of these sites are developed with
existing residential or commercial uses, most are in deteriorated or poor condition and/or the
existing intensity of development is substantially lower than allowed by the R-4 zoning. Given these
existing conditions and the zoning capacity for higher density residential, the City feels these sites
are the most viable redevelopment opportunities to accommodate the housing need within the
planning period. These potentially developable sites have the capacity to yield up to 73 dwelling
units; however, the City estimates that the realistic capacity of these sites is 49 net units.
a) Suitability of Potentially Developable Sites
Coronado is an established community with limited development opportunities on vacant land. As
such, vacant sites cannot accommodate Coronado’s entire share of the regional housing need and
the City relies on potentially developable properties to demonstrate sufficient capacity during the
planning period. This section demonstrates that the potentially developable sites are suitable for
redevelopment within the planning period.
All the developed sites identified by the City are highly developable given the maximum density
allowed in the R-4 zone (up to 40 units per acre). Nearly all of the existing structures are in poor or

fair condition. Figure 12 depicts typical existing conditions on potentially developable sites in the
commercial and residential zones.

story home in poor condition. The property, listed for sale, is  converted single story former residence. The property is
located between two lots of similar size that were recently      similar in size and shape to Site #2, on which the City had
redeveloped with high density multi-family uses. Lot is 7,000    previously approved redevelopment of the site from office use

dead plants and weeds noted on site.
Recent construction and development applications demonstrate active demand for redevelopment of
smaller lots in the R-4 zone. For example, the City approved an eight-unit project in 2006/07 at
575-579 Orange Avenue (APN: 546-381-23) to redevelop a 10,500-square-foot lot previously
occupied by a commercial building. This approval has since expired and the site is available for
future development. Another small lot located at 411-415 Orange Avenue (APN: 536-311-02)
involved the redevelopment of a single-family home with a four-unit multi-family building in 2010.
Therefore, the City concludes that its inventory of potentially developable sites is suitable for
redevelopment within the planning period. Virtually all of the City development activities occurred
as recycling of potentially developable properties into higher intensity uses.
                                                                                                             City of Coronado

4. Affordability Assumptions
The realistic capacity of the City’s vacant and potentially developable sites could result in 65 net new
dwelling units by the end of year 2020. This exceeds the City’s remaining RHNA of 23 units for the
2010-2020 planning period (with 27 units already developed). Government Code Section
65583.2(c)(3)(B) allows local governments to utilize a “default” numerical density standard for
establishing adequate zoning to accommodate lower income housing. With a maximum allowable
density of 40 units per acre, the R-4 zone meets the statute’s “default” density standard. Because 40
units per acre is, by default, considered adequate to accommodate lower income housing, it can also
be considered adequate to accommodate moderate and above moderate income housing. However,
for the three properties that can achieve only one net new unit, this sites inventory assumes their
affordability level at above moderate income. Overall, the vacant and potentially developable R-4
parcels identified in Table 36 have adequate zoning to accommodate at least 64 lower, moderate, or
above moderate income units.
5. Environmental Constraints
This Housing Element identifies a number of sites where high-density residential development may
occur in the City during the 2013-2020 Housing Element timeframe. None of these sites identified is
impacted by major environmental constraints such as hazardous materials, flooding, sensitive
species, or earthquake faults that would preclude development on these sites.
6. Public Services and Infrastructure Availability
As discussed in details in the Constraints to the Provision of Housing section of the Housing
Element, no significant public service or infrastructure constraints have been identified. The City of
Coronado currently has adequate public services and facilities to serve all new residential
development that may occur throughout the City. Sufficient water and energy supplies are available
for anticipated growth, including the City’s regional share requirements per the RHNA. All roads,
curbs, sidewalks, telephone, cable, gas and electric, and sanitary sewer and storm drainage facilities
are already in place. Moreover, amenities such as a library, a golf course, a senior center, parks, and
beach and recreation facilities and programs are of high quality. The City staffs its own police, fire,
ambulance, and lifeguard facilities and supports a private hospital within the community. The City’s
Recreation, Public Services, Community Development, and Administrative Services Departments
service the community’s citizens and support the other line departments, the City Manager’s Office,
and the City Clerk. The Coronado Unified School District spans the whole City, effectively
performing its necessary roles.

7. Summary
Table 37 summarizes the City’s accommodation of the RHNA for all income groups during the
2010-2020 planning period. After accounting for development credits and the realistic capacity of
vacant and potentially developable sites, the City has identified surplus capacity of 52 lower income
units, which when applied to Coronado’s moderate and above moderate allocation, yields a net
surplus of 42 units for the planning period.

C. Financial Resources for Housing
In Coronado, development of new affordable housing is difficult due to the particularly high cost
and limited supply of land. As a small city, Coronado has limited access to financial sources for
affordable housing activities. The following discussion focuses on the most significant housing
funding sources currently used in Coronado.
1. Inclusionary Housing In-lieu Fee
The City of Coronado maintains an Inclusionary Housing Program whereby residential developers
of projects with two or more units must set aside 20 percent of proposed units for affordable housing
or pay an in-lieu fee. All developers to date have chosen to pay the in-lieu fee. Revenue from this
in-lieu fee, plus interest earned on these funds, are placed into an Affordable Housing Special
Revenue Fund. The fund has been utilized for new construction, rent subsidies, and the
rehabilitation of affordable housing units. As of June 2012, the fund has a current balance of
approximately $706,000. With the dissolution of the Community Development Agency (CDA), the
City will rely solely on in-lieu fees to generate funding for its affordable housing activities. This
Housing Element include two programs to address the future uses of the Affordable Housing Special
Revenue Fund and the need to increase revenues for this Fund.
2. Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside
Prior to dissolution in February 2012, State law required the Coronado Community Development
Agency (CDA) to set aside a minimum of 20 percent of all tax increment revenue generated from
redevelopment projects for affordable housing. The “set-aside” or Lower and Moderate Income
Housing Fund (LMIHF) must be used for activities that increase, improve, or preserve the supply of
affordable housing. Redevelopment law required that all new or substantially rehabilitated housing
                                                                                       City of Coronado
Page 84                                                                     2013-2021 Housing Element

units developed or otherwise assisted with the Agency’s set aside funds must remain affordable to
the targeted income group for at least 55 years for rentals and 45 years for ownership housing.
In 2012, the State Legislature dissolved all Redevelopment Agencies, including Coronado's CDA.
The City elected to become the Successor Agency to the CDA to complete projects that were in
progress at the time of dissolution and administer payments of the CDA's enforceable obligations.
As of June 2012, the LMIHF of the former CDA had a balance of $5 million committed for the
payment to existing affordable housing obligations. No new LMIHF will be generated with the
dissolution of the CDA.
3. Housing Choice Voucher Program
The Housing Choice Voucher Program is a federal program that provides rental assistance to very
low income persons in need of affordable housing. The program offers a voucher to income-
qualified tenants that pays the difference between the payment standard (an exception to fair market
rent) and what a tenant can afford to pay (e.g. 30 percent of their income). A voucher allows a
tenant to choose housing that may cost above the payment standard, with the tenant paying the
extra cost. The San Diego County Department of Housing and Community Development (County
HCD) administers the Housing Choice Voucher Program in Coronado. Approximately 20
households in Coronado receive assistance through the Housing Choice Voucher Program.
D. Administrative Resources
Described below are public and private sector organizations that have been involved in housing
activities in Coronado. These agencies partake in the improvement of the housing stock, expansion
of affordable housing opportunities, preservation of existing affordable housing, and/or provision of
housing assistance to households in need.
a) City of Coronado Community Development Department
The Community Development Department administers Zoning Regulations, the General Plan,
Specific Plans, and the Local Coastal Program. The Planning Commission, Design Review
Commission, and Historic Resource Commission are staffed by this department, and the building
inspection and plan check functions are conducted by department staff augmented by contract with a
building plan check consulting firm.
b) San Diego County Department of Housing and Community Development
San Diego County HCD is a public agency that provides subsidized housing and other housing-
related services to lower and moderate income individuals and families. In addition to conventional
public housing within San Diego County, the Department administers several rental assistance
programs such as the Housing Choice Voucher Program, Family Self-Sufficiency, Shelter + Care,
and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS.

County HCD also operates a range of housing programs using HUD and State funds. As
participating jurisdiction, Coronado residents are eligible to receive assistance through the following
programs:
       Home Repair Loan/Grant Program
       Downpayment and Closing Cost Program
       Mortgage Credit Certificate Program
These programs are described in the Housing Plan section of this Housing Element.
c) San Diego Interfaith Housing Foundation
San Diego Interfaith Housing Foundation aims to reach out to seniors, the disabled, and working
poor not served by the traditional housing market. The Foundation attempts to create better and
more affordable housing opportunities for people throughout San Diego County. The organization
has built and manages several successful communities consisting of over 900 affordable housing
units. The Foundation’s role in such developments includes, but is not limited to, project feasibility,
land acquisition, analyzing and securing financing, coordinating and managing the development
team of architects, engineers and contractors, lease-up, property management and resident services.
In Coronado, the Foundation completed three affordable housing projects in collaboration with the
City. These include:
       550-578 Orange:           30 units new construction
       525 Orange:               16 units substantial rehabilitation
       440-450 Orange:           12 units new construction*
       225 Orange:               6 units substantial rehabilitation*
                                  (* This is one project with multiple sites)
E. Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Construction of energy efficient buildings can add to the production costs of ownership and rental
housing. Over time, however, housing with energy conservation features should reduce occupancy
costs as the consumption of fuel and electricity is decreased. This can result in monthly housing
costs that are equal to or less than what they otherwise would have been had no energy conservation
devices been incorporated in the new residential buildings. This section provides an overview of
opportunities for energy conservation during the housing planning period.
1. State Regulations
Title 24 of the California Administrative Code establishes energy conservation standards that must
be applied to all new residential buildings. The regulations specify energy saving design for walls,
ceilings and floor installations, as well as heating and cooling equipment and systems, gas cooling
                                                                                        City of Coronado
Page 86                                                                       2013-2021 Housing Element

devices, conservation standards and the use of non-depleting energy sources, such as solar energy or
wind power. Compliance with the energy standards is achieved by satisfying certain conservation
requirements and an energy budget. Among the alternative ways to meeting the energy standards
are the following:
        Alternative 1: The passive solar approach which requires proper solar orientation,
         appropriate levels of thermal mass, south facing windows, and moderate insulation levels.
        Alternative 2: Generally requires higher levels of insulation than Alternative 1, but has no
         thermal mass or window orientation requirements.
        Alternative 3: Also is without passive solar design but requires active solar water heating in
         exchange for less stringent insulation and/or glazing requirements.
Residential developers must comply with these standards while localities are responsible for
enforcing the energy conservation regulations.
2. State and Federal Programs
The California Department of Community Services and Development in partnership with the
network of local community services agencies that assist lower-income households, administers the
Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and Energy Low Income
Weatherization Assistance Program (DOE-LIWAP). LIHEAP provides financial assistance to
lower income households to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling their residences. DOE-
LIWAP provides installation and weatherization measures that increase energy efficiency of existing
residential and multi-family dwellings occupied by lower income persons. Eligible weatherization
services include a wide variety of energy efficiency measures that encompass the building envelope,
its heating and cooling systems, its electrical system, and electricity consuming appliances. In San
Diego County, the energy service provider is Campesinos Unidos, Inc.
3. Private Sector Programs
The following private sector energy conservation programs are available to housing developers and
Coronado residents:
        California Alternative Rates for Energy (CARE): Lower-income customers enrolled in the
         CARE program receive a 20 percent discount on their electric and natural gas bills and are
         not billed in higher rate tiers that were created for San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E).
         CARE is funded through a rate surcharge paid by all other utility customers.
        Energy Assistance Program Rate (EAPR): Includes a one-year electric rate reduction home
         energy audit, free compact fluorescent lights, and replacement of inefficient refrigerators.
         Income qualification and enrollment by Red Cross.

       Family Electric Rate Assistance Program (FERA): This program was developed for
        families whose household income slightly exceeds the threshold for assistance in other
        energy program allowances. Qualifying households have some of their electricity usage
        billed at a lower rate.
       Low Income Energy Efficiency Program (LIEE): The LIEE program provides no-cost
        weatherization services to lower income households who meet the CARE guidelines.
        Services provided include attic insulation, energy efficient refrigerators, energy efficient
        furnaces, weather stripping, caulking, low-flow showerheads, water heater blankets, and
        door and building envelop repairs that reduce air infiltration.
       Residential Energy Standards Training: SDG&E offers seminars on energy efficiency
        compliance best practices. Architects, designers, builders, engineers, energy consultants,
        HVAC contractors, building department inspectors, and plan checkers are encouraged to
        learn about new technologies that improve energy efficiency and reduce the cost of
        complying with evolving State energy standards.
       Lighting Turn-In Program: Through this program, SDG&E replaces resident’s
        incandescent bulbs with more energy-efficient compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) free of
        charge. Residents can access the program via community events that are held throughout
        SDG&E’s service area and coordinated through an extensive network of community
        organizations and government agencies.
       Rebate Program: SDG&E offers rebates for single-family and multifamily dwelling units for
        certain improvements in their units that lead to greater energy efficiency. These
        improvements include purchase and installation of insulation, energy efficient appliances,
        and the replacement of old light bulbs with Energy Star light bulbs.

B. Implementing Programs
Goal 1:      To provide a broad range of housing opportunities to increase the housing
             options available to individuals.
1. Land Use Policy and Development Capacity
The City of Coronado has been allocated a Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) of 50 units
(13 very low income; 9 low income; 9 moderate income; and 19 above moderate income units). The
City will continue to maintain its General Plan Land Use Element and Orange Avenue Specific Plan
land use policies to ensure adequate capacity is available to meet its RHNA for all income groups.
2013-2021 Objectives:
     Maintain a residential sites inventory that is adequate to accommodate the City’s RHNA of
         50 units.
     Monitor development trends to ensure continued ability to meet the RHNA as sites
         identified in this Housing Element are being redeveloped.
Funding Sources:                  General Fund
Responsible Agencies:             Coronado Community Development Department

2. Inclusionary Housing Program
The City of Coronado will maintain its Inclusionary Housing Program. Residential developers of
projects with two or more units must incorporate affordable housing into their projects or pay an in-
lieu fee. The development must set aside 20 percent of the units in each project as affordable or pay
an in-lieu fee of $7,000 per market-rate dwelling unit. Revenues from this in-lieu fee, plus interest
earned on these funds, are placed into an Affordable Housing Special Revenue Fund. The fund has
been utilized for such things as new construction and rehabilitation. The Affordable Housing Fund
could be leveraged with other funding sources.
2013-2021 Objectives:
     Continue to implement the Inclusionary Housing Program.
     Evaluate the effectiveness of the Inclusionary Housing Program periodically, and make
         adjustments as necessary and appropriate. (See also Program 10 - New Funding Mechanism
         to Administer City’s Affordable Housing Resources.)
     Achieve affordable housing units through new construction, acquisition/rehabilitation, or
         conversion from market-rate housing. Ensure that a portion of the affordable housing units
         are set aside for extremely low and very low income households.
Funding Sources:                 Affordable Housing Special Revenue Fund
Responsible Agencies:            Coronado Community Development Department
3. Affordable Housing Development
As available, the City will allocate funds in the Affordable Housing Special Revenue Fund (in-lieu
fees) toward the development of affordable housing units, especially projects that include units for
extremely low and very low income households. The City will also encourage qualified housing
developers to pursue new construction and acquisition/rehabilitation of affordable housing in the
City. However, with limited funding, the City will also utilize other non-funding-related incentives
to encourage affordable housing production.
2013-2021 Objectives:
     Consider density bonuses, and expedited processing on a case-by-case basis to facilitate
         affordable housing development.
     Provide letter of support and technical assistance to affordable housing developers in their
         applications for State and federal funding, provided that the proposed projects are consistent
         with the City’s General Plan and other applicable plans.

4. Navy Land Projects
The Navy recently informed the City that it is considering development of the vacant land along the
Naval Radio Receiving Facility for Special Warfare Command Operations, which may include the
future need for housing. The City will maintain open channels of communication with the Navy
regarding future affordable housing opportunities on military property.
2013-2021 Objectives:
     Maintain communications with the Navy through the monthly Naval Complexes meetings
         held between Coronado City officials and the Military and through monthly City/Navy staff
         meetings.
     Continue to facilitate Navy efforts to provide affordable housing through City review and
         comment on housing projects as they are proposed, through lobbying efforts in Washington
         D.C., and through infrastructure accommodations to any such projects that are proposed.
Funding Sources:                  None Required
Responsible Agencies:             Navy, City of Coronado
Goal 2:      To provide a broad range of affordable housing opportunities that serve the
             needs of people who work and live in the community.
5. Housing Choice Vouchers
The San Diego County Housing Authority will continue to administer Housing Choice Vouchers
program and the City will support the County’s application for additional funding allocations. This
program provides rental assistance to eligible extremely low and very low income households. The
subsidy represents the difference between the rent that exceeds 30 percent of a household’s monthly
income and the actual rent charged. Currently approximately 20 households in the City are voucher
holders.
2013-2021 Objectives:
     Continue to provide information on the Housing Choice Vouchers program on City website
         and refer interested households and landlords to the County.
Funding Sources:                  HUD Section 8 Allocation
Responsible Agencies:             San Diego County Housing Authority
6. Affordable Housing Resources
As a small community in San Diego County, Coronado is not directly eligible to receive housing
and community development funds such as Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) or
HOME Investment Partnership (HOME) funds from HUD. The City participates in these programs
as a participating jurisdiction in the San Diego Urban County program only, where income-qualified
City of Coronado
2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                    Page 93

Coronado residents may be able to access CDBG- and HOME-funded programs operated by the
County. The County also administers other housing programs funded by other State and federal
resources that are available to income-qualified Coronado residents. The City will continue to
advertise and promote these programs to interested residents:
       Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCC): The MCC program assists low and moderate income
        homebuyers. Under this program, qualified first-time homebuyers are able to take a Federal
        income tax credit of up to 20 percent of the annual interest paid on their mortgage for a
        residence with a maximum appraised value established by the program.
       Downpayment and Closing Costs Assistance Program: The County of San Diego offers low-
        interest deferred payment loans of up to $35,000 or 33 percent of the purchase price
        whichever is less for low income first-time homebuyers. The loan funds may be used to pay
        downpayment and closing costs on the purchase of a new or re-sale home. Properties
        eligible for assistance include single-family homes, condominiums, townhomes and
        manufactured homes on a permanent foundation. The appraised value of the property may
        not exceed a maximum value established by the program. Participants must contribute a
        minimum of one percent of the purchase price from their personal funds.
       Home Repair Program: This program provides loans and grants for the repair of owner-
        occupied homes. Deferred loans are offered at three percent simple interest and calculated
        annually on the unpaid principal. The total amount borrowed must be repaid when the
        property changes hands or the recipient moves from the property. Owners may borrow up to
        $25,000 for a single-family home. A non-repayable grant is available to eligible Mobile
        Home owners of up to $12,000.
2013-2021 Objectives:
     Advertise County programs on City website and provide program information at public
        counters.
     Support the County’s application for State and federal funding for programs that are
        consistent with the goals and policies of this Housing Element and that may potentially
        benefit Coronado residents.

Goal 3:      To provide equal housing opportunities, accessible to all segments of society.
7. Fair Housing Assistance
The City of Coronado will advocate State and federal fair housing laws and promote equal access to
housing for all. Specifically, the City will continue to participate in the Urban County’s CDBG-
funded Fair Housing Program. The County has contracted with North County Lifeline to serve as
its Fair Housing Program Administrator. North County Lifeline has created Lifelines Fair Housing
Collaborative with The Center for Social Advocacy (CSA) and South Bay Community Services
(SBCS) to provide fair housing services. Through their joint efforts, these organizations sponsor
public fair housing educational activities, fair housing outreach activities, and fair housing referral
activities. The City of Coronado is covered under the SBCS service area.
2013-2021 Objectives:
      Continue to provide material at the City Hall Community Development Department
         counter, the Coronado Public Library, and the Coronado Senior Center.
      Encourage the County to implement an annually outreach program that includes County
         presentations to the Coronado Board of Realtors, an annual article in the Coronado Currents
         newsletter, and information placed, and continually available, on the City website.
      Refer complaints and requests for services to the appropriate agencies.
      Participate in the regional efforts to update the 2011 Analysis of Impediments to Fair
         Housing Choice (anticipated to occur in 2016).

8. Senior Housing and Assisted Living Units
The City encourages developers to provide senior housing and assisted living units through
processing assistance, reduction in parking standards, and other appropriate incentives. The City will
consider the reduction of such standards for stand-alone projects on a case-by-case basis.
2013-2021 Objectives:
      Pursue construction of senior housing units over the next eight years. As funding is
         available, Affordable Housing Special Revenue Fund may be used.
      Support affordable housing developers’ applications for State and federal funding for senior
         housing, provided that the proposed projects are consistent with the City’s General Plan and
         other applicable plans.

9. Accessible Housing Design
The City encourages both the private and public sectors to produce or assist in the production of
housing with particular emphasis on housing that accommodates the accessibility needs of persons
with disabilities and the elderly. Development of handicapped-accessible or adaptable and elderly
housing opportunities in existing developments is also encouraged. (Adaptable units have all
handicapped-accessible clearances and provisions met except for the clearances at base cabinets,
countertops, and the provision of grab bars. Such units are designed so that these modifications can
be easily and inexpensively made, but for the convenience of non-handicapped residents, are not
completely modified until an occupant needs the additional modifications.)
To achieve these objectives, the City continues to enforce all applicable accessible housing design
regulations of the California Code of Regulations, otherwise known as the Title 24 Building Code.
While the State’s Building Code accessibility standards do not regulate new single-family residences
or condominiums, the City’s building inspectors and planners will, on a case-by-case basis, in over-
the-counter or telephone conversations, continue to advise property owners that plan to construct or
remodel residential units to consider incorporating accessible housing design into their construction
plans.
2013-2021 Objectives:
     Continue to educating the public on incorporating accessible design into construction design.
     When Affordable Housing Special Revenue Fund is used to subsidize the construction or
        acquisition/rehabilitation of affordable housing, continue to ensure that the project meet or
        exceed the requirements for accessibility.
Funding Sources:                General Fund
Responsible Agencies:           Coronado Community Development Department
Goal 4:     To encourage the conservation and maintenance of its housing stock,
            neighborhoods, and history.

Because of the dissolution of Coronado’s Redevelopment Agency (CDA), the City of Coronado has
undertaken the role of “Successor Agency” to carry out the responsibilities and obligations of the
former redevelopment agency with respect to the existing affordable housing units in Coronado.
Previously, the CDA funded all aspects of providing affordable housing, maintaining affordable
housing, renovating affordable housing, and enforcing affordable housing agreements. All of these
obligations/responsibilities were created due to the involvement of Coronado’s Redevelopment
Agency. The Successor Agency will now be responsible for performing all of these tasks. However,
without the redevelopment agency to provide funding for these activities, a new source of funding
will need to be established for the City acting as the “Successor Agency” to carry out these
responsibilities.
A possible funding mechanism would be to use the City’s housing inclusionary fees. In accordance
with Section 82.21.020, a developer of a condominium consisting of two or more units shall reserve
20 percent of the units within the development “for rental” to persons qualified by the County
Housing Authority as meeting Section 8 Rental Assistance requirements or to persons qualifying
within very low and low income categories as established annually by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD), or “for sale” to persons qualifying within moderate
income categories as established annually by HUD, or shall pay a fee in lieu thereof for every unit
within the project, at the option of the subdivider, for the purpose of providing affordable housing
assistance.

2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                     Page 97

2013-2021 Objectives:
     Develop a funding mechanism to administer the City’s affordable housing resources to
        support the required monitoring, renovation, maintenance, and administrative costs
        associated with the City’s affordable housing stock by the end of 2013. Specifically:
        -   Amend Chapter 82.21. Dedication – Affordable Housing Assistance: Amend Section
            82.21.050: This section identifies the authorized uses of the in-lieu fees collected and
            deposited into the City’s affordable housing fund. This section states, “All fees collected
            hereunder shall be deposited in an affordable housing fund. Said fund shall be
            administered by the City and shall be used only for the purpose of providing funding
            assistance for the provision of new affordable housing units within the City consistent
            with the goals and policies contained in the Housing Element of the General Plan.” In
            order to use this funding source for “maintaining” existing affordable housing and
            administering housing, the code section should be amended to provide expanded
            authority for use of these funds.
        -   Consider Amending Resolution #7259 Established Housing In-Lieu Fee. In accordance
            with subsection B of Section 82.21.040, “the in lieu fee is fixed by a schedule adopted,
            from time to time, by resolution of the City Council. Said amount shall be reasonably
            calculated to provide the subdivider’s fair share contribution towards meeting the City’s
            affordable housing objective without placing an unreasonable financial burden on any
            applicant.” The housing in-lieu fee was originally established in 1983 at $2,100 per unit.
            The fee was amended in 1993 and increased to $7,000 per unit. A typical detached, four-
            unit condominium project pays $28,000 towards affordable housing in-lieu of reserving
            one unit (20 percent of 4) as affordable. The fee should be updated to more accurately
            reflect the cost of creating and or maintaining affordable housing.

11. Long Range Program to Administer the City’s Affordable Housing Units
To develop the most efficient means of maintaining and renovating the City’s 35 housing units, the
City should enter into an agreement with an affordable housing developer. The City should develop
a Request for Proposals to solicit interested firms participation in such a program. The City should
evaluate the proposals and select the developer who has demonstrated experience in effectively
renovating and managing affordable housing similar to the other successful renovations of existing
units purchased by the CDA and completed by San Diego Interfaith Housing.
2013-2021 Objectives:
     Issue a Request for Proposal to solicit interested affordable housing providers or
        management companies to administer the City’s affordable housing units and select a
        qualified provider by the end of 2013.
                                                                                       City of Coronado

12. Alley Unit Rehabilitation and Retention
Alley housing units in Coronado are often non-conforming to the Zoning Ordinance in some
manner and less expensive than other housing in the community. Often these units are small in size,
in need of rehabilitation, or in excess of the number of units presently permitted on the property. If
application of Zoning Ordinance standards prevented needed rehabilitation of these dwellings, then
property owners could be forced to demolish these units and replace them with more expensive new
structures or perhaps not be able to replace them at all. Existing Zoning Ordinance standards allow
some property owners (depending on the type and severity of the non-conformity) to improve and
thereby retain their alley units. Coronado shall maintain this flexibility in the application of its
Zoning Ordinance standards.
2013-2021 Objectives:
     Preserve an average of one alley unit per year, additional units as opportunities arise.
Funding Sources:                  Private Property Owners
Responsible Agencies:             Coronado Community Development Department
13. Historic Preservation
The City continues to educate the public through brochures, historic designations, and news releases
concerning the community’s history and historic structures, and the need for its preservation. The
City will continue to provide incentives, including use of the Mills Act, building permit and planning
application fee exemptions, and Design Review exemptions to rehabilitate and preserve historic
housing. The City will demonstrate flexibility in land use and parking standards and use Building
Code deviations and the Historic Building Code to encourage adaptive reuse of historic structures.
Preservation of historic apartment complexes will be encouraged by permitting their conversion to
condominiums.
2013-2021 Objectives:
     Update brochures annually to reflect both the City’s most current preservation policies and
         the most current list of designated historic structures.
     Recognize designated residences by the award of plaques by the City Council during
         televised Council meetings.
     Conduct an annual outreach program that includes staff presentations to civic groups,
         information on the City website, and articles in “Coronado Currents” newsletter on a regular
         basis.

14. Code Compliance
The City of Coronado continues to advocate and facilitate the rehabilitation of substandard
residential properties by homeowners and landlords, utilizing the Code Compliance program, when
necessary, to improve overall housing quality and conditions.
2013-2021 Objectives:
     Publish articles in “Coronado Currents” newsletter on a regular basis to promote the City’s
        Code Compliance program and provide information on resources and assistance available.

Goal 5:     To minimize governmental constraints to the development, improvement, and
            maintenance of housing, particularly affordable housing or housing accessible
            to persons with disabilities.
15. Zoning Amendments for Special Needs Housing
The City will amend its Zoning Ordinance to address the provision of housing for the homeless and
persons with special needs. Detailed discussions about these housing options are provided in the
Constraints to the Provision of Housing section of this Housing Element.
       Residential Care Facilities: The City will amend the Orange Avenue Corridor Specific Plan
        and Zoning Ordinance to allow large residential care facilities (i.e., those that serve seven or
        more people) with approval of a Major SUP in the R-4 Zone.
       Supportive Housing: The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance and the Orange Avenue
        Corridor Specific Plan to allow supportive housing pursuant to the Health and Safety Code
        Section 50675.14(a)(B)(2). Such housing will be permitted in all zones where housing is
        permitted and subject to the same development standards as the same type of housing in that
        zone.
       Definition of Transitional Housing: The City will amend its Zoning Ordinance to exclude
        boarding houses and single-room occupancy housing from the definition of transitional
        housing. These housing types are (will be) regulated differently than transitional housing.
       Transitional Housing: The Zoning Ordinance will be amended - transitional housing
        meeting the Health and Safety Code definition (Section 50801(i)) will be permitted in all
                                                                                        City of Coronado

         zones where housing is permitted and subject to the same development standards as the
         same type of housing in that zone.
        Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) Housing: The City includes SRO units in its definition of
         “transitional housing.” The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to exclude SRO housing
         in the definition of transitional housing and to establish SRO housing as a use permitted via
         a SUP process in the R-4 zone.
        Emergency Shelters: Consistent with current State law, the City will amend the Orange
         Avenue Corridor Specific Plan to allow emergency shelters in the C Zone by right and
         without discretionary review.
2013-2021 Objectives:
     Amend Zoning Ordinance within one year of the adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing
         Element.
     Ongoing monitoring of implementation to ensure effectiveness and appropriateness of these
         new zoning amendments.

16. Streamlined Process
The City of Coronado continues to educate the public on how to complete the development
approval process and otherwise facilitate building permit and development plan processing for
residential construction. The City expedites project review of residential developments with an
affordable, handicapped-accessible, elderly, or historic preservation component.
The City has created a handout that identifies the various department permits and approvals
required for developing a project in Coronado including other agency contact information. This
handout serves as a “one stop shop” to educate and facilitate development for the public.
Development fees, building hand-outs, and zoning information have all been posted on the City’s
website.
2013-2021 Objectives:
     Provide development process handouts at the City Hall Community Development
         Department counter.
     Periodically review the City’s development process and requirements to identify areas for
         improvement.

C. Summary of Quantified Objectives
The following summarizes the City’s quantified objectives for the 2013-2021 Housing Element
planning period:
         New Construction: The City plans to accommodate its Regional Housing Needs Allocation
          (RHNA) for the planning period. Specifically, the City has already met 27 units of its
          RHNA (12 very low income and 15 above moderate income units).
         Rehabilitation: The City will continue to facilitate rehabilitation of alley units through
          flexible zoning standards. The City anticipates rehabilitation of one alley unit per year.
         Preservation: The City will identify funding sources to administer the City’s affordable
          housing inventory (177 rental and 12 ownership units).

Appendix A: Review of Past Accomplishments
To develop appropriate programs to address the housing issues identified in the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City of Coronado has
reviewed the housing programs adopted in 2005-2010 Housing Element (extended by law to cover through 2012) and evaluated the
effectiveness of these programs in delivering housing services and assistance. Table A-1 summarizes the City’s progress toward the
previous RHNA and Table A-2 provides a detailed program-level assessment of housing accomplishments over the last planning period.

C. Comments Received
Below is a summary of public comments received during the public hearings to review the Draft
Housing Element.
Planning Commission - August 14, 2012
Matthew Jumper, Interfaith Housing, commended staff for their work on affordable housing in
Coronado. Interfaith Housing has developed four affordable housing properties in Coronado and
supports the Draft Housing Element.
Sean Wurley, Policy Director of the San Diego Housing Federation, commended staff for the work
in building affordable housing in Coronado.
City Council – September 18, 2012
Sean Wurley, Policy Director of the San Diego Housing Federation (SDHF), attended the Council
public hearing and reiterated the comments provided in a letter by SDHF’s Executive Director
Susan Tinsky. SDHF recommends the following:
        Reduced parking for affordable housing;
        Reduced minimum lot size for accessory units; and
        Prioritize affordable housing development along Orange Avenue.
The City requires only 1.5 parking spaces per non-senior unit and one space per senior unit. These
standards for affordable housing are already lower than most communities in the region. Given the
City’s unique characteristics and environmental constraints, the City also does not support reducing
the minimum lot size for accessory units. The City has identified Orange Avenue as an area with
capacity to accommodate the City’s RHNA. No changes to the Housing Element are required.
