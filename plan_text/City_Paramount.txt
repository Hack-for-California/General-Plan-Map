         SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT
1.1 AUTHORITY AND SCOPE
This Housing Element is an integral chapter of the City of Paramount General Plan. Local governments in
California are required to prepare long-range general plans to consider various growth issues, including
housing. These general plans must include elements that consider specific issues such as land use,
transportation, housing, health and safety, open space, and natural resources. In 1967, the housing
element became the third State-mandated general plan element. Within the past several decades, the
State legislature has focused increased attention on housing-related issues in California. This attention is
due to the State’s continued population growth, particularly in Southern California’s urban areas. This
significant growth has placed increased demands on the existing housing resources and has accelerated
the need for new housing, especially affordable housing. Southern California is among the most expensive
in the nation.
Section(s) of the Government Code require(s) that local housing elements include an assessment of
housing needs; an inventory of housing resources; and the identification of those constraints that may
impede the development of new housing. This Housing Element was prepared in conformance with the
requirements of the Government Code and addresses the following major issues:
     ●     The determination of the City’s existing and projected housing need;
     ●     The identification of strategies that will enable Paramount to accommodate the identified need;
     ●     The identification of housing goals and policies of the City; and,
     ●     The identification of specific actions the City intends to implement to assist in accommodating
           identified needs.
The State legislature also recognizes the following guiding principles that acknowledge the role of local
government in the provision of housing:1
     ●     Local governments must prepare and implement housing elements that, along with Federal and
           State programs, will assist in the attainment of the State housing goal.
     ●     The individual locality is best capable of determining what efforts are required to contribute to the
           attainment of the State’s housing goals, provided that local programs are consistent with those
           housing goals that are designed to accommodate regional housing needs.
     ●     Programs that focus on the improvement and development of housing must be designed to assist
           the housing needs of all economic segments of the community. The most recent legislative
           changes have focused on the identification of specific housing development sites including those
           that will accommodate transitional housing, supportive housing, and emergency shelters.
This element also identifies programs that will be effective in conserving and maintaining the existing
housing in Paramount as well as how the City intends to accommodate new housing. The State’s key

1.2 HOUSING ELEMENT OBJECTIVES
The focus of this Housing Element is to establish a comprehensive and long-range planning strategy that
specifically addresses housing. This Element’s primary objective is to indicate how the City intends to
accommodate its designated Regional Housing Needs Assessment or RHNA allocation. All of the cities
and counties in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area have been allocated certain housing growth
objectives that will enable the region to meet its projected housing need in the coming years.
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) has been delegated with the responsibility in
developing regional growth forecasts and then assigning new housing objectives for each city and county
under SCAG’s jurisdiction. In addition to establishing an overall objective for new housing units for the
defined planning period (2014-2021), the SCAG RHNA also indicated the proportion of future housing
units that should be accessible to households with varying incomes. The RHNA that is applicable to
Paramount is summarized below:
    ●    A total of 13 units should be allocated to extremely low-income households (less than 30% of the
         Los Angeles County median income);
    ●    A total of 13 units should be allocated to very low-income households (less than 50% of the Los
         Angeles County median income);
    ●    A total of 16 units should be provided for low-income (50% - 80% of the median income)
         households;
    ●    A total of 17 units should be provided for moderate-income (80% - 120% of the median income)
         households;
    ●    A total of 46 units should be provided for households with above moderate (more than 120% of
         the median income for the County) incomes; and,
    ●    The total number of new housing units that will need to be added to the City’s housing inventory
         during the 2014-2021 planning period is 105 units.
1.3 OVERVIEW OF THE CITY OF PARAMOUNT
The City of Paramount is located in the southern portion of Los Angeles County, approximately 16.5 miles
southeast of downtown Los Angeles. The City is bounded by the cities of South Gate and Downey on the
north, Bellflower on the east, Long Beach on the south, and Compton, Lynwood and unincorporated areas
of Los Angeles County on the west. Exhibit 1 indicates the location of the City of Paramount in a regional
context. A Citywide map, indicating the General Plan’s land use designations is provided in Exhibit 2.
The City of Paramount has a total land area of 3,072 acres, or 4.8 square miles (including streets,
easements, the Los Angeles River channel, etc.). Approximately 52% of the City is developed with
residential uses. Industrial land uses account for 23% of the City's total land area, and commercial land
uses account for 5%. The remaining 20% of the City’s land area is devoted to streets, freeways, and other
SECTION 1 ● INTRODUCTION                                                                          PAGE 7

rights-of-way.2 A generalized land use map is provided in Exhibit 2. According to the most recent
California Department of Finance estimates, the City of Paramount’s population in 2010 was 54,196
persons. According to these same statistics, there were 14,240 housing units in the City. The
demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the City are described further herein in Section 2.0.
Since the early 1980’s, Paramount has been very proactive in improving the quality of life for people living
and working in the City. This effort was initiated by the publication of a Rand Corporation Study that
explored the decline of the suburban areas of many of the nation’s metropolitan areas.3 In 1982, the Rand
Corporation published a study supported by the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) concerning the condition of U.S. suburbs with populations over 10,000 people. Based on 16
socioeconomic and demographic disaster indicators, the City of Paramount ranked as one of those urban
areas in the United States as needing special attention. The City Council carefully considered this study
and subsequently initiated a call to arms in developing programs that would improve the residential and
commercial districts.
Between 1970 and 2010, the City’s housing inventory has increased by 3,095 units. Of this total, more
than 2,400 of these units added were part of multiple-family developments containing five or more units.
The Let's Get Paramount Neighborhoods Lookin' Good program, a code enforcement effort designed to
clean up the residential neighborhoods in Paramount, was also implemented over a two-year period while
there had been a major effort in Paramount in redeveloping the central business district and promoting
new housing stock within the City. In addition, much attention was given to preventing the further
deterioration of the existing housing stock through code enforcement programs. In early efforts, the City
targeted areas throughout the community for specific code enforcement activity, only to find that this type
of action often alienated the residents and encouraged them to complain to elected officials. Recognizing
the difficulty of this comply or else approach to code enforcement, the City implemented a number of
programs to provide financial assistance to the community in improving their homes.
1.4 PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The City of Paramount initiated a comprehensive General Plan update, including an update of the
Housing Element, adopted 2012. These earlier updates were undertaken pursuant to the requirements of
the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). This current Element builds
upon the previous Housing Element by updating Paramount’s housing strategy that will enable the City to
meet its current housing requirement.

The public participation process completed as part of this Housing Element’s Update is summarized
below.
    ●    Study Sessions. The City conducted a study session before the Planning Commission that was
         publicly noticed. The meeting involved a discussion of the project team’s findings and the
         manner in which the RHNA may be accommodated along with the overall housing strategy that
         will be included in the draft Housing Element.
    ●    Public Outreach. The City conducted two community meetings at the City Hall. The first meeting
         was held on August 8, 2013, and the second community meeting was held on August 22, 2013.
         The meetings were advertised on the City’s webpage, through the distribution of flyers, and at a
         Planning Commission meeting.
    ●    Public Review of the Preliminary Draft Housing Element. The City placed a number of versions
         of the preliminary draft Housing Element on the City’s website so the public would have an
         opportunity to review the Housing Element in the course of its preparation. The first draft
         Housing Element was placed on the City’s website before the second community meeting.
    ●    Coordination with Local Housing Service Providers. The City contacted key social service
         providers and public agencies involved in providing housing services. A list was compiled of the
         key housing and service providers along with contact names and numbers.
    ●    Planning Commission/City Council Public Hearings. Once the Department of Housing and
         Community Development completed the review of the Housing Element, the City held public
         hearings as part of its adoption. These hearings, along with the environmental review, provided
         additional opportunities for public input.
    ●    Adoption of the Housing Element. Once adopted, the certified Housing Element was placed on
         the City’s website.
As indicated previously, the City made a diligent effort to involve the public in the review and housing
policies and programs. The key elements of this outreach effort included the following:
    ●    A number of housing and service providers, and others who have historically requested
         Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding, were requested to attend a workshop to
         discuss issues germane to housing, including the provision of affordable housing in the City.
    ●    The community workshops were publicly noticed in the local newspaper and held at the City Hall.
         Meeting flyers were mailed to local service agencies drawn from the notification list provided by
         HCD as well as others identified by City staff. Meeting flyers were also posted at all City facilities,
         the public library, and the school district offices.

         presentation followed by a question/answer period. The presentation included slides of relevant
         background information, an explanation of the housing element update process, and a description
         of the recommended policies and programs.
     ●   The draft Housing Element and the presentation materials were placed on the City’s website
         (www.paramountcity.com).
     ●   The draft Housing Element was also considered at a community meeting and public hearings that
         were held before the City of Paramount Planning Commission and City Council. During that
         time, the public was afforded an additional opportunity to review and comment on the draft
         Housing Element. The final Housing Element and the environmental document were adopted at
         a noticed meeting of the City of Paramount City Council.
The key groups that were contacted as part of the Housing Element public participation process included
the following:
     ●   The Rio Hondo Temporary Home;
     ●   Catholic Charities of Los Angeles;
     ●   The Southern California Rehabilitation Services;
     ●   The Southeast Area Counseling;
     ●   The Southeast Area Social Services Funding Authority; and,
     ●   The Salvation Army.
The key points raised during the review of the Draft Housing Element included the following:
     ●   Residents attended the workshops though their concerns focused on how the housing element
         would affect the zoning designation for their individual properties.
     ●   There were concerns regarding the high RHNA numbers that were assigned to the City.
     ●   The potential impacts of the future residential development on schools and other public services
         were identified as a concern.
     ●   There was a concern regarding the City’s future RHNA allocation.
Following the preparation of the draft Housing Element, the Planning Commission conducted public
hearings. Subsequent to planning commission action, further public hearings were held at the City
Council level. All public hearings were advertised in the local newspaper, with additional notices mailed
to interested citizens and community groups. Once the public hearings and the related public review were
completed, the City Council adopted the element.

1.5 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The elements that comprise the Paramount General Plan are required by State law to be internally
consistent. Together these elements provide the framework for the development of facilities, services, and
land uses necessary to address the needs and desires of the City’s residents. To ensure that these needs
are clearly addressed throughout the general plan, the elements must be interrelated and interdependent.
This Housing Element is most directly related to the Land Use element, since it designates the location
and extent of residential development throughout the City.
The City updated the General Plan in 2007 and this update’s most significant change involved the
provision that allowed mixed-use development in the commercial zones. The recently adopted General
Plan also preserves the existing residential neighborhoods. Key general plan issues relevant to this
Housing Element include the following:
    ●    The City has a total developable land area of 2,807 acres with 1,788 acres of land actually
         developed (the difference of 704 acres is devoted to streets, public rights-of way, and easements).
    ●    Of the total land area available for development, 1,482 acres, or approximately 83% is designated
         for residential development.
    ●    The amount of land area designated for multiple-family development (805 acres) exceeds the
         total land area designated for single-family development (670 acres).
    ●    Many parcels within the City are not developed to the maximum intensity theoretically possible
         under the applicable General Plan designation.
    ●    A total of 23,237 units are theoretically possible if all of the parcels designated for residential
         development are ultimately developed to the maximum density permitted under the General
         Plan. This represents 8,629 units over the existing number of 14,608 units.
1.6 FORMAT OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
The City of Paramount Housing Element consists of the following three sections that collectively fulfill the
State’s housing element requirements.
    ●    Section 1.0 - Introduction. This section describes the purpose and authority of this housing
         element, as well as an overview of its organization.
    ●    Section 2.0 - Profile Report. The background analysis that serves as the basis for the
         development of housing policy is detailed in this section. Key topics considered in this section
         include the City’s demographic characteristics, the existing housing stock, household
         characteristics, socioeconomic factors, and housing constraints.
    ●    Section 3.0 – Housing Plan. The existing and projected housing need for Paramount is discussed
         in this section. The City’s long-range plans for accommodating existing and projected housing
         needs, as well as strategies related to housing rehabilitation are described in this section.

1.7 SOURCES OF INFORMATION
The primary source of information used in the compilation of demographic, housing, and socioeconomic
information for the City is based on data collected by the U. S. Bureau of the Census. This baseline
population, housing, and socioeconomic data for cities and counties are collected every ten years as part
of the National Census. The U. S. Bureau of the Census is also updating the statistics for a number of
cities as part of the American Community Survey (ACS). A number of additional sources were consulted
during the preparation of this analysis, with the key sources being the California Department of Finance
(DOF) and the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG).

2.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE COMMUNITY PROFILE
This section of the Housing Element provides an overview of the demographic, housing, and
socioeconomic characteristics of the City of Paramount. The information contained herein indicates those
trends that have occurred in Paramount during the years following the City’s incorporation in 1957. This
section of the Element considers the following:
     ●  Population Characteristics, including population growth trends in the City, age characteristics,
         and ethnicity;
     ●  Housing Unit Characteristics focuses on trends in residential development, housing unit types,
         and housing tenure;
     ●  Household Characteristics provides an overview of the key socioeconomic characteristics that are
         related to housing need;
     ●  Employment and Economic Characteristics describes those economic and market factors relevant
         to the maintenance of existing housing and the production of new housing in the City;
     ●  Special Housing Needs Groups includes a discussion of those City residents that have special
         housing requirements; and,
     ●  Housing Constraints includes a discussion of those governmental and non-governmental
         constraints that could affect housing production.
2.2 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
2.2.1 POPULATION GROWTH TRENDS
According to the 1960 Census, the City’s population at that time was 27,249. The 2010 Census identified
54,196 persons in the City. Finally, according to the most recent DOF population estimates, the City’s
population as of January 1, 2013, was 54,624. In the more than forty years since 1960, Paramount’s
population has more than doubled, increasing by 26,497 persons, or 51.1%. The two greatest periods of
population growth occurred during the 1960s (7,485 persons, or 27.5%) and in the 1980s (11,262 persons,
or 30.9%), as indicated in Table 2. The City’s rate of population appears to have decreased since 2000,
with a population decrease of 358 or 0.65%.
According to the 1960 Census, there were 8,455 housing units in the City. In the decade following the
1960 Census, a total of 3,133 units were added to Paramount’s housing inventory, representing an
increase of 37.1%. Much of the significant population growth experienced during the 1960s may be
attributed to this substantial housing construction. Exhibit 3 illustrates the population growth that has
occurred in the City over the past four decades. Data included in the exhibit was derived from the U. S.
Census and the latest DOF estimates.

The City’s population grew by 7,597 persons in the 1990s. During this same period, only 882 units were
added to the City’s housing stock. The significant population growth in the City during the 1980s and
1990s may be attributed to increases in the average household size, rather than new housing
development. Table 3 compares the trends in the average household size for Los Angeles County with
those of the City for the years 1970 through 2010. As indicated in Table 3, the average household size for
the City is substantially greater than that for the County as a whole. The average household size between
1970 and 2010 increased by 0.74 persons per unit. The most recent 2010 Census figures for the City
identified 15,174 households in Paramount. According to the most recent DOF estimates, the current
average household size is 3.86 persons per unit. The household size trends between 1970 and 2010 for
both Los Angeles County and the City of Paramount are also compared in Exhibit 3.

2.2.2 AGE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CITY’S POPULATION
There is a substantial difference in the average household size between the owner-occupied units in the
City and the rental units. According to the 2010 Census, the average household size for owner-occupied
units was 3.86 persons per household compared to 3.73 persons per household in the renter-occupied
units. According to the 2010 Census, there were 6,430 residents living in owner-occupied units and 7,810
persons living in rental units. The same Census figures indicate there were 6,024 owner-occupied units
and 7,857 rental units in the City.
One of the more significant indicators of population growth trends is a population’s age characteristics.
Table 4 and Exhibit 4 charts the age characteristics of the City’s population between 1970 and 2010. As is
evident from the examination of Table 4, the age cohorts that experienced the greatest rates of growth
consisted of the very young (less than 5 years of age), school-aged, and young adults. The City’s growth
rates among these age categories are consistent with the previously-observed trends in the average
household size. These statistics indicate that Paramount’s population growth was largely attributed to
natural increases (increased birth rates as opposed to in-migration). The City’s population is also
significantly younger overall, compared to the age of the larger regional population.

                        CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
Examination of the statistics summarized in Table 7 and Table 8 reveal that the City’s housing stock
remains predominantly single-family (when considering both single-family detached and single-family
attached units together), though there has been a significant increase in the number of multiple-family
housing units. In 1970, 13.1% of the housing units in Paramount were classified as multiple-family within
structures containing more than 5 units. In 2013, approximately 29.5% of the housing units in the City
were classified as multiple-family within structures containing more than 5 units. Pursuant to State law,
manufactured housing is permitted in R-1 zones. The standards applied to such housing are the same as
those governing conventional “stick built” housing. There are an estimated 1,196 mobile homes in the
City of Paramount.
2.3.2 HOUSING TENURE
According to statistics derived from the U. S. Census, 45.2% of the housing units in the City were owner-
occupied in 2010, compared to 47.8% for the County as a whole. The percentage of owner-occupied units
in the City has increased slightly since 1970, when approximately 44.6% of the housing units were
classified as owner-occupied. The 2010 Census also indicated that 54.8% of the occupied housing units in
the City were rental units. This is a modest decrease of slightly less than 0.6% over the 1970 figures. In
general, housing tenure characteristics in Paramount have changed very little over the past four decades
compared to other cities in the region. Table 9 compares the housing tenure data for the City for 1970
with comparable information derived from the 2010 Census.

According to the most recent ACS data for the year 2012, there were a total of 857 units in the City that
were vacant. This figure accounted for approximately 5.9% of the total number of units in Paramount. Of
this total figure, 494 units were vacant rental units and 261 units were units that were privately owned
that were for sale or otherwise vacant. The remaining 102 vacant units were new units that were yet to be
sold (and occupied). According to the most recent DOF estimates, there were 686 vacant units in the City
as of January 2013 with a vacancy rate of 4.7%.
2.3.3 HOUSING CONDITION
Table 10 depicts 2010 U. S. Census statistics indicating the age of the housing units within Los Angeles
County, which are compared to comparable data for the City. As indicated in Table 10, slightly more than
half of the housing units in the City were constructed during the 1950s. Slightly more than 38.2% of the
housing units in the City were constructed prior to 1960, compared with 51% for the County as a whole.

According to the City’s last five year Housing Assistance Plan, there were approximately 2,899 units that
were classified as substandard. This report defined substandard housing units as those that do not meet
all the current building code requirements. Of these substandard units, 1,807 were owner-occupied units
and 1,092 were renter-occupied units. Substandard units are considered suitable for rehabilitation if they
are structurally sound and can be rehabilitated at a cost not to exceed 50% of the projected market value
of the housing after rehabilitation. The aforementioned Consolidated Plan also estimated that of the
2,899 substandard units, 452 owner units and 273 rental units are severely dilapidated and in need of
replacement. The U.S. Census also includes other measures that could be used to assess housing
condition. These measures include the number of units lacking utilities, indoor plumbing, or kitchens.
According to the 2010 Census, 1,029 units (7.2% of the Citywide total) contained no provisions for indoor
heating. In addition, 220 units (1.5%) lacked complete plumbing facilities. Finally, 91 units (0.6%) lacked
kitchen facilities. Lower-income households occupy approximately one-third of the substandard owner
units and two-thirds of the substandard rental units.
2.4 SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS
2.4.1 HOUSEHOLD INCOME
In 2010, the City’s median income was $42,831. According to the 2010 Census, there were 2,209 families
in the City that had an annual income that was below the poverty level. This figure represented 19.5% of
the total families in Paramount. Of the total households in the City, 14,240 households received some
form of public assistance income. The Los Angeles County Median household income was $64,800 in
2012 according to the most recent U. S. Census. Assuming the 30% figure for the median County income,
an extremely low-income household would have an annual income of $19,440. Table 11 summarizes the
annual household income statistics for the City based on the 2010 Census statistics.

2.4.2 HOUSING COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY
Table 12, HUD’s fair market rent data shows that rents for two, three, and four-bedroom units
significantly increased and then declined in the mid-1990s. The HUD-formulated fair market rent
schedule is a guideline to maximum rents allowable for units receiving Section 8 assistance. HUD uses
the Consumer Price Index and the Census Bureau housing survey data to calculate the fair market rents
for each Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA). As indicated in Table 12, market rents in the City
have more than doubled since 1990.

According to Zillow.com (January, 2014), there were 122 homes listed for sale in January in the City of
Paramount. The asking price for the conventional “stick built” homes ranged from $220,000 to $783,000
with the average price being $407,200. Zillow.com was also consulted to identify the asking rents for the
same period. The asking monthly rentals for single-family homes ranged from $1,300 to $1,900 with the
average monthly rental being $1,600. Finally, the asking monthly rentals for conventional apartments
ranged from $1,100 to $1,600 with the average rent being $1,292.
The HCD now requires local governments to identify those households that have incomes that are
classified as extremely low-income. Extremely low-income households are those households that have
annual incomes that are 30% of the County median (the Households included in this category typically
represent the lowest wage earners in a community with wages corresponding to the current annual
minimum wage of $8.25 per hour as of January 1, 2013). The annual wage figure cited previously
assumes full-time employment. Table 13 indicates the income limits established by HUD to define the
lower income household groups. The income thresholds shown in Table 13 indicate the income limits for
various household sizes (between one person households up to 8 person households).

According to the HUD, households that pay in excess of 30% of their monthly income for housing (either
a mortgage or a rent/lease) may be overpaying. Table 14 indicates the number of owner-occupied and
renter-occupied households that are overpaying for housing.

The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data are used by HOME and CDBG
jurisdictions to prepare their consolidated plans. Data showing housing problems and the availability of
affordable housing are available through the CHAS website for all counties, places, and CDBG/HOME
jurisdictions. Note, the 2010 special tabulation data and median family incomes are based on
metropolitan area definitions at the time of the 2010 Census.
The CHAS data concerning overpayment for housing in Paramount is summarized below in Table 15. The
table indicates the overpayment for extremely low-income households (<30% of the County median), very
low-income households (30% to 50% of the county median), low-income households (50% to 80% of the
county median), and all of the households in the City. The households that are overpaying for housing are
further identified by tenure (owner-occupied and renter households). Finally, the table indicates senior
households and large-family households that are overpaying for housing.

2.4.3 EMPLOYMENT CHARACTERISTICS
In 2010, a total of 24,200 residents were included in the labor force according to the 2000 U. S. Census.
According to the State of California Employment Development Department (EDD), the City’s
unemployment rate as of July 2013 was 15.8%, compared to the County’s 10.8%. According to the EDD’s
labor statistics, the City’s labor force during this period numbered 25,400 persons with 21,400 persons
employed and 4,000 persons actively seeking employment. Table 16 summarizes employment
characteristics for the City of Paramount derived from the 2010 Census.

2.5 SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS GROUPS
Local housing elements must include an analysis of special housing needs. Special needs refer to those
households that contain the elderly, handicapped, large families, and overcrowded households.
2.5.1 ELDERLY AND HANDICAPPED
The most recent 2000 Census indicated that 1,066 senior households lived in owner-occupied units
compared to 444 seniors living in rental units. Senior households living in rental units accounted for
5.6% of the total rental households in the City. Owner-occupied housing units occupied by seniors
accounted for 17.8% of the total occupied units in the City. The lack of such housing is even more
pronounced when it comes to market-rate rental units. The real constraints are associated with the
housing for families and working-aged adults. Construction is almost complete for a 35-unit senior
housing development was recently constructed and includes 9 low-income units. Minor finishing work
remains to be completed.
According to the 2010 American Community Survey (ACS), there were 3,947 residents in the City that had
a disability (this figure represents approximately 7.3% of the City’s total population). Of this total, 376
persons with a disability were under 18 years of age. Working aged persons (18 years to 64 years in age)
with a disability totaled 2,183 persons. Finally, seniors (65 years or older) with a disability totaled 1,316.
Of the total number of persons identified in the 2010 Census (American Community Survey) as having a
disability, 1,246 persons had a cognitive disability, 2,065 persons have an ambulatory disability, and 848
persons had a self-care disability (it should be noted that some disabled persons may have two or more of
the classified disabilities). In addition, 1,246 persons living in the City had a disability that limited
independent living. Not surprisingly, the great majority of those persons with a disability are seniors.
With an aging population, this number is likely to increase in the coming years.
The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) is the major provider of health care for
more than 2 million residents in the County without health insurance. The LACDHS provides hospital
and outpatient care, programs and clinics, emergency medical services and rehabilitative services.
Through its university affiliates (UCLA and USC), the County hospitals conduct postgraduate medical
education for interns, residents, and fellows. The department operates four acute care hospitals, a
rehabilitation hospital, a multi-specialty ambulatory care center, six comprehensive health centers, and
nine health centers. Additionally, the LACDHS operates two trauma centers, two pediatric trauma
centers, four emergency rooms and a state-of-the art burn center.
The City of Paramount is located within the service area of the South Central Los Angeles Regional Center
for Persons with Developmental Disabilities, Inc. (SCLARC), which is a private, non-profit, community
based organization. The SCLARC contracts with the State Department of Developmental Services (DDS)
to coordinate services for individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. According to the
SCLARC, there are currently 310 consumers being served by the regional center. Key services offered by
the SCLARC include the following:
    ●    Adult Day Program.        The Adult Development Center (ADC) includes various community
         programs for adults that are in the process of acquiring self-help skills. These services assist in
         the development of skills related to interaction so that the disabled individual may make their

                           CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
         needs known, and to enable them to respond to instructions. These programs focus on the
         development and maintenance of functional skills required for self-advocacy, community
         integration, employment and self-care.
    ●    Sheltered Workshops.         Participants may also participate in a sheltered, five-day per week
         workshop and perform as if they are working at a regular job for which they receive monetary
         compensation.
    ●    Behavior Management Day Programs. These programs serve adults with severe behavior
         disorder and/or dual diagnosis who, because of their behavior problems, are not appropriate for
         any other community-based day program.
    ●    Residential Placement. Residential Direct Support Professionals provide services to children and
         adults who are unable to reside in the family home. Temporary placements are utilized in
         unusual circumstances that may occur in emergencies or whenever appropriate placements are
         not available. There are also Intermediate Care Facilities for the developmentally disabled and
         skilled nursing care on an extended basis. Most SCLARC consumers placed in residential
         facilities are eligible for SSI/SSA benefits, as well as Medi-Cal.
    ●    Supported Living.        Adults with developmental disabilities, regardless of the degree of the
         disability, have the right to live in homes of their choice as long as they are provided with services
         that will ensure and enhance their success with integration into mainstream society. Supported
         living services consist of services to adults with developmental disabilities that choose to live in
         homes they themselves own or lease in the community.
    ●    Independent Living Training. Independent living services is a 6-month service available to
         persons 18 years of age and older who are not enrolled in school and have demonstrated potential
         for living on their own with a minimal amount of supervision. Training is provided in all areas of
         home management (budgeting, housekeeping, cooking, etc.) and should not be confused with the
         activities of daily living (bathing, grooming, toileting, etc.).
    ●    Supported Employment. Supported employment programs provide support to adults who are
         interested in competitive employment. Supported employment programs are funded by the
         Department of Rehabilitation
The City of Paramount requires that all new residential developments comply with California building
standards (Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations) and Federal requirements for accessibility.
Other City efforts designed to promote reasonable accommodation include the following:
    ●    Procedures for Ensuring Reasonable Accommodations. The City does not have any Zoning
         Ordinance provisions that are specific to housing for disabled persons. Minor building
         improvements, such as ramps, rails, and wheelchair lifts, may be handled through an
         administrative review process to evaluate such development requirements applicable to housing
         for persons with disabilities.
    ●    Efforts to Remove Regulatory Constraints for Persons with Disabilities. The State has removed
         any City discretion for review of small group homes for persons with disabilities (six or fewer
SECTION 2 ● PROFILE REPORT                                                                             PAGE 33

                         CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
         residents). The City does not impose additional zoning, building code, or permitting procedures
         other than those allowed by State law. There are no constraints on housing for persons with
         disabilities caused or controlled by the City.
     ●   Retrofiting Requirements. The City also allows residential retrofitting to increase the suitability
         of homes for persons with disabilities in compliance with accessibility requirements. In addition,
         the City works with applicants who need special accommodations in their homes to ensure that
         application of building code requirements does not create a constraint.
     ●   Information Regarding Accommodation for Zoning, Permit Processing, and Building Codes.
         The City implements and enforces Chapter 11 of the 2013 California Building Code. The City
         provides information to all interested parties regarding accommodations in zoning, permit
         processes, and application of building codes for housing for persons with disabilities.
This Housing Element also includes a new program (refer to Section 3.6.23) that includes the provision of
a new Reasonable Accommodation Program. Under this program, the City will adopt a reasonable
accommodation ordinance to provide exception in zoning and land-use regulations for housing for
persons with disabilities. Currently, the City’s Zoning Ordinance contains no such provisions. The
procedures related to the program’s implementation will be ministerial in nature with minimal or no
processing fee. Improvements may be approved by the Community Development Director as long as a
number of findings may be made. First, the request for reasonable accommodation must be used by an
individual with a disability protected under fair housing laws. Second, the requested accommodation is
necessary to make housing available to an individual with a disability protected under fair housing laws.
Third, the requested accommodation would not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on
the City. Finally, the requested accommodation would not require a fundamental alteration in the nature
of the City's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance.
2.5.2 LARGE FAMILIES
According to the HCD’s definition, the term "large family" refers to a family containing five or more
persons. In 1990, the number of large family households grew to 4,855 households, an increase of 30%
over the 1970 figures. According to the 2000 Census, a total of 2,114 large family households lived in
owner-occupied units. The same Census figures also indicated that 2,913 large family households lived in
rental units.
2.5.3 OVERCROWDED HOUSEHOLDS
Overcrowding may also be a contributor to the deterioration of housing units. A household is considered
to be overcrowded if the numbers of persons residing in the unit exceed 1.01 persons per room. A
household is severely overcrowded if the numbers of persons residing in the unit exceed 1.51 persons per
room. Of the 14,240 occupied housing units identified in the 2010 Census, 2,012 units were identified as
being overcrowded (14.1% of the City’s total number of occupied units) and 1,433 units (10.0% of the total
occupied units in the City) were identified as being severely overcrowded. Table 17 provides a breakdown
of potential overcrowding by housing tenure according to the most recent Census data.

                                       Source: U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2010.
2.5.4 FEMALE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLDS
Based on census data, families with female heads-of-households increased from 1,200 (8.4%) in 1970 to
1,729 (11.2%) in 1980, and 2,494 (19%) in 1990; this trend is consistent with the national trend. During
this period, families with female heads-of-households and children aged 0-18 years of age increased, then
decreased; from 8.3% in 1970 to 14.8% in 1980, and then to 8.55% in 1990. In 2000, there were 3,030
female-headed households, representing 21.7% of the total number of households in the City. According
to the most recent 2010 Census, there were 2,880 female-headed households (20.2% of the total
households in the City). This number bears importance in relation to social service needs, such as child
care, recreation programs, and health care, which are of special concern to these households.
2.5.5 PERSONS IN NEED OF EMERGENCY SHELTER
There are two categories of need that should be considered in discussing the homeless: 1) transient
housing providing shelter only and usually on a nightly basis; and, 2) short-term housing, usually
including a more comprehensive array of social services to enable families to re-integrate themselves into
a stable housing environment.
The issue of homelessness emerged as a major issue in the 1990’s during the severe economic recession
that Southern California was undergoing at that time. While the region has experienced a dramatic
economic rebound, those conditions that typically contribute to homelessness have not significantly
changed. As a result, homelessness within the larger Southern California region continues to be a
problem. Data provided by the Shelter Partnership estimated that there were 236,400 homeless persons
in Los Angeles County over the course of a year. On any given night in Los Angeles County, there are
more than 84,000 homeless persons. Various circumstances that may lead to homelessness include the
following:
     ●   Single adult transients passing through the City on the way to some other destination;
     ●   Seasonal and/or migrant homeless individuals seeking seasonal employment in the City;
     ●   The chronically homeless, single adults, including non-institutionalized, mentally disabled
         individuals, alcohol and drug abusers, elderly individuals with insufficient incomes, and others
         who voluntarily, or are forced, due to financial circumstances, to live on the streets.
     ●   Minors who have run away from home;
SECTION 2 ● PROFILE REPORT                                                                        PAGE 35

                         CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
    ●    Low-income families who are temporarily homeless due to financial circumstances or are in the
         process of searching for a home (single-parent families, mostly female-headed, are especially
         prevalent in this group); and,
    ●    Women (with or without children) who are escaping domestic violence.
The primary agency that deals with the issue of homelessness in Paramount is the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department that serves Paramount. The Sheriff’s Department reported that truly homeless
persons are not generally observed in Paramount. Additionally, the City's Community Services
Department has not received any complaints regarding persons sleeping or living in any of the City's
parks. Finally, the City of Paramount Public Works Department has not received any complaints
regarding persons sleeping or living on the streets.
The Sheriff's Department acts as a referral resource to shelters in the area and sometimes transports those
persons who cannot reference a permanent address to sub-regional facilities. These shelter facilities
include: the Long Beach Rescue Mission, Long Beach Salvation Army, Bell Salvation Army, Catholic
Charities/Homeless Programs, Mental Health Association/Los Angeles County, and East Rancho
Dominguez Community Services. The Salvation Army operates a shelter located at 1370 Alamitos Avenue
in the City of Long Beach. The operators of this shelter report that providing temporary shelter to the
homeless is the shelter’s primary function. This Salvation Army shelter provides services to an average of
73 people per day. Of this number, approximately 10% are homeless. The Bell Shelter, located in the City
of Bell, provides transitional housing for women with dependent children. The focus of the shelter’s
services is to provide women who are victims of domestic violence with housing while they are making a
transition to independent living. The shelter has a 24-bed capacity.
A Citywide housing condition survey was conducted during the summer months (June and July) of 2008.
This survey involved a windshield survey of every street in the City. During this survey, the location and
extent of homeless persons were noted. Several individuals were identified near an abandoned railroad
easement and other individuals were identified either traveling along one of the City’s arterials or resting
in one of the City’s parks. The surveys identified between seven and ten homeless individuals on each day
the survey was conducted. The most recent and comprehensive homeless survey was completed in 2009
as part of the Los Angeles Homeless Service Authority (LAHSA) homeless census. Due to the large size of
Los Angeles County, it was necessary to conduct the enumeration over a period of three days. Statistical
methods were used to forecast the balance of the County’s homeless population. The survey considered
the following:
    ●    Unsheltered homeless people, including those found on streets, in vehicles, in makeshift shelters
         (such as tents), and encampments;
    ●    Sheltered homeless people occupying emergency shelters, transitional housing, domestic violence
         shelters, and those using vouchers to stay in hotels or motels; and,
    ●    A count of homeless people occupying short-stay institutions such as hospitals, residential
         rehabilitation facilities, and jails was completed.
A general population survey of 1,000 randomly selected households throughout Los Angeles County was
also implemented in an effort to discover homeless persons who would not have been identified by the
SECTION 2 ● PROFILE REPORT                                                                          PAGE 36

                         CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
above methods (otherwise known as the "hidden homeless"). These people were classified as unsheltered
due to the fact that they do not utilize emergency shelter or transitional housing facilities for their night-
time accommodations. The City was included in south Los Angeles County (SPA 6). The survey identified
6,357 unsheltered homeless persons and 2,157 sheltered persons. Citywide field surveys were conducted
to assess housing condition. During these surveys, between 6 and 8 homeless individuals were observed.
To address the local homeless problem, the City is cooperating with the Los Angeles Homeless Services
Authority (LAHSA) in addition to providing financial support to local service. The following shelters
provide emergency housing services to the City.
    ●    Women’s & Children’s Crisis Shelter (Whittier. Homeless victims of domestic violence) - 32 Beds.

In an effort to coordinate the available service programs with the needs of the community, the City has
assisted in the establishment of the Rio Hondo Area Homeless Coalition. This organization deals with the
problems of homelessness, supportive housing, health care, and the effects of homelessness and near
homelessness on families and individuals. The group meets on a monthly basis to educate each other as
to the services that are available in the area for more effective referrals and to work out ways to provide
those services to the Rio Hondo area residents who need them. The Housing Plan (refer herein to Section
3) includes a local program that is designed to address local emergency housing needs. This new program
indicates an area of the City where emergency shelters will be permitted by right. The Zoning Ordinance
and map will be amended so that emergency shelters will become a permitted use in the designated areas.
2.6 SUBSIDIZED HOUSING UNITS AT RISK OF CONVERSION
The State law regarding the scope and content of housing elements was amended in the early 1990s to
include the identification of subsidized housing units that may be at risk of conversion to market rate
units. According to data provided by HCD, there is one assisted housing development that is currently at
risk of conversion. The Century Place Apartments, located at 13801 Paramount Boulevard, consists 0f
306 units of which 62 units are low income units. The development contract expired in 2005 and was not
renewed. If the current nonprofit organization managing the 62 units at risk is no longer able to maintain
the project, transferring ownership of the affordable units to another nonprofit housing organization is a
viable way to preserve affordable housing for the long-term. This may be difficult since the 62 units are
included in a larger market-rate multiple-family apartment. A list of qualified agencies that have
indicated interest in purchasing projects that are at-risk of converting to market rate is attached as
Appendix B. Preservation of at-risk projects can be achieved in a variety of ways, with adequate funding
availability. These include:
     ●   Transfer of ownership to nonprofit developers and housing organizations;
SECTION 2 ● PROFILE REPORT                                                                          PAGE 38

                         CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
    ●    Providing rental assistance to renters through other funding sources;
    ●    Purchase affordability covenants; and,
    ●    Refinance mortgage revenue bonds.
Alternatively, units that are converted to market rate may be replaced with new assisted multi-family
units with specified affordability timeframes. In case nonprofit developers cannot maintain or operate
existing affordable housing units, the City will contact potential nonprofit purchasers and investigate
other methods to preserve affordability of those units.
State, local, or other funding sources can also be used to provide rental subsidies to maintain the
affordability of at-risk projects. These subsidies can be structured to mirror the Section 8 program,
whereby the subsidy covers the cost of the unit above what is determined to be affordable for the tenant’s
household income (including a utility allowance) up to the fair market value of the apartment. The total
annual subsidy to maintain the 62 at-risk units for very low-income households is estimated to be
approximately $422,964 assuming a per unit subsidy of $6,822. The per unit rent subsidy is calculated
based on the affordable annual cost (30% of 50% AMI) less the fair market rents and utilities associated
with each unit size.
To replace any loss in the affordable housing stock, the City will encourage private developers to construct
new affordable housing developments. The cost of developing new housing depends on a variety of
factors including density, size of units, construction quality and type, location, and land cost. Assuming a
development cost of $200,000 for a multi-family rental unit, the cost of replacing all 62 affordable at-risk
units would be approximately $12,400,000.
2.7 CONSTRAINTS TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT
There are many factors that may affect the type, timing, and cost of new housing construction. The State
of California Government Code that dictates the scope and content of housing elements require the
elements to consider those variables that may constrain the development of new housing. These
“constraints” considered in this Housing Element include the following:
    ●    Governmental Constraints refer to those actions undertaken by the government that may restrict
         or otherwise impede the development of new housing, especially affordable housing;
    ●    Land Use Controls refer to General Plan and Zoning regulations that may be considered
         exclusionary;
    ●    Environmental Constraints refer to those environmental factors, such as limited available land,
         infrastructure, or hazards, that may affect the construction of new housing; and,
    ●    Market Constraints refers to economic factors (land values, construction costs, interest rates,
         etc.).

2.7.1 GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS PROCESSING FEES
Local governments may unintentionally influence the cost of housing through land use controls, building
codes and their enforcement, fee processing requirements, required on- and off-site improvements, and
taxes and insurance. The aforementioned fees are summarized below in Table 18.

The City of Paramount Department of Community Development is responsible for ensuring that all new
construction is performed and completed in a safe and proper manner using the correct materials and
methods. Permits are required for any changes, including electrical, plumbing or building changes to any
property. Applicants and/or contractors are required to bring their plans to City Hall where a building
inspector will examine the plans for approval. The building permit provides evidence that the contractor
has complied with the Building Code and the City has approved the proposed construction. The building
permit also serves as the permanent record of all improvements done to a particular structure. Building
permits are required to do any new work including mostly repair work.
Table 19 estimates the building fees for a typical single-family home and multiple-family development.
The fees shown in Table 19 are applicable to both single-family and multiple-family development. The
processing fees are well under 1% of the total development cost. Assuming a 1,000 square-foot unit, the
total development fees (including school district fees) would be approximately $5,470 per unit. This
assumes 20 electrical fixtures, 5 plumbing fixtures, one sewer connection, and one thousand square feet of
floor area. The permit fees account for less than 3% of a residential unit costing $225,000.

Table 20 compares the fees charged by Paramount with those of South Gate, Downey, and Long Beach.
As indicated in the table, the fees charged by the City are well below those of the neighboring communities
surveyed. The processing fees are well under one percent of the total development cost. Assuming a
1,000 square-foot unit, the total development fees (including school district fees) would be approximately
$5,470 per unit. This assumes 20 electrical fixtures, 5 plumbing fixtures, one sewer connections, and one
thousand square feet of floor area. The permit fees account for less than 3% of a residential units costing

At the present time, the development fees for single-family development are relatively low with the costs
for site plan review being under $1,000. The cost would be higher in the event a zone variance, zone
change, or general plan amendment is required. Assuming a total development cost of a single-family
unit of $100,000 per unit, the typical processing fees would account for approximately one percent of the
total development cost.

2.7.2 OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS
For a typical single-family home, there are no off-site fees related to the construction of new
infrastructure, park fees (Quimby Ordinance), or Mello-Roos fees. The street system and supporting
infrastructure has been installed as part of the area’s historic development. The City of Paramount
maintains a high engineering standard for curbs, gutters, sidewalks, and streets, and these standards
regulate construction and such items as width and grade. In the past, the City has approved residential
subdivisions with private streets where the standards have been modified to reduce housing costs. Future
single-family development will most likely be authorized as a PRD with private access. The width of the
access will depend on the length of the proposed street, whether or not it has through access, and whether
it is intended to accommodate on-street parking. There are no established standards for private streets
other than that they must be wide enough to meet standards established in the California Fire Code for
Fire Department equipment needs. However, the City is primarily built out and it is unlikely that new
public streets will be created by future housing development.
The City’s requirements for off-site improvements related to multiple-family developments are not overly
or unnecessarily restrictive. The density, setback and other standards regulating development within the
City are consistent with those being used by other surrounding communities and will not inhibit the
development of a range of housing types within the City. Furthermore, the use of Area Plans promote
innovative planning and design that translates into lower housing costs. Through the use of specific
(area) plans, the City has facilitated the development of more affordable housing by providing relief from
parking, density, setback, and other development standards. The City has not imposed any moratoria,
open-space requirements, or prohibitions against multi-family housing that would potentially inhibit the
development of new housing. The City will continue to review the general development standards such as
street width, parking lanes, and sidewalks, not only to result in lower costs, but also in a more pleasing
appearance for the subdivision. Developments must also provide connection to water and wastewater
systems. Where roadways are not present, developers are required to construct all internal roadways for a
subdivision, and provide connections to existing roadways.
2.7.3 PROCESSING TIMES AND BUILDING CODES
Permit fees and approval time frames do not pose a constraint to the development of housing in
Paramount. The City employs a plan check process that applies to all residential development including
multi-family housing. Plan check for the processing of building permits typically require seven to ten
working days, depending on the City’s work load. Building codes are applied to all new construction, and
are monitored and inspected under the building permit process. Where no permits have been obtained,
inspections are made in response to requests and complaints.
The City of Paramount has adopted the 2013 California Building Code (CBC) with Los Angeles County
Amendments, which establishes the minimum standards for new construction. Under State law, the City
may impose more stringent standards though it cannot adopt any that are less stringent than those
included in the CBC. No standards have been adopted above the minimum standards of the CBC. There
are no extraordinary regulations applied by the City that would hinder future housing development. The
entitlement process for discretionary permits, a zone change, general plan amendment, tract map, and
conditional use permit application typically require 60 to 90 days to receive final approval. Zone changes
SECTION 2 ● PROFILE REPORT                                                                         PAGE 42

                       CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
and general plan amendments are first heard by the Planning Commission and then the City Council. For
the majority of these cases, the City Council will review the item and render a decision within 90 days of
application submittal. The Development Review Board (DRB) approval process generally requires 30 to
60 days. The DRB ensures that a project complies with applicable zoning standards, and is generally the
only body necessary for approval for a residential project. All residential development, except for single-
family homes, must receive approval from the DRB prior to the issuance of a building permit. Proposed
single-family residential projects are reviewed administratively, and generally require 15 to 30 days to
receive approval.
As indicated previously, the City has adopted the 2013 California Building Code. This code is considered
to be the minimum necessary to protect public health, safety and welfare. No amendments have been
made that diminish the ability of new housing to accommodate persons with disabilities. There are no
locally amended universal design elements; the universal design provisions of the California Building
Code are enforced. Exceptions or methods of alternative compliance to the requirements to the California
Building Code are contained in the code. The City has no local ability to waive the provisions of the State
building codes. However, a mechanism within the building code allows for an appeals process to
challenge interpretations of the building code requirements. Code enforcement is done on a complaint
basis.
2.7.4 LAND USE CONTROLS
The City of Paramount Zoning Ordinance also provides for a variety of housing types. The City’s zoning
code does not impose constraints on the development of housing units but rather enforces general
standards common in other surrounding cities. Other land use controls pertain to second units,
manufactured housing, and mobile home parks. Manufactured housing units are permitted in all
residential zones as long as the unit is anchored to a permanent foundation. Land use and development
within the City of Paramount is governed by the general plan. The general plan indicates the location and
extent of permitted land uses and development within the City. The general plan provides for the
following residential land use designations:
     ●   Single-Family Residential (SF). This designation is intended to provide for the establishment and
         preservation of quality single-family neighborhoods containing the lowest densities in the City.
         The maximum density for this land use designation is eight dwelling units per acre. For infill
         development, planned unit development on smaller residential lots (approximately 4,000 square
         feet net), including zero lot line development, may be permitted.
     ●   Multiple-Family Residential (MF). The multiple-family designation provides for a wide variety of
         residential opportunities ranging up to 22 dwelling units per acre. Further delineation of more
         detailed density ranges is achieved either through conventional zoning, special housing
         opportunity area designations, planned development with performance standard zoning, or
         policy/regulatory specific plans.
     ●   Commercial. The General Plan was recently amended to permit mixed-use development with the
         approval of a conditional use permit. The maximum development density for mixed use
         development is currently 22 units per acre.

One of the more significant constraints to the development of substantial numbers of new housing units is
related to the availability of land to accommodate such development. As indicated in the previous
sections, the City has been fully developed for a number of years. Of the total land area available for
development, 1,492.2 acres, or 53.3%, are designated for residential development. It should be noted that
the amount of land area designated for multiple-family development (797.7 acres) exceeds the total land
area designated for single-family development (694.5-acres). Some parcels within the City are not
developed to the maximum intensity theoretically possible under the applicable General Plan designation.
For example, approximately 28.4% of the City’s total land area is designated for multiple-family
residential. However not all properties are developed to the maximum extent possible. Table 22 indicates
the residential development theoretically possible if all of the parcels designated for residential land uses
were developed to the maximum intensities permitted under the General Plan. As indicated in Table 22, a
total of 23,237 units are theoretically possible if all of the parcels designated for residential development
are ultimately developed to the maximum density permitted under the General Plan. This represents
8,063 units over the existing number of 15,174 units. These statistics indicate the City’s adopted land use
policy is non-exclusionary.

As indicated in a section that follows, the City’s current (5th Cycle) 2014-2021 Regional Housing Needs
Allocation (RHNA) is 103 housing units. In addition, there is an unmet need of 961 units from the 2008-
2014 (4th Cycle) planning period. The total combined unmet need for the 4th Cycle and 5th Cycle is 1,061

units. In other words, the RHNA calls for these 1,064 additional units to be provided during the 2014-
2021 planning period. The remaining residential development capacity of 8,719 units could easily
accommodate the 1,064 units. This capacity does not include the potential units that could be included in
mixed use projects in the City’s C-3 (General Commercial) zones.
2.7.5 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS IN THE ZONING ORDINANCE
The Paramount Zoning Code contains three residential zone districts.                   These districts include the
following:
     ●   R-1 (Single-family Residential) – This zone district refers to detached single-family development.
         This zone district corresponds to the Low-Density Residential General Plan land use designation.
     ●   R-2 (Medium-Density Residential) – This zone district also refers to detached single-family
         development and lower density multiple-family residential development. This zone district also
         corresponds to the Low Density Residential General Plan land use designation.
     ●   R-M (Multiple-family Residential) – This zone district refers to multiple-family residential
         development. This zone district corresponds to the Multiple-family Residential land use
         designation included in the General Plan.
Table 23 summarizes the development standards for the residential zones, including permitted uses, lot
sizes, setback requirements, and other standards. The City of Paramount Zoning Ordinance stipulates the
residential types permitted, conditionally permitted, or prohibited in each of the residential zone districts.
Permitted Uses refer to those uses allowed without discretionary review except for design review, in
designated areas, as long as the project complies with all development standards. Conditional Use
Permits (CUP) are approved by the Planning Commission unless appealed to the City Council. Projects
appealed to the City Council get priority scheduling and fees for the appeal do not exceed $288. Typical
findings of a CUP include that the project is consistent with the general plan; the use is compatible with
surrounding uses, addresses basic public health and safety, and general welfare concerns.

                      CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
As indicated in Table 23, the City of Paramount Zoning Ordinance contains three zone districts (R-1, R-2,
and R-M) that are specifically residential. The table also indicates the key development standards for
each of the three residential zone districts. In addition to land use controls, local building codes also
affect the cost of housing. The City has adopted the California Building Code which establishes minimum
construction standards. The development standards are consistent with those used throughout
California.
The City will implement a new program that will involve a review and revision of the Zoning Ordinance.
As part of this Zoning Ordinance revision process, the City will examine certain development standards,
such as the maximum height requirement for the R-M Zone (which is 30 feet), parking requirements, and
other residential development standards to determine if a relaxation of these requirements is feasible as a
means to reduce the cost of new multiple-family construction. The Zoning Ordinance revision will also
include the development of a new overlay designation that will permit the implementation of the infill and
mixed-use developments anticipated as part of the Housing Element’s implementation.
Table 24 describes the housing types by permitted uses. The time required to process a project varies
greatly from one project to another and is directly related to the size and complexity of the proposal and
the number of actions or approvals needed to complete the process. Review and approval procedures may
run concurrently. For example, a ministerial review for a single-family home would be processed
concurrently with the design review. The City also encourages the joint processing of related applications
for a single project. As an example, a rezone petition may be reviewed in conjunction with the required
site plan, a tentative tract map, and any necessary variances. Such procedures save time, money, and
effort for both the public and private sector and could decrease the costs for the developer.

Specific zoning requirements for mixed use and SRO development will be identified as part of a future
zoning ordinance revision. The processing requirements for supportive and transitional housing will
correspond to those required for single-family units (assuming they are being proposed in the R-1 zones).
Standards for SRO and mixed use developments will be identified in the commercial and multiple-family
(R-M) zone districts. Pursuant to State law, manufactured housing is permitted by right in R-1 zones.
The standards applied to such housing are the same as those governing conventional “stick built” housing.
There are an estimated 1,372 manufactured (mobile) homes in the City of Paramount.
The City works closely with developers to expedite approval procedures so as not to put any unnecessary
timing constraints on development. For a typical project, an initial pre-consultation meeting with the
community development department, public works, and the fire department is arranged to discuss the
development proposal. Then a tentative parcel map application or a description of project must be filed
with a site plan, which is first reviewed by the planning department and other agencies such as public
works for consistency with City ordinances and General Plan guidelines.
The City also encourages the joint processing of related applications for a multiple-family project. For
example, a request for a rezoning may be reviewed in conjunction with the site plan, a tentative tract map,
and any variances. As indicated previously, the City works closely with developers to expedite approval
procedures so as not to put any unnecessary timing constraints on development. In addition, the City
makes full use of the CEQA Infill Housing Exemption. For a typical housing project, an initial pre-
consultation meeting with the Community Development Department, public works, and the fire
department is arranged to discuss the development proposal. After the project is approved, the building
department performs plan checks and issues building permits. Throughout the construction of a multiple-
family development, the building department will perform building checks to monitor the progress of the
project. This process does not put an undue time constraint on most developments because of the close
working relationship between City staff, developers, and the decision-making body. Table 25 outlines
typical approval requirements for a single-family infill project, a typical subdivision, and a typical
multiple-family rental housing development.
The City’s Development Review Board (DRB) reviews residential development within the R-2 and R-M
zone districts. The DRB consists of members of the planning commission with the planning director and
the chief building official being advisory members. The design review process is not applicable when any
of the following conditions exist:
     ●   When the requested building permit is for security purposes or is to correct a safety hazard
         threatening life or property, including fire damage, and when time is of the essence in making
         such remedial corrections.
     ●   For interior modifications requiring building permits or for residential patio covers.
     ●   Administrative approval of building additions shall be limited to additions of fifteen percent of
         the existing gross floor area of the building to which the addition is to be added.
     ●   The right to waive such Development Review Board approvals is the responsibility of the Director
         of Community Development.

                        CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
     ●    Approvals from the Development Review Board is not required for attached additions to single-
          family dwellings which are located in the R-2 or R-M zones.
The DRB approval process generally requires 30 to 60 days. The DRB review process ensures that a
project complies with the applicable zoning standards. The DRB is typically the only body necessary for
the approval of a multiple-family development. Except for single-family homes, multiple-family
residential developments must receive approval from the DRB prior to the issuance of a building permit.
Single-family residential projects are reviewed administratively and generally require 15 to 30 days to
receive approval. The DRB review process is essentially a component of the City’s site plan review
process. When the proposal is discretionary, the architecture and site plan are among the elements the
Planning Commission considers along with any requested discretionary approvals.
Depending on the complexity of the project, a single-family project is approved in 2 to 3 weeks from date
of plan submission; if no variances, exceptions, or zone changes are needed. After the project is approved,
the building department performs plan checks and issues building permits. In some instances the Chief
Planning Official may approve Minor Variances where the deviation is less than 10% of the applicable
standard. Throughout construction, the City will perform building checks to monitor the progress of the
project. This process does not seem to put an undue time constraint on most developments because of the
close working relationship between City staff, developers, and the decision-making body. Table 25
identifies the typical processing time most common in the entitlement process. It should be noted that
each project does not necessarily have to complete each step in the process (i.e., small scale projects
consistent with General Plan and Zoning designations do not generally require Environmental Impact
Reports [EIR], General Plan Amendments, Rezones, or Variances).

Specific zoning requirements for mixed use and SRO development will be identified as part of a future
zoning ordinance revision (refer to the discussion on the following page). The processing requirements
for supportive and transitional housing will correspond to those required for single-family units
(assuming they are being proposed in the single-family zone). SRO and mixed use developments will
correspond with those indicated for the multiple-family developments.
The City does not restrict occupancy of unrelated individuals in local housing. The Zoning Ordinance
does include a definition for “family” in its listing of definitions which will be removed as part of the
zoning ordinance revision (Program 3.5.25 Zoning Conformity).
2.8 NON-GOVERNMENTAL OR MARKET CONSTRAINTS
Three market factors are cited by State law as a necessary part of the constraints analysis: 1) land cost; 2)
construction costs; and, 3) financing availability. In the Paramount market analysis, the scope of analysis
is enlarged to include an assessment of prevailing prices and rents. Housing costs as a constraint on
affordability must be examined in light of the rental and ownership costs within the means of various
economic segments. State law identifies four economic segments: Very low-income; Low-Income;
Moderate-Income; and High-Income. The annual income limits of these four groups are further defined
by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in reference to the median income for Los
Angeles County and household size. The median income for all households in the County is estimated to
be $38,000. Affordable housing costs are computed on a basis of 30% of monthly income. The affordable
ownership costs, or purchase price of a home, are calculated on the basis of the rule of thumb of 2.5 times
the annual household income. These affordable housing costs then can be compared to the prevailing
costs in Paramount to confirm the existence of market constraints.
One of the major problems facing households in the City of Paramount, and the broader regional housing
market, is affordability. This problem is related to the match between household income and the size and
cost of owning or renting a home. Between 1970 and 1980, the median value of a home in the City of
Paramount increased 241%, and the median gross rent increased 97%. At the same time, median
household income for City residents increased only 62%. The gap between housing cost and income
widened for most City residents. By 1990, the median mortgage for a home in the City was $1,283. The
median household rent in 2000 was $720. A household is generally considered to be overpaying for
housing if it is paying more than 30% of its gross monthly income for housing. According to the 2000
Census, 273 households (8.7 % of the total number of households in the City) paid between 30% to 34% of
their monthly household income towards housing. The 2000 Census also indicated that 1,296 households
(30.2%) paid in excess of 35% of their monthly incomes towards housing. The 2010 Census indicated that
10.7% of the total number of households in the City) paid between 30% to 34% of their monthly
household income towards housing. The 2010 Census also indicated that 51.1% paid in excess of 35% of
their monthly incomes towards housing.
2.8.1 FINANCING COST TRENDS
Although private financing is generally available at market rates, low- and moderate-income households
usually need below market rate financing to enable them to repair existing homes or purchase resale or
new housing units. Also, all potential developers of housing projects are provided information on the
SECTION 2 ● PROFILE REPORT                                                                           PAGE 49

                       CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
various Los Angeles County financing programs available for low-income rental construction or
rehabilitation projects. Additionally, a survey of local banking institutions revealed that redlining does
not occur in the City. In fact, a number of banks have established programs to encourage lower-income
residents to purchase homes, and to improve homes that they already own.
2.8.2 LAND PRICES
Land costs are a major contributor to overall housing production prices. The balance of the City's housing
production will occur in the infill areas. In these areas, the land costs are, in part, associated with the
costs of the single-family dwellings now on the sites. Land prices for new residential construction range
from $20 to $25 per square-foot. The practical effect of land prices relates primarily on infill sites that are
underutilized. Consequently, the land costs (i.e., resale homes) would need to be adjusted to per-unit land
costs based on the existing density.
2.8.3 CONSTRUCTION COSTS
Construction costs include the materials and labor necessary to build the structure. These costs will vary
widely depending on the quality features (e.g., size, roofing, carpeting, etc.) that are incorporated in the
structure. The cost for the construction of a single-family home is in the area of $50 to $75 per square-
foot.
2.8.4 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
This section describes those environmental factors that must typically be considered in the planning and
development of new housing in the City.
    ●    Hazardous Substances. The sites that were developed prior to the 1970s may include trace
         amounts of lead and/or asbestos in the soils and any remaining structures. Lead-based paint was
         commonly used prior to 1970 and is the predominant source of lead contamination in the soils.
         Asbestos was commonly used as insulation and floor tiles during this same period. As a result,
         any demolition associated with any future redevelopment may require some form of investigation
         and/or remediation. However, no Cortese site (Hazardous Waste and Substance listing from the
         Department of Toxic Substances Control) is identified within the City.
    ●    Seismic Risk. Major faults in the region include the Whittier Elsinore, Norwalk, Newport
         Inglewood, Santa Monica, Sierra Madre, Palos Verdes, and San Andreas Faults. According to the
         Los Angeles County Safety Element, no known or suspected active fault traces pass through or are
         located near the City. There are no designated Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zones found within
         the City. The City is located within an area that may be subject to liquefaction hazards. However,
         the level of risk within the City is no greater than that anticipated for the region.
    ●    Wildfire Risk. No areas of native or natural vegetation are found within Paramount. The entire
         City is located outside of any Zone 4 (wildfire risk) designation according to maps prepared by the
         Los Angeles County Fire Department. The Zone 4 designation applies to those areas of the
         County where the natural vegetation represents a significant wildfire risk.
SECTION 2 ● PROFILE REPORT                                                                             PAGE 50

                      CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
    ●    Flood Risk. With the exception of the Los Angeles River channel, there are no lakes or streams
         within the City. No natural stream channels remain within any of the candidate development
         sites. The majority of the City was previously located within a designated flood hazard area as
         identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (the “AR zone” that was assigned to
         areas where potential flooding may occur until upstream flood control improvements are
         completed). The AR zone was proposed and adopted after the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers
         (ACOE) determined that flood control systems serving the Los Angeles area are no longer
         sufficient in terms of protecting nearby areas from inundation by the base flood scenario. The
         ACOE has completed the upstream flood control improvements and the AR flood zone
         designation has been removed.
The aforementioned environmental constraints related to seismic risk, flooding risk, and other natural
hazards are identified in the Safety Element included in the City of Paramount General Plan. In addition,
these hazards are shown in the City’s adopted Hazard Mitigation Plan.
2.8.5 INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRAINTS
As indicated in the previous section, the majority of the City was previously developed. As a result, any
potential housing redevelopment site is currently served by basic infrastructure.
    ●    Water Service. Paramount’s domestic water system is operated by City’s Water Department. The
         system consists of twelve water pumps, one 2.5 million gallons storage tank and many miles of
         water lines. City Engineers indicate that the system operates without any problems and there are
         no areas of the City that have deficiencies.
    ●    Sewer Service. The County Sanitation Districts maintains and operates the sewer system in the
         City. The City is served by the Los Angeles County Sanitation District No. 2. Sewer lines are
         maintained by the County Department of Public Works, with sewage from the area conveyed
         through sewer mains into the Joint Water Pollution Control Plant (JWPCP) in Carson. The
         JWPCP has a design capacity of 385 million gallons per day (mgd) and currently treats 330 mgd.
         Given the projected demand and the existing remaining treatment capacity, future developments’
         treatment demand can be met by the service provider.
    ●    Flood Control. The City is served by the Los Angeles County Flood Control District which
         operates and maintains regional and municipal storm drainage facilities. The City works with the
         Flood Control District in making local drainage plans and improvements. The projected runoff
         from the potential infill sites may be accommodated by existing storm drain infrastructure. The
         projected storm water runoff from potential future development is not anticipated to significantly
         increase given the nature and extent of existing impervious surfaces within the City.

                             SECTION 3.0 - HOUSING PLAN
3.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE RHNA
This section of the City of Paramount Housing Element compares the housing need projections developed
by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) as part of the Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA), with historic population, housing, and employment growth in the City. The
projections were derived from population, housing, and employment figures developed by SCAG as part
of the earlier planning process undertaken to develop the RHNA. The authority to determine housing
needs for the various income groups for cities within the region has been delegated to the Southern
California Association of Governments (SCAG), pursuant to Section 65584 of the Government Code. The
housing needs are categorized according to income groups. The income categories include Very low,
Low, Moderate, and Above moderate-income households, and the incomes of the selected income groups
are based upon percentages of the median household income for the larger Los Angeles County region:
    ●    Very Low-Income households are those households whose income is less than 50% of the median
         household income for the greater Los Angeles area;
    ●    Low-Income households earn from 50% to 80% of the County median;
    ●    Moderate-Income groups earn from 80% to 120% of the County median; and,
    ●    Above moderate-income households earn over 120% of the County median income.
3.2 PROJECTED HOUSING NEEDS
SCAG’s Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) estimated the seven-year (2014-2021) future
housing construction need for Paramount at 105 units. Of the 105 housing units needed to accommodate
future need, 26 units should be allocated to extremely low and very low-income households, 16 units
should be provided for low-income households, 17 units should be provided for moderate-income
households, and 46 units should be provided for households with above moderate-incomes.
The HCD indicates that the projected need for extremely low-income households may be calculated by
assuming that such households represent 50% of the very low-income households. In other words, the
future house need for extremely low-income households in Paramount is projected to be 124 units. The
State Legislature also requires local governments to consider the projected needs for extremely low-
income households. As indicated previously, those households that have incomes of 30% of the County
median would fall into this category. Based on a 2010 Los Angeles County median ($61,632), an
extremely low-income household would have a median annual income of $18,490 or less.
The City has approved the construction of 2 units during the current planning period. Their location and
description is provided below.
    1.   A permit was issued on 11/27/2012 to construct a single-family unit at 15938 Orizaba.
    2. A permit was issued on 1/5/2013 to construct a single-family unit at 7319 Marcelle.
SECTION 3 ● HOUSING PLAN                                                                         PAGE 53

                       CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
The adjusted current 2014-2021 (5th Cycle) RHNA that takes into account the units that have been
provided during this current planning period is summarized in Table 26. The total RHNA is reduced from
105 units to 103 units.
SCAG’s previous RHNA estimated the seven-year 4th Cycle totaled 1,017 units. Of the 1,017 housing units
needed to accommodate future need, 248 units were for very low-income households, 156 units were for
low-income households, 168 units were for moderate-income households, and 445 units were for
households with above-moderate incomes. The 4th Cycle RHNA was adjusted to take into account the
units that have been provided during the 4th Cycle planning period (refer to Table 26). As indicated in the
table, the 4th Cycle RHNA was reduced from 1,017 units to 961 units.
As indicated in a section that follows, the City’s current (5th Cycle) 2014-2021 Regional Housing Needs
Allocation (RHNA) is 105 housing units. In addition, there is an unmet need of 961 units from the 2008-
2014 (4th Cycle) planning period. The total combined unmet need for the 4th Cycle and 5th Cycle is 1,066
units. In other words, the RHNA calls for these 1,066 additional units to be provided during the 2014-
2021 planning period. The remaining residential development capacity of 8,719 units could easily
accommodate the 1,064 units.
Table 26 summarizes the distribution of the projected housing needs for the five income categories for the
4th and 5th Housing Element Update Cycles.

3.3 LAND AVAILABLE TO ACCOMMODATE RHNA HOUSING NEED
The City of Paramount is fully developed and, as a result, any new residential development will consist of
infill development within properties that are currently vacant or underutilized. New residential
development may also occur within residentially zoned properties where the existing land uses are non-
residential at the present time. Of the total land area available for development, 1,492.2 acres, or 53.3%,
is designated for residential development. It should be noted that the amount of land area designated for
multiple-family development (797.7 acres) also exceeds the total land area designated for single-family
development (694.5 acres). Some parcels within the City are not developed to the maximum intensity
theoretically possible under the applicable General Plan designation. For example, approximately 28.4%
of the City’s total land area is designated for multiple-family residential. However not all of these
properties are developed in higher density, multiple-family uses.
SECTION 3 ● HOUSING PLAN                                                                                PAGE 54

                       CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
A total of 23,237 units are theoretically possible if all of the parcels designated for residential development
are ultimately developed to the maximum density permitted under the general plan. This build-out
translates into 8,629 units over the existing number of 14,608 units. The remaining residential
development capacity of 8,719 units is well in excess of the remaining unmet need of 1,064 units that are
required to accommodate the RHNA for the 4th and 5th Cycles. This potential capacity does not include
the potential units that could be included in potential mixed use projects in the City’s C-3 (General
Commercial) zones. The City of Paramount General Plan was recently updated to expand the range of
permitted land uses within the Commercial land use designation. The City will promote the development
of new mixed use development within selected commercial zones. A total of 82 acres have been
designated for Mixed Use and these areas will permit development densities of up to 22 units per acre.
The primary infill housing strategy focuses on the identification of a specific area of the City that could be
developed in residential uses. Two available sites were identified as potential candidates in the 4th
Housing Element update cycle that would enable the City to accommodate its RHNA allocation. The two
sites are identified in Appendix A.

3.5 HOUSING PROGRAMS
This section outlines those housing programs that will be effective in the implementation of the
aforementioned housing policies. An implementation matrix indicating those programs that will be
effective in the implementation of the housing policies is provided at the end of this section.
3.5.1 AFFORDABLE HOUSING BONUSES AND INCENTIVES ORDINANCE
Program Description. As required under the Government Code, this program provides for bonuses and
other incentives in the City’s Zoning Ordinance to developers who construct projects with qualifying
percentages of affordable housing units. This program reflects the affordable housing density bonus
requirements contained in the City of Paramount Zoning Ordinance (Section 44-57, Density in Multiple-
Family Residential Zones).
Program Implementation. This housing program presently exists. No additional funding and/or staffing
will be required or are anticipated with this program’s continued implementation. The City will continue
to promote the program by providing brochures describing the program and its benefits, and making
them available at the counter and information desk in City Hall. Further promotion of this program will
be accomplished by verbally communicating information regarding housing bonuses to housing
developers as they are assisted by the Planning Department at the public counter or over the telephone.
Under this Housing Element, the program will be continued over the entire planning period applicable to
this Housing Element update. This program’s implementation strategy is summarized below:
     ●   Source of Funding: General Fund.
     ●   2014-2021 Program Objectives: The City will advertise this program through handout materials,
         the City's web page, and through periodic advertisements in the City newsletter.
     ●   Agency Responsible for Implementation: City of Paramount Community Development
         Department.
     ●   Implementation Schedule: The program is ongoing and will be continued.
3.5.2 AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM
Program Description. The Affordable Housing Program provides grants or subsidized interest rate loans
for purchase, construction and/or rehabilitation of owner-occupied housing by or for very low, low- and
moderate-income households and/or to finance the purchase, construction or rehabilitation of rental
housing. The program can assist Group Homes/Congregate Care, Homeless Shelters, Mobile Home Park
Purchase Assistance, New For-Sale Housing, New Rental Housing, Rehab of Apartments, Rehab of
Owner-Occupied Housing, Self-Help Housing, Single Room Occupancy (SRO) developments, and
Transitional Housing. Both profit- and non-profit organizations are potential applicants for the loans and
grants.

                     CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
Program Implementation. The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco provided the financing for this
program that provides construction/rehabilitation loans, grants, long-term loans, and other technical
assistance. The amount of grant or interest rate subsidy depends on the amount of assistance required to
make the project feasible. No matching funds are required and the available funding amount of up to
$18,000,000 may be repaid over a 30-year period. The application cycle is twice a year. This program’s
implementation strategy is summarized below:
    ●    Source of Funding: General Fund to complete grant application.
    ●    2014-2021 Program Objectives: Not Applicable.
    ●    Agency Responsible for Implementation: City of Paramount Community Development
         Department.
    ●    Implementation Schedule: The program is ongoing and will be continued.
3.5.3 CALHOME PROGRAM
Program Description. The program provides grants to local public agencies and nonprofit developers to
assist individual households through deferred-payment loans. Direct forgivable loans to assist
development projects involving multiple ownership units, including single-family subdivisions. This
enables low and very low-income households to become or remain homeowners. Activities eligible for
these loans are as follows: redevelopment, site development, new construction, rehabilitation, acquisition
and rehabilitation, down payment assistance, mortgage financing, home buyer counseling, and technical
assistance for self-help projects or shared housing.
Program Implementation. All funds to individual homeowners will be in the form of loans. Loans are
available for real property acquisition, site development, redevelopment, construction period expenses of
home ownership development projects, or permanent financing for mutual housing and cooperative
developments. Project loans to developers may be forgiven as developers make deferred payment loans to
individual homeowners. Assistance to individual households will be in the form of deferred-payment
loans, payable on sale or transfer of the homes, or when they cease to be owner-occupied, or at maturity.
This program’s implementation strategy is summarized below:
    ●    Source of Funding: Community Development Block Grant (CDBG).
    ●    2014-2021 Program Objectives: The City will assist 40 homeowners through this program.
    ●    Agency Responsible for Implementation: City of Paramount Community Development
         Department.
    ●    Implementation Schedule: The program is ongoing and will be continued.            The brochure
         materials and handouts will be provided by the end of the second quarter of 2014. The program
         will also be described in the second quarter issue (2014) of the City’s newsletter. Finally, the
         program will be advertised on the City’s website. The website will be revised by the end of the

3.5.4 CODE ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM
The City of Paramount Code Enforcement Program is designed to bring properties up to City code
requirements and to clean up and improve unsightly or unsafe properties. Under this program, City
personnel refers property owners cited for Code violations to housing rehabilitation assistance programs
as a means to provide financial assistance to qualifying households. Because of the limited number of
staff members available for code enforcement and building code enforcement activities, the City typically
responds to maintenance problems on a complaint basis. In most instances, the greatest number of
housing maintenance complaints typically from tenants who are living in substandard rental units.
Efforts to bring the property owner into compliance with building and property maintenance code
requirements generally do not affect the availability of housing. These efforts do result in improved living
conditions for lower-income tenants. With regard to owner-occupied units, those property owners who
do not comply with notices of code violations are referred to an Appeals Board, which has the authority to
modify staff determinations regarding improvements to the properties. In cases of extreme hardship, the
Appeals Board grants extensions of time and often refers the property owner to the Neighborhood
Improvement Program, where, depending on the resident's income status, CBDG funds are available to
assist in needed repairs.
Program Implementation.       During the past fiscal year, Code Enforcement has cited 25 residential
properties for development and/or zoning code violations. The majority of these violations were related
to maintenance and outdoor storage. However, no code violations were subsequently transmitted to the
Appeals Board. This housing program presently exists. No additional funding and/or staffing will be
required or are anticipated with this program’s continued implementation. The code-enforcement efforts
will be linked with the housing rehabilitation programs in that property owners of substandard units
receiving code violation notices will also be informed of rehabilitation programs. Under this Housing
Element, the program will be continued over the entire planning period applicable to this Housing
Element update. This program’s implementation strategy is summarized below:
     ●   Source of Funding: General Fund and Community Development Block Grant (CDBG).
     ●   2014-2021 Program Objectives: 125 units corrected.
     ●   Agency Responsible for Implementation: City of Paramount Public Safety Department.
     ●   Implementation Schedule: The program is ongoing and will be continued.
3.5.5 EXTREMELY LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROGRAM
Program Description. This housing program is specifically targeted for those households that fall into the
extremely low-income group. These programs reflect a number existing initiatives that support the
provision of housing for households with extremely low and very low-incomes. A primary objective of
these programs is to promote the development of housing units for households earning 30 percent or less
of the Median Family Income for Los Angeles County. The extremely low-income programs will also be
used in conjunction with those programs that promote the development of non-traditional housing types,
such as single-room occupancy units, that are more affordable to extremely low-income households.
SECTION 3 ● HOUSING PLAN                                                                            PAGE 59

                      CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
The City’s use of the available Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) programs is guided by the
adoption and implementation of a Housing Assistance Plan (HAP) by the City Council. The HAP is an
assessment of housing needs for low- and moderate-income persons and a schedule of goals over three
years to address need within reasonably available resources. In order to receive Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) funds, annual HAP goals are updated and a full needs assessment is completed each
three-year period. The County prepares the statistical assessment of need for the City to meet the Federal
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) specifications; the needs assessment is based on
computerized census data. The HAP is a prerequisite to the City receiving any HUD subsidized housing
assistance, such as Section 8 existing rental assistance and Section 202 new senior housing assistance.
Los Angeles County will be administering the City’s Section 8 program that provides rental subsidies to
eligible low-income person and families who rent units in the private housing market. Funds are
provided through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). These are the
principal HUD programs for assisting households in obtaining decent, safe, and sanitary housing. The
overall program is administered by HUD and provides Federal funds to local jurisdictions for housing
assistance. These funds are then used to provide grants to low- and moderate-income homeowners. The
two types of rental assistance include the following:
     ●   Certificate of family participation, which provides a subsidy based on the difference between
         30% of the family's adjusted income and the rent of the units; and,
     ●   Housing vouchers, which pays a subsidy based on the difference between 30 percent of the
         family's adjusted income and the applicable payment standard.
The eligible households for rental assistance include the following:
     ●   Elderly families consisting of one or more persons where one of the family members is 62 years of
         age or older;
     ●   Individuals or families where one adult member of the household is handicapped or disabled;
         and,
     ●   Families of two or more persons living together in a family-type relationship.
Program Implementation. The City’s performance under the HAP is evaluated within the context of low-
and moderate-income housing resources, good faith efforts, and the Federal Administration’s outlook on
housing. During the past six to seven years, low- and moderate-income housing has been de-emphasized
by the Federal government, and housing resources, subsidies, and bonding have been greatly reduced.
Thus, only reasonably available resources to address housing needs are accessible to the City. The City of
Paramount assists with the provision of supplying rental units that are affordable to low-income
households. The County will be administering the Section 8 Rental Assistance Payments Program with
funding provided by HUD. This program provides rental assistance to owners of private market rate units
on behalf of very low-income households, including elderly and disabled persons. Rental assistance is
available in the form of certificates and housing vouchers to eligible families and individuals. The level of
funding provides rental assistance to approximately 203 households. This program’s implementation
strategy is summarized below:

     ●   2014-2021 Program Objectives: 180 vouchers provided.
     ●   Agency Responsible for Implementation: County of Los Angeles.
     ●   Implementation Schedule: The program is ongoing and will be continued.
In addition to the Section 8 program that is on-going, City staff will continue to pursue grant and loan
programs that are available from a variety of governmental and non-profit sources. Because of the
difficulties associated with providing market-rate housing for extremely low-income households, the
identification of those programs that target extremely low-income households for assistance will be
prioritized. The successful acquisition of new grants and loans will assist in the development of new
housing opportunities for extremely low-income households, other lower-income households, and first-
time home buyers. New grants will be publicized on the City’s website that describes housing services.
     ●   Source of Funding: General Fund.
     ●   2014-2021 Program Objectives: The City will initiate 2 grant applications on an annual basis.
     ●   Agency Responsible for Implementation: City of Paramount Community Development

The City shall apply for State and Federal monies for direct support of low-income housing construction
and rehabilitation. The Redevelopment Agency shall continue to assess potential funding sources, such as,
but not limited to, the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), and HOME. The City shall also
seek State and Federal funding specifically targeted for the development of housing affordable to
extremely low-income households, such as the Local Housing Trust Fund program and Proposition 1-C
funds. The City shall promote the benefits of this program to the development community by posting
information on its web page and creating a handout to be distributed with land development applications.
     ●   Source of Funding: General Fund will be utilized to prepare grant applications.
     ●   2014-2021 Program Objectives: The City will apply for grants as they become available.
     ●   Agency Responsible for Implementation: City of Paramount Community Development
         Department.

         sources of funding.
Extremely low-income (ELI) households are a subset of very low-income households who earn 30 percent
or less of the median income. More than 65 percent of ELI households face a severe cost burden related to
housing (more than 50 percent of income going toward housing costs), and they are the income group
most likely to experience a housing crisis when faced with rent increases, foreclosure, or other adverse
event. The City will conduct an in-depth analysis of ELI household housing needs and will develop a local

     ●   Implementation Schedule: Ongoing though continuation of the program will be dependent on
         sources of funding.
The City shall adopt a resolution waiving 100% of the application processing fees for developments in
which 5% of the units are affordable to extremely low-income households. To be eligible for the fee
waiver, the units shall be affordable by affordability covenant. The waiving or reduction of service
mitigation fees may also be considered when an alternative funding source is identified to pay these fees.
The City may use either redevelopment set-aside funds or the Housing Trust Fund to subsidize the service
and mitigation fees for housing affordable to extremely low-income households. The City shall promote
the benefits of this program to the development community by posting information on its web page and
creating a handout to be distributed with land development applications.
     ●   Source of Funding: General Fund for preparation of resolution.
     ●   2014-2021 Program Objectives: The City will adopt the resolution within 12 months of Housing
         Element adoption.

         Department.
     ●   Implementation Schedule: Promotional materials will be prepared and utilized within six
         months after adoption of the Housing Element.
3.5.6 DEVELOPER CONSULTATION PROGRAM
Program Description.       This program promotes consultation with developers to assist in expanding
housing opportunities in order to assist in the development of affordable housing. This early consultation
will also provide developers with information needed to assist them in applying for funding to develop
affordable and assisted housing. The City will continue to investigate the potential for land acquisition
and/or “write-downs” for future projects as a means to remove barriers to affordable housing.
Program Implementation. The City has continued the practice of meeting with prospective developers
prior to receipt of the formal development application. This program has saved time and money on the
part of the developer as well as staffing time in the review of development applications. Projects that
require special attention may be asked to pay the costs associated with the development’s review,
including any environmental studies that may be required. No additional funding and/or staffing will be
required or are anticipated with this program’s continued implementation. Under this Housing Element,

                     CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
the program will be continued over the entire planning period. This program’s implementation strategy is
summarized below:
    ●    Source of Funding: General Fund.
    ●    2014-2021 Program Objectives: This program is ongoing and will be continued and consultation
         will be based on the request for services.
    ●    Agency Responsible for Implementation: City of Paramount Community Development
         Department.
    ●    Implementation Schedule: The program is ongoing and will be continued.
3.5.7 DOWN PAYMENT AND CLOSING COST ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Program Description. This program provides a 4% down payment and closing cost assistance for those
who do not have the funds or for those who do have the funds but the ratio is too high. The down
payment and closing cost assistance releases the buyer’s funds to pay off loans, thus reducing the ratios
and improving purchasing power. There are no first time home buyer restrictions and the qualifying
person can not be making more than 120% of the State or County median family income, whichever is
greater. The assistance is available through the Independent Cities Lease Finance Authority/
Independent Cities Association qualified Fresh Rate Program lenders.
Program Implementation. This housing program presently exists and this program will be continued
over the entire planning period applicable to this Housing Element. The City will continue to provide at
the counter and kiosk brochures containing information about the program. The City will actively
promote these programs by providing informational items in Citywide newsletters and by providing
information on the City’s website. No additional funding and/or staffing will be required or are
anticipated with this program’s continued implementation. This program’s implementation strategy is
summarized below:
    ●    Source of Funding: Independent Cities Lease Finance Authority/ Independent Cities Association
         qualified Fresh Rate Program lenders.
    ●    2014-2021 Program Objectives: The City will continue to advertise this program through
         handout materials available at the public counter; through the City's web page; and through
         periodic advertisements in the City newsletter.
    ●    Agency Responsible for Implementation: City of Paramount Community Development
         Department.
    ●    Implementation Schedule: The program is ongoing and will be continued.            The brochure
         materials and handouts will be provided by the end of the second quarter of 2014. The program
         will also be described in the second quarter issue (2014) of the City’s newsletter. Finally, the
         program will be advertised on the City’s website. The website will be revised by the end of the
         second quarter of 2014.

3.5.8 EMERGENCY SHELTER REZONING PROGRAM/HUD EMERGENCY SHELTER
         GRANTS
Program Description. This program provides for the creation of an overlay zone within a specific area of
the City where an emergency shelter would be permitted by right. The base zone district, and the uses
permitted, would continue to apply. The overlay zone would expand the permitted uses to include an
emergency shelter. The geographic area where the overlay zone would be applicable is within an
industrial area of the City located to the north of Alondra Boulevard in the westernmost portion of
Paramount. This area is currently designated as Business Park in the City of Paramount General Plan and
is zoned as M-1 (Light Industrial). The City will amend its Zoning Ordinance to provide for an Emergency
Shelter Overlay Zone that would be applicable to this area. The Overlay Zone would permit emergency
shelters by right within the designated geographic area. A number of new, tilt-up concrete buildings are
located within this area, including a number of vacant buildings that could accommodate such emergency
shelter uses. This area was selected because of its proximity to employment-related uses and public
transit (a transit stop is located along Alondra Boulevard). In addition, schools are located in close
proximity to this area.
Paramount has also developed a comprehensive strategy to address homelessness.                     This strategy is
comprised of activities to address the following priorities: emergency and transitional housing; persons at
risk of becoming homeless; and persons in transition from homeless to permanent housing. As outlined
in the City of Paramount’s HUD Consolidated Plan, the City will continue to monitor the number of
homeless persons to ensure that this problem is not increasing. In addition, the City and the
redevelopment agency will cooperate in the development of opportunities for additional affordable
housing and home buyer opportunities.
Program Implementation. This program was a new program that was included in the 4th Housing Element Cycle.
The City was unable to implement this program during the 4th Cycle because of a significant reduction in the City’s
budget due to the loss of Redevelopment funds. Three staff positions in the Community Development Department
were eliminated. This program remains a priority in that the Specific Plan Amendment is critical in enabling the City
to accommodate its unmet RHNA. The Zoning Ordinance Revision is slated for adoption in mid-year 2014.
The City will continue to inform those special service agencies and organizations of the grants through
mailing and brochures. The following activities will be undertaken to address the priority needs of
homeless individuals and families:
     ●   The City will continue to monitor the number of homeless to ensure the problem is not
         increasing;
     ●   The City will develop opportunities for additional affordable housing and home buyer
         opportunities; and,
     ●   The City will continue efforts in promoting the homeless program by noticing the special service
         agencies and providers of available funds and appropriate sites.
The implementation strategy is summarized below:

         Revision is slated for adoption by mid-year 2014.
3.5.9 TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM
Program Description. Transitional housing is a type of supportive housing used to facilitate the
movement of homeless individuals and families to permanent housing. A person may live in a
transitional housing unit for up to two years while receiving supportive services that enable independent
living.
Program Implementation.          The City intends to comply with State law regarding the provision of
transitional housing. The definition of transitional housing will be changed in order to consider
transitional housing as a residential use in all zones that allow residential uses subject to those restrictions
that are applicable to the other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. The following will be
applicable to transitional housing:
     ●   Transitional housing will be subject to the same permitting procedures as that required for other
         permitted uses for the zone without undue special regulatory requirements.
     ●   Parking requirements, fire regulations, and design standards for transitional housing will be the
         same as that required for the corresponding residential zone districts. As a result, the applicable
         development standards will not impede the efficient use of the site as transitional housing.
The implementation strategy is summarized below:
     ●   Source of Funding: General Fund for the Zoning Ordinance Revision.
     ●   2014-2021 Program Objectives: The City will implement this program as required by State law.
     ●   Agency Responsible for Implementation: City of Paramount Community Development
         Department.
     ●   Implementation Schedule: Rezoning is currently being implemented. The Zoning Ordinance
         Revision is slated for adoption by mid-year 2014.
3.5.10 SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROGRAM
Program Description. Supportive housing refers to permanent rental housing that also provides a wide
array of support services that are designed to enable residents to maintain stable housing and lead more
productive lives. Supportive housing is most often targeted to persons that have greater risk factors such
as mental illness or drug dependence that could ultimately lead to prolonged homelessness. The types of

                       CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
support services that may be provided include medical and mental health care, vocational and
employment training, substance abuse counseling, childcare, and independent living skills training. Most
supportive housing is constructed and managed by non-profit housing developers in partnership with
non-profit service providers. However, the State requires that local governments take a proactive role in
facilitating the review and approval process.
Program Implementation. The State requires this Housing Element to identify zones that allow
supportive housing development and demonstrate that zoning, local regulations (standards and the
permit process) encourage and facilitate supportive housing. Supportive housing may include a single-
family detached unit or an apartment building. The City of Paramount will permit supportive housing
within all the zones that permit residential uses subject to the same requirements of residential uses of the
same type in the same zone. The City will comply with all State requirements governing supportive
housing. The implementation strategy is summarized below:
     ●    Source of Funding: General Fund for the Zoning Ordinance Revision.
     ●    2014-2021 Program Objectives: The City will implement this program as required by State law.
     ●    Agency Responsible for Implementation: City of Paramount Community Development
          Department.
     ●    Implementation Schedule: Rezoning is currently being implemented. The Zoning Ordinance
          Revision is slated for adoption by mid year 2014.
3.5.11 SINGLE ROOM OCCUPANCY HOUSING PROGRAM
Program Description. A single room occupancy (SRO) development may serve as an important source of
affordable housing for lower-income individuals, seniors, and persons with disabilities. An SRO unit
usually is small ranging in size from 200 square feet to 350 square feet. Many of the older SROs have
been lost due to deterioration, hotel conversions, and demolition. As a means to finance this program, the
City will prioritize affordable housing funds towards the provision of housing for extremely low-income
households as part of the development of SRO housing. The purpose of this program is to establish
appropriate regulations in the City’s Zoning Ordinance that would permit SRO development in the City’s
R-M multiple-family zones as well as in those areas where mixed use development is contemplated.
Program Implementation. This program is new and will be initiated during this planning period. The
implementation elements are outlined below:
     ●    Source of Funding: General Fund (for the rezoning).
     ●    Agency Responsible for Implementation: Community Development Department.
     ●    2014-2021 Program Objectives: Comply with applicable State requirements.
     ●    Implementation Schedule: Rezoning is currently being implemented. The Zoning Ordinance
          Revision is slated for adoption by mid-year 2014.

3.5.12 INFILL SITES REDEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
Program Description. The City will encourage and facilitate development on the two infill sites identified
in Section 3.3 by providing assistance with site identification and entitlement processing, marketing
materials for residential opportunity sites, and technical assistance to interested developers including
technical assistance to acquire necessary funding, offering fee waivers and deferrals for affordable housing
projects.
Program Implementation. On an annual basis, the City will also organize special marketing events
geared towards the development community, and post the sites inventory on the City's webpage. The City
will monitor and evaluate development of underdeveloped parcels on a bi-annual basis and report on the
success of strategies to encourage residential development in its Annual Progress Reports required
pursuant to Government Code 65400. If identified strategies are not successful in generating
development interest, the City will identify additional sites, and/or revise or add additional incentives.
This program is new and will be initiated during this planning period. The implementation elements are
outlined below:
     ●   Source of Funding: General Fund.
     ●   Agency Responsible for Implementation:           City of Paramount Community Development
         Department.
     ●    2014-2021 Program Objectives: Comply with applicable State requirements.
     ●   Implementation Schedule: Rezoning is currently being implemented. The Zoning Ordinance
         Revision is slated for adoption by mid-year 2014.
3.5.13 MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
Program Description. The City will encourage housing development in those zone districts (C-3) where
mixed use development is permitted by allowing administrative processing of lot consolidation requests,
providing assistance with site identification and entitlement processing, offering fee waivers and deferrals
for affordable housing projects, modifying development standards such as set backs and parking, and
provide financial support where available for mixed use affordable projects.
Program Implementation. On an annual basis, the City will also organize special marketing events
geared towards the development community and posting the sites inventory on the City's webpage. This
program is new and will be initiated during this planning period. The implementation elements are
outlined below:
     ●   Source of Funding: General Fund.
     ●   Agency Responsible for Implementation: City of Paramount Community Development
         Department.

                      CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
3.5.14 LOT CONSOLIDATION PROGRAM
Program Description. The City will play an active role in facilitating lot consolidation, particularly as it
relates to parcels listed in Section 3.3 of the sites inventory. For example, the City will work with non-
profit developers and owners of small sites to identify and consolidate parcels to facilitate the
development of housing affordable to lower-income households.
Program Implementation. The lot consolidation procedures will be posted on the City website and
discussed with developers during the preliminary review team process. Lot consolidation requests will be
processed ministerialy. Incentives offered for lot consolidation could include allowing higher densities
once larger parcels are consolidated, flexibility in development standards, expedited processing and/or
reduced fees related to consolidation. This program is new and will be initiated during this planning
period. The implementation elements are outlined below:
    ●    Source of Funding: General Fund.
    ●    Agency Responsible for Implementation:            City of Paramount Community Development
         Department.
    ●    2014-2021 Program Objectives: Comply with applicable State requirements.
    ●    Implementation Schedule: This program is ongoing and will be continued. The effectiveness of
         this program will be reviewed on an annual basis.
3.5.15 RHNA OBJECTIVE/CONSTRAINTS MONITORING PROGRAM
Program Description. To ensure adequate sites are available throughout the planning period to meet the
City’s RHNA, the City will continue to annually update an inventory that details the amount, type, and
size of vacant and underutilized parcels to assist developers in identifying land suitable for residential
development and that also details the number of extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income
units constructed annually. If the inventory indicates a shortage of available sites, the City shall rezone
sufficient sites to accommodate the City’s RHNA. The City has identified residential capacity within the
mixed use zone to accommodate 1,034 units of the City’s RHNA. The City will annually monitor
development standards and on- and off-site improvement requirements to ensure that they do not pose
constraints to residential development. The City will take action to mitigate constraints as necessary.
Program Implementation. To ensure sufficient residential capacity is maintained within this zone to
accommodate the identified need, the City will develop and implement a formal ongoing (project-by-
project) evaluation procedure pursuant to Government Code Section 56863. Should an approval of
commercial development result in a reduction of capacity within the infill sites below the residential
capacity needed to accommodate the remaining need for lower-income households, the City will identify
and zone sufficient sites to accommodate the shortfall on land zones exclusively for residential multi-
family use allowing at least 30 units per acre. This program is new and will be initiated during this
planning period. The implementation elements are outlined below:

3.5.16 ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAM
Program Description. Under this program, the City will review the City’s Zoning code and subdivision
requirements, as well as other applicable codes, to promote energy conservation in housing rehabilitation
and in the construction of new housing. This program will supplement existing City efforts in the
enforcement of the State’s construction codes requiring energy efficiency in new construction.
The City of Paramount will adopt a “Green City” ordinance in conformance to State requirements in 2014.
The City’s website will be expanded to include a “Green City” section that will refer users to a wide range
of initiatives designed to improve the local environment. Key elements will include energy conservation
measures, recycling, water conservation, and the use of alternative transit. The programs will include
rebates for energy conserving refrigerators, water heaters, and other household appliances. The key
elements of this program include the following:
     ●   The City will encourage and support cost-effective energy technologies (passive solar space
         heating and cooling and water conservation) in the review of new residential development. The
         City shall permit the installation of photovoltaic/solar and solar water heating systems on new
         residential construction. The City will establish an information kiosk in the Civic Center near the
         planning counter that will include brochures and handouts promoting energy conservation from
         local utility providers. In addition, the City’s website will be updated to publicize the availability
         of the various rebate programs and tax incentives that will reduce the cost of installing energy-
         saving devices.
     ●   The City of Paramount will update the Zoning code and subdivision requirements and other
         applicable codes to promote energy conservation in housing rehabilitation and in the construction
         of new housing.
     ●   The City shall support ongoing programs from SCE and Sempra Energy that promote energy
         conservation. The programs sponsored by the utility providers include rebates for energy
         conserving refrigerators, water heaters, and other household appliances. The City will establish
         an information kiosk in the Civic Center near the planning counter that includes brochures and
         handouts promoting energy conservation from local utility providers.
     ●   The City will review the Zoning Ordinance to ensure that there are no requirements that are
         overly restrictive concerning the installation of solar panels. The City will then amend the Zoning
         Ordinance to ensure that solar panels are permitted in all Zone Districts. Finally, the City will

         solar panels.
The City shall promote water conservation (drought-tolerant landscaping, water conserving plumbing
fixtures, etc.) in the review of new development. The City adopted a water conservation ordinance in
conformance with State law. The City will also continue to provide areas for handouts and the posting of
information on the City’s website concerning the plant materials and techniques for xeriscape
landscaping.
     ●   The City website will be expanded to indicate ways residents may reduce water consumption.
         This website will be maintained throughout the planning period.
     ●   The local water purveyors publish a variety of brochures and information guides to help residents
         conserve water. The guide and brochures will continue to be distributed at City Hall.
     ●   Title 24 of the California Building Code requires phasing out older, less energy efficient toilets by
         replacing them with toilets that use only 1.6 gallons per flush. The City will continue to ensure
         that this requirement is being implemented.
Program Implementation. No additional funding and/or staffing will be required or are anticipated with
this program’s continued implementation. Under this housing element, the program will be continued
over the entire planning period. This program’s implementation strategy is summarized below:

3.5.21 MORTGAGE CREDIT CERTIFICATE (MCC) PROGRAM
Program Description. This program offers the first-time home buyer a Federal income tax credit by
reducing the amount of Federal taxes to be paid. It also helps a first-time home buyer qualify for a loan by
allowing a lender to reduce the housing expenses ratio by the amount of tax savings. Low- and moderate-
income households get a 20% credit on the annual interest paid on their mortgages. Upper income
households get a 10% credit. The remainder of the mortgage interest is taken as a deduction from income
in the usual manner.
Program Implementation. This housing program presently exists and this program will be continued
over the entire planning period applicable to this Housing element update. This program is an existing

                      CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
program and is being continued on into the current planning period. The Mortgage Credit Certificate
(MCC) Program allows qualified first-time homebuyers to take tax credits on their annual mortgage
interest payment as a dollar for dollar tax credit against Federal income tax. The Los Angeles County
Community Development Commission administers the MCC Program. The City will prepare a flyer and
advertise this program on its website. While the program does not provide down payment assistance, it
provides a home buyer an opportunity to qualify for a larger first mortgage by making a portion of the
mortgage interest payments eligible for a tax credit rather than a tax deduction. This program’s
implementation strategy is summarized below:
    ●    Source of Funding: Bond Revenue.
    ●    2014-2021 Program Objectives: 5 certificates per year.
    ●    Agency Responsible for Implementation: Community Development Department and Los Angeles
         County.
    ●    Implementation Schedule: The program is ongoing and will be continued. The City will prepare a
         flyer and advertise this program on its website within 12 months following adoption of the
         Housing Element.
3.5.22 SECOND UNIT ORDINANCE
Program Description. This Ordinance permits the construction of second units pursuant to the City’s
Zoning code as required in Section 65852.2 of the State of California Government Code. The City
adopted a Second Unit Ordinance in July, 1983. The ordinance allows second units subject to meeting
certain R-1 zone requirements, such as 5-foot setbacks and parking standards. Although demand for
second units in R-1 zones has been small, the existing ordinance does not preclude this development. In
addition, the City's Zoning code provides for the legalization of garage conversions in the R-2 and R-M
zones. The code states that any garage converted prior to July 1, 1986, is deemed legally non-conforming,
providing parking requirements can be met. This has resulted in additional livable space on parcels that
otherwise would not qualify for additional units.
Program Implementation. Over the past five years there has been a significant increase in the rental
housing stock within the City, and such housing is widely available. This program’s implementation
strategy is summarized below:
    ●    Source of Funding: General Fund.
    ●    2014-2021 Program Objectives: The City will revise its ordinance consistent with State law and
         advertise it through handout materials available at the public counter; through the City's web
         page; and through periodic advertisements in the City newsletter.
    ●    Agency Responsible for Implementation: City of Paramount Community Development
         Department.
    ●    Implementation Schedule: The City’s Zoning Ordinance has been adopted and will be
         implemented.

3.5.23 SINGLE-FAMILY MORTGAGE REVENUE BOND PROGRAM
Program Description. Southern California Home Financing Authority (SCHFA) is a joint power authority
between Los Angeles and Orange Counties. SCHFA issues tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds for low-
and moderate-income first time homebuyers. The funds for this program are available on a first-come,
first-served basis.
Program Implementation. This program has been effective since June 9, 1999, and has issued over one
billion dollars in mortgage revenue bonds and has helped thousands of individuals and families to become
homeowners. This program will be continued over the entire planning period applicable to this Housing
element update. No additional funding and/or staffing will be required or are anticipated with this
program’s continued implementation. The City will continue to provide the services to the City residence
and will advertise the availability of this program through brochures. This program’s implementation
strategy is summarized below:
     ●   Source of Funding: Bonds.
     ●   2014-2021 Program Objectives: 10 units.

3.5.24 ZONING CONFORMITY
Program Description.       The City will review the Zoning Ordinance to ensure that the development
standards are consistent with those identified in the Land Use Element. The City will initiate appropriate
changes to the Zoning Map to ensure conformity between the Land Use Element and Zoning Map. The
City’s zoning and land use designations that are applicable to the Clearwater East Specific Plan will be
amended to permit densities ranging from 20 units up to 30 units per acre to facilitate more affordable
housing. The Multiple-Family Residential (R-M) designation will permit 970 units within the two infill
sites.
Program Implementation. This housing program presently exists. No additional funding and/or staffing
will be required or are anticipated with this program’s continued implementation. Under this Housing
Element, the program will be continued over the entire planning period. This program’s implementation
strategy is summarized below:
     ●   Source of Funding: General Fund.
     ●   2014-2021 Program Objectives: The City will revise its ordinance consistent with State law and

3.5.25 UNDERUTILIZED PARCEL INFORMATION
Program Description. To encourage and facilitate the development of housing affordable to lower income
households on sites zoned R-M (Multiple-family Residential) the City will continue to work with
residential developers that are constructing affordable units to identify alternatives that may represent a
cost savings on a case-by-case basis. For example, multiple-family housing located next to a park may not
be required to provide the amount of open space typically required of such developments.
Another example would be a relaxation in parking requirements for mixed-use developments that could
benefit from a shared parking arrangement. The City will also promote the availability of both the
underutilized sites and fiscal and regulatory incentives to the development community through a
brochure regarding these items, during pre-application meetings, at the public planning counter, and over
the telephone. The City will monitor the supply of underutilized sites and evaluate whether the incentives
described above are providing the necessary catalyst to ensure that development is occurring consistent
with the buildout projections described in the General Plan.
Program Implementation. This program is currently operating. This program’s implementation strategy
is summarized below:
     ●   Source of Funding: General Fund.
     ●   2014-2021 Program Objectives: Not Applicable.
     ●   Agency Responsible for Implementation: City of Paramount Community Development

     ●   Implementation Schedule: The program is ongoing and will be continued.
3.5.26 REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROGRAM
Program Description. This program is a new program that will be implemented during the current
planning period. As indicated in Section 2, there are a large number of households in the City that include
at least one member that has a disability. Not all of the disability categories require physical alterations to
the housing unit to better accommodate the disabled resident. However, many residents will benefit from
specific improvements that would better accommodate a disabled person.
Program Implementation.        Under this program, the City will adopt a reasonable accommodation
ordinance to provide exception in zoning and land-use regulations for housing for persons with
disabilities. Currently, the City’s Zoning Ordinance contains no such provisions. The procedures related
to the program’s implementation will be ministerial in nature with minimal or no processing fee.
Improvements may be approved by the Community Development Director as long as a number of findings
may be made. First, the request for reasonable accommodation must be used by an individual with a
disability protected under fair housing laws. Second, the requested accommodation is necessary to make
housing available to an individual with a disability protected under fair housing laws. Third, the

                     CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
requested accommodation would not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the City.
Finally, the requested accommodation would not require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the
City's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance.
    ●    Source of Funding: General Fund.
    ●    2014-2021 Program Objectives: Facilitate the development, maintenance and improvement of
         housing for persons with disabilities; reduce processing time for reasonable accommodation
         requests by 50 percent.
    ●    Agency Responsible for Implementation:          City of Paramount Community Development
         Department.
    ●    Implementation Schedule: The Zoning Ordinance revision will be completed by the second
         quarter of 2014.
3.5.27 CLEARWATER EAST SPECIFIC PLAN AMENDMENT PROGRAM
Program Description. To accommodate the 4th Cycle regional housing need of 404 units affordable to
lower income households per AB 1233, and the 5th Cycle regional need of 42 units affordable to lower-
income households, the City will expand the permitted uses allowed on infill sites #1 and #2 (Table 28) in
the Clearwater East Specific Plan. This program will be implemented to accommodate 404 units
affordable to lower income households within 1 year of 5th Cycle Housing Element Planning Period and to
accommodate an additional 42 units affordable to lower income Households within 3 years of 5th Cycle
Adoption.
Program Implementation. The zoning and land use designations that are applicable to the Clearwater
East Specific Plan will be amended to permit densities ranging from a minimum of 20 units per acre up to
30 units per acre to facilitate the development of affordable housing. The zoning will set a minimum
allowable density of 20 units per acre for the anticipated capacity of 970 units (assuming a minimum
capacity of 22 units per acre). The rezoned sites will permit owner-occupied and rental multifamily
residential uses by-right (without a conditional use permit, planned unit development permit or other
discretionary action) pursuant to Government Code Section 65583.2 (h) and (i). In addition, at least 50
percent of the remaining 404 units will be accommodated on sites zoned for exclusively residential uses.
    ●    Source of Funding: General Fund for the Specific Plan Amendment.
    ●    2014-2021 Program Objectives: Create an opportunity for at least 446 units for lower income
         households.

3.5.28 REMOVAL OF GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS PROGRAM
Program Description. This program is a new program that was initiated during the current planning
period and involves a review and update of the City’s Zoning Ordinance. This update is designed to
eliminate duplication and redundancy and to make the Zoning Ordinance more user-friendly. In
addition, the Zoning Ordinance will eliminate the definition of “family” as part of the current revision.
The review will also include development standards related to building height, setbacks, and density
bonus requirements for qualified affordable housing.
Program Implementation. The zoning requirements will be revised to ensure that it conforms to the
density bonus requirements outlined in Government Code Section 65915. This section requires the City to
undertake the following:
    ●    The City must adopt an ordinance to implement the requirements of Section 65915.
    ●    The City must adopt a procedure to waive or modify development standards which preclude or
         interfere with the effect of the bonus.
    ●    The City must adopt a procedure by which the incentive or concession is granted, including
         legislative body review.
    ●    In no case may a local agency apply any development standard which will have the effect of
         precluding the construction of a qualifying development, unless it has specific, adverse impacts,
         upon health, safety or the physical environment for which there is no feasible method to
         satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.
    ●    The granting of concessions or incentives shall not, by themselves, necessitate a general plan
         amendment, LCP amendment, zoning change or other discretionary approval.
    ●    Upon request of a developer who has met the minimum standard, maximum parking standards
         can be capped as follows: 0-1 bedroom = one on-site; 2-3 bedrooms = two on-site; 4 and more
         bedrooms = two and one-half parking spaces; and parking can be tandem or uncovered, but not
         on-street.
Prospective new developers within the infill sites will be made aware of the density bonus provisions and
possible concessions that may be granted.
    ●    Source of Funding: General Fund for the Zone Ordinance Revision.
    ●    2014-2021 Program Objectives: mitigate constraints to height and parking.

3.5.29 AT-RISK UNIT PRESERVATION PROGRAM
Program Description. In order to meet the housing needs of persons of all economic groups, the City
must guard against the loss of housing units that are available to lower-income households. The Century
Place Apartments, located at 13801 Paramount Boulevard, consist 0f a total of 306 units of which 62 units
are reserved for low income units. The development contract expired in 2005 and was not renewed. The
City’s objective is to retain these at risk units.. The Community Development Department will implement
the following programs on an ongoing basis to conserve its affordable housing stock.
    ●    As indicated previously, the Century Place Apartments, located at 13801 Paramount Boulevard,
         consists 0f 306 units of which 62 units are low income units. The development contract expired
         in 2005 and was not renewed. If the current nonprofit organization managing the 62 units at risk
         is no longer able to maintain the project, transferring ownership of the affordable units to another
         nonprofit housing organization is a viable way to preserve affordable housing for the long-term.
         This may be difficult since the 62 units are included in a larger market-rate multiple-family
         apartment. The City will continue to monitor these apartments on an annual basis.
    ●    The City will work with potential purchasers in addition to establishing contact with public and
         non-profit agencies interested in purchasing and/or managing units at-risk to inform them of the
         status of such projects. The City will also actively pursue affordable housing opportunities and
         maintain a list of interested and qualified affordable housing developers and this list will be
         updated annually.
    ●    The City will work with tenants of at-risk units and provide them with education regarding tenant
         rights and conversion procedures. The City will also provide tenants in at-risk projects
         information regarding Section 8 rent subsidies and other affordable housing opportunities in the
         City.
    ●    The City will assist tenants of the existing rent restricted units to obtain priority status on the
         Section 8 waiting list. HUD has set aside special Section 8 vouchers for existing tenants in
         Section 8 projects that are opting out of low-income use. Upon conversion, the units will stay
         affordable to the existing tenants as long as they stay. Once a unit is vacated and new tenants
         move in, the unit will convert to market-rate housing.
Objectives: The City will annually identify and meet and pursue funding with non-profit organizations as
potential purchasers/managers of at-risk housing units. As part of coordination with non-profit partners,
the City will annually explore funding sources available to purchase affordability covenants on at-risk
projects, transfer ownership of at-risk projects to public or non-profit agencies, purchase existing
buildings to replace at-risk units, or construct replacement units. The City will provide tenant education
within 30 days of a notice and assist tenants to obtain special Section 8 vouchers reserved for tenants of
converted properties.
    ●    Source of Funding: General Fund annual monitoring and exploring potential funding sources.
    ●    2014-2021 Program Objectives: Review grants on an annual basis.

3.5.30 OTHER PROGRAMS TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING
The City is currently operating a program to purchase residential properties that have posed public safety
and property maintenance problems in neighborhoods throughout the City. Through this program,
properties are identified that are significant problems in a neighborhood, and the property owner is
approached to determine interest in selling the property to the City. If a property owner is willing, the
City will then purchase the site. In most cases, the property will contain a blighted home which will be
demolished. A contractor is hired to construct a new home, and when the home is complete, it is sold to a
resident of low or moderate income at an affordable price. Table 28 indicates the Housing Element
policies arranged according to the five main “issue” categories. The implementing housing programs and
ordinances related to the individual policies are then identified in the second column.

As indicated in Section 3.2 of this Housing Element, the City’s current (5th Cycle) 2014-2021 Regional
Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) is 103 housing units. In addition, there is an unmet need of 961 units
from the 2008-2014 (4th Cycle) planning period. The total combined unmet need for the 4th Cycle and 5th
Cycle is 1,064 units. In other words, the RHNA calls for these 1,064 additional units to be provided
during the 2014-2021 planning period. Of the 1,064 housing units needed to accommodate future need,
274 units should be allocated to extremely low and very low-income households, 167 units should be
provided for low-income households, 182 units should be provided for moderate-income households, and
441 units should be provided for households with above moderate-incomes. Table 30 summarizes the
quantified housing objectives for both the 4th and 5th Housing Element Cycles.

                       CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
3.6 PAST PERFORMANCE OF HOUSING ELEMENT POLICIES AND
        PROGRAMS
This Housing Element was prepared, reviewed, and adopted according to Section 65588 of the State
Housing law. This section prescribes for the timely review and update of all housing elements and
requires that the City evaluate all of the following:
     ●   The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to the
         attainment of the State housing goal;
     ●   The effectiveness of the housing element in attainment of the community's housing goals and
         objectives; and,
     ●   The progress of the City in the implementation of the housing element.
Section 65581 of the Government Code includes a description of the need for periodic review of the
housing element. Generally, cities have an important role to play in achieving the State housing goals and
it is the locality, in each case, that can best determine how it will direct its efforts. It is this process of
review and evaluation that permits local officials to evaluate trends in the community. Local officials,
through this process, are able to initiate new programs that will further housing goals. This Housing
Element update incorporates the State requirements with the local conditions, and is based upon the 1984
revision.
3.6.1 GOALS INCLUDED IN THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
The previous Housing Element contained a set of goals and policies and their overall stated intent was “to
promote an optimum state of housing in the City of Paramount.” Towards this end, the following goals
were included as a means “to provide guidance for the City's response to housing needs and the
requirements of the planning process.”
     ●   Goal 1. Develop safe and attractive residential environments free of adverse land use
         incompatibilities.
     ●   Goal 2. Provide the City's residents with access to local and regional employment opportunities,
         community facilities, and proper services.
     ●   Goal 3. Promote the maintenance and enhancement of the existing viable housing stock and
         neighborhoods within the City.
     ●   Goal 4. Reduce the incidence of substandard housing and seriously overcrowded living
         conditions.
     ●   Goal 5. Provide suitable sites for housing development that accommodate a range of housing by
         type, size, location, price, and tenure.
     ●   Goal 6. Continue to provide housing opportunities for the various economic segments and special
         needs households of the City, including senior citizens and handicapped households.
     ●   Goal 7. Continue to provide affordable housing opportunities for both owner and renter
         households.

                     CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
    ●    Goal 8. Continue to promote equal housing opportunity for all persons regardless of age, race,
         sex, marital status, ethnic background, sexual orientation, familial status, disability, source of
         income, and other factors.
3.6.2 POLICIES INCLUDED IN THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
In addition to the aforementioned goals, the previous Housing Element contained a number of “policies”
arranged according to the following three key issue areas:
    ●    The conservation and improvement of the City’s existing housing stock;
    ●    The removal of those governmental constraints identified in the Housing Element; and,
    ●    The promotion of housing opportunities.
According to the previous Housing Element, the following policies would be effective in helping to
conserve and improve the existing housing stock in the City:
    ●    Policy. Continue to enforce the adopted codes which set forth the City's minimum acceptable
         standards for the occupancy of existing housing.
    ●    Policy. Encourage the development of residential uses in strategic proximity to employment
         centers and transportation routes.
    ●    Policy. Implement the following criteria for evaluation of sites for affordable housing: adequate
         public services and facilities; adjacent land uses that are compatible with residential
         development; and convenient access to public transportation and freeways, employment centers,
         recreational facilities (passive and active), schools, and neighborhood commercial areas.
According to the previous Housing Element, the following policies would be effective in the removal of
governmental constraints:
    ●    Policy. Continue to process applications for residential developments on a streamline basis.
    ●    Policy. Utilize "specific plans" as a means to expedite residential developments addressing the
         City's housing needs.
Finally, according to the previous Housing Element, the following policies would be effective in promoting
housing opportunities:
    ●    Policy. Promote housing within its jurisdiction that meets the special needs of the elderly,
         handicapped, and large families.
    ●    Policy. Promote housing practices within the City which reduce the effects of discrimination
         based on arbitrary factors such as race, color, religion, age, sex, family size, marital status, familial
         status, sexual orientation, disability, ancestry, or national origin.
Table 31 indicates those goals and policies that were included in the previous Housing Element and their
status with regard to the current Housing Element. This Housing Element has been simplified to include
only “policies.” The previous Housing Element’s goals and policies were very similar in that the stated

                            HOUSING OPPORTUNITY INFILL AREA
The primary infill housing strategy focuses on the identification of a specific area of the City that could be
developed in residential uses. Two available sites were identified as potential candidates that would
enable the City to accommodate its RHNA allocation. Both infill sites are presently occupied by surface
parking lots that are being used by the Paramount Swap Meet. All of the parcels are contiguous and
Paramount Boulevard extends along the area’s easterly side and Somerset Boulevard extends along the
area’s southerly side. Both of the Infill Sites are located within the Clearwater East Specific Plan which
permits residential development. The existing Zoning designation that is applicable to the majority of the
two Infill Sites is Light Industrial (M-1). One site is currently developed as a church, though this parcel
(Parcel 12) is currently zoned as Residential Multiple (RM). The following paragraphs (and Table 28)
indicate the potential development that may be realized with both infill sites being developed as
residential. The calculation of realistic capacity first began with a development density of 22 units per
acre. The analysis also considers a theoretical development density range of between 20 units per acre
and 30 units per acre. The 30 unit per acre density corresponds to the default density for high-density
residential development in urban Los Angeles County. The two infill sites are located next to Paramount
Boulevard which provides arterial access to both infill sites. In addition, sewer and water lines are located
within the streets that would serve the sites. The two infill sites are described further in the paragraphs
below.
INFILL SITE #1
Infill Site #1 consists of three parcels (Parcel 21, Parcel 24, and Parcel 26) located within the existing
Paramount Swap Meet grounds. Parcels 21 and 26 are currently paved over and used for surface parking
and are presently under single ownership and no buildings are located within Parcels 21 and 26. Parcel
24 is located to the north of the swap meet area just east of Bianchi Way and is occupied by a labor union
hall building and a surface parking lot. The three parcels have a net land area of 13.6 acres. The net land
area used to calculate the development density assumes that 15% of the total lot area will be devoted to
streets and common open space. There is a potential for 298 units assuming a development density of 22
units per acre. There is a potential for between 272 units and 408 units when considering a density range
of between 20 units per acre and 30 units per acre. Infill Site #1 is illustrated in Exhibit 7.
INFILL SITE #2
Infill Site #2 consists of four parcels (Parcel 12, Parcel 23, Parcel 25, and Parcel 44). Parcel 44 is also
located within the Paramount Swap Meet and is occupied by surface parking. Parcels 23 and 25 are also
largely developed in surface parking, though portions of the two parcels are occupied by older industrial
buildings. Finally, Parcel 12 is located just behind the Paramount Boulevard frontage. The building that
occupies Parcel 25 is older and currently vacant. A small portion of Parcel 23 (approximately 14,000
square feet in area) is occupied by a tilt-up concrete building that has frontage along the north side of
Somerset Boulevard. Parcel 12 consists of a parking area and turf area located to the rear of a church.
The four parcels have a total net land area of 29.6 acres. There is a potential for 672 units assuming a
development density of 22 units per acre. There is a potential for between 884 units and 1,326 units when
considering a density range of between 20 units per acre and 30 units per acre. Infill Site #2 is illustrated
in Exhibit 8.

                      CITY OF PARAMOUNT HOUSING ELEMENT – ADOPTED FEBRUARY 4, 2014
BUILD-OUT OF INFILL SITES #1 AND #2
As indicated previously, the unmet RHNA total for the City is 961 units. The development of both Infill
Sites at 22 units per acre would permit the construction of 970 units within the two infill areas which
exceed the RHNA’s unmet need. When assuming a density range of between 20 units per acre to 30 units
per acre, a total of 884 units to 1,326 units are possible. A breakdown of the development potential for
both Infill Sites is provided in Table 33. Overall, the two infill sites could support 970 units assuming a
development density of 22 units per acre (refer to Table 33). In addition, the potential future
development will easily accommodate the unmet RHNA need for the following income categories:
    ●    Extremely Low-income - 124 units.
    ●    Very Low-income - 124 units.
    ●    Low-income – 156 units.
    ●    Moderate Income – 168 units.
    ●    Above Moderate Income – 445 units.
The area subject to this reuse plan is uniquely suited to redevelopment in residential land uses. First, the
existing land uses largely consist of surface parking areas. In addition, schools are located in the
immediate area within easy walking distance of potential future residents. In addition, community retail
uses are located along Somerset Boulevard and Paramount Boulevard.
MARKET TRENDS
The likelihood of residential development occurring on the infill sites during the 5th Cycle Housing
Element Cycle is high. Since 2008, residential development was severely constrained due to the lack of
available credit that affected the entire nation and the severe recession in California. In the past 24
months, there has been resurgence in residential development due to the pent up demand for new
housing and historically low interest rates. Housing prices within the larger Southern California market
have experienced a rebound in the past six months. Finally, the market for apartments has been
especially strong given the increased demand for rental housing.
A major constraint facing housing developers in the metro Southern California market is the lack of
available land. Developers must often demolish existing improvements (commercial, industrial, and even
residential) to accommodate new larger-scale residential planned development. In addition, these sites
are often contaminated, requiring expensive and time-consuming remediation. Nevertheless, a number
of recent residential development requests have occurred in the San Gabriel Valley and in South-Central
Los Angeles County. The availability of Paramount’s infill sites will be in high demand due to the
relatively low development cost (very little demolition and cleanup) and its location in close proximity to
schools and other services.
