INTRODUCTION
          I     magine Brea. Imagine Brea as a town where people live,
                work, shop, and play within one community. Where people
                find homes to match diverse lifestyles, access needs, and
          income levels. Where businesses provide jobs for local residents
          and create a strong economic foundation for the community.
          Where parks and recreational facilities offer opportunities for a
          diverse population to exercise and interact. Where schools and
          teachers educate the youth and inspire the mind. Where the
          natural environment is protected for its inherent visual and wildlife
          resource values. This is how the community imagines the Brea of
          the future, and this General Plan will take Brea there.
          WHAT IS THE GENERAL PLAN?
          The Brea General Plan identifies the community’s vision for its
          collective future and establishes the fundamental framework to
          guide future decision-making about development, resource
          management, public safety, public services, and general
          community well-being. During creation of the General Plan, the
          community worked together to craft this vision and define it
          through text and illustrations. This General Plan reflects the
          planning desires and values of Brea residents, the business
          community, community educators, and elected and appointed
          officials.
          The Brea General Plan describes how Breans will work to retain
          the natural and aesthetic qualities that make their City unique, but
          at the same time, respond to the dynamics of regional growth and
          meeting changing community needs. The General Plan serves as a
          policy guide, balancing these interrelated factors to Brea’s
          community vision.
          BREA GENERAL PLAN
                         1-1

Importantly, this General Plan addresses not just lands within the
City’s corporate limits, but also unincorporated Orange County
properties surrounding Brea, within its so-called sphere of
influence. In this General Plan, the combined City area and
sphere of influence are termed the “planning area,” illustrated in
Figure I-1. While properties within the sphere of influence are
under the jurisdiction of Orange County agencies, these properties
bear a critical relationship to Brea’s planning activities and, from a
visual standpoint, form a significant backdrop to the community.
One day, these properties may become part of the City proper,
and planning for service extensions, integrated infrastructure, and
high design quality is timely and prudent.

                                              Carbon Canyon Regional
                                              Park, partially located
                                              within the corporate
                                              limits of Brea. In the
                                              background are the
                                              Chino Hills in

                                              Brea’s planning area.

HOW WE IMAGINE BREA
The Brea of the future builds upon the Brea of the past.
Throughout its history, the City has embraced changes that have
expanded economic development opportunities, created new
housing, improved the services and facilities available to residents,
and preserved resources integral to the health of the community.
As Brea moves through the first two decades of the twenty-first
century, the community will continue to experience change,
guided by the goals and policies contained in this General Plan.
Brea’s Beginnings – A Planning
Context
The Brea of today lies at the base of the Puente and Chino Hills,
geographic features that provide Breans with scenic views of
natural beauty. The hills contrast with and complement the urban
forms of the City. Whereas the SR-57 freeway and arterial
roadways link Brea to adjacent communities in Orange, Los
Angeles, San Bernardino, and Riverside counties, the hills tie Brea
to its past. Brea occupies a unique geographic location that offers
residents and businesses easy access to both the benefits of urban
living and the quiet solitude of open spaces (Figure I-2).

BREA GENERAL PLAN

The properties comprising current day Brea were once part of the
large land holdings of the San Gabriel Mission established in 1771
by the Franciscan Padres. Vast herds of Mexican cattle pastured
on all the land in and surrounding Brea during the Mission period
and the subsequent Rancho era. In 1863, thousands of acres of
Rancho lands, including Brea, were acquired by Abel Stearns, a
Los Angeles businessman who later leased much of his land to
sheep ranchers.
Sheep ranching and oil production represented the two
predominant business activities during the latter half of the 1800s.
Beneath the hills in Brea lie what was once one of the world’s
richest deposits of oil. The Puente Hills and Brea Canyon
supported substantial petroleum production. By 1895, the Puente
Hills Oil Company had approximately 30 oil wells in the Puente
Hills producing 700 barrels of oil a day. Union Oil Company was
also lured by the riches of Brea and began purchasing land in Brea
for oil production and leasing it out to other oil companies.
Wooden oil derricks and oil production machinery covered the
hills and canyons. Evidence of oil production and remaining steel
derricks can be seen today in the canyons. In Spanish, brea means
tar. Thus, the City’s name reflects its history as an oil community.
                                 Oil derricks can still be seen along the
                                 hillsides in Brea Canyon.
The first real village in Brea was called Olinda and was originally
sited where Carbon Canyon Regional Park lies today. Olinda,
literally surrounded by hundreds of oil wells, was the workplace
for many of the oil field workers. The village contained a church,
barbershop, livery stable, boarding house, dance hall, pump
house, Santa Fe Freight Depot, a school, and an oil storage tank.

                                              Chapter 1: Introduction
The official founding date for the town of Brea is January 19, 1911.
The City incorporated in 1917 with a population of 732. Many of
the buildings of the original town were situated along Pomona
Avenue (current day Brea Boulevard). As a booming oil town, the
City’s population began to grow rapidly. Development of new
housing, businesses, and civic buildings began to shape theBrea of
today. In 1918, the Pacific Electric Railway connected Brea to La
Habra, Whittier, and other Los Angeles communities.
With the oil boom, land in and around the City began converting
from sheep ranches to orange groves. The Bastanchury Ranch
Company in La Habra, Fullerton, and Brea was said to have the
largest citrus groves in the world, which included over 5,350 acres
of orange groves during the 1920s. Union Oil Company also
realized the potential of turning over underutilized properties to
citrus production.
In Brea and throughout Southern California, the post-World War II
years were a period of substantial growth. Citrus groves were
plowed under and the land subdivided for greater profits. Brea
also experienced an influx of manufacturing and industrial
businesses. In 1972, completion of the 57 Freeway made
agricultural lands and oil lands surrounding Brea even more
accessible. Five years later, the Brea Mall opened, providing
economic growth for the City while supplying retail opportunities
for Breans and the region.
During the latter decades of the twentieth century, as the flatter
lands below the base of the hills built out, development started to
occur along the lower hillslopes. Also, properties once in active oil
production transitioned to urban development as the economics of
the energy industry changed. The Olinda Ranch development at
Lambert Road and Valencia Avenue transformed 277 acres of oil
fields into a residential community with substantial open space
features.
As the community moves through the first twenty years of the
twenty-first century, continuing regional growth pressures will
again transform Brea. The question this General Plan answers is,
How do we imagine Brea in 2020?
Imagining Brea - Year 2020
How do we imagine the Brea of tomorrow? As part of the General
Plan program, the City undertook a substantial public outreach
program to understand current community values and
BREA GENERAL PLAN
                 1-7

to establish a new General Plan policy foundation based on those
values. The outreach effort arose from Brea’s long-standing
practice of involving its citizenry in important policy discussion, as
well as in reaction to public discussion in 2000 regarding the
future of Brea’s hillsides, a discussion that culminated in a much-
debated ballot measure. The outreach program was multi-faceted
and included the components described below.
        As part of the General Plan update program, a General
        Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC) was formed to serve as
        an advisory committee to the City Council and Planning
        Commission. The GPAC members represented various
        City commissions and committees, the school board,
        community groups, and community at large. The GPAC
        conducted eight meetings over a one-year period, during
        which time the group formulated a long-range vision for
        Brea and assisted in translating this vision into General Plan
        goals and policies, as well as suggestions for land use and
        development capacity within the hillsides and
        unincorporated areas. The public was invited to share
        their comment and concerns with the members of the
        GPAC during these meetings. Two special meetings were
        conducted to which owners of large vacant hillside
        properties were specifically invited to engage in dialogue
        about hillside development policy.
                                At the Imagine Brea workshop, residents
                                learned about different urban design and

        Full-scale public participation began at the Imagine Brea
        Workshop involving the GPAC, City staff, City policy
        makers, consultants, and the public. This interactive
        workshop – which was presented in the format of “virtual
        Brea”, with the meeting room laid out as a map of the City
        – allowed the public ask to questions about the General

    Plan program, collectively create a vision, and discuss the
    level of detail and framework of the General Plan. Major
    planning issues were identified and discussed.
    The second Community Workshop was a mobile
    workshop, whereby participants, maps in hand, drove to
    key sites in the City, reviewed land use options, and
    indicated a preference among the options presented. The
    information from this workshop helped the GPAC craft a
    preferred land use policy map.
    At the City’s annual Wellness Festival, attendees were
    invited to visit the General Plan booth and identify
    preferences for various types of development: suburban
    versus urban, clustered versus the more traditional lotting
    patterns in Brea. This mini-workshop helped refine
    different land use alternatives for consideration by the
    GPAC.
    Once foundation goals and policies had been drafted, the
    public participated in a third Community Workshop
    designed to gain affirmation of policy direction. The two
    key questions City staff asked the public to answer were,
    “Did we get it right?” and “What did we miss?”
    The City utilized its website to provide current information
    on the General Plan update program. Summaries of the
    public meetings and information on program progress were
    posted for review. The public was allowed to comment on
    various aspects of the program during its formation.
    A special General Plan newsletter summarizing the
    General Plan Chapters was prepared and distributed to
    residents, with a brief description of the proposed General
    Plan and its contents.
    Brea Line, the City’s community newsletter, was used to
    keep the public continually informed about the General
    Plan program. One issue focused on the General Plan.
    An internal City staff advisory committee, the General Plan
    Action Team, met at key points in the work program to
    review issues, goals and policies, and land use/circulation
    alternatives.

                                Prior to adoption of the General Plan, the Draft General
                                Plan and associated Environmental Impact Report were
                                circulated for public review and comment, and a final
                                community workshop was help before General Plan
                                Public Hearings were conducted before the Planning
                                Commission and City Council.
                       Through this extensive outreach process, the City learned how
                       residents and the business community imagine Brea.
                           Imagine Brea
Brea will be a community that provides great places to live, work, learn, and play,
       places that respect the community’s natural and cultural resources,
          provide open space and public spaces that appeal to all Breans,
               encourage economic vitality, and enhance the overall
                           quality of life for all residents.
                       In support of this vision statement, the community defined four
                       overarching goals that embody the community’s values and will
                       guide all decisions made pursuant to this General Plan.
                       Overarching General Plan Goals
                       Goal 1
                       Create an inclusive community that strives to meet the needs of
                       residents of all ages, income levels, occupations, family types, and
                       lifestyles.

                       Goal 3
                       Provide a range of mobility options that reduce dependence on
                       the automobile.
                       Goal 4
                       Maintain a sustainable economic base to provide a solid fiscal
                       foundation and diverse employment opportunities, and to ensure
                       the provision of quality community facilities and services.

                                              Chapter 1: Introduction
ORGANIZATION OF THE
GENERAL PLAN
Under California law, every city must adopt a comprehensive,
long-term General Plan to guide the physical development of the
city’s incorporated area, plus to plan for land outside of the
municipal boundaries that bear a relationship to a city’s planning
activities. As described above, such planning is not just a State
mandate; it simply makes good sense. State law further indicates
that the General Plan is the primary document a jurisdiction must
utilize to regulate land use. Consequently, the zoning ordinance,
specific plans, and individual public and private development
proposals must be consistent with General Plan goals, policies, and
standards.
To ensure that every city and county prepares General Plans that
are comprehensive and long-term in perspective, State statutes
establish requirements for the minimum contents of a General
Plan. (Interested readers are referred to Sections 65350 through
65590 of the Government Code.) By law, a General Plan must
contain the following seven “elements” and must be internally
consistent element to element:
         Land Use
         Circulation
         Housing
         Conservation
         Open Space
         Noise
         Safety
Jurisdictions may prepare and adopt any other General Plan
element or address any other subject of particular relevance or
interest to that community, with the understanding that these
optional elements must be implemented with the same vigor – and
are subject to the same legal scrutiny – as the mandatory elements.
The Brea General Plan has been constructed to reflect the issues
and policies and issues unique to this City.            Rather than
“elements”, the Plan is organized by themed chapters, each of
which examines and addresses several interrelated issues.
Separate sections within the chapters treat a specific issue. For
example, the Community Development Chapter contains sections
related to development: land use, circulation, economic

development, urban design, and infrastructure.            Figure I-3
illustrates this organization.
Figure I-3. Organization of the General Plan
Table I-1 indicates how each of these chapters corresponds to the
seven State-mandated elements.
The Community Development Chapter contains the following
sections: Land Use, Circulation, Infrastructure, Urban Design,
Economic Development, and Growth Management. This chapter
focuses on the built environment aspect of Brea and pulls together
issues and goals from the other chapters and lays out the
framework for balancing development with broader community
aims.
The Housing Chapter addresses issues, goals, and polices related
to ensuring an adequate supply of housing opportunities for
persons of all needs and income levels. Unlike the other elements,
State law sets forth very specific regulations regarding the content
and breadth of the Housing Element. Housing elements must be
updated every five years.
The Community Resources Chapter examines both the natural
and human-made environments, and establishes policies to protect
those resources that distinguish and define Brea. Issues addressed
are Parks and Open Space, Wildlife Habitat, Trails, Scenic

Resources, Air Quality, Water Conservation and Quality, and
Historic Resources.
The Community Services Chapter emphasizes the human
elements of the City: Recreation Programs, Human Services,
Cultural Arts, Education, and Libraries.
The Public Safety Chapter is concerned with identifying hazards
present in the community and ensuring that proper planning and
emergency response services can mitigate the hazards. Sections in
the chapter include: Emergency Services, Hazards Management,
Wildland Fires, Flood Concerns, Geologic and Seismic
Considerations, and Noise.
USING THE GENERAL PLAN
Because the General Plan is a community document intended for
use by all Breans, not just City staff and decision-makers, the Plan
has been written and organized for ease of use. Tables, diagrams,
and maps help readers understand planning concepts, and sidebar
notes define terms and direct users to chapters addressing related
topics or policies. At the end of each goals and policies section,
readers can follow links to the Implementation Guide contained in
Appendix A of the General Plan.
Key Terms Used
As stated above, goals and policies represent the Plan’s foundation.
A goal is an overall statement of community desires and consists of
a broad statement of purpose or direction. For each goal in this
General Plan, associated and more definitive policy statements
follow. A policy provides guidance to the City Council, Planning
Commission, other City commissions and boards, and City staff in
their review of development proposals and the actions taken.
The organization of the General Plan allows users to turn to the
section that interests them and quickly obtain a perspective of City
policies on the subject. However, General Plan users should
realize that the policies throughout all chapters are interrelated
and should be examined comprehensively. All of these policy
components must be considered together when making planning
decisions.

               Some readers may find that the goals and policies do not fully
               articulate how the City will achieve its aims. Further articulation
               can be found in the Implementation Guide (Appendix A). The
               Implementation Guide identifies specific actions the City will
               undertake toward putting each goal and policy into action.
               Adopted separately from the General Plan, the Implementation
               Guide is intended to be reviewed and updated annually to allow
               decision-makers to adjust to current community priorities and
               funding resources.
               Related Plans and Programs
               As referenced above, State law places the General Plan atop the
               hierarchy of land use planning regulations.           Several local
               ordinances and other City plans must conform with General Plan
               policy direction and work to implement the Plan. Also, regional
               governmental agencies, such as the Southern California Association
               of Governments and the South Coast Air Quality Management
               District, have been established in recognition of the fact that
               planning issues extend beyond the boundaries of individual cities.
               Efforts to address regional planning issues such as air quality,
               transportation, affordable housing, and habitat conservation have
               resulted in the adoption of regional plans. The policies Brea
               adopts are affected by these plans. The paragraphs below describe
               ordinances, plans, and programs important to be consulted in
               association with the General Plan in development and planning
               decisions.
   Brea Zoning The Zoning Ordinance, the primary tool used to implement the
               General Plan, regulates development type and intensity citywide.
    Ordinance
               Development regulations imposed include those setting limits on
               building height, requiring setbacks, and specifying the percentage
               of a site which must be landscaped. The Zoning Ordinance also
               outlines standards for residential planned unit development,
               affordable housing, adult entertainment businesses, hillside
               management, historic preservation, and off-site hazardous waste
               facilities, among many other land use issues.
          Brea Under California Law, cities can form redevelopment agencies and
               adopt redevelopment plans as mechanisms for facilitating
Redevelopment
               community renewal.        Since establishment of redevelopment
         Plans authority in 1972, the Brea Economic Development Department
               has been instrumental in restoring a vibrant downtown commercial
               district, providing numerous affordable housing opportunities, and
               achieving economic development successes. Brea’s City Council
               acts as the Redevelopment Agency.

   Specific Plans A Specific Plan is a detailed plan for the development of a
                  particular area. Falling under the broader umbrella of the General
          in Brea
                  Plan, Specific Plans are intended to provide more finite
                  specification of the types of uses to be permitted, development
                  standards (setbacks, heights, landscape, architecture, etc), and
                  circulation and infrastructure improvements. Specific Plans are
                  often used to ensure that multiple property owners and developers
                  adhere to a single common development plan, as well as to
                  provide flexibility in development standards beyond those
                  contained in the Zoning Ordinance. Brea has utilized Specific
                  Plans as a tool to achieve the coordinated development of
                  individual parcels within a broader context. Active Specific Plans
                  include:
                              Birch Hills
                              Brea Industrial

                              Tomlinson Park
       California The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted by
                  the State legislature in response to a public mandate for thorough

                  environmental analysis of projects impacting the environment.
     Quality Act  The provisions of the law and environmental review procedure are
         (CEQA)   described in the CEQA Law and Guidelines. CEQA is the
                  instrument for ensuring that environmental impacts of local
                  development projects are appropriately assessed and mitigated.
 SCAG Regional    The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
                  undertakes regional planning for the six-county SCAG region of Los
 Comprehensive    Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Imperial and Ventura
 Plan and Guide   counties. SCAG’s efforts focus on developing regional strategies to
                  minimize traffic congestion, protect environmental quality, and
                  provide adequate housing. The Regional Comprehensive Plan and
                  Guide sets forth broad goals intended to be implemented by

   Orange County   The Orange County General Plan guides land use decision-making
                   in unincorporated sections of the County. Brea’s sphere of
      General Plan
                   influence is so governed.                  The County and incorporated
                   communities within the County have agreed through a formal
                   Memorandum of Understanding to consult with each other
                   whenever development actions are proposed within a city’s
                   Sphere of Influence.

                           magine Brea, where the urban form creates a living, active,
                           and diverse environment that complements all lifestyles and
                           enhances neighborhoods without comprising the valued
                   resources that make Brea unique. Imagine a community where
                   the synergetic planning of land use, circulation, infrastructure,
                   urban design, and economic development works to manage
                   growth.
                   Imagine residential, commercial, industrial, and public uses
                   existing in harmony with the surrounding urban and natural
                   environments. Imagine reducing the impact of motor vehicle
                   traffic and creating additional opportunities for walking and biking.
                   Imagine architecturally enriching environments that highlight
                   Brea’s identity, and that exhibit innovative and modern design
                   features complementary to the City’s historic fabric. Imagine
                   visually attractive, high-amenity streetscapes, pedestrian paseos
                   and paths, and urban outdoor rooms. Imagine a local economy
                   that provides a sufficient base of revenue, employment options,
                   and ample commercial, financial, office, and industrial
                   opportunities. Imagine the management of development in a
                   manner that ensures adequate public services and limits impact on
                   the natural environment. Imagine new residents and businesses
                   coming to Brea at a pace that allows infrastructure, public services,
                   and school facilities to meet increased demand and maintain the
                   high standard of education Brea enjoys.

                                    City and within the sphere of influence, with the overarching aim
                                    to continue to improve the quality of life and reinforce the sense of
                                    place in Brea.
The Ash Street Cottages, a 96-unit single-family development adjacent to Downtown
Brea, were envisioned as a true downtown neighborhood. The project has met the
goal of a truly urban living experience with resident-serving amenities such as a
supermarket, restaurants, and entertainment all within walking distance. The units
have retained their cottage charm with many owners adding rose and other gardens
to their front yards. Ash Street Cottages has won several awards for innovative design
and quality of development.

LAND USE
Imagine flying over Brea in the year 2020.               Will Brea look
different than the City did at the turn of the century? Will land use
patterns have changed significantly? Will you note any new
features? This Land Use section identifies how the Brea of the
future will appear in terms of land use distribution, type, and
intensities, and provides guidance to City staff and decision-makers
for realizing the land use vision.
                                            The Evangelical Christian

                                            of the quality of architecture
                                            found in buildings
                                            throughout Brea.
The Land Use Policy Map on page 2-9 identifies the form of Brea
in two dimensions. The map indicates that traditional land use
patterns of residential neighborhoods and commercial and
industrial districts will continue, reflecting stable, long-established
areas. The map also shows that opportunities have been created
for drawing from the successes of Downtown Brea to create
vibrant mixed-use neighborhoods and districts with focal points
and pedestrian connections. The land uses permitted reflect the
community’s goals for its form and character, and the desire to
maintain a quality living environment for families, to preserve the
City’s existing, well-maintained neighborhoods, to strengthen
Brea’s distinctive image, to diversify and expand the local
economy, and to preserve the hillside and natural areas that make
Brea unique.

use, readers are encouraged to look as well to the Community
Resources Chapter and the sections addressing Parks and Open
Space and Wildlife Habitat.

Context
Brea lies at the base of the Puente and Chino Hills, which provide
a scenic contrast to the relatively flat lands upon which much of
the City has been developed. This contrast has influenced and
continues to shape the types, intensities, and locations of land uses
throughout the community. The City’s historical uses have also
shaped the urban form and street patterns seen in Brea today.
Brea’s incorporated city limits, as of 2002, encompassed
approximately 7,000 acres or 11 square miles. The community
displays a balanced, complementary mix of residential
neighborhoods of various housing types and densities, local and
large-scale regional commercial businesses and centers, modern
industrial uses in business park settings, schools, and public parks.
Of the 7,000 acres (Table CD-1), 26 percent are developed with
residences, 20 percent with businesses, 5 percent with schools and
major public facilities like the Civic and Cultural Center, and 14
percent with parks and other open spaces, with Chino Hills State
Park representing a major open space feature.

Residential neighborhoods — the pride of Brea — contain homes
and representative architectural styles from almost every period
dating to the early twentieth century. The historic core of the City
surrounding City Hall Park still holds the traditional grid street
pattern, while development from the 1960s through 1990s is
generally suburban in nature, with curving streets and cul-de-sacs.
During the 1990s, emerging development trends and the
foresightedness of City leaders allowed more traditional urban
forms – or “neo-traditional” development – to reappear as higher

density small lot subdivisions, townhomes, and apartments near
the City center, and as mixed use combined with commercial
businesses.    More compact development also occurred in the
foothills, with the clustered forms arranged largely to avoid
environmentally constrained properties.         Given the built-out
character of the flat lands, denser infill development and
sensitively designed residential projects on the City fringe will
characterize any new housing opportunities.
Commercial uses of early Brea centered near the Birch Street/Brea
Boulevard intersection, and while the original buildings no longer
remain, this area continues to represent a major commercial
center and community gathering place. Both the revitalized
Downtown Brea and Brea Mall, a major revenue generator for the
City, represent shining examples of careful, daring, and creative
planning by City leaders to facilitate development of varied
benefits to the community. The large commercial centers along
Imperial Highway, east and west of the SR-57 freeway,
complement the other commercial centers, and the industrial
businesses in west and central Brea provide jobs of varied skill
levels.
The hills north of Brea lie in unincorporated Orange and Los
Angeles counties, with the Orange County portion within the City’s
sphere of influence. As discussed in the Introduction chapter, the
properties in Orange County bear a direct relationship to land use
planning in the City. Visually, the hills frame and define Brea, and
the homes, roads, and other infrastructure interface directly with
these roughly 7,500 acres. Historically, oil production represented
the predominant use in the hillside areas, with the County’s
Olinda Alpha landfill occupying many acres as well. During the
1980s and 1990s, the gradual depletion of oil resources in the hills
set property owners to planning for alternative uses. Also,
environmental interests and State park planners recognized that
BREA GENERAL PLAN
               2-5

actions were required to stop increased loss of open space and
valuable habitat throughout the Puente and Chino Hills, and
managed to secure many acres as permanent, protected open
space use, such as Chino Hills State Park.
As Brea moves toward the year 2020, it faces the challenge of
retaining those features that define the community while
responding to growth pressures placed by forces beyond the City’s
control. California, and Southern California in particular, will
continue to experience an influx of people, both from other states
and foreign countries, as well as population growth from new
births. What level of growth is anticipated?
                                                            Townhomes create
                                                            opportunities for
                                                            home ownership in
                                                            well-planned
                                                            neighborhoods.
The State Department of Finance estimated Brea’s January 1, 2002
population at 36,8571 people. Population projections developed
by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
indicate that regional growth will cause the City’s population to
experience a 27% increase by the year 2020, to 46,900 Breans.
This represents an increase of nearly 10,000 residents over a 20-
year period.
The question is not whether Brea can shut the door to growth but
how Brea can open its door and welcome development that
complements the existing community, enhances the City’s
character, provides the infrastructure needed to support new uses,
and conforms to the City’s vision expressed through the General
Plan goals and policies.

THE LAND USE PLAN
The Land Use Policy Map displayed in Figure CD-2 illustrates the
distribution of land use throughout the Brea Planning Area to be
achieved over the long term. The map shows nineteen land use
categories that reflect long-established land use patterns and
intensities, and that respond to community desires for changes in
specific areas. This Land Use Plan section describes the land use
categories shown on the map and provides more directed policy
discussion for those areas of Brea identified as needing focused
attention and treatment.
Density and Intensity
People can easily recognize how a property is used. The use may
be residential or commercial or a park. To describe the level of
use, that is, how much development exists on a property (and
presumably, what the associated activity level is), land use planners
have developed measures called density and intensity. The term
density is used for residential uses and refers to the population and
development capacity of residential land. Density is described in
terms of dwelling units per acre of land (du/ac).
                                                Residential units at Olinda
                                                Heights (Ranch) have been
                                                built at a density of 12
                                                dwelling units per acre
                                                (Medium Density Residential).
                                                Different phases of the
                                                development are built at lower
                                                and higher densities ranging
                                                from 6 to 15 dwelling units per
                                                acre.
Development intensity refers to the extent of development on a
parcel of land or lot (that is, the total building square footage,
building height, the floor-area ratio, and/or the percent of lot
coverage). While intensity generally describes nonresidential
development levels, in a broader sense, intensity also can be used
BREA GENERAL PLAN
                2-7
to express overall levels of both residential and nonresidential
development types. For land uses in Brea, floor-area ratio and
building square footage are used as measures of nonresidential
development intensity. The floor-area ratio, or FAR, describes the
relationship between the total square footage of development on a
lot and the area of that lot. Figure CD-1 illustrates different FAR
calculations.
Figure CD-1: Examples of Floor Area Ratios (FAR)
The FAR controls the intensity of use on a lot. FAR is determined
by dividing the gross floor area of all buildings on a lot by the land
area of that lot. For example, a 20,000 square foot building on a
40,000 square foot lot yields a FAR of 0.50:1. A 0.50:1 FAR allows
a single-story building, which covers half the lot, or a two-story
building with reduced lot coverage.
Land Use Designations

General Plan goals and policies.           The following land use
designations correspond to the categories shown on the Land Use

Residential Five residential land use designations are established to reflect the
            diverse residential character of Brea. The preservation and
Categories
            enhancement of existing single-family residential areas, particularly
            older established neighborhoods adjacent to City Hall Park, is a
            key goal. New development must be compatible with and
            complement existing residential neighborhoods. Special standards
            address residential development in the hillsides areas. Densities
            are stated as the number of housing units per net acre of
            developable land, excluding areas containing geological, slope,
            and related environmental constraints.
               Hillside Residential
               Unit Density: Based on calculated property slope
               Population Density: approximately 3 persons/acre
            Hillside Residential areas generally are located in hillside areas.
            Properties designated Hillside Residential are moderately to
            severely constrained by unique or significant features such as
            ridgelines, earthquake faults, steep and/or unstable slopes, creeks,
            sensitive habitat, sensitive wildlife species, mapped landslides, soil
            conditions, accessibility issues, and wildland fire hazards. Such
            properties are subject to the City’s Hillside Management
            Ordinance.
            Permitted uses include detached single-family residences and
            ancillary uses, limited commercial recreational uses with
            discretionary review, places for religious worship (with
            discretionary review), public schools, group homes, and public and
            private hiking trails and related facilities. Clustering of units is
            preferred to achieve protection of sensitive resources and avoid
            environmentally challenged areas.
            Permitted density calculations are based on a three-step approach
            described beginning on page 2-19 of this chapter. The steps
            involve determining the maximum density allowed based on the
            average slope calculation for a property, identifying biological
            resources to be protected, and meeting performance standards
            crafted specifically for the hillsides.

Specific Plans
The land use designations establish basic guidelines for property
development:        permitted uses and maximum permitted
development densities. Further requirements are spelled out in
the City’s zoning ordinance, the primary tool used to implement
land use policy. Specific Plans represent a second tool; Specific
Plans provide a detailed plan for development within a particular
area that may or may not reflect standard zoning ordinance
requirements. Several Specific Plans have been approved, and
these plans dictate the types of uses permitted, applicable
development standards (setbacks, heights, landscape, architecture,
etc), and circulation and infrastructure improvements required.
Figure CD-2, the Land Use Policy Map, indicates the boundaries
of the following Specific Plans:
       Birch Hills
       Brea Industrial
       Brea Towne Plaza
       Carbon Canyon
       Olinda Heights (Ranch)
       Tomlinson Park
The City will continue to use these adopted plans to guide
development of properties within the various Specific Plan
boundaries. As a general practice, however, the City will
discourage further use of Specific Plans unless circumstances
indicate that a Specific Plan represents the best method of
achieving a cohesive land use plan for a property or related
properties.
Hillside Development Policy
The hillsides represent a resource long valued for the scenic, open
space, and biological resources they offer. The community has
long identified its desire to preserve the hillsides as undeveloped
open space. However, most properties are privately held, and the
City must allow property owners to obtain some economic value
from their lands, either by continuing to exploit the oil resources
buried deep within the earth below or by transitioning the
properties, where safe to do so, to some other economically viable
use.
To balance its preservation goals with the realities of land use law,
the City has crafted an approach to regulating the type, location,
density, and intensity of residential development permitted, that
works to protect sensitive lands. On a given property designated
BREA GENERAL PLAN
               2-19

                    Hillside Residential, the level of development that can take place is
                    based on hillside development policies and the City’s goals to
                    preserve riparian areas, creeks, streams, wetlands, and wildlife
                    habitat; slope; avoid oil production hazards (ongoing and
                    residual); avoid earthquake fault zones; minimize fire hazards;
                    require adequate levels of public services; and meet project-
                    related and cumulative infrastructure demands. At the same time,
                    incorporating growth management policies is also important given
                    the isolated nature of the hillside areas relative to infrastructure
                    and public services.
   Hillside Density Calculating density yield involves a three-step approach. The first
                    step involves establishing a maximum allowable residential
Calculation Process
                    density/yield on a given property based on average property slope.
                    The second step requires the developer to identify opportunities
                    and constraints to be considered in the drafting of a development
                    plan. Third, the developer must demonstrate compliance with
                    specified performance criteria.

                                   Chapter 2: Community Development
Step 1: Establish Allowed Density Based on Average Slope
The slope of a hillside is a major determining factor on how much
development on a hillside can take place. It determines the extent
of grading, cut-and-fill activity, hillside erosion, and the placement
and configuration of lots. An important concept to understand is
that the steeper the slope, the more difficult – and costly – it is to
build on that slope. The maximum allowable density based on the
following average property slope ranges:
                              Table CD-2
             Allowed Density Based on Average Slope
                                             Maximum Allowable
             Average Slope                         Density
        Less than 10%, inclusive                2.2 units/acre
               10.1 – 20%                       1.6 units/acre
               20.1 – 25%                         1 unit/acre
                25.1-30%                        1 unit/5 acres
            Greater than 30%                    1 unit/20 acres
The maximum allowed yield will be considered a maximum limit
and not an entitlement. Property owners may not be able to
achieve the maximum number of units allowed on a given piece of
land. Other factors, described below, must be considered in
determining the unit yield (the so-called carrying capacity of a
property).
Density transfers from one portion of a property to a more
developable area will be permitted. As an example (see Figure
CD-3), consider a 50-acre property with 30 acres having an
average slope of 10% (maximum 2.2 units/acre) and the remaining
20 acres with a 25% slope (maximum 1 unit/acre). To avoid
building on the steeper slopes, the developer may opt to transfer
the 20 units allowed on the 25% slope land to the other portion of
the property, essentially clustering units on less steep terrain.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
               2-21

                                 Figure CD-3: Example of Unit Transfer
       Developers may opt to
transfer units from very steep
  terrain to flatter portions of
      the same property, thus
 clustering residential units in
    a more developable area.
                                 As an alternative to the density transfer approach, a developer may
                                 exercise the option of identifying large contiguous areas of where
                                 the slope is 25% or less on a property. This area may be used as
                                 the basis for a recalculation of the average slope for that portion of
                                 the property (see Figure CD-4). Based on this recalculation, the
                                 appropriate maximum allowable density range may then be
                                 applied to that portion of the property (still subject to Steps 2 and
                                 3), with the remainder of the property thereby preserved from
                                 future development as a condition of this option. For example, a
                                 100-acre property with an average slope of 30% would be allowed
                                 a maximum of 1 unit per 20 acres under the slope density formula.
                                 If there were no other constraints on the property (Step 2) and all
                                 performance criteria could be met (Step 3), this would yield a
                                 maximum of 5 units for the 100-acre property. However, within
                                 this 100-acre property there could exist a contiguous 10-acre
                                 portion that has an average slope of 10%. The developer could
                                 opt to have the average slope recalculated on this piece of
                                 property, thereby yielding 2.2 units per acre, or 22 units for the
                                 10-acre piece, subject to further evaluation through Steps 2 and 3.
                                 The developer would then be required to preserve the remainder
                                 of the property from further development as a consideration for
                                 the average density recalculation.         The preservation of the
                                 remaining property could be achieved through a conservation
                                 easement, approved in form and content by the City Attorney, or
                                 other mechanism satisfactory to the City. The preserved property
                                 cannot be counted toward any open space requirements of the
                                 actual development itself.

    Developers may opt to
   recalculate the slope for
areas that are not as steep.
                             Step 2: Identify Opportunities and Constraints
                             Goals for hillside areas clearly identify the community’s desire to
                             protect important visual, biotic, and open space resources. In
                             addition, developing in areas that contain significant
                             environmental resources is often more costly and more time
                             consuming due to the need for higher level regulatory agency
                             permits. Thus, the second step in the land use determination
                             process involves identifying significant on-site resources that must
                             be protected. Resources to be considered include, but are not
                             limited to:
                                    Ridgelines (as identified in the City’s Hillside Development
                                     Ordinance)
                                    Blueline streams
                                    Riparian habitat areas
                                    Other unique/sensitive habitats (woodlands and chaparral)
                             In determining the area available for development on a given
                             property, the owner is encouraged to eliminate from consideration
                             those areas containing these significant resources.

Another area requiring special consideration is the Alquist-Priolo
Earthquake Fault Zone. State law limits the type of structures that
can be built within the vicinity of active earthquake fault zones.
Owners of properties affected by the designated fault zone will be
required to undertake special studies and avoid development
within constrained areas. No density transfers will be allowed
from such affected areas.
Step 3: Conformance with Performance Criteria
Developers will be required to meet performance criteria when
developing in the hillside areas. The following provide examples
of the criteria to be used.
    1. Development will be subject to the Hillside Management
        Ordinance.
    2. All development must be located within an “X”-minute
        response zone for emergency services.
    3. No road shall have a grade in excess of “Y”%.
Precise mechanisms for implementing this three-step approach
are detailed in the Hillside Management Ordinance.
The allowed density applicable to hillside property, which is the
subject of a development entitlement application, may be
increased to the extent necessary to avoid the unconstitutional
taking of the subject property. Any such increase shall be the
subject of a finding by the Planning Commission or City Council,
whichever is the final administrative body considering the
application.     The finding shall be supported by substantial
evidence introduced during the hearing on the issue conducted
by the Planning Commission and/or City Council.

                                           Chapter 2: Community Development
           The following goals and policies address issues first of a citywide
Goals and  relevance and then those pertaining to specific focus areas within
  Policies the planning area.
  Citywide Brea is a diverse community. To continue this diversity, new
           development must be compatible with the established urban
           fabric. Residential, commercial, industrial, parks, and open space
           are to provide a balance and mixture of uses, not only
           complementing the existing community, but accommodating
           future needs and desires of the community.
           Goal CD-1        Provide a balance of land uses to meet the
                            present and future needs of all residents.
           Policy CD-1.1    Create neighborhoods that effectively integrate
                            single-family and multi-family housing with
                            convenience and neighborhood shopping
                            centers, park and recreation areas, and other
                            uses appropriate for the neighborhoods.
           Policy CD-1.2    Maintain a land use structure that balances the
                            provision of jobs and housing with available
                            infrastructure and public and human services.
           Policy CD-1.3    Endeavor to create a mixture of employment
                            opportunities for all economic levels of citizens.
           Policy CD-1.4    Ensure that the City maintains a balance among
                            residential, commercial, and industrial land uses.
           Policy CD-1.5    Provide opportunities for development of
                            housing that responds to diverse community
                            needs in terms of density, size, location, design,
                            and cost.
           Policy CD-1.6    Accommodate a broad range of business uses
                            that provide employment at all income levels and
                            that make a positive contribution to the City’s tax
                            base.

               Policy CD-1.7      Create and maintain linked open spaces and
                                  pedestrian access that serve the entire
                                  community.
               Policy CD-1.8      Connect, where possible, all neighborhoods of
                                  the community and surrounding areas located

                                  neighborhoods and districts to conserve open
                                  space resources, minimize infrastructure costs,
                                  and reduce reliance on the automobile.
               Policy CD-1.10 Preserve open space wherever                   possible,
                                  especially in the hillside areas.
               Policy CD-1.11 Maintain a mixture of business and retail uses
                                  within the community.
               Policy CD-1.12 Preserve existing older but well-maintained
                                  neighborhoods.
               Policy CD-1.13 Address “mansionization” in the community.

        Focus Areas     Specific goals and policies have been developed for six distinct
                        areas (Figure CD-5) that need special planning attention:
                               Northwest Neighborhoods
                               Downtown Brea

Figure CD-5 Focus Areas
                        Northwest Neighborhoods
                        The northwest corner of Brea contains a mix of residential
                        neighborhoods, including several senior housing developments.
                        The edges of several northern neighborhoods abut undeveloped
                        open space in unincorporated Orange County. Most of the homes
                        were built between the 1950s and 1970s, with some newer tracts
                        built in the 1980s and 1990s. Given the age of the homes,
                        focused attention will be required to maintain the quality of the
                        neighborhoods.
                        A key opportunity exists to revitalize aging commercial strips with
                        either new neighborhood-serving commercial centers or mixed-
                        use developments that provide both needed housing and local
                        commercial shops and services.
                        Goal CD-2          Preserve and enhance the character            of
                                           neighborhoods in northwest Brea.
                        Policy CD-2.1      Ensure that the design of new residential
                                           developments is sensitive to the character of
                                           existing neighborhoods.

Policy CD-2.2    Ensure that new developments are integrated
                 with established neighborhoods through a
                 network of street and pedestrian connections.
Policy CD-2.3    Pursue circulation improvements that promote
                 safe vehicle speeds. Utilize creative methods to
                 reduce speeds, and improve circulation such as
                 timed traffic lights and traffic calming devices.
Policy CD-2.4    Preserve existing neighborhood characteristics,
                 including tree-lined streets, sidewalks, and
                 building orientation.
Policy CD-2.5    Improve existing small, commercial centers to
                 improve access, aesthetics, and business success.
Goal CD-3        Improve access to transportation, shopping,
                 and community services throughout existing
                 neighborhoods.
Policy CD-3.1    Promote greater mobility through pedestrian
                 improvements and improved transit access.
Policy CD-3.2    Increase the number and variety of services,
                 transportation access, and activity centers for
                 seniors.
Policy CD-3.4    Encourage local retail businesses to serve the

Downtown Brea
The success of Downtown can be attributed to its integration of
residential and commercial land uses. Brea residents and visitors
from surrounding communities enjoy the shopping, entertainment,
and dining available within a compact, pedestrian-friendly area.
Linking surrounding neighborhoods to Downtown Brea is vital to
the continued success of Downtown.

Historic Brea
Neighborhoods in southwest Brea contain a concentration of
homes dating to the early twentieth century. City Hall Park is a
unique and treasured community resource, containing Brea’s Old
City Hall, the Brea Plunge, and the Old American Legion Hall.
The South Walnut residential neighborhood surrounding City Hall
Park contains many structures 80 to 90 years old that have not
been properly repaired and are in danger of ruin. Many of these
structures exhibit craftsmanship characteristic of their era and
incorporate unique materials.
South Brea Boulevard serves as the primary arterial for the
neighborhoods to the east and west of it. While the street is
primarily oriented toward automobile uses, its current mix of
BREA GENERAL PLAN
              2-29

services and shops is relatively accessible to the pedestrian, and
the street functions as a community gathering place as neighbors
meet while running errands or at local restaurants. Many of the
commercial properties, however, are deteriorated and in need of
revitalization.    In addition, improvements to the pedestrian
environment would enhance this area that serves as the “public
living room” for the neighborhoods to the east and west of the
Boulevard. Preserving the unique community environment that
exists on this thoroughfare today, while providing for opportunities
to revitalize the commercial uses, create appropriate housing
opportunities, improve pedestrian accessibility, and avoid impacts
on surrounding neighborhoods, is a priority for this area.
Goal CD-5           Preserve Brea’s unique historic and cultural
                    resources and neighborhoods.
Policy CD-5.1       Ensure new development is compatible with the

Policy CD-5.2       Promote preservation of historic single-family
                    homes by ensuring that General Plan and zoning
                    designations reflect the single-family nature of
                    specific neighborhoods, and by providing City
                    resources or incentives that foster rehabilitation.
Policy CD-5.3       Provide landscaping and amenities                that

                    neighborhoods.
Policy CD-5.4       Ensure that development within and surrounding
                    City Hall Park respects and responds to this
                    important resource.
Policy CD-5.5       Create an easily identifiable historic district in
                    Brea that is closely linked with Downtown.
Policy CD-5.6       Establish design guidelines of standards for

                    Boulevard that respect and complement the
                    historic character of surrounding neighborhoods.
Policy CD-5.7       Establish a program that would enable historic
                    neighborhoods to be designated as either a
                    landmark district or historic overlay zone.

                                Chapter 2: Community Development
Goal CD-6        Provide for the revitalization of the South Brea
                 Boulevard Core.
Policy CD-6.1    Encourage redevelopment of South Brea
                 Boulevard      properties     through   economic
                 development.
Policy CD-6.2    Where housing is a component of a project
                 within properties in the Mixed Use III area, the
                 development of ownership housing opportunities
                 shall be encouraged.
Policy CD-6.3    Ensure that traffic generated by new
                 development along South Brea Boulevard,
                 particularly where that traffic generated by new
                 residential development, takes ingress/egress
                 from South Brea Boulevard and is not directed
                 into neighborhood streets.
Policy CD-6.4    Develop programs, such as traffic calming, that
                 discourage use of neighborhood streets for
                 regional cut-through traffic.
Policy CD-6.5    Encourage the inclusion of open spaces, linkage
                 parks, street trees, and enhanced pedestrian
                 amenities on South Brea Boulevard.
Carbon Canyon and Olinda Village
Carbon Canyon contains important biological habitat. Prior
community visioning programs have emphasized the community’s
ideas regarding resource preservation. Olinda Village is a distinct
residential neighborhood within Carbon Canyon. The rural
character of the area, together with the development constraints
imposed by topography, geologic conditions, and the configuration
of Carbon Canyon Road, a State highway, may limit land use
opportunities within Carbon Canyon.
Goal CD-7        Create an environment in Carbon Canyon that
                 balances the community’s long-term housing
                 needs with community open space, habitat
                 conservation, and public safety goals.
Policy CD-7.1    Base allowable development on the ability of
                 infrastructure, landforms, physical constraints,
                 and emergency response capabilities to support
                 new development.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
              2-31

Policy CD-7.2     Preserve key wildlife migration corridors and
                  habitat areas within Carbon Canyon.
Policy CD-7.3     Allow and encourage clustering of housing as a
                  means of protecting resources.
Policy CD-7.4     Require that development preserve prominent
                  landforms consistent with the City’s hillside
                  management ordinance.
Policy CD-7.5     Limit commercial uses in Olinda Village to those
                  that serve local neighborhood needs.
Policy CD-7.6     Preserve a rural atmosphere in Olinda Village.
Policy CD-7.7     Consider establishing a transfer of development
                  rights (TDR) ordinance that would apply to
                  Carbon Canyon as a means of preserving
                  sensitive hillside areas.
Policy CD-7.8     Consider alternatives to a specific plan for
                  regulating land use within the Carbon Canyon
                  area.
Hillsides and Unincorporated Brea
Breans value the hillsides. Landowners will continue to seek
entitlements for development, and the City will continue to
balance development interests with broader community
preservation goals.
Goal CD-8         Minimize the extent of urban development in
                  the hillsides, and mitigate any adverse
                  consequences associated with urbanization.
Policy CD-8.1     Aggressively pursue methods to preserve open
                  space and natural habitat, including but not
                  limited to:
                  1)     Negotiating with property owners during
                         the development process
                  2)     Regulating preservation of ridgelines and
                         hillsides
                  3)     Acquiring private lands using City funds,
                         State and Federal funds, grants, bonds, or
                         assessment districts

                 infrastructure, landform, physical constraints, and
                 emergency response capabilities to support new
                 development.
Policy CD-8.3    Require developers to employ sustainable
                 approaches to development and environmentally
                 sensitive design.
Policy CD-8.4    Ensure that Olinda Landfill operations allow for
                 eventual reclamation and reuse of the property
                 for open space purposes.
Policy CD-8.5    Support efforts of State and federal agencies and
                 private conservation organizations to acquire
                 properties for open space and conservation uses.
Policy CD-8.6    Ensure that any new development that does
                 occur is integrated effectively into the existing
                 City via convenient street and/or pedestrian
                 connections, as well as visual connections.
Policy CD-8.7    Work closely with the County of Orange and
                 emphasize the City’s need to participate in the
                 development review process of projects
                 proposed in surrounding unincorporated areas.
                 Work to ensure that such developments proceed
                 consistent with City standards.
Policy CD-8.8    Ensure that height and density levels are limited
                 for development in hillside areas or in areas of
                 steep topography in order to preserve life safety.
Southeast Brea
Southeast Brea includes the Unocal Research Center property and
other surrounding former oil-use-related and agricultural properties
that are expected to transition over time to other uses.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
              2-33

               Goal CD-9          Create a dynamic, mixed-use urban village that
                                  integrates a range of housing types (including
                                  senior         housing),        moderate-intensity
                                  commercial uses, educational and public uses,
                                  and parks.
               Policy CD-9.1      Ensure that new commercial uses complement
                                  rather than compete with businesses along
                                  Imperial Highway and in Downtown.
               Policy CD-9.2      Accommodate emerging housing trends, and
                                  encourage pedestrian linkage to surrounding
                                  neighborhoods and activity centers.
               Policy CD-9.3      Encourage the establishment of community
                                  recreation and park facilities in the area.
               Policy CD-9.4      Support efforts to establish quality, community
                                  institutions in the area.
               Policy CD-9.5      Provide quality, affordable housing that would
                                  accommodate young families, college students,
                                  and educators.
               Policy CD-9.6      Preserve open space within this area, and
                                  provide outdoor recreation facilities.
               Policy CD-9.7      Strongly encourage the master planning of any
                                  large contiguous land holdings in this area.
               Policy CD-9.8      Strongly encourage the prezoning and
                                  annexation of the unincorporated properties in
                                  this area into the City the Brea in order to avoid
                                  the creation of new County islands.

Implications of Land Use Policy
Over time, as properties recycle to new uses and vacant lands are
developed, the distribution of uses within the community will
change. Table CD-3 on the following page summarizes the
distribution of uses and shows that buildout of the planning area
pursuant to Land Use policy will allow many new residents to call
Brea “home.”

               CIRCULATION
               Moving people and goods between destinations within the urban
               environment efficiently and effectively allows a community to
               function well economically and socially. People should be able to
               circulate within their community from home to school, work, or
               shopping with ease and safety. Alternatives to the private car –
               transit, biking, walking, and carpooling – can offer choice and
               convenience. Goods must also be easily transported locally and
               regionally to retain a working economy.
               This Circulation section guides continued development of the
               circulation system to support planned growth. New development
               will increase use of local and regional roadways, and the plan and
               policies here identify strategies the City will pursue to maintain
               good service levels. Because local circulation is linked with the
               regional system, policies highlight Brea’s continued need to
               participate in regional programs to alleviate traffic congestion
               through capacity enhancements and trip reduction. Reduced
               dependency on the automobile works toward these goals and also
               improves environmental quality.
               Context
               When considering circulation, we think of both the physical
               infrastructure systems – the roadways, rails, and trails – as well as
               the method of getting around, by car or bike or bus or on foot. In
               Brea, the physical system includes the local street network and
               several routes of regional significance: State Route 57, Carbon
               Canyon and Lambert Roads, Brea Boulevard, and Imperial
               Highway. While these regional roads provide Breans with ready
               access to surrounding destinations, the roads also bring regional
               traffic into and through the City. Much of the traffic traveling on
               the freeway, Carbon Canyon Road, and Imperial Highway during
               peak periods simply passes through Brea to other employment
               centers.
     Regional  As part of a large metropolitan area and of necessity, Brea has
               integrated its local street system with existing and planned regional
Transportation
               and local systems. Transportation planning and management
     Planning  require cooperation and coordination among local cities and the
               Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA), as well as
               jurisdictions and agencies in adjacent Los Angeles County.
               Working together, agencies can address the physical infrastructure
               needed to support regional demands and to ensure that
               BREA GENERAL PLAN
                               2-39

               convenient alternative transportation modes allow            for  an
               integrated approach to addressing traffic problems.
               In Orange County, OCTA has adopted the County of Orange
               Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH) to define the intended
               future roadway system for the County. All cities, including Brea,
               must reflect the MPAH in their General Plans to receive Measure
               M transportation funds. OCTA also is responsible for administering
               the State-mandated Congestion Management Program, or CMP.
               The goals of the CMP are to reduce traffic congestion and to
               provide a mechanism for coordinating land use development and
               transportation improvement decisions.
               The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has
               authority over the State highway system, including mainline
               facilities and interchanges. Caltrans must be involved in and
               approve the planning and design of improvements for state
               highway facilities. State highway facilities in Brea include State
               Route 57 and associated interchanges, Imperial Highway, Carbon
               Canyon Road, Valencia Avenue, and Imperial Highway.
Transportation OCTA provides transit and paratransit service within the Brea
               planning area and throughout Orange County. The agency also
      Services coordinates commuter rail service in the County, including leading
               efforts to construct light rail routes consistent with adopted plans.
               To supplement this service for more localized needs, the City
               operates the Brea Shuttle Express, a curb-to-curb transportation
               shuttle.
Master Plan of The County’s Master Plan of Countywide Bikeways designates
               locations and classes of bike routes in unincorporated areas and
  Countywide
               through cities. The primary aim is to provide consistency between
     Bikeways  the countywide and local jurisdiction bikeway plans. The Brea
               bikeway plan in this chapter utilizes the countywide classification
               system and links to County routes.
               The Street System and Master Plan of
               Roadways
               Brea’s street system is defined by a hierarchical classification
               system, with roadway functional classifications differentiated by
               size, function, and capacity. The categories are:
               Freeway: Freeways are limited-access, high-speed travelways
               included in the State and federal highway systems. Their purpose
               is to carry regional through traffic (traffic passing through Brea

without stopping). Access is provided at interchanges. State Route
57 is the only local freeway connecting Brea to regional
destinations.
Major Arterial: Typically constructed within a right-of-way of 120
feet, with a curb-to-curb pavement width of 102 feet, this roadway
has a maximum capacity of 56,300 average daily trips and a peak-
hour capacity of 5,630 trips. Major Arterials carry a large volume
of regional traffic not handled by the freeway. They are typically
six-lane, divided roadways. The roadway geometrics and right-of-
way width may vary depending on localized conditions.
Primary Arterial: Typically constructed within a right-of-way of
100 feet, with a curb-to-curb pavement width of 84 feet, this
roadway has a maximum capacity of 37,500 average daily trips
and a peak-hour capacity of 3,750 trips. The roadway geometrics
and right-of-way width may vary depending on localized
conditions. A Primary Arterial’s function is similar to that of a
Major Arterial, with the principal difference being capacity.
Primary Arterials are typically four-lane divided roadways.
Modified Secondary Arterial: A Modified Secondary Arterial is a
two- to four-lane roadway constructed within a right-of-way of 100
feet, with a varying curb-to-curb pavement width, depending upon
the number of lanes provided. The street functions similar to a
Secondary Arterial. The right-of-way not improved with paved
lanes can be used for a bike path or lane, multi-use trail, and
extensive landscaping.
Secondary Arterial: Typically constructed within a right-of-way of
80 feet with a curb-to-curb pavement width of 64 feet, Secondary
Arterials serve as collectors that distribute traffic between local
streets and four- to six-lane divided arterials. The maximum
roadway capacity is 25,000 average daily trips and 2,500 peak-
hour trips.
Collector Roadway: A Collector roadway is a two- to four-lane
unrestricted access roadway with capacity ranging from 12,500
average daily trips for two-lane undivided to 25,000 average daily
trips for four-lane roads (with peak-hour capacities of 1,250 and
2,500, respectively.) By strict definition, a Collector facility is not
an arterial highway. It differs from a local street in its ability to
handle through traffic movements between arterials.
Local Roadway: A local roadway provides direct access to
abutting properties as their primary function. Local streets rarely
have more than two travel lanes, and speed limits are generally
kept low (25 miles per hour).

                 Smart Street: In addition to the arterial classification, the MPAH
                 recognizes Smart Streets as arterials with enhanced traffic-carrying
                 capacity. Such enhancements include:
                          Addition of through or turn lanes
                          Preferential traffic signal timing and synchronization
                          Removal of on street parking
                          Intersection grade separations
                          Grade separated turning movements
                          Access limitations
                          Access consolidations
                          Frontage roads
                          Pedestrian grade separations
                 Figures CD-6 and CD-7 show schematic cross sections of each
                 category of arterial and collector roadway.             These sections
                 represent desirable standards, but variation in right-of-way width
                 and specific road improvements will occur in certain cases due to
                 physical constraints and/or right-of-way limitations. In particular,
                 the median width of Major and Primary Arterials will vary
                 according to the area being served, right-of-way constraints, and
                 turn lane requirements. Any of the Arterial classifications may
                 deviate from the standards where physical constraints exist or
                 where preservation of community character dictates special
                 treatment.
                 Bikeways and sidewalks also affect the specific standards applied
                 to various facilities. Another design consideration is the need to
                 comply with Brea capacity requirements.                 The overriding
                 circulation goal is that all roadways carry the designed volumes of
                 traffic at the desired level of service.
Level of Service Evaluating the ability of the circulation system to serve Brea’s
                 residents and businesses requires establishing suitable performance
     Standards
                 criteria. Performance criteria have a policy component that
                 establishes a desired level of service and a technical component
                 that specifies how traffic forecast data can be used to measure the
                 achievement of the criteria.
                 For Brea, the volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio represents the criteria
                 used to measure level of service. A V/C ratio is calculated based
                 on average daily traffic volumes on a roadway and the daily
                 capacity value for that roadway. A level of service (LOS) scale is
                 used to evaluate roadway performance based on the V/C ratio.
                 The levels range from “A” to “F”, with LOS A representing free-
                 flow traffic and LOS F representing extreme congestion, with traffic

               Roadway            Within Brea, Imperial Highway has been identified as part of the
                                  highway system identified in the Orange County CMP. Per the
            Congestion
                                  CMP and Orange County Growth Management Plan, the LOS at
               Concerns           identified intersections must be maintained at LOS D or better for
                                  Brea to be eligible to receive earmarked State transportation funds.
                                  The CMP intersections in Brea are State College Boulevard at
                                  Imperial Highway, Valencia Avenue at Imperial Highway, and the
                                  SR-57 ramps at Imperial Highway.
                                  The most critical time of the day for traffic operations in Brea is
                                  during the morning and evening peak hours, typically lasting from
                                  6 to 8 A.M. in the morning and 4 to 6 P.M. in the evening. The
                                  freeway interchanges at Brea Boulevard, Lambert Road, and
                                  Imperial Highway are heavily congested during peak hours of the
                                  BREA GENERAL PLAN

               day.      Roads directly serving the local public schools also
               experience their highest levels of congestion during the morning
               and mid-afternoon school peak periods.
               During evening commute hours, Valencia Avenue and Lambert
               Road/Carbon Canyon Road (SR-142) experience LOS F conditions.
               Carbon Canyon Road is one of the few roads that connect Brea
               and Orange County to San Bernardino County to the east. Thus,
               commuters use the road as a regional link between housing in San
               Bernardino and Riverside counties and employment in Orange
               County. East of the Olinda Ranch neighborhood, Carbon Canyon
               Road remains a two-lane highway with severe traffic during both
               A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Topography and sensitive habitat within
               Carbon Canyon severely limit opportunities to widen the roadway
               to relieve congestion.
               Imperial Highway, also a major east-west roadway, carries
               extremely high traffic volumes during peak hours and also can
               experience congestion during off-peak periods.
Master Plan of To address areas where congestion historically has occurred and to
               accommodate long-term traffic needs, the City has developed a
   Roadways    Master Plan of Roadways, illustrated in Figure CD-7.
               The Plan meets Brea’s long-term circulation needs, reflects City
               policies regarding environmental resource protection, and largely
               implements County Master Plan of Arterial Highways. The City
               Master Roadway Plan provides for changes to the County MPAH
               as described below.            Figure CD-8 shows current MPAH
               classification for these segments, with the indication that the
               classifications will be changed following changes to the MPAH.
               The Master Plan of Roadways plans for the following changes:
                       Reclassify Puente Avenue and Whittier Boulevard as a
                        Collector Arterial. This modification accurately represents
                        the function of this roadway.
                       Reclassify Brea Canyon Road (north of Lambert Road) as
                        a Modified Secondary Arterial. The Modified Secondary
                        Arterial classification best reflects the function Brea Canyon
                        Boulevard serves during most travel hours. Only during
                        the evening commute does the roadway experience heavy
                        use, typically as an alternative to the crowded SR-57
                        freeway. The City will preserve right-of-way adequate for
                        a Primary Arterial, but the Secondary designation indicates
                        the anticipated roadway function.

                      Reclassify South Brea Boulevard (south of Imperial
                       Highway) as Primary Arterial.            This modification
                       preserves right-of-way consistent with a Major Arterial
                       standard but indicates the City’s intention to maintain no
                       more than two travel lanes in each direction. The land use
                       plan provides for South Brea Boulevard to be a mixed-use,
                       pedestrian-friendly district. The wide right-of-way will
                       provide space for on-street parking, pedestrian
                       enhancements, ample landscaping, and street-oriented
                       development.
                      Eliminate Tonner/Valencia Avenue (north of Lambert
                       Road) as Proposed Primary Arterial. Land use policy
                       north of Lambert Road does not support the MPAH
                       alignment, nor do planned densities require a roadway of
                       this size.

               Regional Circulation System
               Coordination with regional and State transportation planning
               efforts and those efforts adjacent jurisdictions is essential to
               addressing the regional traffic concerns that impact Brea directly,
               particularly within the Four Corners area.

Four Corners The term “Four Corners” represents the intra-urban metropolitan
             area where the four county boundaries of Los Angeles, Orange,
             San Bernardino, and Riverside counties converge. Serving as the
             gateway between the Inland Empire and the more urbanized
             region of Los Angeles and Orange counties, during the latter
             decades of the twentieth century this area experienced a
             tremendous influx in commuter traffic and congestion. Expanding
             employment opportunities in Orange and Los Angeles counties
             and relatively affordable residential development in the Inland
             Empire have resulted in many, many commuters traveling from
             east to west in the morning and in the reverse direction after work.
             Demographic projections point toward continuation of this trend
             so that by 2020, many workers living in the Inland Empire are still
             expected to depend on jobs in other areas.
             Four travel routes accommodate the east-west commute pattern:
             the SR-60 and SR-91 freeways, and two arterial streets, Grand
             Avenue through Diamond Bar and Carbon Canyon Road (SR-241)
             through Chino Hills and Brea. North-south traffic is restricted to
             SR-57 and Brea Canyon Road.2 The Chino Hills and Santa Ana
             mountains limit opportunities for providing additional capacity.
             According to the Four Corners June, 2000 study, the following
             issues and problems will intensify through the year 2020:
                     Heavy directional commute problems resulting in
                      significant delays during peak hours throughout the Four
                      Corners area
                     Major traffic streams through the very constrained
                      convergence of the SR-60 and SR-57 freeways
                     Slow eastbound traffic on SR-60 east of SR-57 due to a
                      steep grade through the hills
                     The presence of several colleges and universities along the
                      SR-57 corridor, which increases congestion during the
                      school year

                      Future travel patterns and congestion problems are
                       expected to be less dominated by commuter trips as
                       regional growth leads to other types of trip-making during
                       peak periods
Improvement   The Four Corners participants, including Brea, recognize that both
              physical infrastructure improvements and “soft” traffic
   Strategies
              management strategies will be required to address regional traffic
              concerns. Recommendations contained in the June, 2000 Four
              Corners study that would affect Brea directly include:
                      Adding two lanes on SR-57 between SR-60 and SR-22
                      Developing a new road from Chino Hills to SR-57 pursuant
                       to results of detailed feasibility and alignment study
                      Developing express bus service from the City of Industry
                       station to business and activity centers in Brea
                      Studying the potential for ramps to and from R-57 carpool
                       lanes in Brea
              Brea will continue to investigate these and other strategies in
              cooperation with other Four Corners agencies.
              Truck Routes
              Brea experiences moderate amounts of truck traffic generated by
              commercial and light industrial uses and the Olinda-Alpha Landfill.
              Truck traffic may increase in future years in support of new
              businesses. The amount of truck traffic associated with the Olinda-
              Alpha Landfill is related to daily tonnage limits that are regulated
              by an agreement between Orange County and the City of Brea.
              Should the life of the landfill be extended, the City does not
              anticipate an increase in daily tonnage limits, given agreement
              restrictions. However, truck traffic will continue through the
              extended landfill operational period.
              To minimize truck traffic impacts on noise-sensitive uses, the City
              has developed a truck route plan that directs truck traffic to
              Arterials.

                            A major source of truck traffic in Brea is the
                            Olinda-Alpha Landfill located at the terminus
                            of Valencia Avenue. The landfill can be seen
                            in the photo on the right side, just above the
                            houses.
Pedestrian Circulation System
Walkability, access, and connections are necessary components of
a circulation system that easily and specifically accommodates
pedestrians. Walkability includes wide sidewalks, safe street
crossings, features that encourage cautious driving, and a pleasant
and safe walking environment. Walkways, mid-block crossings,
pathways, and pedestrian short-cuts allow people to get from one
destination point to another with ease and quickly. Dedicated
pedestrian paths can provide access between residential and retail
areas, especially if streets are not feasible. Pedestrian connections
should be provided primarily to and from intense commercial
activity centers such as Downtown Brea and transit stops.
Handicapped access strategies should be incorporated into all
street and pathway plans.
Residential development tracts designed inward or isolated from
adjoining neighborhoods create obstacles to pedestrian movement
due to walls, limited access ways, and long walking distances.
Residential tracts should have pathways to commercial centers,
parks, schools, and transit stops. Activities of daily life must be
within walking distance so that people will opt to walk rather than
use the automobile for short trips.
The Community Resources Chapter contains an entire section on
trails, including urban trails and sidewalks. Chapter Six, Public
Safety, contains several goals and policies related to pedestrian
safety.

                    This pedestrian access point, located at the southeast
                    corner of Birch Street and Poplar Avenue, allows
                    residents of the adjoining residential development to
                    easily walk onto Birch Street without having to travel
                    all the way around to the automobile street entrances.
                    Birch Street leads pedestrians easily to Downtown
                    Brea, the Civic and Cultural Center, and the Brea Mall.
Public Transportation System
Promoting the use of alternative transportation modes such as
transit, bicycling, and walking produces a number of community
benefits, including reduced traffic, reduced need for costly
roadway improvement projects, improved air quality, and a
healthier population. Transit in particular reduces vehicles on
freeways and arterial roadways and offers mobility for those who
cannot or do not wish to drive.
Public bus service is provided by OCTA. An established network
of bus routes provides access to employment centers, shopping,
and recreational areas within the City. Transit routes link Brea to
other communities such as La Habra, Fullerton, Orange, Santa
Ana, Costa Mesa, Tustin, Anaheim, Garden Grove, Irvine, and
Newport Beach. OCTA periodically updates its countywide Bus
Service Implementation Program to respond to necessary changes
to service levels and route configurations.
Paratransit services are provided by ACCESS, OCTA's shared-ride
service for people who are unable to use the regular, fixed-route
bus service because of functional limitations caused by a disability.
The City operates the Brea Shuttle Express, a curb-to-curb
transportation shuttle. Local mobility could be enhanced by a
Brea-based fixed-route service that in particular serves the schools
and major retail areas.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
                2-53
OCTA also oversees commuter rail planning and operations. Brea
supports efforts of OCTA to extend light rail or other commuter rail
services to North Orange County, provided any such program
maintains the quality of life in the City.
Accommodating Bicyclists
In Brea and throughout Orange County, where rain falls less than
30 days a year and temperatures are generally moderate, the
climate is perfect for bicycling. People can easily cycle to work or
school, provided safe routes are available. Allowing bicycles on
buses or providing secure bicycle parking facilities can further
encourage bicycling for longer trips. Cycling is also a major
recreational activity, both on mountain tracks and along the roads.
The numerous backbone and single-track trails for the advance
and beginning mountain bikers in Chino Hills Park are purely for
fun and exercise. For the road cyclist, Rose Drive leads cyclists to
a paved pathway in Yorba Linda that guides them to the Santa Ana
River Bike Trail, a great paved bike path that follows the Santa Ana
River to the Pacific Ocean.
Bikeways, like roadways, come in several forms. Brea has adopted
three bikeway standards that parallel those presented in OCTA’s
Bikeways Strategic Plan. Descriptions of these classifications are
presented in Table CD-5 and illustrated in Figure CD-9.
                      Bikeways can provide access to recreational areas,
                      such as this bike path entrance at Rose Drive. This
                      particular bike path winds past Carbon Canyon
                      Dam and straight into Carbon Canyon Regional
                      Park. The Park has immediate access into Chino
                      Hills State Park where various off-road bikeways for
                      mountain biking can be found.

                   transit such as the train and bus, barriers between lengthy trips,
                   personal security, and poor weather conditions are eliminated. In
                   addition, bicycling to transit reduces taxpayer and parking costs,
                   air pollution, energy consummation and traffic congestion.

                                                   provide great opportunities to link

                Parking
                Parking typically is considered a separate issue from vehicle
                circulation. However, the presence of on-street parking has a
                direct effect on roadway capacity. In addition, off-street parking
                deficiencies can cause vehicles to re-circulate on public streets,
                which also increases traffic volumes and congestion by reducing
                capacity for through traffic.
                The City’s zoning ordinance includes parking requirements to
                ensure that adequate number of spaces are provided on-site for
                most uses, as well as minimum stall dimensions that are consistent
                with current standards for other jurisdictions. These regulations
                apply to all new developments and may be applied to existing uses
                that are modified or expanded.
                Goals and Policies
                The following goals and policies ensure that Brea maintains a safe
                and efficient transportation network, and that a variety of mobility
                choices are available throughout the community.
     Regional   Transportation in Brea is directly related to an overall
                transportation network for the four-county area. Roadway facilities
Transportation
                in Brea accommodate regional traffic resulting from congestion on
     Facilities State Route 57 and limited access between San Bernardino and
                Riverside counties to Orange and Los Angeles counties. Planning
                for the needs of the community necessarily includes recognition of
                the related transportation needs and planning efforts of the
                surrounding communities, County, and region.             With that
                recognition is the need for the City to actively monitor
                transportation planning in the surrounding area and strongly
                encourage regional transportation improvements.
                Goal CD-10:         Maintain an effective regional transportation
                                    network.
                Policy CD-10.1      Work continually with Caltrans to improve
                                    access to and from State Route 57.
                Policy CD-10.2      Support efforts to establish rail         travel

                   INFRASTRUCTURE
                   The City’s water, sewer, and storm drain systems represent the
                   hidden support network for development in Brea. These systems
                   must be maintained to ensure that existing residents and business
                   people can reliably turn on a tap, run the washing machine, or use
                   water for industrial processes knowing that the infrastructure
                   systems will not fail. As infrastructure ages, isolated failures
                   represent a real potential. To preserve high service levels in Brea,
                   water and sewer lines will need to be expanded and replaced to
                   maximize efficiency and increase capacity. For new development,
                   the infrastructure must be able to support new needs and
                   demands without burdening current users.
                   Context
                   The City maintains the water distribution, sewage collection, and
                   local storm drain systems in Brea. Water supplies are purchased
                   from wholesale providers (refer to the discussion in the
                   Community Resources Chapter), and the City is responsible for
                   storage and distribution. Sewage collected in laterals and City
                   trunk lines flows into regional lines maintained by the Orange
                   County Sanitation District. With regard to flood control, City
                   storm drains direct runoff into major channels and other facilities
                   under the control of the Orange County Flood Control District.
Water Distribution Because the groundwater quality of the La Habra basin underlying
                   Brea is poor, the City purchases water supplies from two agencies:
           System
                   the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) and
                   the California Domestic Water Company (CDWC). The one
                   groundwater well owned by the City is used strictly for irrigation
                   purposes.
                   Brea’s distribution facilities include supply connections to MWD
                   and CDWC, as well as emergency connections with neighboring
                   agencies. Water enters the distribution systems from transmission
                   mains through various pressure reducing stations and the Berry
                   Street Pumping Station. The water is stored in reservoirs in the
                   hills and other functionally strategic locations, and the City also has
                   storage capacity in the Orange County Reservoir, which is jointly
                   owned by Brea, La Habra, and Fullerton.

                                              reservoirs during its
                                              construction.
In addition to water demands placed on the system for domestic
and commercial use and irrigation, the water system must be
capable of providing adequate pressures for fire-fighting purposes.
Since fires can occur at any time, the water system must be ready
at all times to provide the required flow.
In 2002, the City prepared a Water System Master Plan that
analyzed the domestic water system to determine what
improvements would be required over the long term to best serve
established development, as well as requirements for new facilities
based on the General Plan land use plan. Table CD-6 indicates
the combined summary of total demand by land use within the
planning area.
Over the long term, projected water demands are expected to
increase from a 2002 baseline use of about 9.8 million gallons per
day to 18.1 million gallons per day at build-out, an increase of 85
percent.      To meet this anticipated demand, the City will be
required to increase the capacity of the MWD OC-29 connection
by five cubic feet per second. Also, low water pressure at higher
elevations in Olinda Village and lack of sufficient pumping capacity
at the Berry Street Booster Pumping Station will require upgrades
to the pressure system.
Figure CD-11 identifies the required water system improvements
within the planning area that will be pursued over the long term,
with priority given to meeting the needs of established uses.

Sewage Collection The local sewage collection system provides wastewater collection
                  services to all areas within the City’s corporate boundaries,
         System
                  portions of unincorporated Orange County, and a small portion of
                  Placentia. The gravity system consists of over 100 miles of pipe,
                  the majority of which consist of vitrified clay pipe ranging in size
                  from 8 to 27 inches in diameter. The service area consists of ten
                  major sewer drainage areas that flow into City trunk sewers, which
                  in turn outlet to Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD)
                  facilities. OCSD collects sewage from cities throughout Orange
                  County and treats it at regional facilities.
                  In 2001, the City conducted an extensive analysis of the local
                  sewer system to identify deficiencies in the existing system and to
                  anticipate long-term needs as the City accommodates new
                  residential and other uses. A sewer system model projected
                  wastewater flows associated with build-out consistent with General
                  Plan land use policy. Table CD-7 indicates long-term conditions
                  within each of the ten drainage areas.
                  Ensuring adequate sewer service throughout the entire planning
                  area will require replacement facilities and the extension of new
                  infrastructure to serve new development. Figure CD-12 identifies
                  the required sewer system improvements.
                  The Sewer Master Plan establishes the following priorities for
                  recommended master plan capital improvements:
                       1.      Facilities identified as deficient under existing peak-
                               flow conditions shall be given high priority. For
                               facilities known to require frequent maintenance, those
                               facilities shall be considered of highest priority.
                       2.      Facilities identified as deficient under ultimate
                               conditions and dependent on future development shall
                               be given a moderate priority.
                       3.      Facilities affecting the greatest number of customers or
                               which would cause the most damage in the event of
                               failure are given higher priority rankings that those that
                               do not. This means that downstream facilities with
                               larger tributary flows receive higher priority than
                               upstream facilities.

          Storm Drains              Storm water is rainwater plus anything the rain carries along with
                                    it. In urban areas, rain that falls on roofs or collects on paved areas
                                    is carried away through a system of gutters, pipes, and culverts.
                                    Storm water runoff flows directly into the City's storm drain system
                                    via street gutters and other inlets, and this flow in turn discharges
                                    into County flood control channels which ultimately drain to the
                                    Pacific Ocean.       The Orange County Flood Control District
                                    (OCFCD) maintains the regional storm drain system.
                                    From a planning standpoint, the two important considerations to
                                    focus on regarding storm drains are: 1) ensuring adequate capacity
                                    to collect and carry storm water and thereby avoid flooding, and 2)
                                    working to reduce pollutant loads in storm water as part of
                                    regional efforts to improve water quality in surface waters.
                                    Storm Drainage
                                    In the hills above Brea, Brea Creek, Fullerton Creek (via the Loftus
                                    Diversion Channel), and Carbon Canyon Creek are the three
                                    primary drainage courses. All three are part of the greater
                                    watershed of the San Gabriel River, which outlets into the Pacific
                                    Ocean at Seal Beach.           In Carbon Canyon, drainages and
                                    intermittent streams flow into the Carbon Canyon Dam drainage
                                    area. Stream flows below the dam are directed to the San Gabriel
                                    River via Fullerton Creek or diverted to the Santa Ana River.

                                 located in the City of Fullerton.
Within the urbanized areas of Brea, surface flows are contained
within concrete channels, including the Brea Canyon channel,
Memory Gardens channel, Imperial channel, and Loftus Diversion
channel. These channels, maintained by the OCFCD, provide a
high degree of protection from excessive storm water flows.
(Storm water flooding is addressed as a public safety issue in the
Public Safety Chapter.)
Storm Pollutants
When it rains, trash, litter, silt, automotive chemicals (oils and
grease, antifreeze, and fine dust from tire wear), animal wastes,
and many other contaminants are washed into the storm drain
system. Since storm drains are designed to carry only storm water,
these drains typically are not equipped with filters or cleaning
systems and consequently, deliver polluted urban runoff directly
into local flood control channels and the ocean. Many of the
pollutants found in this runoff are toxic to fish, marine mammals,
and other aquatic life.
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act prohibits the discharge of
any pollutant to navigable waters from a point source unless the
discharge is authorized by a National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit. In 1987, the passage of the
Water Quality Act established NPDES permit requirements for
discharges of storm water. The NPDES permit program controls
water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge
pollutants into waters of the United States. Since 1990, operators
of storm water systems such as Orange County’s have been
required to develop a storm water management program designed
to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed away by storm
water runoff and discharged into local water bodies. Brea

URBAN DESIGN
Vision
Imagine Brea with walkable, tree-lined streets and linked trails and
bicycle paths. Imagine high-quality residential neighborhoods with
shops, services, schools, and parks within close walking distance.
Image a lively downtown and Brea Boulevard with outdoor dining,
shops, and homes mixed together and places to linger and meet
one another. Imagine traveling along Lambert Road, Imperial
Highway, or other main arterials and instantly recognizing that you
are in Brea.
                                 Awnings, sidewalk, street trees, and
                                 public art invite people outside to
                                 walk, socialize, and visit the interesting
                                 places Brea offers.
The image of Brea is composed of the perception and experience
of those living, working, playing, or traveling throughout the
community.       Urban design addresses the conservation and
enhancement of the visual quality of Brea. Urban design applies to
Brea’s visual and physical setting and transcends into other
planning areas: transportation, land use, housing, economic
development, and the natural environment. Addressing urban
design in Brea is especially significant given the City’s unique
mixed-use districts, historical and cultural resources, and rugged
hillside and open space areas. This Urban Design section of the
Community Development Chapter provides guidance regarding
the visual appearance, character, and quality of life within the
community. Principles and policies are designed to improve the
community-wide appearance and character of Brea, as well as to
address urban design in specific areas such as mixed-use districts
and hillside areas.

Context
The history of Brea lies in its hillsides: in the oil industry,
production camps, and early settlements that predate the City’s
founding. Today, the rugged hills provide a scenic backdrop to the
community and insulate the community geographically and
psychologically from Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties.
Breans remain concerned with preserving the natural environment
and open space areas. Throughout the General Plan preparation
process, residents identified these areas as a valuable visual
resource that represent a defining component of community
identity.
                                               Incorporating
                                               landscaping and
                                               decorative features
                                               assists in making
                                               outdoor plazas
                                               inviting.
Brea is also in a unique position of benefiting from a vibrant,
pedestrian-oriented downtown that incorporates and blends
residential, commercial, retail, and entertainment uses.
Downtown Brea represents a source of community pride and an
important destination. Mixed-use land use designations will
provide pedestrian-oriented focused areas that offer opportunities
for people to live, work, shop, and play. The success of mixed use
and pedestrian-oriented areas within the Downtown will be
expanded into other suitable areas – along Birch Street across from
the Civic and Cultural Center and along South Brea Boulevard –
that have ready access to transit and community focal points.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
               2-79

Maintaining and improving the City’s residential areas is also a key
component of urban design.             While the majority of the
community’s housing stock is in good to excellent condition, many
residential neighborhoods would benefit from enhanced
pedestrian and transit connections and integration of local
shopping and services to meet the needs of residents.
Community members have identified several issues relating to the
qualities that define Brea:
       Breans recognize the value of the community’s ”old town”
        feel and community history. This can be enhanced through
        the use of markers, landmarks, buildings, and signs to
        designate historic districts.
       Many areas of Brea are not very walkable and are visually
        non-descriptive, with excessive use of driveways and
        bland, non-cohesive storefronts.       The use of design
        standards, interesting pavement designs, trees, benches,
        mixed-use, and restaurant seating on sidewalks would
        improve the look and walkability of these areas.
       Brea would benefit from more pocket parks, attractive
        public spaces, attractive development, on-street parking,
        historic landmarks, and signs to invoke a sense of identity
        and connection to the past.
       All sides of development (side, back, and front) should look
        attractive and be accessible.
       Brea needs a stronger sense of community identity.
        Capitalize on Brea’s unique history and provide more
        visual definition at City entrances.
       The look and success of Downtown is a great asset to the
        community. Active pedestrian and social activities are
        largely achieved through design and mixed-use
        development. We should extend the look and success of
        Downtown Brea to other areas such as South Brea
        Boulevard.
       Green space adds tremendous value and enjoyment to
        residents. Since a limited amount of open space remains in
        Brea, this can be achieved through more landscaping and
        trees.

               2-80

                                 Chapter 2: Community Development
       Pedestrian-friendly streets, outdoor dining, street furniture,
        and sidewalks make a community more attractive and also
        make people want to get out of their cars and walk to
        different places.
       A limited number of historic structures remain in Brea;
        therefore, we should identify structures that are important
        to be saved. Many valuable historic homes and buildings
        can be refurbished or improved.
       Breans enjoy the community’s varied and extensive
        outdoor art collection. We should employ more creative
        methods to incorporate art work to blend with new and
        existing buildings.
       Brea’s hillsides are an important community asset. They
        should be developed with the least amount of impact
        possible, while still maintaining the ridgelines and
        providing pathways and viewing trails for the community.
The urban design plan presents broad citywide goals, as well as
specific design policies tailored for distinct neighborhoods in the
community:
       Downtown Brea
       Historic Brea
       Northwest Brea Neighborhoods
       East Brea Neighborhoods
       West Brea Industry and Commerce Center
       Unocal Research Center and Environs

               The citywide urban design objectives and design guidelines for
               districts and neighborhoods have been crafted around the
               following five overarching goals:
               Goal CD-17       Promote and maintain a distinct community
                                identity and sense of place that include the
                                presence      of    identifiable   districts   and
                                neighborhoods.
               Goal CD-18       Emphasize the use of public spaces and
                                pedestrian and transit use throughout the
                                community.
               Goal CD-19       Encourage       active    and    inviting    street
                                environments that include a variety of uses
                                within Commercial and Mixed-Use areas.
               Goal CD-20       Encourage site planning within Commercial and
                                Mixed-Use districts that functionally and visually
                                integrates on-site facilities and uses, including
                                buildings, services, access, and parking.
               Goal CD-21       Integrate residential development with its built
                                and natural surroundings, and in particular,
                                encourage a strong relationship between
                                dwellings and the street.
               Goal CD-22       Encourage the use of native plant palettes in the
                                creation of landscaping plans used to establish a
                                sense of place in neighborhood identification
                                efforts.

                  At a citywide level, programs and improvements will be pursued
                  that enhance the visual character of Brea and create a distinct
                  identity.
                                      Homes that create a direct relationship to the street,
                                      without the looming presence of garages, reinforce
                                      the feelings of neighborhood and community.
Citywide Concept: Overall Concept
                  The urban design plan recognizes the multitude of places that
           Places distinguish Brea. These places vary in scale from districts to
                  landmarks, but each component further differentiates the
                  community and contributes to the understanding, use, and
                  enjoyment of the City.
                  Concept Components: Brea Places
                  Districts describe rather broad areas of the community, each
                  featuring a relatively consistent character and sometimes a highly
                  unique identity (Figure CD-13). Districts should complement one
                  another, and while some are distinguished by a diversity of uses
                  (Downtown Brea, Historic Brea), others are identified by a single
                  dominant land use. For instance, Northwest Brea Neighborhoods
                  consist of mostly residential areas, with limited commercial use.
                  Private development and public improvements should enhance
                  the identity, character, and function of each district.
                  Neighborhoods are relatively defined areas with a primarily
                  residential function, often focused around a park or school.
                  Neighborhoods should be well connected with their surroundings,
                  and integration of a limited amount of local shopping and services
                  conveniently serving day-to-day needs is often justified. Of
                  particular concern to Brea’s residents, the quality of existing
                  neighborhoods should be preserved, and new development should
                  be sensitive to residential surroundings.

Figure CD-13. Urban Design District Map
                           Activity Nodes serve as important destinations, the major centers
                           of public life within the community. These nodes require a “critical
                           mass” and should promote compact development patterns, with
                           particular emphasis given to main street commercial, housing over
                           retail, and/or urban village project types. Streets should be treated
                           as highly public places where pedestrians are given priority and
                           there is an abundance of streetscape amenity.
                           Focal Intersections become visually distinct places through special
                           paving, landscape treatment, and/or public art; they serve to orient
                           residents and visitors alike. Some intersections may also function
                           as the focus of activity for surrounding districts and nodes.
                           Increased development intensities surrounding the intersection
                           and buildings with strong corner massing will highlight and support
                           this role.
                           Schools and Parks are traditionally associated with local
                           neighborhoods, and this pattern is appropriate to Brea. A
                           desirable balance between residential land use and open space
                           resources is achieved, and many social and recreational needs are
                           conveniently met. Each neighborhood should have convenient
                           access to a local park, preferably within or directly adjacent its
                           boundaries; however, some outlying neighborhoods are not well
                           served.
                           Urban Spaces include publicly accessible plazas, courtyards, and
                           similar outdoor spaces that form a vital component of a
                           community’s public life. Therefore, these spaces are especially
                           appropriate within identified activity nodes. As well-defined
                           outdoor rooms, they may accommodate public gatherings and
                           celebrations, or serve as retreats from urban activity.

                  Landmarks are highly recognizable buildings, structures, or
                  landscape features. As such, they become powerful orienting
                  devices that help define the City, a district, and/or a
                  neighborhood. For instance, residents readily identify “The
                  Plunge” with Historic Brea. Historically significant buildings and
                  structures frequently achieve status as community landmarks and
                  should be preserved and protected from incompatible
                  development.
                  Natural Features generally refer to the hillside areas that provide a
                  special backdrop to the community. The hillside areas are an
                  indispensable component of the City’s visual character, and
                  include environmentally significant features such as ridgelines and
                  drainage ways that should be protected from intrusion.
                  Figure CD-14 indicates locations of urban design improvements
                  planned throughout Brea.
                             Gateways featuring special signage
                             are an opportunity to reinforce
                             Brea’s unique character and identity.

                  principal connections that unite Brea’s place. These linkages build
                  a system of open spaces comprised of landscape corridors,
                  walkable streets, and trails connecting undeveloped hillside, public
                  parks and schools, and urban open spaces. Brea has identified a
                  particular need to upgrade the visual quality of many of the
                  community’s streets. The City also recognizes the opportunity to
                  build strong connections to new development by extending the
                  existing road network.

                         access and enjoyment of the hillside and other
                         valued community open spaces.
Concept Components: Brea Connections
Gateways announce arrival, as expressed through special design.
City gateways are recommended where major streets cross
municipal boundaries and at freeway ramps. District gateways
should be considered for especially recognizable districts, most
notably Downtown Brea and Historic Brea.                Environmental
graphics (i.e. signage) that express local history and identity are an
especially important element of gateway design.
Landscape Corridors are a highly visible component of the
cityscape. These significant regional thoroughfares benefit from
extensive landscape improvements.            In particular, generous
medians and parkways enhance the visual quality of these
otherwise auto-dominated corridors and function as an extension
of the community open space network (Figure CD-13).
Mixed-Use Boulevards directly link and/or support Brea’s
principal activity nodes, requiring the transformation of auto-
dominated arterials into vibrant mixed-use places. While these
streets will continue to support auto and transit movement, they
represent boulevards where pedestrian activity is most desired.
Brea Boulevard, Birch Street, and key roadways within newly
developing areas will receive this treatment. Public initiatives and
private sector development will need to respond accordingly.
Buildings should exhibit an exceptionally strong street orientation,
and priority should be given to providing considerable streetscape
amenities.
Major Linkages establish a community-wide network of
connections between parks and schools to create an open space
system. Typically, these streets are arterials and collectors that
should be more accommodating of the pedestrian.
Recommended streetscape improvements emphasize street trees
BREA GENERAL PLAN
                2-89

to unify the street’s appearance, and amenities such as enhanced
transit stops, benches, and pedestrian-scaled light fixtures. As far
as feasible, adjacent development should orient to the street and
incorporate pedestrian-friendly design features.
                                             Multi-use trails provide
                                             places for pedestrians,
                                             joggers, and cyclists.
Neighborhood Linkages promote local walking connections to
shops and services, including neighborhood parks and schools.
These streets may also offer vital connections between adjacent
neighborhoods; for instance, the existing street network should be
extended to discourage isolated developments.                 Continuous
sidewalks are a necessity in both nonresidential and residential
areas. In addition, opportunities for traffic calming should be
explored within residential neighborhoods.
Pedestrian Passages provide on-site connections between
sidewalks, outdoor spaces, building entrances, and parking
facilities. They are an especially important component of urban
villages and activity nodes, where a well-connected and engaging
pedestrian environment is most critical.
Trails complement regional and community open space systems.
Ridgelines, drainage ways, abandoned rail lines, urban drainage
channels, and freeway rights-of-way provide the opportunity for a
continuous network linking hillsides with flatlands.                In the
Community Resources Chapter, the Trails Plan identifies a network
of urban and natural area trails linking all community places.

Downtown Brea Policies for Creating a Sense of Place
                Provide diverse housing, employment and cultural
                 opportunities throughout the Downtown, with an emphasis on
                 compact, mixed-use and pedestrian-oriented development
                 patterns that are appropriate to the core of the City.
                                         Landscaping enhances private businesses
                                         where they interface with the public realm.
                Accommodate a range of housing densities and residential
                 building types, including non-traditional forms that enliven the
                 Downtown setting, such as small lot single-family residential,
                 housing over retail, lofts, and live-work accommodations.
                Promote the Brea/Birch intersection as the vibrant heart of
                 Downtown and the principal center of public life for the
                 community; this node should function as a highly identifiable
                 shopping and entertainment destination for Brea and
                 neighboring communities.
                Enhance the public character of the Civic and Cultural Center
                 and its surroundings; this area of Downtown should be highly
                 accessible and much more accommodating of people, with an
                 emphasis on transit- and pedestrian-oriented development.
              Policies for Creating Connections
                Build especially prominent visual and physical connections
                 between Downtown and the remainder of the community;

                                    Create an extensive network of safe and comfortable
                                     pedestrian linkages throughout the Downtown, including
                                     visually attractive, high-amenity streetscapes, pedestrian paseos
                                     and paths, and urban outdoor rooms.
                                    Strengthen the connection along Birch Street between the
                                     heart of Downtown and the Civic and Cultural Center;
                                     pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use development, and a high level
                                     of streetscape amenity are encouraged.
                 Historic Brea    Policies for Creating a Sense of Place
                                    Protect the character and enhance the quality of Historic
                                     Brea’s single-family residential areas; in particular, infill
                                     development should be compatible with the scale and
                                     appearance of neighboring dwellings, with higher intensity
                                     development along South Brea Boulevard serving as a buffer to
                                     the established single-family neighborhood behind.
                                    Support preservation and rehabilitation of the area’s single-

City Gateway
 Identify the City at prominent entrances to the community.
  Distinctive public art pieces, signage and/or graphics that
  express the history and character of the community are
  recommended at City gateways.
 Use a combination of special paving, lighting, and/or landscape
  treatment to augment the appearance and visual impact of
  gateways. For example, a change in streetscape design and
  appearance will communicate passage into Brea.
 Mark community thresholds with vertical design elements.
  Where appropriate, private development should support the
  notion of community gateway with strong corner massing,
  tower elements, or other architectural features that create a
  distinct profile.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
            2-101

Landscape Corridor
 Improve the visual quality of the community’s major
  thoroughfares with abundant landscape. The design of these
  streets should serve as a physical and visual accompaniment to
  the community’s open space network.
 Provide generous medians and parkways that support
  extensive plantings.      In addition, medians and parkways
  should accommodate distinctive gateways at the City’s
  boundaries.
 Include continuous sidewalks with wide parkways that
  establish a physical and psychological separation between
  pedestrians and autos. Benches and pedestrian-scaled light
  fixtures should also be included, where appropriate.

             2-102

                              Chapter 2: Community Development
 Plant street trees of considerable height and stature
  appropriate to the scale and function of the street. Flowering
  trees and shrubs may be included for color interest and to
  augment the appearance of the street.
 Along Lambert Road east of SR-57, investigate strategies and
  programs to coordinate with private property owners to create
  a unified street presence of slopes and fences facing onto
  Lambert Road.
Boulevard Corridor
 Make Boulevards Corridors active streets that accommodate a
  balance between vehicular, transit, and pedestrian modes of
  travel. In particular, pedestrians should find these streets
  amenable to walking, strolling, lingering, meeting, and
  conversing.
 Provide wide sidewalks that accommodate a clear pedestrian
  path at least five feet wide, as well as space for streetscape
  amenities and commercial activities such as sidewalk dining.
  In general, streetscape amenities should be located adjacent
  the curb, and on-street parking is encouraged.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
            2-103

 Choose street trees that hold up to urban conditions, planted
  in tree wells. Tree species and spacing should establish a
  formal rhythm and should be of sufficient stature to reinforce
  the space of the street.
 Provide streetscape amenities at frequent intervals, and
  consider opportunities for public art, environmental graphics,
  special sidewalk paving, and crosswalk enhancements. At a
  minimum, furniture should include pedestrian-scaled light
  fixtures, benches, trash receptacles, and planters of compatible
  design.
 Emphasize development focused toward the street, with
  parking located behind or next to buildings rather than in
  front.
Major Linkage
 Improve pedestrian access throughout the community by
  incorporating pedestrian-oriented design features along streets
  identified as major linkages. Street trees and other streetscape
  amenities should communicate that these streets are part of
  the community’s open space network.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
             2-104

                                Chapter 2: Community Development
 Provide tree lawns or wide sidewalks that accommodate street
  trees and other streetscape amenities. In most instances, street
  trees will be located adjacent the curb to heighten the sense of
  separation between the pedestrian and the automobile.
 Plant street trees that offer overhead cover for pedestrians and
  create a pleasant rhythm that unifies and leads the eye down
  the street. Choose species that will distinguish these streets as
  principal connectors.
 Include street furniture and other streetscape amenities that
  promote pedestrian safety and comfort, and consider
  opportunities for bus stop and crosswalk enhancements.
  Pedestrian-scaled light fixtures and benches that allow periodic
  rest are especially important.
Neighborhood Linkages
 Design neighborhood linkages streets to support neighborliness
  and comfortable movement on foot. Residents should feel at
  ease walking along these streets and should experience a sense
  of neighborhood pride.
 Encourage narrow travel lanes with curb-side parking to slow
  traffic. Consistent street tree planting will also narrow the
  perceptual width of the street.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
             2-105

 Plant spreading, deciduous canopy trees in generous tree
  lawns measuring at least three feet wide. Street trees may be
  chosen to lend a street or neighborhood a unique identity, and
  a formal arrangement is not necessary.
 Orient residences to the street to create attractive street scenes
  and increase security. Shallow setbacks and front porches are
  encouraged, providing a pleasant transition between the
  sidewalk and the dwelling.
Pedestrian Passage
 Provide pedestrian passages and paseos in conjunction with
  commercial and mixed-use developments. Pedestrian passages
  should conveniently and comfortably connect building
  entrances, outdoor spaces, sidewalks, and parking.
 Incorporate outdoor furniture and other pedestrian amenities
  along outdoor passages. Benches and planters are especially
  encouraged, but should be placed at locations that will not
  interrupt pedestrian circulation.
 Consider opportunities for public art that will draw people
  through the space. Other features such as kiosks and
  directories are also recommended.

                              Chapter 2: Community Development
Public Plaza
 Encourage developers to incorporate public plazas within the
  community’s most intensely active places. Plazas may be
  provided by public and/or private sector initiative, but should
  accommodate public use.
 Establish immediate physical and visual connections between
  public plazas and sidewalks. Public plazas should be located
  at or near the same grade as adjacent sidewalks.
 Dimension public plazas in accordance with their
  surroundings. Plazas should be defined spaces that enhance
  the street environment without harmful interruptions in retail
  and pedestrian continuity.
 Enliven public plazas with civic art and fountains, as well as
  seating and shade. Public plazas should accommodate
  comfortable human occupation and use.

                               Chapter 2: Community Development
Regional/Community Shopping
Center
 Use shopping center buildings and/or landscape treatment to
  define street corridors. To the maximum extent feasible, a
  portion of the development’s buildings should contribute to
  definition of the street edge, especially at street corners.
 Reduce the visual and environmental impact of expansive
  parking lots. Numerous trees and plantings should shade
  parking areas, define circulation routes, and screen undesirable
  views of parking from adjacent properties.
 Give large-scale shopping centers a unified architectural
  character. A common design theme for all buildings, signage,
  and landscape treatment is encouraged, including freestanding
  pad buildings.
 Minimize large, unbroken wall surfaces, and provide highly
  visible public entrances to all buildings and uses. In particular,
  public entrances and heavily trafficked outdoor areas should
  incorporate human-scaled details such as canopies and
  window displays.
 Provide well-marked and comfortable pedestrian walkways
  including pedestrian circulation within parking lots with
  connections to adjacent sidewalks and safe access from
  parking. Pedestrian circulation routes within parking lots
  should be clearly delineated, and pedestrian amenities in the
  form of courtyards, plazas, and covered walks are encouraged.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
            2-109

     Generate visual interest along outdoor passages and
      paseos.     Building facades with articulated entrances,
      ground floor transparency, and architectural details such as
      accent lighting are recommended.
Local Shopping Center
 Site local shopping centers in whole or in part close to the
  street. In particular, buildings should define the edges of street
  corners.
 Reduce the visual impact of parking on local neighborhoods.
  To the maximum extent feasible, on-site parking should be
  located to the rear or side of buildings, with shade trees and
  extensive plantings that screen undesirable views from
  sidewalks and adjacent properties.
 Create a street-level environment that is pedestrian-friendly.
  Design features such as arcades, canopies and awnings,
  transparent windows and windows displays, etc. should be
  incorporated.
 Respond to adjacent residential uses with a sensitive transition
  in scale and massing. For example, building mass should be
  broken down with step backs in height, articulated sub-
  volumes, and horizontal and vertical façade articulation.
 Incorporate functional pedestrian connections to adjacent
  uses. Nearby residential uses should benefit from convenient
  access to local shopping and services.

                                 Chapter 2: Community Development
Main Street Commercial
 Build an especially strong relationship between the building
  and the street. Buildings should be configured to maintain a
  continuous edge along the sidewalk and define public space.
 Design buildings to encourage multi-tenant occupancy and
  walk-in traffic at the street level. Uses that generate negligible
  walk-in traffic are discouraged from street-front locations.
 Provide a frequent cadence of shop entrances along the street.
  Recessed entries are encouraged; however, grade separations
  between sidewalks and ground floor commercial uses are
  discouraged.
 Encourage the creative expression of individual storefronts,
  and use shop windows to help animate the street and sustain
  attention.       Generous street level windows that are
  predominantly transparent glass are strongly encouraged.
 Emphasize design elements such as separate storefronts,
  display windows, shop entrances, exterior light fixtures,
  awnings and overhangs, and pedestrian-oriented signage.
  These features will add interest and give a human dimension
  to street level facades.
 Generate visual interest along outdoor passages and paseos.
  Building facades with articulated entrances, ground floor
  transparency, and architectural details such as accent lighting
  are recommended.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
             2-111

Mixed Use: Urban Village
 Encourage horizontal and vertical mixing of commercial and
  residential uses. The inclusion of apartment, townhome,
  housing over commercial, and main street commercial project
  types will contribute to a village atmosphere that
  accommodates live, work, and play.
 Emphasize a street-oriented development pattern. In general,
  buildings should visually define streets and important public
  spaces, and provide active uses along sidewalks.
 Incorporate outdoor spaces that are activity oriented and
  support public gathering.        Well-defined parks, plazas,
  courtyards, and connecting sidewalks and paseos should create
  a network of pedestrian spaces.
 Use subterranean or interior parking courts to minimize the
  visual impact of parking. The location and design of parking
  should not prohibit the desired street-oriented development
  pattern or inhibit the provision of comfortable and functional
  outdoor spaces.

            2-112

                               Chapter 2: Community Development
Mixed Use: Housing Over Retail
 Support a street-oriented development pattern, with buildings
  sited at or near the sidewalk edge. Mixed-use structures
  should be a component of main street commercial
  development and other areas where pedestrian activity is
  strongly encouraged.
 Rely on ground floor commercial space with frequent sidewalk
  entrances to promote pedestrian activity along the street. In
  particular, ground floor commercial uses should offer shops
  and services to local residents.
 Include communal and private open space areas for project
  residents. These spaces should be designed to limit intrusion
  by non-residents.
 Make ground floor commercial uses visually distinct from the
  residential space above. Dwelling units should exhibit a
  residential character, and residential entrances should read
  differently from entrances to ground floor commercial uses.
 Incorporate upper floor balconies, bays, and windows that
  overlook the street and enliven the street elevation. These will
  also communicate the residential function of upper levels.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
            2-113

Multi-Family Dwellings
 Reduce the bulk of multi-family buildings, including a
  transition in scale to adjacent single-family dwellings. Building
  facades should be articulated to portray a domestic scale and
  give identity to individual dwelling units.
 Locate parking to reduce its visibility from streets and open
  space areas, and restrict parking from within required setbacks.
  Subterranean parking and parking courts interior to a block are
  appropriate solutions.
 Provide attractive, centrally located communal open space
  with functional amenities. The amount of communal open
  space should increase with the size of a multi-family
  development to meet the social and recreational needs of its
  inhabitants.
 Include private outdoor space in conjunction with each
  dwelling unit. Private open space may include patios, terraces,
  and well-sized balconies.

            2-114

                               Chapter 2: Community Development
Single-Family Dwellings
 Infill single-family residential neighborhoods with dwellings
  that approximate the scale of established residences.
  Excessively large dwellings that dominate the surrounding
  neighborhood are discouraged.
 Create a pleasing variety of homes within low-density
  residential developments. In particular, dwellings with identical
  elevations should not be placed on adjacent lots, and
  developments must include single-story units and/or building
  forms.
 Avoid repetitive placement of garage doors and reduce their
  visual prominence. Dwellings should orient to the street, with
  the garage setback from the front elevation or placed to the
  rear of the property.
 Promote site configurations that create useable yard areas. For
  example, consider zero-lot line layouts where they do not
  conflict with the dominant pattern of development.
 Articulate facades to add interest, reduce monotony, and
  create identity from dwelling to dwelling. Dwellings should
  present a simple and pleasing composition that uses a
  common vocabulary of forms, architectural elements, and
  materials.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
             2-115

Hillside Residential
 Restrict construction on environmentally sensitive and visually
  prominent locations. Dwellings should be sited well below the
  ridgeline, and avoid prominent landforms, site features,
  drainageways, and vegetation.
 Use naturalistic grading techniques that blend grading with the
  existing topography. Grading should use rounded contours
  and slopes to minimize the apparent disturbance to the site.
 Revegetate with native and/or naturalized species where
  grading or other activities have disturbed the site. In general,
  planting should be drought resistant and control erosion.
 Design unobtrusive dwellings, requiring stepped, single story,
  and low profile building and roof forms that conform to the
  hillside topography. Tall building forms that block views and
  detract from the largely undeveloped character of the hillsides
  are strongly discouraged.
 Incorporate architectural features that reduce bulk, such as
  eaves, bay windows, varied elevations. Naturalistic materials
  and colors are also encouraged.

Office and Industrial Campus
 Organize industrial and large office developments around
  shared courts, quadrangles, and greens. Multiple paths should
  connect on-site buildings and uses, transit stops, and public
  sidewalks.
 Support street-level activity. Buildings should provide ground-
  floor interest, transparency, and openness, especially views
  into lobbies.
 Design buildings with individual character and identity,
  including a highly visible main entrance. Monolithic buildings
  are discouraged, and massing should be broken down with
  vertical and horizontal façade modulation.
 Provide abundant landscape in keeping with a campus setting.
  For example, “orchard” tree planting should be used within
  parking lots for shade and visual relief.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
A healthy local economy consists of a highly trained and educated
workforce, diversified businesses, accessibility to major highways
and freeways, available housing, financial assistance to businesses,
and infrastructure ready to serve technologically advanced
businesses. With this Brea can easily to attract, retain, and expand
the City’s business community. This will in turn ensure Brea’s
fiscal and financial health, allowing for a high level of public
services and programs. Economic development goals can set the
tone and direction for the business community in Brea.
Context
Brea has a true balance of quality office, industrial, retail,
residential, recreational, and entertainment uses that offer many
employment opportunities and provide a healthy tax revenue
base. Brea is also a regional retail center, providing a variety of
goods and services for many north Orange County residents. This
diversified business sector includes manufacturing, service
industries, retail and distribution outlets, and professional
corporations.
                              Three large office parks within Brea can be
                              found along State College Boulevard
                              adjacent to the Brea Mall, Imperial
                              Highway and Valencia Avenue, and at the
                              intersection of Lambert Road and SR-57.

                                                 Chapter 2: Community Development
               In addition, Brea is actively involved in many projects and
               programs to enhance the business community.                 The City
               aggressively offers business retention and attraction programs,
               housing programs for low- to moderate-income families, and
               property redevelopment and revitalization programs.              Brea
               constantly monitors available manufacturing and industrial space
               and provides information to businesses interested in relocating or
               expanding in the City of Brea. The City continually looks for new
               initiatives to examine the availability of appropriate infrastructure,
               such as fiber optics, to accommodate the growing needs of high-
               tech businesses.
               Economic development is a regionally important issue. Many
               residents work outside of Brea, and many employees who live in
               other communities come to Brea to work. Census data (year
               2000) shows at least 18,000 working residents living in Brea but
               40,000 employment positions in the City, creating a net flow of
               approximately 22,000 jobs. Regional cooperation is needed
               because transportation and housing cross city lines, and Brea’s
               decisions can affect neighboring cities. Regional cooperation
               comes from the North Orange County Partnership (NOCP). This
               organization was formed to ensure that the North Orange County
               region fully participates in the economic growth of the County and
               the greater Southern California metropolitan area. The NOCP
               consists of economic development professionals from the cities of
               Brea, Buena Park, Fullerton, La Habra, Placentia, and Yorba Linda.
Businesses and The approximate 2,500 businesses in Brea employ at least 40,000
               people. Four primary employment sectors make up Brea’s
  Employment
               economic base: trade; finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE);
               services; and manufacturing. The advantage of such a diverse
               business composition means that the City can withstand an
               economic downturn without experiencing an entire collapse
               within the local economy.
               Trade includes both retail and wholesale trade. All of the retail
               trade sectors account for the greatest share of employment in the
               City. Table CD-8 shows the total share of businesses in Brea
               compared to the region and the County. The percentage of retail
               employment results from the City serving as a retail center for the
               region. The Brea Mall is the largest regional retail mall in North
               Orange County. In addition to the Mall, Brea Union Plaza,
               Gateway Center, Downtown Brea, and the Brea Marketplace are
               significant power centers under retail trade.

                                  Supporting economic development means making space for both
                                  existing businesses to expand and for new businesses to locate in
                                  Brea. To ensure adequate supply of land, the City will need to
                                  plan in advance to anticipate business expansion potential and to
                                  attract new or added uses to the local economy. Expanding or
                                  relocating businesses seek not only a sufficient land supply, but

                                                opportunities for Breans and
                                                the region.
Employment Growth
Between 1999 and 2020, Brea can expect an increase in jobs
available in the community to 49,700 (23 percent increase), as
shown in Table CD-9. This projected growth is much higher than
that projected for the region (9 percent), but lower than Orange
County (32 percent) as a whole. Also, the City’s population will
grow, fueling employment growth by creating demand for
additional retail, service, and public-sector uses and jobs. With a
diverse employment base and expansion of employment
opportunities for local residents, Breans will continue to benefit
from the local economy.

                                                The Brea Job Center provides a
                                                neutral site where day laborers may
                                                be hired by potential employers.
                                                Men and women with expertise in
                                                plumbing, landscaping,

                                                skills are ready to work. Potential
                                                employers may drop by or call the
                                                Job Center to arrange for help in

Redevelopment The Brea Redevelopment Agency was formed to provide a tool to
              eliminate blighting conditions and ensure that the City’s economic
              base would grow and remain healthy through new public
              improvements, commercial development, and affordable housing.
              Over the years, the Agency adopted and amended several project
              areas, resulting in numerous successful projects ranging from the
              Brea Mall and the Civic and Cultural Center to office parks, retail
              centers, residential projects and public improvements.
              Community-involved planning efforts such as the Brea Project and
              the Downtown Charette ensured that public input was included
              throughout any redevelopment process.
              The Agency made significant progress during the later half of the
              1990s by restoring a vibrant downtown commercial district,
              providing numerous affordable housing opportunities, and other
              economic development successes. Under the guidance of the
              Economic Development Department, the Agency looks forward to
              continuing to use redevelopment authority strategically to target
              improvements within project areas.

   Economic  Although Brea’s economy exhibits good health, the City faces
             several challenges as it continues to grow in the future. The
Development
             challenges, however, are not unique to other cities or the region:
  Challenges
                Underutilized and outdated commercial shopping centers.
                 While larger commercial centers are currently enjoying
                 successes within the retail market, older and outdated
                 commercial centers are struggling because of secondary
                 locations and loss of market share to newer and larger
                 commercial centers within the City. An example of this issue is
                 the Brea Marketplace, which has been struggling and will more
                 than likely find it difficult to retain tenants, given the number
                 of healthy, vibrant centers with better locations and higher
                 visibility nearby. Due to the location of the center, adjacent to
                 the Brea Mall, Cultural and Civic Center, and high-rise office
                 buildings, this center is an ideal place for intense mix-use
                 combining commercial, office and residential uses to continue
                 the successes of Downtown Brea.
                Shortage of Industrial Buildings. Vacancy of industrial space
                 within Brea is very low, and economists believe that Brea has a
                 shortage of industrial buildings, given the City’s prime location
                 to regional transportation corridors. Land use policy plans for
                 at least a 10 percent increase in industrial space square footage
                 over the time horizon of the General Plan.
                Automobile congestion. Traffic congestion has plagued many
                 Orange County cities and can be a deterrent for potential
                 businesses choosing to locate to Brea. As population and
                 employment grows, congestion will continue to be a
                 foreseeable problem in the future. The Circulation section of
                 this chapter describes the goals and policies designed to
                 confront the problem now and in the future.
             BREA GENERAL PLAN
                             2-123

                    Housing availability. Available and affordable housing must
                     be accommodated as Brea continues to expand economically.
                     In the 1990s, the Economic Development Department and the
                     Redevelopment Agency participated in several projects that
                     created new affordable housing opportunities.         Brea has
                     identified a need not just for affordable housing but also for
                     homes priced above $500,000 that establish a move-up
                     market for executives and other high wage earners who wish
                     to remain in Brea as their earning power increases.
                Goals and Policies
                The Economic Development goals and policies call for continued
                economic successes and outline strategies the City will pursue
                keep Brea on track as a community that experiences a comfortable
                quality of life.
       Tax Base Economic growth can bring many benefits to the community,
                including jobs, housing, and new revenue. New growth will lead
Revenue Growth
                to higher tax revenue, thus benefiting residents and the community
                directly by enhancing many of the public services the City
                provides. The City will collaborate with the business community
                to facilitate growth, development, and infrastructure improvements
                that benefit residents and businesses alike.
                Goal CD-23            Encourage and facilitate activities        that

                                      that make a positive contribution to the City’s
                                      tax base.
                Policy CD-23.2        Provide opportunities for mixed-use, office,
                                      manufacturing, and retail development that
                                      respond to market and community needs in
                                      terms of size, location, and cost.
                Policy CD-23.3        Track retail trends, and tailor regulations to
                                      respond to market changes, maximize revenue,
                                      and maintain the appropriate business mix.

Diversity Brea understands that part of its economic stronghold stems from
          its employment diversity of office, retail, manufacturing, and
          industrial businesses. Retaining and expanding these businesses
          will continue the economic benefits the City maintains, as well as

GROWTH MANAGEMENT
Given its central location at the crossroads of Orange, Los Angeles
and San Bernardino counties, Brea experiences the both positive
and negative effects of regional growth. As more people move
into the area, they spend tax dollars at the Brea Mall and at shops
and restaurants in Downtown, and they drive every weekday to
major employment centers in the community. This activity brings
increased congestion on the major arterials through Brea: Carbon
Canyon Road, Imperial Highway, Lambert Road, and Valencia
Road. Brea continues to work cooperatively with surrounding
cities and counties to manage growth to minimize adverse effects
on the City. More importantly, Brea looks locally to balance its
own growth and ensure that the pace of new development and
welcome economic growth does not outpace the ability of the City
and the Brea-Olinda Unified School District to provide services

                                                     Chapter 2: Community Development
                  Future growth in Brea will occur as residential, commercial, and
                  industrial infill, as well as new homes in limited hillside areas, are
                  constructed. The outlying areas will require substantial investments
                  in roads, water and sewer lines, and other infrastructure. Proper
                  phasing of new development in concert with augmenting the
                  capacities of infrastructure and public facilities, as identified in the
                  Community Services and Community Resources Chapters, will
                  ensure sufficient levels for service of residents and businesses.
                  To assure that new development does not negatively impact the
                  existing levels of public services provided by the City, the Growth
                  Management Element provides guidance in balancing provision of
                  public facilities and infrastructure in a manner that will adequately
                  serve current and future residents. In addition, planning for future
                  growth is also required by Orange County Measure M, the Revised
                  Traffic Improvement and Growth Management Plan approved in
                  1990 by Orange County voters. Measure M allocates funds to
                  provide transportation facilities in Orange County. The funds
                  raised by Measure M are returned to cities to be used for local and
                  regional transportation projects. To qualify for funds, each city
                  must comply with the Countywide Traffic Improvement and
                  Growth Management Program, which requires adoption of local
                  growth management policies.
                  Context
                  Plans and programs adopted by Orange County and the Southern
                  California Association of Governments have bearing on the scope
                  and context of Brea’s growth management policies.
  Orange County   Measure M, adopted by Orange County voters in 1990,
                  established a one-half cent sales tax for countywide transportation
  Revised Traffic
                  improvements. All eligible jurisdictions receive 14.6 percent of the
Improvement and   sales tax revenue based on factors such as the population ratio,
         Growth   Master Plan of Arterial Highways miles, and total taxable sales. To
Management Plan   receive the funds, cities must have a local Growth Management
                  Plan. Funds can be used for local projects, as well as ongoing
    (Measure M)   maintenance of local streets and roads. This program was designed
                  to create a process among Orange County jurisdictions to
                  coordinate and implement traffic improvements and planning on a
                  countywide basis.
                  BREA GENERAL PLAN
                                 2-129

To receive its allocations of Measure M funds, Brea must submit a
statement of compliance with the growth management
components addressing the following:
1) Adoption of a Growth Management Element, or similar
    General Plan component, that includes traffic Level of Service
    (LOS) standards. The general target standard should be LOS D
    for intersections, recognizing that lower LOS standards for
    certain intersections in urbanized areas may be appropriate if
    such affected roadways carry a high proportion of regional
    traffic (for example, Imperial Highway).
2) Develop a Mitigation Program. This program shall ensure that
    new growth pays its fair share of the costs associated with that
    growth. To meet the requirements, Brea is required to: a)
    adopt a development mitigation program to ensure that
    development is paying its share of the costs associated with
    that development; b) impose or continue a traffic impact
    mitigation fee; c) ensure that new revenues provided by a sales
    tax increase measure shall no be used to replace private
    developer funding which has been committed for a project.
3) Participate in Inter-jurisdictional Planning Forums. Brea, in
    cooperation with the City-County Coordination Committee, is
    required to participate in interjurisdictional forums to
    cooperate in easing cumulative traffic impacts and
    coordinating improvements in transportation and other
    facilities. Brea has been an ongoing participant in the Four
    Corner Study effort to define options for easing traffic
    congestion where Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside, and San
    Bernardino counties converge.
4) Development of a Seven-Year Capital Improvement
    Program. Brea must determine the capital projects needed to
    meet and maintain both traffic Level of Service and
    Performance Standards. The Capital Improvement Program
    shall include approved projects and an analysis of the costs of
    the proposed projects, as well as a financial plan for providing
    the improvements.
5) Address Housing Options and Job Opportunities as related
    to transportation demand on a city, sub-regional, and
    countywide basis. Through adoption and implementation of
    the Mixed Use I, II, and III General Plan land use designations,
    Brea creates opportunities for housing and jobs to be located
    in close proximity to each other, thereby reducing vehicle
    trips.

                    6) Adopt a Transportation Demand Management Ordinance or
                         alternative mitigation to reduce single-occupancy automobile
                         travel.
Southern California The Southern California Association of Governments, or SCAG, has
                    adopted a Growth Management Plan that applies to the six-county
     Association of
                    SCAG region (Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside,
     Governments    Ventura, and Imperial counties). This plan recommends ways that
                    cities and counties can redirect regional growth to minimize traffic
                    congestion and improve environmental quality. A key goal of
                    SCAG’s Growth Management Element is to better balance jobs and
                    housing within subregions.
                    The South Coast Air Quality Management District supports the
                    SCAG Growth Management Plan through implementation of the
                    Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP). The AQMP mandates a
                    variety of measures to reduce traffic congestion and improve air
                    quality. To comply with the AQMP, Brea has adopted an Air
                    Quality Implementation Plan to meet the requirements for local
                    jurisdictions as identified in the regional AQMP.                New
                    development in the City must comply with the Air Quality
                    Implementation Plan.
                    Goals and Policies
                    Inherent in the Land Use and Infrastructure sections of this
                    Chapter is the goal to balance growth with infrastructure and
                    services.     The following goals and policies tie together all
                    development goals under the unifying theme of growth
                    management, and indicate Brea’s commitment to continue to
                    work with other jurisdictions to address regional concerns.

1. INTRODUCTION
          A. COMMUNITY CONTEXT
            L
                     ocated along the 57 Freeway among rolling hills in
                     northeast Orange County (refer to Figure HE-1), Brea
                     started as a small oil town and has grown to a community
          of more than 36,000 people today. Although incorporated in
          1917, the 1950s and 1960s brought an avalanche of housing and
          new businesses into Brea. During this time, the population more
          than doubled every ten years.            Significant population and
          employment growth continued well into the 1970s and 1980s, but
          leveled off in the 1990s as vacant land became increasingly scarce.
          Demographic shifts are occurring in the City. As Brea continues to
          grow, the ethnic composition of the population is changing. In
          1990, more than 77 percent of the Breans were white. The Asian
          and Hispanic shares of the population were 6 percent and 15
          percent, respectively. While no updated census is available,
          enrollment data in the Brea-Olinda Unified School District
          (BOUSD) provides some insight into the racial/ethnic composition
          of Breans. In 1999, about 10 percent of the students in BOUSD
          are Asian and 22 percent are Hispanic. Also, the population is
          aging, with the senior population having increased to more than
          3,000 residents, making up over 9 percent of the population in
          1990. According to the Orange County Register, Brea’s senior
          population is projected to triple by 2020.
          Brea serves as an important retail and industrial center for the
          north Orange County area. It is home to numerous large
          corporations and offers a wide variety of employment
          opportunities. The City’s strong tax base allows the citizens to
          enjoy a high level of public services rarely found in a community of
          similar size.

                                         Chapter 3: Housing Element
The City’s strong employment base, high level of service, highly
rated school system, and quality residential neighborhoods
contribute to its attractiveness as a place to live, resulting in an
ever tightening housing market. Housing costs in Brea continue to
rank among the highest in north Orange County, second only to
Yorba Linda. The median price of a single-family home is
estimated at over $230,000 and rent for a two-bedroom
apartment ranges from $750 to $1,245 per month in 1999.
Brea offers a mix of housing choices. Of the 13,160 units in the
City, 62 percent are single-family homes, 30 percent are multi-
family units, and 7 percent are mobile homes and trailers. The
majority of the housing stock is in good physical condition. There
are, however, a few neighborhoods with visible signs of
deterioration, reflecting in part that many homes are 30 years or
older. The City recognizes that the preservation and improvement
of the existing housing stock is an important issue, and has
adopted a Neighborhood Enhancement Plan which sets forth
policies and programs to specifically address the problem
conditions found in six selected areas.
The majority of the 2,600+ dwelling units remaining to be
developed in Brea will occur in the northern and eastern hillside
areas within the Carbon Canyon and Olinda Ranch Specific Plan
areas. The City will continue to provide opportunities for multi-
family housing development both within Carbon Canyon and on
in-fill sites in the downtown area.          Over the years, the
Redevelopment Agency has assisted in the development of various
in-fill residential projects in downtown. It has also been active in
using its set-aside funds for the preservation, improvement, and
development of affordable housing in other parts of the City.
B. ROLE OF HOUSING
ELEMENT
Brea is faced with various important housing issues: a balance
between employment and housing opportunities; a match
between the supply of and demand for housing; preserving and
enhancing affordability to provide housing for all segments of the
population; preserving the quality of the housing stock; and
providing new types of housing necessary to accommodate the
demographic shifts. This Housing Element provides policies and
programs to address these issues.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
                 3-3

Brea’s Housing Element is a five-year plan extending from 2000-
2005, unlike other General Plan elements which typically cover a
minimum ten-year planning horizon. This Housing Element
identifies strategies and programs that focus on: 1) conserving and
improving existing affordable housing; 2) providing adequate
housing sites; 3) assisting in the development of affordable
housing; 4) removing governmental and other constraints to the
housing development; and 5) promoting equal housing
opportunities.
The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
        An analysis of the City’s demographic and housing
         characteristics and trends (Section 2)
        A summary of the existing and projected housing needs of
         the City’s households (Section 3).
        A review of potential market, governmental, and
         environmental constraints to meeting the City’s identified
         housing needs (Section 4).
        An evaluation of resources available to address Brea’s
         housing goals (Section 5).
        A statement of the Housing Plan to address the City’s
         identified housing needs, including housing goals, policies
         and programs (Section 6).
C. DATA SOURCES
In preparing the Housing Element, various sources of information
are consulted. The 1990 Census provides the basis for population
and household characteristics.        Although dated, the Census
remains the most comprehensive and widely accepted source of
information on demographic characteristics. In addition, 1990
Census data must be used in the Housing Element to ensure
consistency with other Regional, State, and Federal housing plans.
However, several sources of information are used to supplement
and provide reliable updates of the 1990 Census.
        Population and demographic data is updated by the State
         Department of Finance, and 1998 school enrollment
         information from the State Department of Education;

                                           Chapter 3: Housing Element
         Housing market information, such as home sales, rents,
          and vacancies, is updated by City surveys and property tax
          assessor’s files;
         Local and County public and nonprofit agencies are
          consulted for information on special needs populations,
          the services available to them, and gaps in the system;
         Lending patterns for home purchase and home
          improvement loans are provided through the Home
          Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) database; and
         Housing condition information is provided by the City.
D. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Opportunities for residents to recommend strategies, review, and
comment on Brea’s Housing Element are an important component
of the housing element preparation program. Under this program,
the Housing Breans Advisory Board, consisting of volunteer
residents, review and provide input into the programs, strategies,
and policies. The Planning Commission and City Council conduct
a study session upon completion of the housing needs assessment
and prior to formulation of the Element’s policies and programs.
After review of the draft Element by the State Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD), public hearings are
held before the Planning Commission and the City Council.
Notification is published in the local newspaper in advance of
each hearing and copies of the draft Element are made available
for public review at City Hall and public libraries. In addition,
copies of the Element are sent to the Brea Olinda Unified School
District.
In addition to the public participation program described above
which involved the local community, the City also brought
together an outside “Housing Resource Team” for a two-day
workshop program in early 2000. The Resource Team was
comprised of working professionals in housing related fields, and
offered innovative and creative ideas and recommendations to the
City for addressing its housing issues and needs. Among the many
ideas generated, ten were selected as recommendations that
would be most relevant and effective in Brea:
BREA GENERAL PLAN
                 3-5

    1. Explore reuse opportunities on obsolete commercial or
        industrial sites, especially obsolete strip retail centers.
    2. Amend the City’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance.
    3. Explore creation of a local Housing Trust Fund and/or non-
        profit housing corporation.
    4. Seek out opportunities to facilitate the development of
        larger apartment units for low- and moderate-income
        families in mixed-use complexes.
    5. Partner non-profits and affordable housing builders with
        for-profit developers.
    6. Promote mixed-use development where housing is located
        adjacent to jobs, shopping, services, schools, and leisure
        opportunities.
    7. Work with developers/operators to ensure that any senior
        housing and/or assisted living projects are appropriately
        designed and staffed, and offer necessary range of services
        for residents.
    8. Meet some affordable housing demand by allowing extra
        rental unit on single-family lots (e.g. carriage units above
        garages), notwithstanding inclusionary requirements.
    9. Explore more innovative parking solutions (e.g. tandem
        parking, garage lifts, use of driveway apron area, shared
        parking, carports, on-street parking).
    10. Demand creative look at opportunities in hillsides; do not
        simply settle for smaller number of executive-style units.
These top recommendations of the Housing Resource Team are
incorporated into the Housing Plan (Section 6) of the Element. A
written report documenting this innovative process and the
ideas/recommendations generated is attached as an appendix to
the Housing Element.
E. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER
GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The City of Brea General Plan consists of eight elements: 1) Land
Use; 2) Circulation; 3) Housing; 4) Open Space and Conservation
(combined); 5) Park, Recreation and Human Services; 6) Safety; 7)
Noise; and 8) Growth Management. This Housing Element builds
upon the other General Plan elements and is consistent with the
policies and proposals set forth by the Plan. Examples of inter-
element consistency include: residential development capacities
established in the Land Use Element are incorporated within the

2. HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
           T
                   his Needs Assessment section of the Housing Element
                   reviews and evaluates Brea’s demographic, socio-
                   economic, and housing characteristics and trends as a
          basis for determining the nature and extent of the City’s specific
          housing needs.
          A. POPULATION
          CHARACTERISTICS
          The characteristics of a city’s population are important factors
          affecting the housing market in the community. Issues such as
          population growth, age, race/ethnicity, and employment all help
          determine the city’s housing needs.
          1. Population Growth Trends
          Brea grew tremendously prior to 1980. Many new housing
          developments and businesses located in the City between the
          1940s and 1960s.          The 1970s was a period of intensive
          development marked by the opening of the Orange (SR-57)
          Freeway and the construction of Brea Mall, a regional shopping
          center. Brea’s growth in the post-1970s period has been relatively
          moderate. Between 1980 and 1990, the population grew by 18
          percent, from 27,910 to 32,873. This growth was 7 percentage
          points lower than the countywide population increase of 25
          percent. Table HE-1 and Figure HE-2 compare population
          changes in the 1980s and 1990s for Brea, the nearby cities, and
          the County. Brea’s population growth in the 1980s was identical
          to that of Placentia, but higher than that of Fullerton and La Habra.
          Like other north Orange County cities, the increase in Brea’s
          population was well below that experienced by Yorba Linda, the
          city with the highest growth percentage in north Orange County.
          As of January 1999, the City had an estimated population of
          36,388 (State Department of Finance), representing an increase of
          nearly 11 percent from 1990. Countywide, the population grew
          by 15 percent during the nine-year period. Among the five cities,
          the (percentage) increase in Brea’s population is the second lowest
          in the 1990s. This implies that the City‘s population size has been

                                        rather stable, especially when compared to Placentia and Yorba
                                        Linda which have experienced relatively high population growth in
                                        the 1990s.

2. Age Characteristics
Age is an important influence on housing demand because people
of different age groups have different housing needs. Traditionally,
the assumption has been that young adults (20 to 34 years old)
prefer apartments, low- to moderate-cost condominiums, and
smaller single-family units. Adults between 35 and 65 years old
provide the major market for moderate- to high-end apartments,
condominiums, and single-family homes. This segment of the
population is more likely to have higher incomes and larger
household sizes. The senior population (65 years and older) tends
to demand low- to moderate-cost apartments and condominiums,
group quarters, and mobile homes.
In 1990, the median age in the City was 33.5 years, 2.1 years
higher than the County median of 31.4 years. Between 1980 and
1990, the share of Brea’s population aged between 20 and 34
years old remained virtually unchanged at 27 percent. Adults
between the ages of 35 and 64 made up a slightly higher
proportion of the population in 1990 than in 1980. The senior
population also grew: the share of the population aged 65 years
and above increased by 3 percentage points during the ten-year
period. More telling though is that the senior population increased
by 73 percent, from 1,763 in 1980 to 3,052 in 1990. This
indicates that special attention must be paid to the housing and
supportive services needs of senior residents. Table HE-2 and
Figure HE-3 show the age distributions of Brea’s population in
1980 and 1990.

              School enrollment in the Brea Olinda Unified School District
              increased in the 1990s, according to the California State
              Department of Education. Between 1992 and 1997, the total
              number of students enrolled in kindergarten to twelfth grade grew
              by about 13 percent, from 5,262 to 5,965. There was an increase
              in enrollment for all grades, with the greatest percentage growth in
              grade 6. An increase in enrollment over the years indicates that
              the school age population has grown steadily.
              3. Race and Ethnicity
              The nature and extent of a community’s housing needs is, to a
              large extent, determined by the racial/ethnic composition of its
              population.    The size and type of housing preferred, the
              neighborhood desired, and the ability to purchase or rent housing
              often vary by a person or household’s racial or ethnic background.
              Table HE-3 compares the racial/ethnic composition of Brea’s
              population in 1990 with that of the County’s.

              Brea’s population is predominantly white. As shown above, whites
              made up 77 percent of the City’s population in 1990, comparing
              to 65 percent for the County. The Asian and Hispanic shares of
              the population were 6 percent and 15 percent, respectively.
              These figures are lower than those for the County; Asians and
              Hispanics together make up about a third of the County’s
              population.

                    4. Employment
                    According to the 1990 Census, 19,628 Breans were in the labor
                    force. (The labor force includes employed and unemployed
                    persons aged 16 years and above.) This represents a labor force
                    participation rate of 75 percent. As shown in Table HE-4, most of
                    the residents were employed in two occupational categories:
                    managerial and professional specialty (37 percent) and sales,
                    technical, and administrative support (36 percent).             The
                    unemployment rate was 3.3 percent. According to the State
                    Employment Development Department, Brea’s unemployment
                    rate in 1999 was very low at 1.8 percent, nearly 1 percentage
                    point lower than the countywide rate.

                    Considering the relatively small population of the City, Brea had a
                    large employment base in 1990. The City’s employment base of
                    31,519 jobs was only slightly lower than its population of 32,873
                    (SCAG). Major employers in Brea include Bank of America,
                    American Funds Service Company, American Suzuki Motor
                    Corporation, Beckman Instruments, Ericsson Communications, and
                    Avery Dennison. Data from SCAG show that the number of jobs
                    has actually decreased in the 1990s; the projected figure for the
                    year 2000 is 25,098. However, Brea’s employment base is
                    projected to increase dramatically (by 18,986 jobs) between 2000
                    and 2020. Should the predicted increase in jobs be realized, there
                    will very likely be an accompanying increase in the demand for
                    housing in the City. Thus, job growth is certainly a possible major
                    stimulus to housing demand in the near future.

A general measure of the balance of a community’s employment
opportunities with the needs of its residents is through a “jobs-
housing ratio” test. A balanced community would have a match
between employment and housing opportunities so that most of
the residents can also work in the community. SCAG data show
that there were 22,015 jobs and 12,527 occupied housing units in
Brea in 1994. These figures translate to a jobs-housing ratio of
1.76, which is higher than the County’s ratio of 1.45 and indicates
that the City’s employment base is high relative to the size of its
occupied housing stock. Table HE-6 compares Brea’s jobs-housing
ratio against that of the nearby cities and the County. As shown
below, Brea has the highest jobs-housing ratio among cities in
northeast Orange County.

B. HOUSEHOLD
CHARACTERISTICS
The characteristics of households provide important information
about the housing needs in a community.                   Income and
affordability are best measured and examined at the household
level, as are the special needs of certain groups, such as large-
family households or female-headed households.
1. Household Composition and Size
The Census defines a "household" as all persons who occupy a
housing unit, which may include single persons living alone,
families related through marriage or blood, or unrelated persons
sharing living quarters. Persons living in retirement or convalescent
homes, dormitories, or other group living situations are not

considered households. Household characteristics are important
indicators of the type and size of housing needed in a city.
According to the 1990 Census, about 70 percent of the 12,224
households in the City were families. This proportion is almost
identical to that of Orange County as a whole, where 71 percent
of all households consisted of families. Single-person households
comprised 22 percent of all households in the City, while 8
percent of households made up of unrelated persons living
together (“other”).     Figure HE-4 shows the composition of
households in Brea in 1990.

Household size is defined as the number of persons living in a
housing unit. A noticeable change in the average household size
over time reflects a change in the household composition of a
community. For example, a city's average household size will
increase over time if there is a trend towards larger families. In a
community with a growing number of elderly households, the
average household size will usually decline.
Between 1980 and 1990, the average household size in Brea
decreased from 2.81 to 2.68 persons per household. This decline,
however, did not continue in the 1990s. According to the State
Department of Finance, the estimated household size in 1999 is
2.85 persons. This figure is lower than the estimates for nearby
cities and Orange County as a whole. Table HE-6 compares the
average household size of Brea, its neighbors, and the County.

2. Overcrowding
Overcrowding is a problem of misfit between a household and the
housing unit. The State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) defines overcrowding as more than one
person per room, excluding bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, and
porches. Overcrowding occurs primarily because households
“double-up” to afford high rents and because of a lack of available
housing units of adequate size to accommodate a growing number
of families with larger numbers of children.
According to the 1990 Census, 629 or 5 percent of all households
in the City were living in overcrowded conditions. The incidence
of overcrowding is much lower in Brea than in the County (11
percent) and reflective of the City’s smaller household size. As was
(and is) the case in most cities, overcrowding among renter-
households in Brea was more prevalent than among owner-
households. Only 2.4 percent of the owner-households were
overcrowded, comparing to nearly 10 percent of renter-
households. Lower income households have an overcrowding rate
of 9 percent. Of the 265 lower income households living in
overcrowding conditions, 238 are renters and 27 are owners.
The City has made an effort to address overcrowding in Brea.
Subsequent to 1990, the Redevelopment Agency acquired and
rehabilitated 51 deteriorated apartment units previously occupied
by a total of 300 persons. Of these residents, 23 households
remained in the project after rehabilitation and 15 purchased
homes using relocation assistance provided through the Agency.
The remaining households relocated to non-overcrowded units
elsewhere.

3. Household Income and Income
Distribution
Income is a major factor influencing the demand for housing and
to a large extent, reflects the affordability of housing in a
community. According to the Census, the median household
income in Brea was $51,253 in 1989, about 12 percent higher
than the County median of $45,922. Figure HE-5 shows median
household income of Brea in comparison to the nearby cities and
the County.

The State Department of Housing and Community Development
has developed the following income categories based on the
Median Family Income (MFI) of a Metropolitan Statistical Area
(MSA):
         Very Low Income: 50 percent or less of the area MFI;
         Low Income: between 51 and 80 percent of the area MFI;
         Moderate Income: between 81 and 120 percent of the
          area MFI;
         Upper Income: greater than 120 percent of the area MFI.
The 1989 MFI of $46,900 for the Anaheim-Santa Ana MSA was
used to interpolate the City’s income distribution from the Census
according to the above income categories. Table HE-7 shows the

                    The percentage of Brean households in the very low- and low
                    income groups is slightly lower than that of households
                    countywide. About 35 percent of the households in the City have
                    very low or low incomes comparing to nearly 40 percent of the
                    households in Orange County. Brea is predominantly a moderate
                    and upper income community, with nearly two-thirds of its
                    households in these income ranges. Figure HE-6 compares Brea’s
                    household composition by income group with that of the County.

                    Overpayment
                    Affordability measures the burden of monthly housing
                    expenditures in relation to the residents’ incomes. State and
                    federal standards state that a household overpays for housing if it
                    spends 30 percent or more of its gross income on housing. Table
                    HE-9 provides a profile of housing overpayment by household
                    type and tenure.

                      According to the Census, 32 percent (approximately 3,910) of the
                      12,224 households in Brea were spending 30 percent or more of
                      their income on housing in 1990. Of these cost-burdened
                      households, 47 percent were renters and 53 percent were owners.
                      Overpayment varies widely by income, household type and size.
                      Lower income (less than 80 percent of area MFI) households have
                      an overpayment rate of 68 percent. Of the 1,940 lower income
                      households overpaying, 1,328 are renters and 612 are owners.
                      Like many cities in Southern California, the level of overpayment
                      for senior renter households in Brea is high (70 percent), as
                      exhibited in Table HE-9. Overpayment is also severe for large
                      lower income households, with three-quarters of such households
                      being cost-burdened.
                      Figure HE-7 shows housing overpayment statistics by tenure and
                      income. Very low-income renters (less than 51 percent of area
                      MFI) had a very high incidence of overpayment. Of the 977 renter
                      households in this income category, 838 or 86 percent spent 30
                      percent or more of their income on housing. Overpayment is also
                      severe for low-income households, for whom the rate of
                      overpaying is 74 percent.

                                Certain segments of the population may have particular difficulties
                                in finding decent, affordable housing because of their special
                                needs and circumstances. These special needs groups, as defined
                                by State housing element law, include the elderly, disabled
                                persons,      large    households,      female-headed       households,
                                farmworkers, and the homeless. Table HE-10 summarizes the
                                numbers of households or persons in each of these special needs
                                groups in the City.

Elderly Persons                 Most elderly households have special needs because of their
                                relatively low, fixed incomes, physical disabilities/limitations, and
                                dependency needs. Specifically, people aged 65 years and older
                                have four main concerns:
                                        Housing: Many seniors live alone and tend to be renters.
                                        Income: People aged 65 and over are usually retired and
                                         living on a limited income.
                                        Health care: Seniors are more likely to be in ill-health and
                                         require hospital visits or stays.
                                        Transportation: Many of the elderly rely on public
                                         transportation. A significant number of seniors with
                                         disabilities who require alternative transportation (e.g.
                                         Handivan).

As shown in Table HE-10, about 15 percent of households in Brea
were headed by elderly persons aged 65 and above in 1990. Of
the 1,879 elderly households, 890 (47 percent) were elderly
persons living alone. Elderly persons who live alone may have
special needs for assistance with finance, home maintenance and
repairs, and other routine activities. This is especially true of
persons aged 75 years and older who are more likely to be the
“frail elderly.” Of the 2,889 persons aged 65 and above, about 6
percent lived below the poverty level.
According to the Brea Senior Policy/Issues Task Force, the City has
a housing stock of 957 units for seniors as of 1998. This stock
consists of 504 apartments (both at and below market rates), 429
mobile home units, and 24 units in residential care homes. Senior
housing developments include Alterra Winwood Residential
Manor (formerly Springhouse), Brea Woods, BREAL, Darnan
Senior Apartments, Heritage Plaza, and Orange Villa. The Task
Force states that more assisted living facilities are needed to meet
the housing and supportive services needs of the City’s growing
senior population. At the present time, there is only one such
facility in the City. Opened in 1995, Alterra Winwood has 98
units and provides the supportive services many seniors need,
including meals, housekeeping, laundry services, and
transportation. The City has a new senior apartment complex,
Vintage Canyon, a 105-unit development which opened in 1999.
Vintage Canyon offers many services to more active seniors with
rental rates affordable to very low-income seniors.
The Brea Redevelopment Agency administers the Senior Subsidy
Program to assist very low-income seniors with their housing
expenditure. Began in 1989, the program currently provides 125
senior Breans with $163 per month in rent subsidy. Participating
seniors are allowed to use the subsidy towards rent at the dwelling
of their choice.
The City has a Senior Center which serves as a meeting place and
service center for seniors. Services or programs provided by the
Center include a noon-time nutrition (lunch) program, bus service
to the Center, health counseling, homemaker services, and
recreation, education, and cultural activities. The City also has a
“Meals on Wheels” program through which meals are delivered to
senior residents with physical disabilities or limitations. A senior
day care program for seniors requiring day time supervision has
been created and is operated by Easter Seals.

Disabled Persons                Physical and mental disabilities can hinder access to traditionally
                                designed housing units (and other facilities) as well as potentially
                                limit the ability to earn income. As shown in Table HE-10, 10.2
                                percent of Brea’s population aged 16 years and over were disabled
                                in 1990. Disabled persons include those with (1) work disabilities,
                                (2) mobility/self-care limitations, or (3) both work disabilities and
                                mobility/self-care limitations. Of the 2,662 disabled residents in
                                Brea, 998 or 37 percent were 65 years or older. This is further
                                supporting evidence that the City needs to develop or assist in the
                                development of more assisted living facilities for senior residents.

                                Most lower income disabled persons are likely to require housing
                                assistance. Their housing need is further compounded by design
                                and location requirements which can often be costly. For
                                example, special needs of households with wheelchair-bound or
                                semi-ambulatory individuals may require ramps, holding bars,
                                special bathroom designs, wider doorways, lower cabinets, and
                                other interior and exterior design features.
                                Housing opportunities for individuals with disabilities can be
                                addressed through the provision of affordable, barrier-free housing.
                                Currently, housing units that are accessible to the disabled are
                                limited in supply. In addition to the development of new units,
                                rehabilitation assistance can also be provided to disabled renters
                                and homeowners to modify existing units to improve accessibility.
                                In addition, accessible housing can be provided through senior
                                housing developments.
                 Large          Large households are defined as those with five or more members.
                                The size of these households create special needs in that many
       Households               cities lack adequately-size, affordable housing units for larger
                                households. Large households, consisting mostly of families with a
                                few children, often live in overcrowded conditions because of their
                                lower incomes and the limited supply of large, affordable dwelling
                                units.

                                                3-23

               According to the Census, there were 1,289 large households in
               Brea in 1990, of which 367 or 29 percent were renters. Over
               three-quarters of these large renter-households had housing
               problems which include overpayment, overcrowding, or living in
               sub-standard housing conditions.
               Through its Community Center, the City provides youth and family
               services to meet the needs and concerns of families. Services
               include: parenting classes, counseling, tutoring for teens, youth
               employment, consumer education seminars, health screening,
               citizenship classes, information and referrals.
Female-headed  Single-parent households often require special consideration and
               assistance as a result of their greater need for affordable housing
   Households  and accessible day care, health care, and other supportive services.
               Female-headed households with children, in particular, tend to
               have lower incomes than other types of households. Because of
               their relatively low income, such households often have limited
               housing options and restricted access to supportive services.
               According to the 1990 Census, there were 945 female-headed
               family households in the City, 433 (46 percent) of which had
               children under the age of 18. Female-headed families with
               children constituted about 3 percent of the City’s households.
               Approximately 6 percent of the female-headed families were living
               below the poverty level in 1990. It is also important to point out
               that a total of 1,505 female householders were living alone; many
               of them are likely to be seniors.
  Farmworkers  Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary
               incomes are earned through seasonal agricultural labor. They have
               special housing needs because of their relatively low income and
               the unstable nature of their job (having to move throughout the
               year from one harvest to the next). There were approximately 190
               Brea residents employed in farming, forestry, and fishing
               occupations in 1990. These individuals accounted for only 1
               percent of the City’s total employed residents.
  Day Laborers The City operates a Job Center where day laborers may be hired
               by potential employers.        Approximately 125 individuals are
               registered at the Center, with between 40 and 50 laborers
               available for hire daily to perform a variety of work, including
               plumbing, landscaping, homemaking, painting and so forth. All of
               these registered laborers are Brea residents and the majority of
               them originated from Mexico. According to the Community
               Services Department, two of the laborers are homeless, but
               currently receive emergency assistance from the City.

                                                                            Chapter 3: Housing Element
             Homeless          In 1990, 5 homeless persons were staying in emergency shelters in
                               Brea, according to the Census. This is possibly an undercount. (It
                Persons        has been widely acknowledged that the methodology used in the
                               Census to count or estimate the number of homeless was
                               ineffective, thereby resulting in substantial undercounting of the
                               homeless population.) The City Community Services Department
                               provides homeless individuals and families with emergency
                               assistance, including meal vouchers, transportation assistance, and
                               referrals to social service agencies. According to the Department,
                               103 persons were assisted with emergency assistance in 1999, of
                               which 50 received vouchers for lodging or rental assistance which
                               enabled some residents to remain in their homes. The majority of
                               those assisted were Caucasians between the ages of 30 to 45 years
                               of age. Funding for the emergency assistance program originate
                               from the City and three non-profit organizations: Active Christians
                               Today, Brea Community Emergency Council and the Salvation
                               Army.
                               There is currently a shelter for women and children in Brea.
                               Operated by a Christian organization, this facility called the
                               “Sheepfold” is located in a residential area in the central portion of
                               the City. In addition, the City’s Family Resource Center serves as
                               an out-station for the Salvation Army. Table HE-12 lists the major
                               homeless shelters and facilities in north Orange County. Aside
                               from the facilities listed, the Community Services Department also
                               refers homeless persons and families to the following shelters and

                                 This section addresses various housing characteristics and
                                 conditions that affect the well-being of Brea residents. Housing
                                 factors analyzed include the following: housing stock and growth,
                                 tenure and vacancy rates, age and condition, and housing costs
                                 and affordability.
                                 1. Housing Growth
                                 Between 1980 and 1990, Brea’s housing stock increased
                                 moderately (by nearly 13 percent), from 11,203 to 12,648 units.

                           In contrast, the County’s housing stock grew by 21 percent. Table
                           HE-13 compares housing growth in Brea and selected cities in
                           north Orange County. The growth in Brea’s housing stock in the
                           1980s is higher than that in Fullerton and La Habra, but
                           significantly lower than that in Yorba Linda. Placentia, which
                           experienced the same population growth (18 percent) as Brea in
                           the 1980s, had a greater percentage increase in its housing stock
                           than Brea.

                           In the 1990s, Brea’s housing growth is again greater than that in
                           Fullerton and La Habra, but much lower than that in Placentia and
                           Yorba Linda. The Redevelopment Agency played a key role in
                           increasing the supply of housing in the City during this period. The
                           majority of housing developed in the 1990s received some form of
                           assistance from the Agency. Figure HE-8 compares housing growth
                           in the 1980s and 1990s for Brea, the nearby cities, and the
                           County.

                       2. HOUSING TYPE AND
                       TENURE
                       Table HE-14 provides a breakdown of the housing stock in Brea by
                       unit type in 1990 and 1999. The composition of the housing stock
                       in 1999 is essentially the same as that nine years ago. As was the
                       case in 1990, single-family homes are the predominant housing
                       type in 1999. Single-family homes make up 63 percent of the
                       stock in 1999, while the multi-family share is 31 percent and
                       mobilehomes comprise the remaining 7 percent. Specifically, 90
                       percent of the single-family homes are detached. The multi-family
                       share of Brea’s housing stock is relatively high in comparison to the
                       nearby cities of Placentia and Yorba Linda, where the vast majority
                       of housing is single-family homes and where apartments are
                       limited in supply.

In terms of tenure, nearly two-thirds of the units were owner-
occupied in 1990, while about one third were renter-occupied.
Given that the housing stock composition has not changed much
since 1980, it is likely that the majority of the housing units in Brea
is still predominantly owner-occupied. The City’s overall vacancy
rate was 3.4 percent in 1990. Specifically, the vacancy rates for
ownership and rental units were 0.8 percent and 5 percent,
respectively. While this reflects a healthy vacancy rate for rentals,
the low ownership vacancy rate indicates a tight for-sale housing
market.
3. Age and Condition of Housing
Stock
The age of housing is commonly used as a measure of when
housing may begin to require repairs. Figure HE-9 shows the age
distribution of the housing stock in Brea. In general, housing units
over 30 years old are likely to have rehabilitation needs, including
new roofing, foundation work, new plumbing, and so on.
Approximately one-third of the housing stock in the City is 30
years or older (built before 1970), reflecting the Brea’s tremendous
growth in the 1960s and indicating that some homes are likely to
be in need of rehabilitation. The dramatic slowdown in housing
production is also reflected in Figure HE-9; units 9 years old or
younger (constructed since 1990) account for only about 4 percent
of Brea’s housing stock.

The majority of Brea’s housing stock is in good condition.
However, like most cities, the City does have a number of areas
that are showing early signs of deterioration. To address these
conditions, the City prepared a Neighborhood Enhancement Plan
in 1998. This plan identifies six “Focus Neighborhoods” with signs
of physical deterioration and other related problems (refer to
Figure HE-10). Specifically, these neighborhoods exhibit the
following problem conditions: deferred maintenance, dilapidation
(such as peeling paint, wood rot, worn roofs), cracked asphalt
driveways, and building code violations such as illegal garage
conversions. Table HE-15 summarizes the characteristics and
physical problem conditions of the six neighborhoods.
Neighborhoods where physical problem conditions are most
severe (neighborhoods 2, 3, and 4) share two common
characteristics: many of the households are renters and over 10
percent of the households are overcrowded (Table HE-15). To
address the physical problems (as well as the economic and social
conditions) found in the focus neighborhoods, new programs are
proposed, including (but not limited to): assistance to non-profit
organizations for the purchase and rehabilitation of multi-family
units, an apartment inspection program, and a rehabilitation loan
program for single- and multi-family properties in the focus
neighborhoods. These programs are designed to build upon and
complement the City’s existing housing programs, including: the
Deferred Payment Loans and Low Interest Loans for rehabilitating
owner-occupied housing; Investor-Owner Loans for rehabilitating
rental units; and Grants for rehabilitating mobilehomes.

Housing Prices According to the 1990 Census, the median value of a housing unit
               in Brea was $264,000, about 4 percent higher than the County
               median of $252,700. More recent data from the California
               Association of Realtors (CAR) indicate that Brea has the second
               highest (behind Yorba Linda) median home price among the five
               cities in north Orange County, as shown in Figure HE-11.
               According to CAR, the median sales price of a home in Brea in the
               first quarter of 1999 was $235,000.

               Detailed housing market sales data for Brea are provided in Tables
               HE-16 and HE-17. The median sale prices of single-family homes
               and multi-family units are $231,750 and $113,500, respectively.
               The sales volume of single-family homes is fairly high between
               June 1998 and May 1999. Specifically, single-family homes with
               three to four bedrooms have been the most popular with home
               buyers: 325 or 79 percent of the 410 homes sold have three to
               four bedrooms. The multi-family housing market has not been
               particularly active, with only 38 sales between June 1998 and May
               1999. Of the multi-family units sold, 22 or 58 percent have two
               bedrooms. Only five three-bedroom units were sold, likely
               indicating that these units are limited in supply.

Housing Rental                 The 1990 median contract rent for a housing unit in the City was
                               $701, about 4 percent lower than the County median of $728.
                 Rates         Comparing to the nearby cities, Brea’s median rent was the
                               “median”: it was higher than rents in Fullerton and La Habra, but
                               lower than those in Placentia and Yorba Linda.
                               Table HE-18 is a comparison of current rental rates in Brea,
                               Fullerton, and Placentia. Apartment rents in Brea are slightly
                               higher than those in Fullerton and Placentia. In Brea, rents range
                               from $650 to $895 for a one-bedroom apartment and from $750
                               to $1,245 for a two-bedroom apartment. There appears to be a
                               shortage of three-bedroom apartments in the City, given the
                               limited availability of such units listed for rent. There are three-
                               bedroom condominiums or townhomes available for rent, but
                               these units are rather limited in supply and costly to rent.

Housing Costs               Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of
                            renting or owning a home in Brea with the maximum affordable
                and         housing costs to households of different income levels. Taken
 Affordability              together, this information can reveal who can afford what size and
                            type of housing as well as indicate the type of households that
                            would likely experience overcrowding or overpayment.
                            The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development
                            (HUD) conducts annual household income surveys for
                            metropolitan areas across the country, including Orange County.
                            These income surveys are adjusted for differences in the type and
                            size of a family. HUD uses these income levels to determine the
                            maximum amount that a household could pay for housing and
                            their eligibility for federal housing assistance. According to HUD,
                            the 1999 Area Median Family Income (MFI) for a four-person
                            household in Orange County is $68,300.
                            Tables HE-19 and HE-20 below provide the annual income for
                            very low, low, and moderate-income households by the maximum
                            affordable housing payment based on the federal standard of 30
                            percent of gross household income. Standard housing costs for
                            utilities, taxes, and property insurance are also shown. From these
                            income and housing cost information, the maximum affordable
                            home prices and rents are determined.

                                  $79,300, the household cannot find an affordable home of
                                  sufficient size in Brea. In terms of the rental market, there are two-
                                  bedroom apartments affordable to very low-income households
                                  with monthly rents below $800. However, the supply of these
                                  units is extremely limited. Market rents in newer apartment
                                  complexes are well above levels affordable to very low-income
                                  households, indicating a need to provide some form of subsidy or
                                  affordable housing incentives to bring rents down to affordable
                                  levels.

                                            Chapter 3: Housing Element
The best homeownership option for low-income (51 to 80 percent
of MFI) households is a two-bedroom condominium. However,
this type of unit appears to be limited in supply: only 22 two-
bedroom multi-family homes or condominiums were sold between
June 1998 and May 1999. With an affordable monthly payment
of $1,145, a low-income household should be able to rent a two-
bedroom apartment or condominium in Brea. There are very few
three-bedroom apartments in the City and those available are most
likely to be too high-priced for low-income households. And while
three-bedroom condominiums are in greater supply, rent levels are
beyond the level of affordability of low-income households.
A moderate-income (81 to 120 percent of MFI) household should
be able to afford to purchase a home of adequate size in Brea.
With a maximum affordable home price at $259,400, moderate-
income households can afford the median-priced three-bedroom
single-family home as well as any condominium in the City.
However, the required downpayment and/or closing costs can be
obstacles to home purchase for moderate-income households. In
terms of rental options, moderate-income households can afford
the full range of rental units available in Brea.
5. Assisted Housing At Risk of
Conversion
State law requires the Housing Element to identify, analyze and
propose programs to preserve housing units that are currently
restricted to low-income housing use and will become unrestricted
and possibly lost as low-income housing. Based on a review of
federal and State subsidized housing inventories, there are
currently no “Assisted Housing Projects” in Brea, as defined by
State Government Code Section 65583(a)(8). There are, however,
City-assisted multi-family rental housing in Brea. As illustrated by
Table HE-21, the Redevelopment Agency has played an active role
in the provision of affordable housing. The Agency has subsidized
a total of nine multi-family rental projects, providing 107 very low-
income, 86 low-income, and 94 moderate-income units. These
developments have relatively long affordability periods and none is
at risk of conversion to market rate for the next ten years.

3. SUMMARY OF HOUSING NEEDS
         T       his section of the Housing Element is a summary of the
                 major housing need categories in terms of the various
                 income groups as defined by Federal and State law. It
         includes the City’s share of regional housing need as provided by
         the Southern California Association of Governments’ (SCAG)
         Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA). As summarized in
         Table HE-22, the areas of greatest housing assistance need in Brea
         include the following:
         1. Households Overpaying for
         Housing
         About 31 percent of all households in Brea spent 30 percent or
         more of their income on housing. Of these 3,822 households, 47
         percent (1,796) were renters and 53 percent (2,026) were owners.
         Very low-income households experienced a very high incidence of
         overpayment: 86 percent of these households overpaid for their
         housing.       About 160 large renter-families and 423 elderly
         households overpaid for housing in 1990.
         2. Special Needs Groups
         Certain segments of the population may experience more
         difficulties finding decent, affordable housing because of their
         special needs and circumstances. The Housing Needs Assessment
         documents the following special needs groups:
                  1,879 households headed by elderly persons, 47 percent
                   of which were elderly persons living alone;
                  2,662 persons aged 16 and above with physical disabilities,
                   of which 998 (or 37 percent) were 65 years or older;
                  945 female-headed households, 46 percent of which had
                   children (under 18 years old). Approximately 6 percent of
                   female-headed households were living below the poverty
                   level;
                  1,289 large (5 or more members) households, comprising
                   11 percent of Brean households;
                  About 103 persons received emergency assistance from
                   the City’s Community Services Department in 1999.

                          3-39

3. Age and Condition of Housing
Stock
As of 1999, about 36 percent of the housing stock in Brea is 30
years or older, when most housing units typically begin to have
repair and/or rehabilitation needs.
A number of neighborhoods are showing signs of deterioration.
Six “Focus Neighborhoods” with signs of physical deterioration and
other related problems have been identified by the City and are
the focus of Brea’s Neighborhood Enhancement Program.
Specifically, these neighborhoods exhibit the following problem
conditions: deferred maintenance, dilapidation (such as peeling
paint, wood rot, worn roofs), cracked asphalt driveways, and
building code violations such as illegal garage conversions.
4. Housing Costs and Affordability
Recent sales data indicate that the median sale prices of single-
family homes and condominiums in Brea are $231,750 and
$113,500, respectively. Given these relatively high prices, very
low- and low-income households have very few home ownership
opportunities in the City. Moderate-income households have a
better chance of purchasing adequately-sized homes: they can
afford a three-bedroom single-family home or condominium.
In terms of rentals, there are two- to three-bedroom apartments
affordable to very low- and low-income households. However,
the supply of these units is limited, while the demand for them is
very high. A moderate-income household is able to rent the
largest unit available on the market: a three-bedroom
condominium. It should be noted, however, that these units are
rather scarce.
5. Overcrowded Households
About 5 percent (629) of the total households lived in
overcrowded conditions (more than 1.01 persons per room). Like
most cities, overcrowding among renter-households in Brea was
more prevalent than among owner-households. Only 2.4 percent
(189) of the owner-households were overcrowded, comparing to
nearly 10 percent (440) of renter-occupied households.

                      6. Regional Housing Needs
                      Assessment (RHNA)
                      Regional growth needs are defined as the number of units that
                      would have to be added in each jurisdiction to accommodate the
                      forecasted growth in the number of households by different
                      income categories between January 1, 1998 and June 30, 2005, as
                      well as the number of units that would have to be compensated
                      for anticipated demolitions and changes to achieve an “ideal”
                      vacancy rate. SCAG recently released the RHNA figures for the
                      1998-2005 period. The RHNA for Brea for this period is 1,053
                      additional dwelling units. This total growth need is allocated to
                      four income categories: very low-income, low-income, moderate-
                      income, and upper-income. Table HE-22 shows the household
                      growth divided into the various income categories.

4. HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
         T
                 he provision of adequate and affordable housing is
                 constrained by a number of factors. This section assesses
                 the various market, governmental, and environmental
         factors that may serve as a potential constraint to housing
         development and improvement in Brea.
         A. MARKET CONSTRAINTS
         1. Construction Costs
         The cost of building materials is a major cost associated with
         constructing a new housing unit. In the current Southern
         California real estate market, the cost of building materials is the
         single factor having the most impact on the cost of building a new
         house. These costs are estimated to account for 40 to 50 percent
         of the sales prices of a new home. Typical residential construction
         costs range from approximately $60 to $80 per square foot for a
         single-family home and from $40 to $75 per square foot for multi-
         family construction. According to the 1999 Orange County
         Affordable Housing Strategy, residential construction costs have
         increased dramatically over the last decade “to the point where a
         typical two-bedroom apartment costs around $150,000 to
         develop” (p. 58).
         A reduction in amenities and the quality of building materials
         (above a minimum acceptability for health, safety, and adequate
         performance) could result in lower sales prices. In addition,
         prefabricated factory-built housing may provide for lower priced
         housing by reducing construction and labor costs. Another factor
         related to construction costs is the number of units built at one
         time. As the number increases, overall costs generally decrease as
         builders are able to take advantage of the benefits of economies of
         scale. This type of cost reduction is of particular benefit when
         density bonuses are used for the provision of affordable housing.
         2. Land Costs
         A key component of the total cost of housing is the price of raw
         land and any necessary improvements. The diminishing supply of
         land available for residential construction combined with a fairly

high demand for such development has served to keep the cost of
land relatively high, particularly in Orange County cities. High and
rapidly increasing land costs in the County have resulted in
homebuilders developing more and more high-priced homes in
order to preserve profits, according to the County’s Housing
Strategy. In Brea, residential land costs vary from $11 to $17 per
square foot, depending on the location, zoning, and size of the
property.
3. Availability of Mortgage and
Rehabilitation Financing
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or
improve a home. Interest rates are determined by national
policies and economic conditions, and local governments can do
little to affect these rates. Jurisdictions can, however, offer interest
rate write-downs to extend home purchasing opportunities to a
broader economic segment of the population. In addition,
government insured loan programs may be available to reduce
mortgage downpayment requirements.
Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending
institutions are required to disclose information on the disposition
of loan applications and the income, gender, and race of loan
applicants. As shown in Table HE-23, of the 789 applications for
conventional mortgage loans to purchase homes in Brea in 1997,
about 70 percent were originated (approved by lenders and
accepted by applicants). The overall denial rate was 14 percent,
while 16 percent of the applications were withdrawn, closed for
incompleteness, or not accepted by the applicants. As expected,
the denial rate for low-income applicants was the highest among
the three income groups at 23 percent. However, it is interesting
to note that 20 percent of applicants for conventional mortgages in
Brea were low-income. This likely reflects the fact that the City
operates a first-time homebuyer program, which provides silent
second mortgages (considered “conventional” loans) to low- and
moderate-income households.

                                    Brea has a relatively small pool of government-assisted loans, such
                                    as FHA, VA and FmHA, given the sales price limits under these
                                    programs. Among the 61 applications for government-assisted
                                    loans, the denial rate for low-income applicant households was
                                    also higher than that for moderate- and upper income applicants.
                                    However, it should be noted that low-income households have a
                                    much better chance of getting a government-assisted loan than a
                                    conventional loan. Over 70 percent of the applications for
                                    government-assisted loans by low-income households were
                                    originated, comparing to just 55 percent for conventional loans.
                                    Table HE-24 shows the disposition of conventional and
                                    government-assisted home improvement loans. Compared to
                                    mortgage loans, home improvement loans were much more
                                    difficult to secure, as is typical in most jurisdictions. The overall
                                    approval rates for conventional and government-assisted home
                                    improvement loans were very low: only 50 percent and 33
                                    percent, respectively. Even for government-assisted loans, the
                                    denial rate for low-income applicants was extremely high (70
                                    percent). The relatively high denial rates for low- and moderate-
                                    income households support the importance of City sponsored
                                    rehabilitation assistance for these households. Increasing the
                                    availability of financing sources for households to improve or
                                    rehabilitate their homes is important to improving the overall
                                    quality of housing in Brea.

                                    CONSTRAINTS
                                    Aside from market factors, actions by the City can have an impact
                                    on the price and availability of housing. Land use controls, site
                                    improvement requirements, building codes, fees, and other local
                                    programs intended to improve the overall quality of housing may
                                    serve as potential constraints to the development and
                                    improvement of housing.
                                    1. Land Use Controls
                                    The Land Use Element of the General Plan sets forth the City’s
                                    policies for guiding local development and growth. These policies,
                                    together with existing zoning regulations, establish the amount and
                                    distribution of land uses within the City. The General Plan
                                    provides for five residential land use categories, as shown in Table
                                    HE-25.

                                    In addition to the base zone districts identified above, the City has
                                    adopted several specific plans for areas requiring focused planning
                                    efforts, including Olinda Ranch, Carbon Canyon, Towne Plaza,
                                    and Birch Hills. (Additionally, the proposed Tomlinson specific
                                    plan is currently under consideration.) Each of these specific plans
                                    has its own unique zoning districts and set of development
                                    standards tailored to guide development in that particular area.
                                    These specific plans fall within the overall development framework
                                    defined by the Land Use Element.
                   Growth           In response to the passage of Measure M in 1990, the City
                                    adopted a Growth Management Element as part of its General
          Management
                                    Plan. The Element aims to ensure that growth and development
                                    are balanced with the City’s ability to provide an adequate
                                    circulation system pursuant to the requirements of the Revise
                                    Traffic Improvement and Growth Management Ordinance, also
                                    known as Measure M. The Element does not serve as a constraint
                                    to housing development. Unlike growth control measures enacted
                                    by some jurisdictions, Brea’s Growth Management Element does
                                    not limit housing growth to an established maximum level.

2. Residential Development Standards
Brea’s Zoning Ordinance provides for the following residential
zones:
        Single Family Residential - Hillside (R1-H)
        Hillside Residential (RH)
        Single Family Residential (R-1)
        Single Family Residential (R-1 (5,000))
        Multiple Family Residential (R-2)
        Multiple Family Residential (R-3 and R-3-I)
The development standards for these zones are summarized in
Table HE-26. Brea’s standards for dwelling unit size establish
opportunities for a diverse housing mix. These standards range
from 450 square feet for a studio unit in the R-3 district to 2,500
square feet (for a single-story unit) in the RH zone. Small lot
single-family subdivisions as well as townhomes are provided for in
the R-1 (5,000) zone, with minimum unit sizes of 800 square feet.
These standards, when viewed in the context of the entire
community, offer a positive balance of home sizes.
Apart from the maximum density permitted by the Zoning
Ordinance, two standards that may affect the number of units that
can be constructed on a given lot are maximum lot coverage and
height limits. The Zoning Ordinance restricts the amount of lot
area that may be covered by development to 50 percent in R-2
and 60 percent in R-3 zones. Three-story (35') building heights are
permitted in R-2 and R-3 zones, with additional height of up to 75'
permitted in R-3 zones based on distance from R-1, R-2 of RH
zone districts. The maximum building envelope achievable under
the lot coverage and height requirements does not serve as a
constraint to achieving close to the maximum permitted densities
in the City’s R-2 and R-3 zone districts. For example, the City has
a current development application for 48 units on a 2.07 acre R-3
parcel, translating to 23.8 units per acre, or 96 percent of the
maximum permitted density.

                                            The Zoning Ordinance calculates parking requirements by unit
                                            type, and on a per bedroom basis for multi-family units, as
                                            illustrated in Table HE-27. Carports for multi-family units are
                                            permitted, serving to reduce development costs in contrast to the
                                            provision of separate garages. In addition, to facilitate the
                                            development of affordable housing and to reflect the actual
                                            parking demands created by these developments, the City has
                                            granted parking reductions for senior housing, loft housing and
                                            affordable housing in general.

                                   In order to specifically facilitate the development of affordable
                                   housing, the City utilizes two primary regulatory mechanisms:
                                   Development Agreements and the Affordable Housing Ordinance.
         Development               The City makes extensive use of development agreements as a tool
                                   to provide regulatory relief from density, parking and other multi-
            Agreements
                                   family development standards in exchange for public benefits,
                                   including but not limited to affordable housing. For example, the
                                   City has entered into 10 development agreements to provide for
                                   multi-family housing in R-3 districts which exceed the maximum
                                   density standard of 25 dwelling units per acre. These projects
                                   have provided for 609 senior and 62 family units. The average
                                   densities for the senior and family projects are 50 and 78 units per
                                   acre, respectively.
               Affordable          The purpose of the Affordable Housing Ordinance is to expand the
                                   affordable housing stock in proportion with the overall increase in
Housing Ordinance
                                   residential units in the City through establishment of standards to
                                   encourage the development of low- to moderate-income housing.
                                   Adopted in 1993, the Ordinance requires developers of residential
                                   projects with 20 or more units to provide 10 percent of the units
                                   for affordable housing, provided that the City determines the
                                   development of the affordable units does not place an economic
                                   burden on the developers. To offset the costs of developing
                                   affordable units, the City offers the following incentives:

        Density bonus;
        Flexible development standards, such as a reduction in
         unit square footage, on-site requirements, and off-site
         improvements;
        Deferral of development impact fees;
        Use of Building Code alternatives;
        Assistance in application for public funds, such as rent
         subsidies, bond financing, community development block
         grants (CDBG);
        Redevelopment set-aside funds; and
        Any other lawful means of offsetting the costs of providing
         affordable units
All affordable units developed under this Ordinance must remain
as units affordable to lower and moderate-income households for
30 years. The 30-year period begins upon initial sale or rental of
the units. Since adoption of the ordinance, only four projects have
met the 20-unit threshold which triggers implementation of the
Ordinance, including Vintage Canyon, Tamarack Pointe, Arbors,
and Laurel Walk. With the economy in the late 1990s again
robust and several of the City’s specific plans now becoming
active, the Affordable Housing Ordinance will again come into
play. To provide even greater flexibility in the way the City’s
affordable housing requirements are fulfilled, the Ordinance allows
for payment of an in-lieu fee, described below.
In-Lieu Fees: The Affordable Housing Ordinance provides the
developers of for-sale housing with the option to fulfill the
inclusionary housing requirement by paying an in-lieu fee to the
City. The in-lieu fees collected are deposited in the Affordable
Housing Trust Fund to be used exclusively for the development or
maintenance of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income
households. The fee is calculated by subtracting the current market
value for comparable units from the established maximum
affordable home price for moderate-income households. The
formula included in the Ordinance calls for the City to calculate
the fee each time a developer wishes to apply for the in-lieu fee
option. To date, of the four projects which met the 20-unit
threshold of the inclusionary housing ordinance, none has opted to
pay the in-lieu fee, and all have provided the affordable units on
site. Given development activity projected to occur in Brea’s
hillsides, it is likely many of these hillside projects will opt to pay
the in-lieu fee rather than provide affordable units on-site due to
the high cost of developing in the hillsides.

                                     (3) the second unit meets the development standards for such a
                                     unit in the R-1 Zone; and (4) the second unit does not cause the
                                     existing dwelling to conflict with the minimum standards
                                     applicable to the single family zone on which it is located. The
                                     City has processed and approved numerous applications for the
                                     development of second units.

                   fewer persons) are permitted in the following zones: R-1, R1-H, R-
     Housing and
                   1 5,000, R-2, and R-3. Residential care facilities for more than 6
Emergency Shelters persons are conditionally permitted in the following zones: R-3
                   (Multiple-Family Residential), C-P (Commercial, Administrative,
                   and Professional Office), C-N (Neighborhood Commercial), C-C
                   (Major Shopping Center), C-G (General Commercial), and C-RC
                   (Commercial Recreation).
                   The Sheepfold Shelter for women and children currently operates
                   in Brea. According to the City’s Community Services Department,
                   there have been some discussions (but no formal plans) by a local
                   church and the operator of “Sheepfold” to open another shelter
                   for women and children in Brea.
                   4. Development and Planning Fees
                   The Development Services Department collects various fees from
                   developers to cover the costs of processing permits and providing
                   necessary services and infrastructure. An analysis conducted by
                   the City in the early 1990s indicated the City’s fees constituted
                   only about six percent of the total development costs in multi-
                   family development. As of this writing, fees for staff time spent on
                   a project are based on three levels of hourly rate service: $97 per

                hour for “Management Staff,” $73 per hour for “Technical Staff,”
                and $63.25 per hour for “Inspection Staff.” Typically, most work is
                performed by technical and inspection staff. The Department
                requests a deposit at the time it begins to process a project based
                on an estimate of how much time will be spent. If the project
                ends up requiring more time, an invoice is processed for additional
                funds. If the project is completed before the entire deposit is
                used, a refund is processed. The City adopted the fee deposits as
                a measure to save costs for smaller and less complicated
                developments, in contrast to an average fee being applied to all
                projects. Table HE-29 is a list of deposit amounts charged by the
                City.

                Not all projects are processed using the hourly rate formula. For
                inspection of small projects, flat fees are charged.
                New residential development projects in Brea are subject to
                various impact fees, which include the Traffic Impact Fees, Water
                Impact Fees, Fire Impact Fees, and Dispatch Impact Fees.
                Established in 1995, these fees apply to new developments in the
                City and annexed portions of its Sphere of Influence. The City is
                currently in the process of re-evaluating the structure of impact
                fees. As a result of this analysis, the City may modify fees to better
                reflect the actual costs of providing services.

                               3-53

Traffic Impact Fees           “Traffic Impact Fees” are required, in part, by Orange County’s
                              Measure M, a transportation initiative passed in 1990. These are
                              fair-share based fees designed to offset or mitigate the traffic
                              impacts caused by new developments. In some cases, a developer
                              may be required to make certain traffic improvements in addition
                              to, or in-lieu of paying traffic impact fees. However, the total cost
                              of traffic improvements and/or fees will not exceed the
                              development’s fair-share toward mitigating its own impacts. The
                              amount of fees varies depending upon the type and location of a
                              project. The required fees must be paid prior to the issuance of
                              any building permits. Table HE-30 is a schedule of the traffic
                              impact fee.

Water Impact Fees             “Water Impact Fees” are assessed to ensure that adequate water
                              infrastructure and facilities are provided to new residential
                              projects. In some cases, a developer may be required to make
                              certain water improvements in addition to, or in-lieu of paying
                              water impact fees. However, the total cost of water improvements
                              and/or fees will not exceed the development’s fair-share of
                              providing the water infrastructure or facilities. The amount of fees
                              a developer pays ranges from $2,876 to $8,764 per dwelling unit,
                              depending upon a project’s location. The fees only apply to three
                              designated areas in the Sphere of Influence.
  Fire Impact Fees            “Fire Impact Fees” are one-time fees established to fund the cost
                              of building a fire station and purchasing new fire engines and
                              equipment required to serve new development. The amount of
                              fees vary depending upon a project’s location. The fees for the
                              eastern and western portions of the Sphere of Influence are
                              $166.32 and $1,388.35 per dwelling unit, respectively. New

                                                         Chapter 3: Housing Element
                developments within the City are not subject to fire impact fees
                because the infrastructure and equipment for fire services are
                already in-place.
Dispatch Impact “Dispatch Impact Fees” are assessed to provide upgrades to the
                Police and Fire dispatch systems to ensure that new developments
           Fees
                are provided with the necessary public safety services. The fee is
                $132.50 for each dwelling unit.
                Recognizing that the above impact fees may discourage new
                development, the City does allow the deferral of these fees as a
                means to offset the costs of providing affordable housing units for
                developers.
                5. Building Codes and Enforcement
                In addition to land use controls, local building codes also affect the
                cost of housing. The City has adopted the Uniform Building Code
                (UBC) which establishes the minimum standards for new
                construction.     While the City may impose more stringent
                standards, it cannot adopt any which are below those of the UBC.
                No standard has been adopted above the minimum standards of
                the UBC.
                6. Local Processing and Permit
                Procedures
                The processing time needed to obtain development permits and
                required approvals is often cited as a prime contributor to the high
                cost of housing.        Additional time may be necessary for
                environmental review, depending on the location and nature of a
                project.
                Brea’s development process can be summarized in the following
                seven steps. All of these steps may not be necessary depending on
                the nature of a project.
   Screen Check This process is a free service that allows a developer to meet with
                staff from various City departments before actually filing an
                application that initiates the development process. Screen Check
                is particularly helpful in projects requiring a Conditional Use
                Permit (CUP). City staff help developers by assessing proposed
                projects, discussing concerns, and explaining any special
                requirements of the projects. Screen Check can potentially save
                developers time and money by addressing potential concerns at an
                early stage thereby avoiding delays later.

                               3-55

Application  The “Planning (or Application) Submittal” process is when a
             developer submits an application, a deposit (amount depending
   Submittal
             on the complexity of the proposed project), and other necessary
             forms, such as “Environmental Information” or “Hazardous Waste
             and Substance Site Statement”.
Plan Review  The next phase, the “Plan Review” process, begins after the
             application plans and required deposit have been submitted. A
             planner is assigned to serve as the developer’s liaison helping to
             expedite the permit process and coordinating any department
             reviews required. During this phase, the developer’s application
             submittal is distributed to the appropriate City departments for
             review and comment. A review of the environmental issues
             associated with the proposed project (as required by the California
             Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)) will also be completed at this
             time.      All discretionary projects (those requiring Planning
             Commission approval) require an Environmental Review.
    Planning If a project is determined to require discretionary action, it will be
             scheduled on the Planning Commission’s agenda and public notice
Commission
             will be given. Property owners within 300 feet of the proposed
   Approval  project will be notified. The developer is strongly encouraged to
             work out potential problems with neighboring residents or business
             owners before the Commission meeting.
             A developer may appeal most Planning Commission actions to the
             City Council. In some instances, the project may require City
             Council approval. Still, other projects may never go to either the
             Commission or the Council. The level of review is dictated by the
             location and use of a project.
 Plan Check  This step verifies that all building, fire, mechanical, plumbing, and
             electrical code requirements are fulfilled in compliance with Brea’s
             Building and Zoning codes. The developer’s application will be
             reviewed by the City’s Engineering, Planning, Fire, and Building
             divisions. Any requirements or problems identified during the Plan
             Review phase should now be completed or rectified. Once the
             application submittal is complete, the City performs the Plan
             Check. The Plan Check turnaround times are as follows:
             Minor repair projects                         10 days
             Tenant improvements, room additions           15 days
             Full development projects                     90 days

                  Once Plan Check is completed, the developer will need to submit
                  final plans with any revisions required by the City Council,
                  Planning Commission or City Staff. Final plans must be submitted
                  in order to receive the building permit(s).
  Building Permit A building permit is required before construction can begin.
                  Throughout construction, regular inspections are required. The
                  final inspection will involve all of the appropriate City
                  departments.
Occupancy Permit  Once the final inspection is completed, the developer needs to
                  secure an occupancy permit and pay the appropriate fees prior to
                  occupancy. Buildings or structures cannot be used or occupied
                  until the building official has issued a “Certificate of Occupancy.”
                  C. ENVIRONMENTAL AND
                  INFRASTRUCTURE
                  CONSTRAINTS
                  Brea is subject to the following environmental and infrastructure
                  constraints. Carbon Canyon, in particular, is an area with high
                  risks of being affected by these environmental hazards. The
                  geology and soils of the canyon area present constraints upon
                  development due to the presence of the Whittier Fault zone,
                  landslides and related slope stability issues.
                  1. Seismic Hazards
                  The City is likely to experience ground shaking associated with the
                  active and potentially active fault systems in the surrounding area.
                  The most severe ground shaking would result from earthquake
                  activity on the Whittier fault zone. The Whittier fault is active and
                  cuts across Brea and the Sphere of Influence diagonally
                  (northwest/southeast orientation).
                  BREA GENERAL PLAN
                                 3-57

2. Slope Stability - Landslides and
Subsidence
Stability of natural slopes in the rugged Carbon Canyon area is a
significant concern. The numerous landslides that have occurred
in this area attest to its stability hazards. There is some potential
for erosion and slope instability related to stream activity along
major canyons and drainage courses. Liquefaction may also occur
in areas of Carbon Canyon and along the major drainages of Brea
Creek and Fullerton Creek where perched water may exist.
3. Flooding
All major tributary courses throughout the City are areas of
potential flooding. Specifically, Carbon Canyon stream and its
tributaries, Telegraph Canyon Creek and Soquel Canyon Creek,
which flow into the Carbon Canyon Dam area, exhibit some
hazardous flooding during high intensity storms. Flooding may
also occur in areas surrounding the Carbon Canyon Dam and at
the Orange County reservoir should there be dam failure. There is
currently an inundation map to guide development in areas that
would be affected by dam failure.
4. Public Services and Facilities
Future development in the Carbon Canyon area will result in the
need for additional infrastructure (roads, facilities providing water
and power etc.) and public safety facilities including police, fire
and paramedic services. These additional services and facilities
will be funded by developers who are required to pay various
impact fees. However, as mentioned previously, developers may
have the fees deferred as an incentive to provide affordable
housing in their residential developments.

5. HOUSING RESOURCES
         V
                  arious resources available for the development,
                  rehabilitation, and preservation of housing are available in
                  Brea.     The section begins with an overview of the
                  availability of land resources or residential sites for future
         housing development, and an evaluation of the City’s ability to
         provide adequate sites to address the its identified share of future
         housing needs. This section also presents the financial resources
         available to support the provision of affordable housing in the
         community, and specifically identifies funding amounts for
         redevelopment set-aside, CDBG and HOME funds available during
         the five year planning period. Finally, the section concludes with a
         discussion of opportunities for energy conservation.
         A. AVAILABILITY OF SITES FOR
         HOUSING
         An important component of the Housing Element is the
         identification of sites for future housing development, and
         evaluation of the adequacy of these sites in fulfilling the City’s
         share of regional housing needs (as determined by SCAG). Table
         HE-31 shows the City’s residential development potential by
         General Plan land use category. Figure HE-12 identifies the
         general location of vacant and underutilized sites available for
         residential development.

 Notes:     1.  Assumes realistic development potential in Carbon Canyon is approximately half of the 2,061 total units
                called for in the 1986 Specific Plan, estimated at 1,029 units (88 Rural, 483 Low Density, 115 Medium
                Density, and 343 High Density).
           2.   Underutilized acreage reflects key developable parcels in Brea Towne Plaza Specific Plan yielding, a
                potential net increase in 188 units.
                                        As shown in Table HE-31, the City can accommodate 2,645 net
                                        new dwelling units based on existing zoning, General Plan, and
                                        Specific Plan designations. The 1,655 units in the “Rural” and
                                        “Low Density” districts will most likely be single-family homes,
                                        while the 990 units in the “Medium Density” and “High Density”
                                        zones will be in multi-family housing developments. Two large
                                        specific plans in the eastern hillside areas of the City - Carbon
                                        Canyon and Olinda Ranch - will comprise a significant potion of
                                        the City’s future growth. Olinda Ranch allows for 639 single-
                                        family units, and has begun development.
                                        The 1986 Carbon Canyon Specific Plan calls for approximately
                                        2,000 units in this area, although in all likelihood this significantly
                                        overstates the level of development which can realistically be
                                        expected.        The City has received a preliminary development
                                        application for a sizable portion of Carbon Canyon known as
                                        Canyon Crest which proposes approximately half the units entitled
                                        under the Specific Plan.              The City has been undertaking
                                        infrastructure studies in Carbon Canyon and the Sphere of
                                        Influence to better assess supportable development in the area.
                                        Given these considerations, the residential sites analysis contained
                                        in Table HE-31 assumes Carbon Canyon will build out at half the
                                        residential development potential assumed by the Specific Plan.
                                        While Table HE-31 identifies potential for 990 new multi-family
                                        units in medium and high density areas, the City has a strong
                                        history of providing increased densities in exchange for affordable
                                        units. Through development agreements, the City has provided
                                        BREA GENERAL PLAN
                                                         3-61

                   developers with incentives such as density bonuses as well as
                   relaxed development standards (e.g. lower parking requirements,
                   smaller unit sizes). The City has approved numerous residential
                   developments (most of which are senior apartments) that have
                   densities well above the 25 units per acre standard established for
                   the High Density or R-3 zone, as well as mixed use housing
                   including loft housing above retail uses.
                   In addition to vacant sites, future housing units can also be
                   accommodated on underutilized lots or lots on which
                   developments are not built-out to the maximum density level
                   permitted. The Brea Towne Plaza Specific Plan area, in particular,
                   is an area designed for high density housing and contains a
                   significant number of parcels developed with only one or two
                   units. The Towne Plaza Specific Plan provides density incentives
                   for the consolidation of underutilized parcels in this area. A parcel
                   specific analysis identifies potential for a net increase of 188 high-
                   density units in the Towne Plaza area on key underdeveloped
                   sites.
Comparison of Site Brea has a regional housing growth need (RHNA) of 1,052 new
                   units for the 1998-2005 period. Given that the City can
   Inventory with
                   accommodate residential growth of over 2,640 units, it can
          RHNA     certainly accommodate 1,052 units in this period. The more
                   important issue, however, is whether the City has adequate sites
                   for the provision of units for very low-, low-, and moderate-income
                   households. The State Department of Housing and Community
                   Development (HCD) uses the following general affordability and
                   development density guidelines for urban areas to evaluate the
                   adequacy of available sites to fulfill a city’s share of regional
                   housing needs:
                           Very Low-Income - 25 du/ac
                           Low-Income - 18 du/ac
                           Moderate-Income - 8 du/ac
                   Housing units built in Brea since January 1998 can be subtracted
                   from the City’s RHNA. Since January 1998, a total of 144 housing
                   units have been developed in the City, including 6 single-family
                   homes, a triplex (3 units), 30 loft apartments and 105 senior
                   apartment units. Given the market sales and rent data presented
                   earlier in the needs assessment, the following income distribution
                   can be assumed for these units: 5 of the single-family homes are at
                   upper-income sales prices; one single-family home, the triplex,
                   BREA GENERAL PLAN

                                                                     Chapter 3: Housing Element
                          and loft apartments are at prices affordable to moderate income
                          households; and the senior apartment units are at rent levels
                          affordable to very low-income households. The Redevelopment
                          Agency provided funding support for both the loft apartments and
                          the senior housing project (Vintage Canyon), ensuring long term
                          affordability to moderate- and very low-income households,
                          respectively. Thus, the RHNA figures for the City can be reduced
                          to the following:

                          Given the City’s zoning designations and the maximum allowable
                          densities and based on HCD’s density thresholds, units affordable
                          to very low-income and low-income would need to be located in
                          the High Density or R-3 zone. As displayed in Table HE-31, a total
                          of 531 units can be accommodated in areas designated High
                          Density. This high density growth potential adequately fulfills the
                          remaining need for 234 very low- and low-income units. The
                          City’s remaining housing needs for moderate-income households
                          are for 178 units. With residential sites to accommodate 459
                          additional units in the Medium Density (R-2) zone, the City also
                          has adequate residential development capacity to address its
                          remaining moderate-income housing needs.

                          infrastructure. These fees apply to new developments in the City
                          and annexed portions of the Sphere of Influence.

B. FINANCIAL RESOURCES
There are a variety of existing and potential funding sources
available for affordable housing activities in Brea. They include the
following:
1. Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside
Redevelopment housing set-aside funds are one of the primary
sources of financing used for the preservation, improvement, and
development of affordable housing. As required by the California
Redevelopment Law, Brea’s Redevelopment Agency sets aside 20
percent of all tax increment revenue generated from the
redevelopment project area for the purpose of increasing and
improving the community’s supply of housing for low- and
moderate-income households. This set-aside is placed in a
separate Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Fund. This fund
has funded Agency-assisted affordable housing programs and
projects in Brea, such as the senior rental subsidy program, the
homebuyer assistance program, the Birch View and Habitat
condominium projects, and the multi-family rental developments
listed in Table HE-21 (Needs Assessment). Interest earned on
money in the Fund, and repayments from loans, advances or
grants are returned to the Fund and used to assist other affordable
housing projects and programs.
Housing units developed using the Agency’s housing set-aside
funds must remain affordable to the targeted income group for the
longest feasible period of time and not less than 15 years for rental
housing and 10 years for ownership housing. However, there are
provisions that allow for a term of less than 10 years if the Agency
receives a fair return on invested funds.
So long as the expenditure directly serve to increase, improve, or
preserve the supply of low- and moderate-income housing,
Redevelopment Law allows for a broad range of uses for the
Housing Fund. These uses include, but not limited to the
acquisition of land or buildings, construction of buildings,
rehabilitation of buildings, subsidies, and on-site and off-site
improvements.
The Housing Fund may be used outside the redevelopment
project area (but must remain within the City limits), upon a
finding by the City Council that use outside the project area will be
of benefit to the redevelopment project. The Housing Fund must
be expended on housing that is available at affordable housing cost
BREA GENERAL PLAN
                3-64

                                         Chapter 3: Housing Element
to households whose incomes do not exceed the low- and
moderate-income level for the area.
The City of Brea is projected to have approximately $3.7 million in
redevelopment set-aside funds available for housing activities
during this Housing Element cycle (2000-2005).               Annual
contributions range from $289,000 to $1 million per year.
2. Community Development Block
Grant (CDBG) Funds
Through the CDBG program, the federal Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) provides funds to local
governments for funding a wide range of community development
activities for low-income persons. The CDBG program provides
formula funding to larger cities and counties, while smaller cities
(less than 50,000 population) generally compete for funding that is
allocated to and administered by the state or county. As a smaller
city, Brea receives its allocation of CDBG funds through the
Orange County Housing and Community Development
Department.
The CDBG program is very flexible in that the funds can be used
for a wide range of activities. The eligible activities include, but
not limited to: acquisition and/or disposition of real estate or
property, public facilities and improvements, relocation,
rehabilitation and construction (under certain limitations) of
housing, homeownership assistance, and clearance activities. The
City currently allocates 70 to 75 percent of its CDBG funds to
housing activities.
3. HOME Investment Partnership
Program
Established by the Federal government in 1990, the HOME
program is designed to improve and/or expand a jurisdiction’s
affordable housing stock. Unlike the CDBG program, HOME
funds can only be used for affordable housing activities.
Specifically, HOME funds can be used for the following activities
which promote affordable rental housing and lower-income
homeownership: building acquisition, new construction,
reconstruction, moderate or substantial rehabilitation, homebuyer
assistance, and tenant-based assistance.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
                3-65

There are fairly strict requirements governing the use of the funds.
Two major requirements are that HOME funds must be: (1) used
for activities that target certain income groups (lower income
families in particular) and (2) matched 25 percent by non-federal
sources (such as City redevelopment funds).
The City anticipates receiving approximately $1.2 million in CDBG
and HOME funds from the County during the 2000-2005 period,
averaging $250,000 per year.
4. Tax Exempt Multi-family Revenue
Bonds
The construction, acquisition, and rehabilitation of multi-family
rental housing developments can be funded by tax exempt bonds
which provide a lower interest rate than is available through
conventional financing. Projects financed through these bonds,
which can be issued by the Redevelopment Agency, are required
to set aside 20 percent of the units for occupancy by very low-
income households or 40 percent of the units to be set aside from
households at 60 percent of the area median income. Tax exempt
bonds for multi-family housing may also be issued to refinance
existing tax exempt debt, which are referred to as a refunding
bond issue.
In 1985, the Agency issued multi-family revenue bonds to finance
the 124-unit Town and County Apartments project on South Brea
Boulevard. A Regulatory Agreement requires that 20 percent of
the units (25 of 124) be reserved for lower income households at
affordable rents. This project also included a refunding bond issue
in 1994 and additional housing set-aside funds to secure a total of
50 affordable units for lower income households.                The
Redevelopment Agency issued tax exempt 501(c)(3) bonds for
non-profit acquisition of the Rancho Brea mobile home park and
financed $395,000 in park improvements using housing set-aside
funds.
5. Housing Agreements
The Redevelopment Agency assists in the development of new
affordable housing units by entering into Disposition Development
Agreements (DDA) or Owner Participation Agreements (OPA) with
developers. DDAs or OPAs may provide for the disposition of
Agency-owned land at a price which can support the development
of units at an affordable housing cost for low- and moderate-
income households. These agreements may also provide for
BREA GENERAL PLAN
               3-66
                                            Chapter 3: Housing Element
development assistance, usually in the form of a density bonus or
the payment of specified development fees or other development
costs which cannot be supported by the proposed development.
Land disposition projects to date include (but not limited to)
Arbors, Laurel Walk, Laurel Creek, Birch View, and Ash Street
Cottages. The City has also provided development assistance
(density bonus and/or land disposition) to the following: Brea
Woods, Darnan, Orange Villa, and three projects with Habitat for
Humanity.
6. Housing In-Lieu Fee
The City allows the payment of in-lieu fee to fulfill the inclusionary
housing requirement under the Affordable Housing Ordinance.
The Planning Commission decides, on a case by case basis,
whether a developer can pay in-lieu fees instead of providing the
required affordable housing units. The in-lieu fees collected are
deposited in an Affordable Housing Trust Fund to be used
exclusively for the development or maintenance of housing
affordable to low- and moderate-income households.
7. Low Income Housing Tax Credit
(LIHTC)
Created by the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the LIHTC program has
been used to encourage the construction and rehabilitation of low-
income rental housing. It allows investors an annual tax credit
over a ten-year period, provided that the housing meets the low-
income occupancy requirements: a minimum of 20 percent of the
units must be affordable to households at 50 percent of area
median income (AMI), or 40 percent affordable to those at 60
percent of AMI. The total credit over the ten-year period has a
present value equal to 70 percent of the qualified construction and
rehabilitation expenditures. This program has limitations which
affect the amount of tax credits received, such as a ten-year
requirement for housing being purchased, a minimum
rehabilitation expenditure for rehabilitation projects. The tax
credit is typically sold to large investors at a syndication value. The
rehabilitation of Walnut Village Apartments (on Walnut Avenue)
and the construction of the Vintage Canyon senior apartment
complex were funded in part by LIHTC proceeds.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
                3-67
8. Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCC)
The MCC program is designed to help low- and moderate-income
first-time homebuyers qualify for conventional first mortgage loans
by increasing the homebuyer’s after-tax income. The MCC is a
direct tax credit for eligible homebuyers equal to 20 percent of the
mortgage interest paid during the year. The other 80 percent of
mortgage interest can still be taken as an income deduction. Brea
is a participating city in the County-run MCC program and has
issued 36 MCCs to date.
9. Section 8 Rental Assistance
The federal Section 8 program provides rental assistance to low-
income persons in need of affordable housing. There are two
types of subsidies under Section 8: certificates and vouchers. A
certificate pays the difference between the fair market rent and 30
percent of the tenants’ monthly income, while a voucher allows a
tenant to choose housing that may cost above the fair market rent
figure, with the tenant paying the extra cost. The voucher also
allows the tenant to rent a unit below the fair market rent figure
with the tenant keeping the savings.
The Orange County Housing Authority (OCHA) coordinates and
administers Section 8 rental assistance on behalf of the
unincorporated areas and the 28 cities that do not have their own
housing authorities (exceptions are Anaheim, Garden Grove, and
Santa Ana). According to the County’s Affordable Housing
Strategy, there are approximately 6,700 households in extremely
low-income, low-income, and special needs groups receiving
Section 8 assistance. Like many other urban jurisdictions, the
demand for rental assistance in Orange County is very high. There
are at least 3,200 applicants on a waiting list for Section 8
assistance and the average waiting time is four years.
10. California Housing Finance
Agency (CHFA) Programs
CHFA administers a number of ownership and rental housing
programs funded with the proceeds of tax-exempt bonds. The
single-family programs provide low- and moderate-income first-
time homebuyers with below-market interest rate mortgages
and/or second mortgages to assist with downpayment. The rental
programs provide financing for the construction of apartment units,
including second mortgages from CHFA’s Housing Trust Fund.

                                         Chapter 3: Housing Element
11. Fannie Mae Downpayment
Assistance Program
The Federal National Mortgage Association, better known as
“Fannie Mae,” offers a program that provides second mortgages to
homeowners.        This second mortgage can serve as the
downpayment and closing costs on home purchases. Under this
program, a city or county is required to post a reserve fund equal
to 20 percent of an amount that Fannie Mae then makes available
for such second mortgages.          Resources are leveraged at a
minimum ratio of 5:1.
The Brea Redevelopment Agency also administers a Homebuyer
Assistance Loan Program using housing set-aside funds for direct
downpayment assistance lending. Over 80 households have been
assisted to date.
C. OPPORTUNITIES FOR
ENERGY CONSERVATION
As residential energy costs rise, increasing utility costs reduce the
affordability of housing. The City has many opportunities to
directly affect energy use within its jurisdiction. Title 24 of the
California Administrative Code sets forth mandatory energy
standards for new development, and requires adoption of an
“energy budget”. The following are among the alternative ways to
meet these energy standards.
Alternative 1: The passive solar approach which requires proper
solar orientation, appropriate levels of thermal mass, south facing
windows, and moderate insulation levels.
Alternative 2: Generally requires higher levels of insulation than
Alternative 1, but has no thermal mass or window orientation
requirements.
Alternative 3: Also is without passive solar design but requires
active solar water heating in exchange for less stringent insulation
and/or glazing requirements.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
               3-69

In turn, the home building industry must comply with these
standards while localities are responsible for enforcing the energy
conservation regulations. Some additional opportunities for energy
conservation include various passive design techniques. Among
the range of techniques that could be used for purposes of
reducing energy consumption are the following:
        Locating the structure on the northern portion of the
         sunniest portion of the site;
        Designing the structure to admit the maximum amount of
         sunlight into the building and to reduce exposure to
         extreme weather conditions;
        Locating indoor areas of maximum usage along the south
         face of the building and placing corridors, closets, laundry
         rooms, power core, and garages along the north face;
        Making the main entrance a small enclosed space that
         creates an air lock between the building and its exterior;
         orienting the entrance away from prevailing winds; or
         using a windbreak to reduce the wind velocity against the
         entrance.
Southern California Edison Customer
Assistance Program
Southern California Edison (SCE) offers a variety of energy
conservation services under Customer Assistance Programs (CAP).
These services are designed to help low-income households, senior
citizens, permanently disabled, and non-English speaking
customers control their energy use. All CAP participants must
meet the federally-established income guidelines. Most of the
services offered are available free of charge.
Southern California Gas Company
Involvement Program
The Southern California Gas Company offers an energy
conservation service known as the Community Involvement
Program (CIP). Provided free of charge, this service provides
weatherization for the homes or apartments of low-income
families, provided they meet the federally-established income
guidelines.

6. HOUSING PLAN
         Sections 2 through 5 of the Housing Element establish the housing
         needs, opportunities and constraints in the City of Brea. The
         following Housing Plan section first evaluates the accomplishments
         of the last adopted housing element and then presents the City’s
         five-year Housing Plan. This Plan sets forth Brea’s goals, policies,
         and programs to address the identified housing needs of the City.
         A. EVALUATION OF
         ACCOMPLISHMENTS UNDER
         ADOPTED HOUSING ELEMENT
         Under State Housing Element law, communities are required to
         assess the achievements under their adopted housing programs as
         part of the five-year update to their housing elements. These
         results should be quantified where possible (e.g. the number of
         units that were rehabilitated), but may be qualitative where
         necessary (e.g. mitigation of governmental constraints). The results
         should then be compared with what was projected or planned in
         the earlier element. Where significant shortfalls exist between
         what was planned and what was achieved, the reasons for such
         differences must be discussed.
         Brea’s prior Housing Element was adopted in 1989, and sets forth
         a series of housing programs with related objectives for the
         following topic areas: conservation and improvement of the
         housing stock; provision of adequate affordable housing; provision
         of adequate housing sites; removal of governmental constraints;
         and promotion of equal housing opportunities. This section
         reviews the current appropriateness of these programs, the
         effectiveness of the Element, and the progress in implementation
         since 1989. Housing programs implemented since 1989 and not
         included in the previous Housing Element are also evaluated.

                        1. Conservation and Improvement of
                        the Housing Stock
                        A major issue addressed in the 1989 Housing Element is the
                        conservation and improvement of existing affordable housing.
                        Specifically, the Element focused on upgrading the City’s single-
                        family residential neighborhoods and conserving the rental housing
                        stock.
      1989 Housing      The Single-Family Rehabilitation Program has been providing low-
                        interest loans to low- and moderate-income homeowners for the
Element Programs
                        repair or rehabilitation of their homes. This program is funded by
                        Federal CDBG and HOME grants, and Redevelopment set-aside
         Single-Family  funds. The City’s 1989 objective was to provide financial
         Rehabilitation assistance for the improvement of 13 housing units per year (65
              Program   units in five years). Brea has exceeded this goal, providing
                        approximately 15 to 20 loans annually.
        Condominium     As a means of protecting the existing stock of apartment units from
           Conversion   conversion to condominiums, the 1989 Housing Element called for
           Regulations  the establishment of condominium conversion regulations. The
                        Zoning Ordinance now provides criteria for the conversion of
                        existing multi-family housing to condominiums.             Residential
                        condominium conversions are permitted in appropriate zoned
                        districts within the City subject to the issuance of a conditional use
                        permit. A proposed condominium or condominium project may
                        be approved, conditionally approved, or disapproved by the
                        Planning Commission.
      Section 8 Rental  The Section 8 program provides rental subsidies to very low-
            Assistance  income households as a means of providing affordable rental
(Certificate/Voucher)   housing not otherwise provided by the private market. A total of
              Program   51 households in Brea currently receive Section 8 vouchers from
                        the Orange County Housing Authority (OCHA), the agency
                        administering the program for the City.

                        Terrace offers 37 units, 18 of which are provided at affordable
                        rents to very low- and low-income households. The Civic Center

Multi-family Housing   The acquisition and rehabilitation of aging apartment complexes is
         Acquisition/  a way to provide quality affordable housing to very low- and low-
        Rehabilitation income households. The Redevelopment Agency acquired the 51-
                       unit Walnut Village Apartments in an effort to provide for the
                       rehabilitation and preservation of these apartments at rents
                       affordable to very low-income households. The Agency then sold
                       the units to a non-profit housing corporation, which coordinated
                       the rehabilitation, maintenance, and management of the units.
                       The project construction/ rehabilitation was completed in 1997,
                       and provides 47 units of very low-income family housing. There is
                       a 40-year affordability term on the units.
       Neighborhood    Adopted in 1998, Brea’s Neighborhood Enhancement Plan
  Enhancement Plan     identifies six focus areas in the City with signs of physical
                       deterioration and other related problems, and proposes programs
                       to provide for neighborhood upgrading. Programs proposed as
                       part of the Plan include (but are not limited to): assistance to non-
                       profit organizations for the purchase and rehabilitation of multi-
                       family units, an apartment inspection program, and a targeted
                       rehabilitation loan program for single- and multi-family properties
                       in the focus neighborhoods.
                       In the first year since adoption of the Enhancement Plan, the
                       Redevelopment Agency has started marketing a rehabilitation loan
                       program specifically in the six identified neighborhoods and has
                       had positive results. A mailing campaign to promote the program
                       has generated a high number of inquiries. Between July and
                       December 1998, five (5) new housing rehabilitation loans were
                       provided to families living in the six focus areas. In addition, two
                       neighborhood outreach meetings have been held with input
                       received from the residents, followed by “Neighborhood
                       Beautification Days” complete with clean-up volunteers and
                       multiple free trash bins to help residents remove debris and
                       upgrade their neighborhood.
                       Provision of Adequate Affordable
                       Housing
                       Since the adoption of the 1989 Housing Element, the City has
                       implemented various programs to increase homeownership and
                       rental opportunities for low- and moderate-income households.

     1989 Housing            An Affordable Housing Ordinance was adopted in 1993. It
                             requires developers of residential projects with 20 or more units to

                             provide 10 percent of the units for housing affordable to low- and
                             moderate-income households, provided that the City determines
 Affordable Housing          the development of the affordable units does not render the
             Ordinance       project economically infeasible. Since its adoption, four housing
                             developments have been subject to the Ordinance, and have
                             provided a total of 120 affordable units (106 very low, 3 low, and
                             11 moderate), as shown in Table HE-33. The developers of these
                             projects received various incentives to off-set the cost of
                             developing the affordable units.

 Housing Trust Fund          The 1989 Housing Element proposed the completion of a study
                             regarding establishment of a “Housing Trust Fund.” The study was
                             completed and an “Affordable Housing Trust Fund” was created in
                             1993, in conjunction with the adoption of the Affordable Housing
                             Ordinance. Under the Ordinance, a developer may be allowed to
                             pay in-lieu fees instead of providing the required affordable units.
                             The in-lieu fees collected are deposited in the Affordable Housing
                             Trust Fund to be used exclusively for the development or
                             maintenance of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income
                             households. To date, there have been no contributions to the
                             Trust Fund. The four developments that have met the 20-unit
                             threshold have provided affordable units as required under the
                             Ordinance.
 Non-profit Housing          The 1989 Housing Element establishes a quantified objective for
        Development:         the development of 45 affordable housing units through the
     Habitat Housing         Habitat Housing Program. Beginning in 1994, the City has worked
         Program and         closely with Habitat for Humanity of Orange County to develop
                             ownership housing for very low-income families. A total of 10

                      1998.
                      While Brea fell short of its development objective of 45 units
                      through this particular program, it is important to note that the City
                      has implemented other housing programs since 1989 that have
                      increased homeownership opportunities for low- and moderate-
                      income households. These programs include the Homebuyer
                      Assistance Program, Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) program,
                      and Development Assistance (all of which are discussed below).
                      The City has also worked with two additional non-profit housing
                      corporations: La Habra Neighborhood Housing Services (NHS) and
                      the Caritas Corporation. NHS acquired South Walnut Apartments
                      and rehabilitated the units with assistance from the Agency. The
                      Agency also facilitated the sale of Rancho Brea Mobile Home Park
                      (100 spaces) to Caritas. Through these efforts, 47 very low-income
                      units were secured at South Walnut and 63 very low- to moderate-
                      income units were secured at Rancho Brea.
     New Programs     Funded with the City’s redevelopment housing set-aside funds, the
                      Homebuyer Assistance Program provides 30-year second
Homebuyer Assistance  mortgages to help low- and moderate-income families purchase
                      homes in Brea. The second mortgage helps the buyer bridge the
              Program
                      gap between the first mortgage the buyer can afford and the
                      purchase price of the home. The City initiated the program in
                      1994 and has assisted over 80 households.
      Mortgage Credit The MCC program is designed to help low- and moderate-income
    Certificate (MCC) first-time homebuyers qualify for conventional first mortgage loans
              Program by increasing their after-tax income. Since the City began
                      participating in this County-run program in 1994, a total of 41
                      MCCs have been issued, 16 of which were issued in conjunction
                      with loans from the Homebuyer Assistance Program.
       Senior Subsidy Begun in 1989 and funded by redevelopment set-aside funds,
              Program Brea’s Senior Subsidy Program offers rent subsides to very low-
                      income senior households. Participating seniors are allowed to
                      apply the subsidy towards rent at the dwelling of their choice. The
                      program currently provides approximately 120 very low-income
                      seniors with $171 per month each in rent subsidies.
   Tax Exempt Multi-  In 1994, the Redevelopment Agency refinanced the bond issue on
Family Revenue Bonds  the 122-unit Town and Country Apartments which was set to
                      expire in 1996. By doing so, it preserved 25 affordable housing
                      units. The Agency also provided a loan to the property owner to
                      finance property improvements and to secure an additional 25

                              affordable units, thus bringing the total number of affordable units
                              to 50. The affordability term on the units is 30 years. The income
                              mix of the units is: 25 units for very low- and low-income
                              households, and 25 for median/moderate-income households.
Housing Agreements:           The Redevelopment Agency has assisted in the development of
Land Disposition and          new affordable housing by entering into Disposition and
         Development          Development Agreements (DDA) with developers.                   These
              Assistance      agreements provided for the disposition of Agency owned-land at
                              a price which can support the development of units at an
                              affordable housing cost for low- and moderate-income
                              households.          The agreements also provided for development
                              assistance in the form of a density bonus. Between 1985 and
                              1999, the Agency assisted in the production of 483 affordable
                              units. Tables HE-34 and HE-35 include Agency-assisted projects

                            Completed in 1999, Vintage Canyon is 105-unit senior housing
                            complex developed by USA Properties in partnership with
                            Riverside Charitable Corporation, a non-profit housing
                            organization.          Vintage Canyon is considered a unique
                            development in that all of its units are for very low-income senior
                            residents. In addition, the complex provides residents with
                            transportation to medical appointments and day trips, recreational
                            activities, on-site medial screening, and food delivery programs at
                            the community room.
                            The Downtown redevelopment project includes 30 loft apartments
                            with 25 units with affordable housing restrictions. Soon to be
                            completed, Building A of the Downtown Loft Apartments will
                            contain a total of 32 one-bedroom units, of which 8 are set-aside
                            for low-income households. These 32 loft apartments are being
                            built above retail spaces on Birch Street and have an affordability
                            term of 30 years.
     Housing Breans         The Housing Breans Advisory Board was formed in August 1993 to
     Advisory Board         provide community input into the City’s housing efforts. The
                            Board has five members and is comprised of a cross-section of the
                            community. The Board has provided valuable input on the review
                            of affordable housing projects and programs, and has supported
                            the City’s efforts to provide quality housing opportunities to all
                            economic segments of the community.
Looking Forward: A          In 1999, the Brea Senior Policy/Issues Task Force completed
Senior Policy Report        Looking Forward, a report that studies the demographic and policy
                            impacts of the City’s growing senior citizen population. An
                            important issue addressed in the report is senior housing. The City
                            recognizes that as Brea’s senior population increases in size, it is
                            important to provide for a variety of housing choices available to
                            seniors of every income level. The major recommendations of the
                            Task Force include: encouraging assisted living facilities and
                            nursing home developments; investigating creative housing
                            solutions such as co-housing; requiring new senior developments

                                              3-77

                       to participate in “joint use” of facilities and services; and including
                       an affordable housing component in all senior developments.
  Mobile Home Policy   Adopted in 1995, the City’s Mobile Home Policy presents various
                       policies and programs to assist in preserving and enhancing mobile
                       home park living in Brea. It is formulated in recognition of the fact
                       that many senior citizens, young families, and fixed income
                       households are residing in mobile home parks and overpaying for
                       their housing. The Policy identifies the problem of separate
                       ownership of the land and dwelling unit which creates competing
                       interests and conflict between the residents and park owners. The
                       major recommendations of the Policy include: allowing the use of
                       the existing first-time home buyers program for the purchase of
                       mobile home park pads; providing financial assistance to mobile
                       home park owners who agree to rehabilitate the park or to provide
                       amenities to upgrade the living environment; offering mediation
                       services between mobile home park owners and tenants; and
                       providing information to park residents regarding programs, such
                       as the State of California Mobile Home Ombudsman’s Office.
Non-profit Acquisition With the Mobile Home Policy in place, the Redevelopment
  and Management of    Agency issued bonds and provided a loan to assist the Caritas
  Mobile Home Parks:   Corporation, a non-profit organization, to purchase the 100-space
  Rancho Brea Mobile   Rancho Brea Mobile Home Park. Caritas purchased the park with
                       the overall intention of improving living conditions, stabilizing
           Home Park
                       rents, making necessary park improvements, and increasing
                       residential participation. Sixty-three of the units in the park are
                       now occupied by very low- to moderate-income families.
                       Specifically, there are 24 very low-, 15 low-, and 24 moderate-
                       income households living in Rancho Brea. The occupancy of the
                       park went from 80 percent prior to Agency involvement to 100
                       percent when the sale and park improvements were completed.
                       Provision of Adequate Housing Sites
                       A key component to satisfying the housing needs of all segments of
                       the community is the provision of adequate sites for different
                       types, sizes and prices of housing.
     1989 Housing      In 1990, the City completed a comprehensive market and land use
                       study to determine the existing and future potential for residential,
 Element Programs
                       retail, office, and recreational development within the City. This
                       study has assisted the City in defining the highest and best use of
 Market and Land Use   its remaining land resources. Specifically, the study provided
               Study   background information to the City Council to guide future
                       decisions on: defining the character of downtown Brea, specifically
                       the Brea Boulevard and Imperial Highway area; determining land

                                                                 Chapter 3: Housing Element

                      the extent of future development permitted in its hillsides.
       Specific Plans The 1989 Housing Element called for the implementation of
                      specific plans as a means to “provide housing in adequate
                      locations with convenient access to employment opportunities,
                      community facilities and adequate services.” Specific plans were
                      adopted in 1995 to guide the development of the Olinda Heights
                      and Birch Hills areas. Both plans provide for the development of
                      the two areas as primarily residential communities. Birch Hills has
                      the capacity to accommodate a maximum of 475 dwelling units,
                      with nearly 60 percent of the area acreage dedicated to residential
                      use. Olinda Heights can accommodate 662 units, with 40 percent
                      of the area acreage designated for residential use. Both Birch Hills
                      and Olinda Heights provide for low (3.2 du/ac) and medium (7.7
                      du/ac) density residential uses.
                      The City also previously adopted specific plans for the Carbon
                      Canyon and Brea Towne Plaza areas. Adopted in 1986, these
                      plans recognize the unique characteristics of the areas and provide
                      policies to guide their development. Carbon Canyon has an area
                      of 1,758 acres, of which three-quarters is designated for single-
                      family and multi-family residential uses. A total of 2,360 units can
                      be accommodated in the area. The Brea Towne Plaza Specific
                      Plan is rather unique in comparison to the City’s other specific
                      plan areas in that this plan is concerned with the redevelopment
                      and revitalization of a downtown area, rather than the
                      development of vacant lands. Approximately 55 percent of the
                      Towne Plaza area is zoned for medium to high density residential
                      developments; the area has the capacity to support a total of
                      2,800 dwelling units.        Loft apartments are currently being
                      developed above retail spaces on Birch Street and ownership
                      townhomes along Brea Boulevard in the downtown.
                      Removal of Governmental Constraints
     1989 Housing     As mentioned previously, the City has adopted an Affordable
                      Housing Ordinance. The Redevelopment Agency can approve
Element Programs
                      various incentives to off-set the costs of developing affordable units
                      as required by the Ordinance. They include: density bonus,
 Affordable Housing   flexible development standards, deferral of development impact
          Ordinance   fees, use of building code alternatives, assistance in applying for
                      public funds, redevelopment set-aside funds, and any other lawful
                      means. The provision of incentives such as density bonuses have
                      resulted in an increase in the supply of affordable housing in Brea.

      New Program    The Development Services Department provides “Screen Check,”
                     a free service that allows a developer to meet with staff from
        Screen Check various City departments before actually filing an application that
                     initiates the development process. The Screen Check process can
                     potentially save developers time and money by addressing
                     potential concerns at an early stage thereby avoiding delays later.
                     Promotion of Equal Housing
                     Opportunities
      1989 Housing   One of the goals in the 1989 Housing Element is to promote
                     housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race, religion,
  Element Program
                     sex, marital status, ancestry, national origin or color. To achieve
                     this goal, the City participates with the Orange County Fair
Fair Housing Program Housing Council and implemented a system of referring
                     discrimination complaints to the proper agencies.
                     Summary of Housing
                     Accomplishments
                     Since the adoption of the previous Housing Element in 1989, the
                     City of Brea has made significant progress in achieving its housing
                     goals. The City’s major accomplishments include the following:
                             Establishing the Homebuyer Assistance Program in 1994
                              and providing assistance to 80+ households;
                             Providing rental subsidies to 125 very low-income seniors
                              through the Senior Subsidy Program;
                             Assisting in the provision of 180+ affordable housing units
                              through provision of land disposition, regulatory incentives,
                              and/or direct financial assistance;
                             Providing 15 to 20 rehabilitation loans annually to low-
                              and moderate-income single-family homeowners;
                             Adopting the Affordable Housing Ordinance and
                              establishing the Affordable Housing Trust Fund;
                             Forming the Housing Breans Advisory Board to provide
                              community input into the City’s housing efforts;
                             Adopting the Neighborhood Enhancement Plan to pro-
                              actively address the problem of physically deteriorating
                              neighborhoods;
                             Creating the Rental Rehabilitation and Assistance Program
                              and upgrading two rental properties containing 67 units;
                             Refinancing the bond issue on the 122-unit Town and
                              Country Apartments and providing 50 rent-restricted units
                              to very low- and low-income households; and

                                      communities
Comparison of 1989-          According to the 1989 Housing Element, the City had a total
   1994 RHNA with            regional housing need (RHNA) of 1,600 units to be produced
  Units Constructed          between 1989 and 1994, including 237 very low-, 285 low-, 362
   during 1989-1997          moderate-, and 716 upper-income units. While the RHNA
                             originally covered the 1989 to 1994 planning period, the RHNA
                             has been extended through December 1997 based on direction
                             from the State Department of Housing and Community
                             Development to reflect the revised housing element cycle.
                             Housing developed as of January 1998 is applied to the City’s
                             future RHNA for the 1998-2005 period.
                             Recognizing that the production goals established by the 1989-
                             1994 RHNA were unrealistically high based on historic levels of
                             development, the City established a more attainable objective of
                             constructing 800 new housing units, with the same income mix as
                             the RHNA. Table HE-36 summarizes the City’s RHNA and
                             Housing Element objectives, and provides a comparison with
                             actual levels of production.

                             Based on a review of Building Department records, a total of 578
                             units have been developed in the City between 1989 and 1997.
                             This shortfall in housing production in contrast to both the RHNA
                             and the Housing Element objectives is primarily the result of the
                             economic recession which impacted most of the State in the early
                             to mid 1990s. The RHNA was developed prior to the recession
                             and assumed that the economic prosperity experienced in the late
                             1980s would continue in the 1990s. In actuality, housing
                             BREA GENERAL PLAN
                                             3-81

construction activities were significantly lower than the levels
projected by SCAG throughout the region.
Because all of the housing projects developed in Brea since 1989
have received some type of assistance from the Redevelopment
Agency, it is possible to determine the distribution of the units by
income category. While Brea fell short in total production, the
City supported a higher proportion of very low-income units than
specified by the RHNA. A comparison between actual production
figures and the 1989 objectives indicate that the City was
extremely close to meeting its objective for very low-income
households (only 5 units short) despite the recession, reflecting the
active involvement of the Redevelopment Agency in the provision
of affordable housing. Units for very low- to moderate-income
households accounted for nearly half of the total units developed
since 1989.

                                      Chapter 3: Housing Element
Removal of Governmental Constraints
GOAL 4.0   To mitigate any potential governmental
           constraints      to    housing     production     and
           affordability.
Policy 4.1 Offer financial and/or regulatory incentives where
           feasible to off-set or reduce the costs of developing
           affordable housing.

           3-85

Policy 5.4     Continue to provide opportunities for public input
               and representation in the City’s housing efforts
               through the Housing Breans Advisory Board.
C. HOUSING PROGRAMS
The goals and policies contained in the Housing Element address
Brea’s identified housing needs, and are implemented through a
series of housing programs offered through the Development
Services Department and Redevelopment Agency.               Housing
programs define the specific actions the City will undertake to
achieve the stated goals and policies. According to Section 65583
of the State Government Code, a city’s housing programs must
address the following five major areas:
       Conserving the existing supply of affordable housing;
       Assisting in the provision of housing;
       Providing adequate sites to achieve a variety and diversity
        of housing;
       Removing governmental constraints as necessary; and
       Promoting equal housing opportunity
Brea’s housing plan for addressing unmet needs, removing
constraints, and achieving quantitative and qualitative objectives is
described in this section according to the above five areas. The
housing programs described on the following pages include
existing programs as well as several new programs which have
been added to address the City’s unmet housing needs. The
program summary (Table HE-37) included at the end of this
section specifies for each program the following: five-year
objective(s), funding source(s), and agency responsible for
implementation of the program.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
               3-86

                                        Chapter 3: Housing Element
CONSERVING THE EXISTING
SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE
HOUSING
Conserving and improving the housing stock is an important goal
for Brea. Approximately one-third of the housing stock is 30 years
or older, the age when most homes start to have rehabilitation
needs. By adopting the Neighborhood Enhancement Plan, the
City has taken a pro-active approach to conserving its current
housing stock. The six focus neighborhoods identified by this Plan
as evidencing physical deterioration are now specifically targeted
for City housing improvement assistance.
1. Neighborhood Enhancement Plan
Adopted in 1998, Brea’s Neighborhood Enhancement Plan sets
forth a comprehensive program to address deteriorated housing
conditions in six focus neighborhoods, identified previously in
Figure HE-10. The Plan proposes the following programs within
the neighborhood focus areas: 1) assistance to non-profit
organizations for the purchase and rehabilitation of multi-family
units; 2) specific programs based on the “critical need” found
within the neighborhood; and 3) a rehabilitation loan program for
single- and multi-family properties. An initial community outreach
event is conducted in each neighborhood to receive input from
the community and provide information on available programs,
followed by a neighborhood clean-up day. Implementation of
programs under the Neighborhood Enhancement Plan is critical to
improving the quality of housing in the City.
Five-year Objective: The City will undertake program activities
identified in the Neighborhood Enhancement Plan to facilitate
neighborhood upgrading in the six focus areas.
2. Single-Family Rehabilitation
Program
Brea offers several housing rehabilitation programs for lower
income (80 percent MFI) single-family homeowners, including low
interest loans, deferred payment loans, and rebates.           The
maximum loan amount is $35,000, although loan amounts
typically vary from $15,000 to $25,000. Homeowners may
receive loans to address the following types of problems: painting,
BREA GENERAL PLAN
               3-87

plumbing, leaks, sagging ceiling, electrical problems, termite
damage, damaged floor tile and carpeting, poor drainage,
crumbling chimney, roof leaks and related improvements. The
City may also provide funding for room additions to alleviate
overcrowded conditions. The City conducts a focused marketing
of housing rehabilitation programs in the Neighborhood
Enhancement areas both through the initial outreach events, and
through targeted mailing of program brochures.
Five-year Objective: The City will continue to provide
rehabilitation loans to qualified lower income homeowners. The
objective is to issue eighteen (18) loans annually.
3. Rental Rehabilitation and Assistance
Program
The Rental Rehabilitation and Assistance Program provides
rehabilitation and refinancing loans to qualified owners of rental
properties and mobile home parks. The loans are funded by
Federal HOME grants and redevelopment housing set-aside funds.
Typical loan amounts range between $10,000 to $20,000 per
affordable unit with fixed interest rates and 30-year terms. These
loans make it possible for apartment and/or mobile home park
owners to adhere to the highest standards of housing maintenance.
In return for the loans, property owners must: (1) maintain
affordable rent levels for a portion of the units as determined by
the Redevelopment Agency; (2) provide property maintenance
covenants; and (3) provide and maintain a significant level of
affordability for the long term.
Five-year Objective: The City will continue to inform owners of
apartments and mobile home parks about the Rental
Rehabilitation Program. The objective is to rehabilitate twenty-five
(25) units annually and to focus the program in the six
Neighborhood Enhancement areas especially for single-family
rental properties with low-income tenants.
4. Multi-family Housing Acquisition
and Rehabilitation
A key program in Brea’s overall strategy to provide affordable
housing to lower income households is through the acquisition and
rehabilitation of aging and/or deteriorating apartment complexes.
Under this program, the Agency acquires a problem apartment
complex and then sells the project to a non-profit housing provider
BREA GENERAL PLAN
                3-88

                                          Chapter 3: Housing Element
which in turn coordinates the rehabilitation, maintenance, and
management of the project as long term affordable housing. The
Redevelopment Agency has demonstrated that this is a successful
program and is integral to improving the City’s aging stock of multi-
family rental units.
Five-year Objective: The City will identify apartments in need of
rehabilitation, and cooperate with non-profit housing corporations
to acquire and rehabilitate the units. Projects will be focused in
the Neighborhood Enhancement areas to contribute to
revitalization efforts in these neighborhoods.
5. Senior Subsidy Program
As a means of addressing the affordable housing needs of its senior
renter population, Brea has established a rent subsidy program for
very low-income seniors. Seniors participating in the program are
allowed to apply the subsidy towards rent at the dwelling of their
choice. Presently, the program provides approximately 120
seniors with $171 per month each in rent subsidies. As a
testimony to the high demand for rental assistance, there are
currently close to 100 seniors on the waiting list under the
program.
Five-year Objective: The City’s objective is to provide rental
subsidies to approximately 120 to 130 seniors annually.
6. Section 8 Rental Assistance Program
The Section 8 Rental Assistance Program extends rental subsidies
to very low-income households who spend more than 30 percent
of their gross income on housing. Rental assistance not only
addresses housing affordability, but also overcrowding by allowing
families that may be “doubling up” to afford their own housing.
The Orange County Housing Authority coordinates Section 8
rental assistance on behalf of the City, with 51 households
currently participating in the program.
Five-year Objective: The City’s objective is to continue current
levels of Section 8 rental assistance, and to direct eligible
households to the County program.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
                3-89

ASSISTING IN THE PROVISION OF
HOUSING
To enable more households to attain homeownership in Brea, the
City offers two mortgage assistance programs: the Homebuyer
Assistance Program and the Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC).
These programs are very important given that housing prices in
Brea rank among the highest in north Orange County. The
Redevelopment Agency actively works with both non-profit and
for profit developers in the production of affordable for-sale and
rental housing. The City has also adopted an Affordable Housing
Ordinance to ensure that future market-rate housing developments
provide a portion of units affordable to low- and moderate-income
households.
7. Homebuyer Assistance Program
The Homebuyer Assistance Program is funded by redevelopment
housing set-aside funds, and provides 30-year second mortgages to
help low- and moderate-income families purchase homes in Brea.
The second mortgage provided helps the homebuyer to bridge the
gap between the first mortgage the buyer can afford and the
purchase price of the home. Participants make no payments for
the first five years of the loan. Instead of collecting interest, the
Redevelopment Agency shares in the appreciation of the homes
when it is sold. To be eligible, families must meet the specified
income requirements and be able to pay a 5-percent
downpayment on their home. The maximum sales price for a
home through the program in 1999 is $248,000. The maximum
price of a home purchased in conjunction with the Mortgage
Credit Certificate program (described below) is $204,937 for an
existing home and $229,883 for a new home.
Five-year Objective: The City’s objective is to provide loans to
fifteen (15) households annually through the Homebuyer
Assistance Program.
8. Mortgage Credit Certificate
The Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) program is a federal
program that allows qualified first-time homebuyers to take an
annual credit against federal income taxes of up to 15 percent of
the annual interest paid on the applicant’s mortgage. This enables
homebuyers to have more income available to qualify for a
mortgage loan and make the monthly mortgage payments. The
BREA GENERAL PLAN
                3-90

                                        Chapter 3: Housing Element
value of the MCC must be taken into consideration by the
mortgage lender in underwriting the loan and may be used to
adjust the borrower’s federal income tax withholding. The MCC
program has covenant restrictions to ensure the affordability of the
participating homes for a period of 15 years. MCCs can be used in
conjunction with the Homebuyer Assistance Program.
Five-year Objective: Through the County, the City will continue
to provide MCCs to qualified first-time homebuyers. The objective
is to provide four (4) MCCs per year depending on availability.
9. Affordable Housing Development
For-profit and non-profit housing developers play an important
role in providing affordable housing in Brea. The City has
provided land, regulatory incentives, and direct financial assistance
to a number of developers to provide both ownership and rental
housing to low- and moderate-income households. In recent
years, the Redevelopment Agency has worked with The Olson
Company, a for-profit developer, on a number of affordable
housing developments. Non-profits active in Brea include Habitat
for Humanity of Orange County, Neighborhood Housing Services
of Orange County (NHS), and the Caritas Corporation.
Five-year Objective: The City will continue to provide financial
and regulatory incentives to private developers to increase the
supply of affordable housing in Brea. The City will focus a portion
of Agency assistance towards rental projects which meet the needs
of very low- and low-income renters, and large families.
10. Affordable Housing Ordinance
In 1993, the City adopted the Affordable Housing Ordinance
which requires developers of residential projects with 20 or more
units to allocate 10 percent of the units for housing affordable to
low- and moderate-income households (provided that the City
determines the provision of the affordable units does not make the
project economically infeasible). The Redevelopment Agency can
approve various financial or regulatory incentives to off-set the
costs of developing the affordable units required by the
Ordinance. These incentives include: density bonus, flexible
development standards, deferral of development impact fees, use
of building code alternatives, assistance in applying for public
funds, redevelopment set-aside funds, and any other legal means.
At the discretion of the City, a developer may be allowed to pay
BREA GENERAL PLAN
               3-91

in-lieu fees instead of providing the required affordable units to be
deposited into an Affordable Housing Trust Fund.
Since adoption of the Ordinance in 1993, four projects have met
the 20-unit threshold, all of which opted to provide the required
affordable units on-site. With development now beginning to
occur in the City’s hillsides, it is likely many of these projects will
opt for payment of the in-lieu fee due to the high cost of
development in hillside locations.
Five-year Objective: The City will continue to utilize the
Affordable Housing Ordinance as a tool to integrate affordable
housing within market rate developments, or alternatively, to
generate fees in support of affordable developments in off-site
locations.
11. Housing Breans Advisory Board
The Housing Breans Advisory Board was formed to provide
community input into the City’s housing efforts. Specifically, the
Board has provided valuable input on the review of affordable
housing projects and programs, and has supported the City’s
efforts to provide quality housing opportunities to all economic
segments of the community. The Board currently has five
members, but may be expanded to include seven members.
Five-year Objective: The City will continue to conduct regular
meetings to involve the Housing Breans Advisory Board in the
City’s housing efforts.
PROVIDING ADEQUATE HOUSING
SITES
A major element in meeting the housing needs of all segments of
the community is the provision of adequate sites of all types, sizes
and prices of housing.          The City’s General Plan, Zoning
Ordinance, and specific plans dictate where housing may locate,
thereby affecting the supply of land available for residential
development.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
               3-92

                                         Chapter 3: Housing Element
12. Land Use Element
The Land Use Element of the General Plan provides for a variety of
housing types in Brea, with densities ranging from one unit per five
acres to 25 dwelling units per acre. Higher densities can be
achieved through the City’s density bonus provisions, senior
housing policy, and through development agreements. The Land
Use Plan provides for a net increase in over 2,600 units within the
current City limits, including 531 high density units.           This
residential development potential is more than adequate to
address the City’s share of regional housing needs, which are
identified as 1,052 dwelling units between 1998 and 2005. In
addition to a variety of development assistance programs, the City
maintains an inventory of available sites for future residential
development.
Five-year Objective: The City will continue to provide appropriate
land use designations and maintain an inventory of sites suitable
for residential development, coupled with incentives for the
development of affordable housing, to address its share of regional
housing needs.
13. Specific Plans
The majority of future housing growth within the City’s current
boundaries will occur within several specific plan areas: Birch Hills,
Olinda Heights, Carbon Canyon, and Brea Towne Plaza. Birch
Hills and Olinda Heights have the capacity to accommodate 475
units and 662 units, respectively, according to the specific plans
adopted in 1995. Carbon Canyon, the largest of the specific plan
areas, can accommodate over 1,000 units, including 343 high-
density units. The Brea Towne Plaza specific plan provides for in-
fill housing opportunities in the downtown area. The Towne Plaza
area has the capacity to support 2,800 dwelling units, over half of
which will be in medium to high density residential developments.
Five-year Objective: The City will ensure that the specific plans
are properly implemented to provide housing units of varying
types and costs.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
               3-93

14. Annexation of Areas in Sphere of
Influence
Brea has a sizable Sphere of Influence. The annexation of these
areas will increase the City’s capacity to accommodate future
housing growth. In addition, since any new housing development
will be subject to the City’s Affordable Housing Ordinance, which
requires 10 percent affordable units in projects with 20 or more
units, additional affordable housing will be provided in the Sphere
of Influence. If developers choose not to provide the required
units, then they will have the option of paying an in-lieu fee,
resulting in additional funds for affordable housing production.
Five-year Objective: The City will pursue phased annexation of
the Sphere of Influence to provide additional growth opportunities
consistent with infrastructure capacities.
REMOVING GOVERNMENTAL
CONSTRAINTS
Under current State law, the Housing Element must address, and
where legally possible, remove governmental constraints affecting
the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.
The following programs are designed to mitigate government
constraints on residential development and facilitate the
development of a variety of housing.
15. Regulatory and Financial
Assistance
Brea has strong track record in providing regulatory and/or
financial incentives to facilitate the development of affordable
housing. In addition to direct financial assistance, the City
provides the following incentives to for-profit and non-profit
developers to off-set or reduce the costs of providing affordable
housing: density bonus, deferral of development impact fees,
flexible development standards, use of building code alternatives,
assistance in applying for public funds as well as any other viable
means. Where direct Agency assistance is involved, the City
typically enters into a Development Agreement which provides
regulatory relief from density, parking, and other multi-family
development standards in exchange for affordable housing. The
City also uses the Administrative Adjustment Process to provide
BREA GENERAL PLAN
               3-94

                                          Chapter 3: Housing Element
flexibility in height, setback, open space, parking and other
requirements.
Five-year Objectives: The City will continue to offer regulatory
and/or financial incentives to facilitate the provision of affordable
housing by private developers. The City will periodically review all
regulations, ordinances, and residential fees related to housing
rehabilitation and/or construction to assess their impact on housing
costs, and revise as appropriate.
16. Efficient Project Processing
The City is committed to a streamlined development process, and
has adopted several procedures to facilitate project processing.
The Development Services Department provides “Screen Check,”
a free service designed to save developers time and money.
Screen Check allows a developer to meet with staff from various
City departments before actually filing an application that initiates
the development process. Through this service, a developer can
become aware of the City’s concerns about a project and address
them early prior to starting the development process.
Another way the City assists developers in project processing is
through the Guaranteed Second Opinion Program. Developers
are given the opportunity to ask for a second opinion on how a
regulation or policy is interpreted at any point during the permit
process.
Five-year Objective: The City will continue to offer streamline
development processing, and will periodically review departmental
processing procedures to ensure efficient project processing.
PROMOTING EQUAL HOUSING
OPPORTUNITIES
To adequately meet the housing needs of all segments of the
community, the housing plan must include program(s) that
promote housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race,
religion, sex, family size, marital status, ancestry, national origin,
color, age, or physical disability.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
               3-95

17. Fair Housing Program
The City uses the services of the Orange County Fair Housing
Council for fair housing outreach and educational information, fair
housing complaints, tenant/landlord dispute resolution, and
housing information and counseling. The role of the Council is to
provide services to jurisdictions, agencies, and the general public
to further fair housing practices in the sale or rental of housing.
Brea advertises the fair housing program through placement of fair
housing services brochures at the public counter, and through the
City’s newsletter.
Five-year Objective: The City will continue to promote fair
housing practices, and provide educational information on fair
housing to the public. The City will refer fair housing complaints
to the Orange County Fair Housing Council.

                    Brea will work to preserve and protect existing resources, and to
                    capture new resources as they become available. The City will
                    enhance its recreational facilities and look for ways to expand
                    parks and trails throughout Brea. With assistance from interested
                    organizations, creative solutions will be discovered and
                    implemented to preserve sensitive habitat areas. The hills that

      PARKS AND OPEN SPACE
      Parks and open spaces historically have provided passive greenery
      in urban areas, providing a refuge from the concrete environment
      with large green lawns, gardens, tall trees, and lakes and ponds.
      Many parks today, to meet the demands of a changing
      demographic, now serve as a location for active recreation, with
      sports and play facilities. As land continues to be developed and
      paved, and economic resources restricted or diverted, parks and
      open space have become increasingly difficult to acquire and
      fund. Nevertheless, parks and open space represent major,
      important resources in Brea, meeting both active and passive
      recreation needs and providing a source of aesthetic beauty.
      Carbon Canyon Regional Park and Chino Hills State Park create
      extensive stretches of scenic open space, but at the same time
      offer places where people can picnic, hike, throw a Frisbee, or ride
      a bike.

      Context
Parks Brea benefits from an assortment of neighborhood, community,
      and regional parks distributed throughout the community. Passive
      open space and park areas account for five percent of the land
      area within the corporate City limits. Chino Hills State Park alone,
      a natural wilderness park with hiking, biking, and equestrian trails,
      encompasses 3,400 acres.
      Classification and Standards
      The Brea park system consists of public neighborhood parks,
      community parks, and school grounds with joint-use agreements.
      Carbon Canyon and Craig regional parks, although located at least
      partially within Brea, are owned and maintained by Orange
      County.

meet the demands of their                 effective manner. Due to their size, school parks can offer broader

                                          comparable to a community park, with baseball fields, basketball

                                          Regional Park. Regional parks meet the recreational needs of a
                                          regional population and usually include a wide variety of active
                                          and passive recreation improvements. The environment in which
                                          the park is located influences the facilities available. Regional
                                          parks in urban areas can have a distinctive sports field focus,
                                          whereas a park within a natural open space area may offer only
                                          hiking or picnicking facilities. Night lighting of activity areas
                                          increases the availability and utilization of courts and playing field
                                          facilities.

                                       As noted above, the two regional parks in Brea – Carbon Canyon
                                       Regional Park and Craig Regional Park – are County parks. Carbon
                                       Canyon Regional Park covers 124 acres, with 60 acres designed for
                                       recreational uses and the remaining acreage maintained as natural
                                       open space, including a grove of Coastal Redwoods. This open
                                       space area provides a transition to the adjacent Chino Hills State
                                       Park. The park contains hiking and equestrian trails, and offers
                                       guided nature walks and fishing.
                                       Craig Regional Park, located between the SR-57 freeway and
                                       College State Boulevard, has 129 acres of rolling hills, baseball
                                       fields, open space, and a formal rose garden. The park is partially
                                       in Brea (14 acres), while the remaining portion of the park lies
                                       within the city of Fullerton.
                                       Other Recreation Areas.                  Chino Hills State Park covers
                                       approximately 13,000 acres in Orange, Riverside, and San
                                       Bernardino counties. The park largely consists of natural open
                                       space and thus provides wildlife habitat value as well as open
                                       space for people. Over 60 miles of trails allow hikers, equestrians,
                                       and bicyclists to enjoy native southern California oak woodlands,
                                       grasslands, and riparian areas, as well as views of the surrounding
                                       urban areas and mountains.

                 Recreation Programs
                 Recreation programs are an integral component of an overall park
                 and recreation system. Programs are addressed in the Community
                 Services Chapter.
Need and Service Brea has established a service standard of 5.0 acres of park and
                 recreation facilities per 1,000 residents. Based on the January 1,
          Areas  2002 population of 36,857 residents and park acreage of
                 approximately 331 acres within the planning area, the ratio is 9.0
                 acres of parkland for every 1,000 residents. With the regional
                 parks, Brea currently meets a high service standard. General Plan
                 land use policy set forth in the Community Development Chapter
                 could allow for up to 51,307 residents within the planning area. If
                 the current park acreage remained constant, the ratio would
                 reduce to 6.5 acres per 1,000 people.
                 While providing park acreage at or above the established
                 community standard is important, the City must also ensure that
                 park improvements and park locations respond to demographic
                 needs. Brea is a young city, with families attracted to the
                 community by the excellent school district. Children play sports,
                 and sports fields occupy significant acreage. For many years,
                 Breans have desired a dedicated sports park to meet increasing
                 demands and to reduce wear on long-used fields. The City has
                 planned for a sports complex aimed at organized recreational
                 youth sports such as Little League Baseball, the American Youth
                 Soccer Organization (AYSO), and similar youth sports
                 organizations. By 2005, such a facility should be in place on Birch
                 Street just west of Valencia Avenue, as the City and Brea-Olinda
                 Unified School District work together to create a joint school-park
                 facility.
                 BREA GENERAL PLAN
                                4-9

As the benefits of recreation activities are recognized to
individuals, families, and the community-at-large, the City
anticipates that strong demand for parks and recreation will
continue. New residential developments will be required to
dedicate land and/or pay fees to help the City maintain its
parkland standard, both in terms of overall acreage and facilities
appropriate to meet the needs of residents.
With regard to park location, service area standards recommended
by the National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA) indicate
that a park typically should cover a 1/2- to 1/4-mile service area
radius, depending on the size of the park. Larger parks, such as
Carbon Canyon Regional Park and Chino Hills State Park usually
have a much larger service area, meeting park demand beyond the
City of Brea.
Based on this standard, there are few areas in Brea that lack park
and recreation facilities except within Brea’s sphere of influence
(Figure CR-1). Park facilities within the Tomlinson Park Specific
Plan will relieve recreation demand in the Northwest
Neighborhoods not served by Woodcrest Park. The City will
carefully examine opportunities for public park space in Brea’s
sphere of influence whenever new development is proposed for
the area. Similarly, any new residential neighborhoods developed
east of Valencia Avenue in the City will be required to provide
local or community park facilities to meet the demand of new

In the Orange County General Plan, the Olinda Alpha Landfill is
designated as a future County Regional Park. Landfill properties
cover about 562 acres. Once the landfill has closed, the County’s
intent is to provide “urban-natural” and wilderness areas, and to
provide active and passive recreational opportunities.
Open Space
The Puente and Chino Hills form a backdrop to Brea that hearkens
back to its rural beginnings. The hills provide vast areas of open
space containing vital biological resources and wildlife habitat
areas. Approximately half of the open space areas within Brea’s
sphere of influence are privately held lands which have been, and
to a degree continue to be, exploited for the oil and gas that lie
beneath. Other property owners include the State of California
(Chino Hills State Park), Orange County (Olinda Alpha Landfill),
and the City of Industry.

                                     Boulevard.
The canyons that snake through the hillsides are dotted with oil
wells and oil production facilities. Many of these facilities have
been in operation for over 100 years, and in some areas, past
practices have eroded slopes and degraded natural habitat area.
As oil field operations have consolidated, however, nature has
displayed its tremendous resiliency by reclaiming stream valleys
and grass-covered hills. Wildlife use the hills as habitat and
movement corridors.       As open space throughout Southern
California continues to disappear, Breans increasingly value and
enjoy the open space areas that make Brea unique. As a
community, Brea has grown progressively more interested in issues
surrounding these open spaces.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
               4-11

Open space issues were the focus of seven separate planning
efforts between 1986 and 2001. These efforts included the 1986
Open Space Element of the General Plan, the Brea Project, the
Sphere of Influence Vision Building workshops, creation of a
Hillside Management Ordinance, the Open Space Task Force, and
the Parks, Recreation, Open Space and Human Services Master
Plan. Through these programs, the community identified the
preservation of open space as significant for three key reasons:
        Environmental Sensitivity: To preserve and protect
         resources, habitat, scenic and/or aesthetic areas
        Enhanced Recreation: For additional passive and active
         recreation areas
        Quality of Life: To preserve rural characteristics while
         maintaining or improving traffic, noise, and air quality

                                          recognized as vital to
                                          improving the quality of life.
Goals and Policies
The City’s role in providing parks, recreation, and open space
relates directly to community well-being, livability, and quality of
life.   The City is committed to providing, facilitating, and
supporting parks, recreation facilities and programs, and open
space of the highest quality and in a cost-effective manner to
enhance the living environment for all residents. Further, the City
believes that pursuits of the individual must be carefully examined
in light of the general public interest, and specifically the
conservation of natural resources.

           City is committed to continued investment in its parks as resources
           are available. The City is also committed to providing new
           facilities, especially in underserved areas or new types of facilities
           such as a sports park.

TRAILS
Accessibility between neighborhoods, employment centers, civic
and cultural areas, wilderness areas, schools, and other social and
natural places unifies the community. Pedestrian trails and
bikeways enhance community mobility and provide opportunities
for recreation and exercise. A well-defined, interconnected trail
system also reduces dependence on the automobile. The key is
designing a system comfortable, suitable, and safe for those who
wish to use it.
Trails in hillside areas allow access into open space and parkland
areas and provide recreational activities for the avid hiker,
mountain biker, naturalist, and equestrian. Urban trails increase
the connectivity within the urban fabric of a city. Cities and urban
centers are stronger and livelier when access is easily accomplished
by good public transportation, bicycling, or on foot. Brea can
enjoy both wilderness and urban trails through a trail system
designed to increase connectivity.

    urban setting, while others are in open space areas.
   Local Trails: These are public trails that serve a local purpose.
    The trails are usually short and may connect to the major and
    regional trails. The trails could be dedicated to a single use
    such as hiking or riding.

Staging Areas
Staging areas connect the urban and natural areas. They link an
existing public facility or street right-of-way to important parkland
or open space such as Chino Hills Park. A linkage normally
consists of two components: (1) a staging area where people can
gather and park and (2) the trail head. Additional staging areas are
needed at various points along Brea’s trail system to enhance
accessibility. Nine such staging areas have been identified in the
Trails Master Plan. These should be built out in conjunction with
related trail segments. Trail heads that include amenities for
hikers, bicyclists and equestrians to prepare for, start, and return
from hikes should be located strategically throughout the City of

                 Chino Hills State Park
                 Chino Hills State Park offers 13,000 acres of wilderness area and
                 over 65 miles of hiking, mountain bike riding, and horseback
                 riding trails. The trails allow for passive activities such as bird
                 watching, photography, and nature study, and access many of the
                 park’s secluded areas, including riparian areas, open grasslands,
                 and scenic view points. This system of trails should be integrated to
                 Brea’s proposed trail system to create a seamless network
                 connecting urban and wilderness areas.
                 A one-mile-long nature trail in Carbon Canyon Regional Park
                 provides access for hikers, bird watchers, and other amateur
                 naturalists to the park’s beautiful Redwood Grove. The park also
                 contains an equestrian trail.
                 The opportunity to create trails in Carbon and Tonner Canyons
                 and across other hillside properties not within Chino Hills State
                 Park will exist as the properties become publicly owned or are
                 acquired by private conservation organizations interested in
                 opening properties to public access.                Additionally, any
                 development proposal can be conditioned to provide public trails
                 consistent with the City’s Trails Master Plan.
Urban Trails and Walking is a common leisure and recreational activity, as well as a
                 means to get around town; the urban environment should be
      Sidewalks
                 amendable to those who like to walk and particularly to school
                 children. Sidewalks should be continuous and part of a system
                 that provides access to goods, services, schools, and homes.
                 Creating an extended network of sidewalks that are comfortable
                 and safe for pedestrians increases accessibility and creates “eyes on
                 the street” in residential neighborhoods. Figure CR-2 illustrates the
                 network of urban and walkway trails that will link all parts of Brea.

                                    Chapter 4: Community Resources
In a built-out urban environment like Brea, creating
pedestrian/bike ways separated from the street is difficult.
However, the rail right-of-way that extends more than four miles
from Valencia Avenue west to the western City accesses several
activity centers (Figure CR-2). Throughout California and the
nation, communities have acquired such rights-of-way to create
multi-purpose trails, and Brea aims to accomplish the same. Issues
that will need particular consideration in establishing the trail
include user safety, interface with adjacent residential
neighborhoods, easy and safe access, maintenance, and
connectivity to other trails and walkways.
                                           Trail opportunities await
                                           along the rail right-of-way.
On the street system, Brea will provide improvements to
encourage walking and biking, particularly between residential
neighborhoods and schools and parks, as well as to commercial
centers. Improvements will take the form of landscaped buffers
between the road and sidewalk, and/or dedicated trails where
adequate right-of-way exists. Sidewalks should be wide and
spacious, with decorative accent paving materials located at major
intersections and pedestrian crosswalks along the route.
Intersections will be designed to allow easy crossings and to alert
motorists to pedestrians. Key roadways to receive such treatment
include:
        Lambert Road
        Brea Boulevard south of Lambert Road
        Birch Street east and west of SR-57
        Valencia Avenue
        Elm Street between Arovista Park and Craig Regional Park
        Kraemer Boulevard
        Berry Street
        Puente Street
BREA GENERAL PLAN
               4-23

Special design studies of Birch Street will be conducted to
determine an appropriate mixed-use path that links Downtown to
the Civic and Cultural Center and Brea Mall, and neighborhoods
east of SR-57 to the new sports park and middle school.
Flood control rights-of-way represent additional areas where trails
can be established, where it is safe to do so. The Trails Master
Plan (Figure CR-2) incorporates channels.
                                                Trees and other
                                                landscaping provide a
                                                pleasant atmosphere
                                                for the pedestrian.
Bikeways
Bikeways form an important component of Brea’s recreation and
circulation system. The Circulation section of the Community
Development Chapter addresses bicycle paths.
Goals and Policies
All types of trails will work together to allow easy transition from
urban trails to wilderness trails and back again.                   New
developments will require incorporation into the trail system and
removal of potential barriers to the trail network.

                 WILDLIFE HABITAT
                 Preserving and protecting wildlife habitat equates to the
                 preservation and protection of wildlife species. The great diversity
                 of vegetation types and habitat located in the hillsides of Brea
                 support a wide variety of animal populations. Natural habitat such
                 as riparian areas provides food, cover, and shelter for birds,
                 mammals, reptiles and insects. Wildlife corridors provide areas of
                 undisturbed open space that allow regional wildlife migration
                 between natural habitats, promoting proliferation of indigenous
                 species.
                 Why is it important to preserve wildlife and promote biodiversity?
                 Biological systems have interrelated dependencies, and they
                 require options and opportunities to survive. If we protect habitat,
                 we increase the probability that important and critical species will
                 survive and flourish. Wildlife and the habitat they live in enhance
                 our own life experiences. Creating the balance between habitat
                 preservation and meeting people’s needs for housing, jobs, and
                 resources represents a key planning challenge.
                 Context
                 The Puente and Chino Hills above Brea are just part of a much
                 larger natural area that extends to the Santa Ana Mountains and
                 Cleveland National Forest to the west. The Cleveland National
                 Forest contains an enormous amount of natural open space and
                 habitat for animals, stretching from San Bernardino County to San
                 Diego County. Incremental transformation of wilderness to urban
                 uses, including areas of Brea, has significantly reduced and will
                 continue to reduce habitat for wildlife species and sever
                 connections to larger habitat resources.
Wildlife Species Among the diverse wildlife species within the Brea planning area
                 are sensitive species, some of which have protected status under
                 the federal Endangered Species Act and various California statutes.
                 “Sensitive” means any wildlife species native to California that is
                 vulnerable or declining and is likely to become endangered or
                 threatened in a significant portion of its range within the State
                 without cooperative management or removal of threats.
                 Some of the larger mammals known to inhabit the hills, and
                 sometimes visit urban areas on the hillside fringes, include
                 mountain lions, deer, and coyotes. Large birds and raptors such as
                 hawks, owls, falcons, eagles, and vultures have been observed

foraging and nesting.             Smaller birds sighted include wrens,
gnatcatchers, quails, babblers, starlings, crows, ravens,
woodpeckers, flycatchers, and hummingbirds. Sensitive species
confirmed include mountain lions, Cooper’s hawk, golden eagle,
coastal cactus wren, California gnatcathcher, least Bell’s vireo,
coastal western whiptail lizard, northern red diamond rattlesnake,
black-bellied salamander, Monterey salamander, and the
southwestern pond turtle.1

                                                                  Brea hills,
                                                                  especially along
                                                                  the canyons in
                                                                  Chino Hills State

More than 200 species of birds and mammals, numerous reptiles
and amphibians, and thousands of types of insects and other
invertebrates live within Chino Hills State Park. Because of its
great variety of habitats and microclimates, the park is an ideal
location for observing many wildlife species native to Southern
California. Coyotes, deer, bobcats and other mammals are often
seen in the woodlands, scrub, and grasslands. The local diversity of
native plants and animals found here in the Southern California
basin is greater than in any other area of comparable size in the
United States.

Wildlife Corridors Wildlife corridors are links connecting large patches of habitat that
                   have become separated by the process or urbanization or
                   otherwise made unavailable for use by native wildlife. They allow
                   for the free movement of wildlife between disjunct habitats and
                   thereby provide access to mates, food, and water; diminish
                   competition for resources by facilitating the dispersal of dense
                   populations; and serve as escape routes from fire, predators,
                   humans, and urbanization.
                   Wildlife corridors are considered an important declining resource
                   in California because ongoing urbanization has separated
                   remaining natural open space, interrupting wildlife movement and
                   isolating populations. The primary threats to wildlife connectivity
                   in the Southern California region include urbanization, roads,
                   invasive species, and agriculture.2 Scientific studies have shown
                   that the isolation of habitat can lead to ecosystem collapse. Small,
                   isolated areas of habitat simply cannot support as many species in
                   a larger area.
                   The Puente and Chino Hills have become increasingly isolated by
                   the conversion of the surrounding natural landscape to urban uses.
                   The Puente and Chino Hills and Santa Ana Mountains together
                   encompass about 511,000 acres of wildlands. This area supports
                   important biological resources, including several rare and endemic
                   communities. Large blocks of habitat ridgelines along the Puente
                   and Chino Hills allow wildlife to move throughout the hills and
                   into the large open spaces of Chino Hills State Park and the
                   Cleveland National Forest.
                   Chino Hills State Park and the Puente and Whittier Hills are linked
                   via the Tonner Canyon and Sonome Canyon wildlife corridors, as
                   illustrated in Figure CR-3. Tonner Canyon is considered a major
                   wildlife movement corridor, providing year-round water and
                   shelter for small and large mammals. The Tonner Canyon wildlife
                   crossing at the intersection of SR-57 and Tonner Canyon Road
                   provides wildlife access beneath the freeway. However, the
                   Sonome Canyon wildlife corridor is bisected by Carbon Canyon
                   Road, where several culverts pass under the road. These culverts
                   are considered inadequate for larger mammals such as deer and
                   mountain lions because of their size. Animals must cross Carbon
                   Canyon Road at grade and avoid automobiles in order to leave
                   Chino Hills State Park through the corridor.3

                                       Wildlife Corridor Conservation Authority (WCCA)
                                       The Wildlife Corridor Conservation Authority (WCCA) is a local
                                       joint powers authority represented by city and State agencies. The
                                       mission of WCCA is to provide for the proper planning,
                                       conservation, environmental protection, and maintenance of the
                                       habitat and wildlife corridor between the Puente Hills in the west
                                       and the Chino Hills in the east, which connects to the Cleveland
                                       National Forest, and the east-west connections between Chino
                                       Hills State Park and the Prado Basin.
                                       Plant Communities and Habitat
                                       The following paragraphs describe major plant communities within
                                       the planning area. Each plant community contains unique features
                                       and supports a variety of wildlife species.
                                       Chaparral Habitat
                                       Chaparral consists of evergreen, medium-height to tall shrubs
                                       which commonly cover hills and slopes of Southern California.
                                       This community is highly adapted to drought and fire conditions.
                                       Shrub canopy cover is generally continuous. California sagebrush
                                       and California buckwheat occur within the understory of larger
                                       shrubs. The chaparral community is ecologically fitted to a cycle of
                                       fire destruction. Periodic fires help preserve the mixes of plant
                                       species and reduce the danger of a more catastrophic fire.

Chaparral provides food and cover for reptiles, birds, rodents,
coyote, and deer.
Grassland Habitat
Grasslands consist of low herbaceous vegetation dominated by
grasses. They thrive in deep, well developed soils on gentle slopes
and flats, mostly at low elevations. Three types of grassland are
found in the area: native grasslands, non-native annual grasslands,
and ruderal grasslands. The grasslands are green during the rainy
season and spring, but with the advent of summer dry into a
golden mantle. The grasslands must be managed to prevent fire
hazards and the intrusion of weed species, chaparral, and invasive
plants such as star thistle. Grasslands provide forage for cattle and
other grazing animals, and habitat for small reptile, rodents, deer,
coyote, songbirds, and birds of prey.
Riparian Habitat
A riparian community is a combination of plant species that thrive
along intermittent and perennial waterways. These waterways can
be found at the bottom of the many canyons found in the hillsides,
including Brea, Carbon, Tonner, Sonome, Soquel, and Telegraph
Canyons.      Creeks and streams and the associated riparian
vegetation provide wildlife habitat, stormwater drainage, visual
backdrops, and recreation corridors.            Riparian habitats are
considered among the most valuable habitats for wildlife because
of the presence of water, lush vegetation, and high insect
populations.      Riparian habitat provides cover and food for
numerous animals and nesting birds. Many nesting birds are
migratory species that come to the streamside habitats from
Central and South America each spring to raise their young.
Sage Scrub Habitat
Sage scrub can be defined as low-drought-deciduous and
evergreen shrubs that occur on steep to moderate slopes mostly
below 3,000 feet in elevation. It is considered a sensitive habitat
due to its potential to support threatened and endangered species.
Common animal species include deer, rabbit, bobcat, and coyote,
as they utilize the scrub habitat as part of a larger home range.

                                                (Artemisia californica),
                                                is a low ashy-gray shrub
                                                found throughout
                                                Brea’s planning area.
Woodland Habitat
Woodland is a plant community with a diverse mix of tree species
forming a dense overstory of vegetation. Woodlands in Brea are
primarily located on the north and east facing slopes if the
canyons. Common trees in the woodland community include
coastal and interior live oaks, balk oak, valley oak, California bay
laurel, buck eye, and madrone. Insect- or seed-eating birds and
mammals are common in the woodlands and are preyed upon by
raptors and owls that also inhabit these areas. The larger mammals
utilize these areas as well, including deer, coyote, and foxes.
Diversity is perhaps the most important feature of the vegetation
found within Chino Hills State Park and surrounding hillsides.
Within creek and riparian areas, cattail stands provide habitat for a
variety of wildlife. Along seasonal and year-round creeks, the
willow and sycamore woodlands have understories of wild rose,
stinging nettle, and mule fat. Southern California black walnut
trees, sycamores, and coast live oaks form woodlands above the
creeks, often on north facing slopes. These walnut woodlands are
another important and rare plant community preserved in Chino
Hills State Park and undisturbed hillside areas. Only a few
thousand acres of this California habitat still exist, with about one
thousand acres in preserves. Several hundred acres are protected
at Chino Hills State Park.

                           Mugwort (Artemisia) can be found on hillside
                           along Carbon Canyon Regional Park.
The Tecate cypress is another special type of plant community
found only in a few places in the United States. Several different
scrub and chaparral communities along the hills and slopes above
the canyon floors include coastal sage scrub, California sagebrush,
California buckwheat, and purple sage, as well as a mixed
chaparral community dominated by laurel sumac and toyon.
Many California wildlife species depend on these scrub and
chaparral communities for survival. Because these communities
are disappearing as urban development continues, they form an
increasingly important part of the biological resources protected in
the park.
Most of the grassland in the park is non-native annual European
grasses that were introduced here during the early ranching years.
However, grassland species native to California, such as purple
needle grass and giant rye can be found among the annuals. An
active grassland restoration program in the park is restoring native
grassland to its more natural and dominant state.
Goals and Policies
Brea has resolved to protect wildlife habitat by preserving wildlife
corridors and the vegetation communities that make up the
habitat areas. While many thousand acres receive protection
due to their location within Chino Hills State Park, the difficulty
lies in maintaining linkages to valuable habitat on private
BREA GENERAL PLAN
               4-33
                   property. Without financial resources to purchase the properties
                   worthy of permanent open space status, the City must look to
                   creative approaches. Land use policy set forth in the Community
                   Development Chapter provides incentives to land owners to
                   avoid sensitive areas whenever development is proposed. The
                   City fully supports efforts of conservation agencies and
                   organizations to purchase properties for preservation.
Wildlife Corridors Preserving wildlife corridors allow animals to move freely between
                   large open space areas from protection of predators, urbanization,
                   and wildland fires, and to further promote their individual species.
                   When future improvements to roads are undertaken, including
                   capacity increases planned for the regional transportation system,
                   the construction or enhancement of suitable wildlife crossings,
                   such as bridges or culverts, will be required to maintain corridor
                   function and biological viability.
                   Goal CR-8       Preserve and maintain wildlife and animal

              SCENIC RESOURCES
              Scenic resources enhance the visual character of the community
              and provide distinguishing characteristics, an invaluable asset that
              benefits a community. The scenic qualities of the Puente and
              Chino Hills include prominent ridgelines, scenic corridors and
              canyons, view corridors and vista points, roadways through
              undisturbed habitat, highways, and natural landscaping (Figure CR-
              4). The drive through Brea Canyon reminds a motorist of the
              region’s ranching and oil producing heritage and provides an easy
              transition into the urban environment.
              Context
Hillsides and The hillsides above Brea offer several scenic benefits to the
              community. They are used as landmarks and offer a sense of
  Ridgelines
              direction or orientation to people moving about. Hillsides create
              edges that may define an area or watershed. They beckon people
              to a sanctuary from the urban environment.
              Breans imagine a future that preserves the hillsides to the
              maximum extent possible. As discussed above, this means
              balancing the desire with recognition of private property rights. A
              key concept of this General Plan is to define permitted land use
              intensities within remaining open hillside areas in a manner
              consistent with the vision. Land use development intensities and
              corresponding performance standards in the Community
              Development Chapter, implemented largely through the Hillside
              Management Ordinance, aim at maximizing the amount of hillside
              area left in its natural state. Strategies include limiting densities
              and grading, prohibiting development on identified significant
              ridgelines, and encouraging clustered development on flatter
              portions of development sites.

Vistas Vista points can be found throughout Brea both from urban areas
       toward the hills and from wilderness areas looking back onto Brea.
       The landscape in Chino Hills State Park has been relatively
       unaltered by the works of man, especially compared to the
       surrounding environment. Long distance views of natural terrain
       and vegetation can be found throughout the park. The Chino
       Hills State Park Master Plan emphasizes acquiring ridgelines and
       ridgetops to protect viewsheds within the park.4 Pristine views of
       the hills from Telegraph Canyon and from selected panoramic
       points have been mostly protected from urban encroachments. A
       viewpoint of particular interest is Gilman Peak (1,685-foot
       elevation) located in the park. Main trails take hikers and cyclists
       to points with breathtaking views of Orange County and the
       surrounding hills.
       The ridgelines from Sonome Canyon, Soquel Canyon, and Lions
       Canyon provide scenic view points of natural rolling hills with
       southern California black walnut and coast live oak trees found on
       the north-facing slopes.             Seasonal color transformations of
       vegetation throughout the year change from green during spring to
       golden brown during the summer.

             The SR-57 freeway between SR-60 and Imperial Highway is
             eligible as a California State Scenic Highway. Properties flanking
             the freeway lie within unincorporated Los Angeles and Orange
             counties. Designating the freeway as an Official Scenic Highway
             will require a cooperative effort among many agencies to maintain
             the scenic qualities by minimizing or avoiding hillside
             development, and working through the California Department of
             Transportation to assign the designation.
Urban Forest While trees add considerably to the aesthetics of Brea, “urban
             forests” also promote a good community environment and
             biological benefits. They contribute to clean air, provide cooling
             shade, support wildlife, and provide protection from high winds.
             The urban forest is comprised of the street tree system, trees on
             park and other public lands, and trees on private properties and in
             yards through out the City. The urban forest is distinct within the
             established areas of the City where trees have fully matured. The
             City is committed to preserving its existing trees, replacing trees
             that are damaged or dying, and expanding urban forests in newer
             areas of Brea.
                           London Plane (Platanus x acerifolia) trees planted along the
                           meandering sidewalk on Lambert Road provide relief from
                           the sun on afternoon walks.
             Goals and Policies
             Protecting Brea’s scenic resources will be carried out through the
             following goals and policies. Once a scenic resource, such as an
             oak tree grove, stream course, or a ridgeline is torn down and
             developed, it is lost forever. It is important to pursue options to
             protect and preserve scenic resources.

WATER CONSERVATION AND
QUALITY
Water resources sustain life in both the urban and natural
environments. In the communities where we live, an adequate
water supply and good water quality are taken for granted. In the
natural environment, water resources promote healthy ecosystems,
recharge groundwater basins, and create scenic corridors. Water
conservation policies and programs ensure that a healthful, reliable
supply of water remains available for future residents and prevents
deterioration of natural areas.
Context
In Brea, two water agencies supply the majority of drinking water:
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) and
the California Domestic Water Company (CDWC) in Whittier.
MWD supplies derive from surface water in the Colorado River
and the California Water Project, which draws water from the San
Francisco-San Joaquin Bay Delta. CDWC pumps water from wells
in the San Gabriel Valley. These two water sources are blended to
provide the water directly to households and businesses. Brea
purchases an average of 11,000 acre-feet per year, with
approximately 66 percent of the supply coming from MWD and
34 percent from CDWC.
The La Habra Groundwater Basin, located directly beneath the
City, has poor water quality that would require extensive treatment
and blending with higher quality water to meet the State’s public
health standards.
An abundance of perennial and intermittent streams course
through the canyons in the hillsides and Chino Hills State Park.
Carbon, Tonner, and Brea Canyons contain three primary trunk
streams that drain the Puente Hills and eventually flow into the
San Gabriel and Santa Ana Rivers. Carbon and Telegraph Canyon
Creeks are the headwaters above Carbon Canyon Dam. Brea
Canyon and Tonner Creeks drain into the Brea Dam reservoir
located in Fullerton. Three watersheds lie within the planning area:
Lower Santa Ana River, Carbon Creek, and San Gabriel
River/Coyote Creek.

            Conservation        Water should be regarded as a limited natural resource, and water
                                conservation     represents      the  most    cost-effective  and
                                environmentally sound way to reduce current and future demand
                                for this resource. Economic and financial incentives can be used
                                to encourage conservation and prudent use of water, although
                                sometimes legislative mandates are required. In response to State
                                law aimed at reducing water use for landscaping, in 1993 the Brea
                                City Council adopted Ordinance No. 932. Simple procedures
                                such as checking for leaks, changing to water-saving appliances,
                                using recycled wastewater, and other measures can encourage
                                efficient use and lead successfully to water conservation. Past
                                water use and projected water demand for Brea is presented in
                                Figure CR-5.

                                required by the State and federal regulatory agencies. In fact, in
                                many instances, the City goes beyond what is required to monitor
                                for additional contaminants that have known health risks.
                                The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the
                                California Department of Health Services (DHS) are the agencies
                                responsible for establishing drinking water quality standards. To
                                ensure that tap water is safe to drink, EPA and DHS prescribe
                                regulations that limit the amount of certain contaminants in water
                                provided by public water systems.
                                For many pollutants, the primary contributor to water pollution is
                                urban runoff. Runoff from streets, parking lots, commercial
                                businesses, and private yards may contain oil, grease, pesticides
                                and herbicides, heavy metals, paints and household chemicals,
                                construction materials, sediment, and eroded soil. Ultimately,

these materials end up in creeks and storm drains that lead directly
into the ocean, where they have caused substantial water quality
degradation over the past century.
Urban pollutants degrade water quality and impact wildlife and
plants dependent on aquatic habitat. The City is a co-permittee
with the County of Orange in the National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) program, which is designed to reduce
pollutants in runoff. According to the NPDES permit, all new
development projects and substantial rehabilitation projects will be
required to incorporate Best Management Practices (BMPs) as
identified in the County Drainage Area Master Plan (DAMP).
The Infrastructure Section of the Community Development
Chapter discusses in detail storm drain capacity and urban runoff.
Goals and Policies
As Brea grows, demand for water will increase. The following
goals and policies focus on maximizing water conservation, and on
promoting high water quality both in domestic supplies and
surface waters that flow into the regional facilities. The City
supports safe and practical applications of reclaimed water for
landscaping to reduce the demand on water supplies.
Goal CR-11          Conserve and protect water resources
                    through water conservation standards,
                    sustainable development practices, and
                    water quality standards.
Policy CR-11.1      Develop water conservation plans, standards,
                    and/or guidelines for all new construction
                    projects to address such issues as water-
                    conserving plumbing fixtures, on-site storm
                    water retention, drought-tolerant landscaping,
                    and gray water use.
Policy CR-11.2      Establish standards for the use of reclaimed
                    water for landscaping.
Policy CR-11.3      Base water use fees and charges on a system
                    that rewards conservation and discourages
                    consumption beyond standard levels.
Policy CR-11.4      Promote techniques and methods for water
                    conservation throughout the community.

                               and vegetation.
               Policy CR-11.6 Cooperate with regional agencies, such as the
                               Regional Water Quality Control Board, in their
                               efforts to improve surface and groundwater water
                               quality for all Southern Californians.
               Goal CR-12      Protect the beneficial uses of ground and surface
                               waters.
               Policy CR-12.1 To the maximum extent practicable, adopt and
                               enforce regulations and engage in educational
                               efforts to eliminate pollution from urban runoff.
               Policy CR-12.2 Evaluate development projects for compliance with
                               NPDES requirements, aiming toward reducing
                               pollutant loads in stormwater runoff, minimizing
                               impervious surface areas, and minimizing peak
                               flows.

AIR QUALITY
Every day, each of us breathes about 3,400 gallons of air. Yet our
air is contaminated on a daily basis by our activities: driving cars,
burning fossil fuels, and manufacturing chemicals. Although air
quality has improved since the 1960s despite substantial economic
expansion and population growth, further improvements are
needed. Air quality is a regional issue that does not respect
jurisdictional boundaries. Every city throughout the region must
accept a portion of the responsibility for addressing air quality
problems.

                                                        over Brea.
Context
Brea lies within the South Coast Air Basin, a geographic area that
extends from the Pacific Ocean north to the San Gabriel
Mountains and east to the San Bernardino and San Jacinto
Mountains. The Basin is a non-attainment area for federal and
State air quality standards for ozone and State standards for
particulate matter less than ten microns in diameter (PM10). The
South Coast Air Quality Management District regulates air quality
improvement programs within the Basin and works to improve
regional air quality to achieve federal and State standards.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
               4-47
Motor vehicles represent the major source of regional emissions
throughout the Basin and within Brea. Land use patterns which
poorly disperse housing densities, employment centers, and mass
transit facilities lead to excessive automobile usage. Most pollution
control strategies have aimed at reducing vehicle usage and using
cleaner-burning fuels. Other sources of air pollution include auto
repair businesses, dry cleaners, and businesses that regularly use
chemicals solvents. Common sources of PM10 include road dust,
construction activity, grading, and wood-burning stoves and
fireplaces. Brea has continued to work with the South Coast Air
Quality Management District and in accordance with the Air
Quality Management Plan to improve the regional transportation
system and regional air quality.
Energy conservation is strategy for improving air quality. Air
pollutants are generated by the combustion of fossil fuels to
produce electricity, and by the combustion of natural gas.
Reducing energy usage decreases the amount of pollutants
generated.       Energy requirement can be diminished through
innovative architectural design, building construction, structural
orientation, and landscaping.
Goals and Policies
Cooperation among all agencies in the Basin is necessary to
achieve desired improvements to air quality. Brea can participate
and contribute its share to those efforts by proper planning and
participation in regional air quality management programs.

                   Identifying, recognizing, preserving, rehabilitating, maintaining,
                   and treasuring the City’s historic resources creates an awareness
                   and appreciation for Brea’s heritage. Our past tells us who we are,

                   the community’s cultural and physical foundations.
                   Context
                   Brea contains a rich history, celebrated through events that took
                   place at original sites and structures that exist today. Brea’s history
                   includes a time period when sheep ranching, oil extraction, and
                   citrus production each represented the economic underpinning of
                   the Southern California region. The remaining homes, commercial
                   buildings, parks, and oil production facilities are just some of the
                   historic resources that help define and enhance the community’s
                   character. Public awareness of these historic resources has led to
                   the development of programs to aid in their preservation and
                   restoration. To protect Brea’s heritage, the community will
                   continue to identify and safeguard resources worthy of such
                   treatment, and ensure that new development enhances rather than
                   alters reminders of early Brea.
Early Brea History The properties comprising Brea were once part of the large land
                   holdings of the San Gabriel Mission that was established in 1771
                   by the Franciscan Padres. The mission land stretched along the
                   coastal areas of California from San Diego to Monterey. Vast herds
                   of Mexican cattle pastured on all the land in and surrounding Brea
                   during the Mission and Rancho periods. In 1863, thousands of
                   acres of Rancho lands, including Brea, were acquired by Abel
                   Stearns, a Los Angeles businessman who later leased much of his
                   land to sheep ranchers.
                   Beneath the hills in Brea lie what was once one of the world’s
                   richest deposits of oil. The Puente Hills and Brea Canyon
                   supported substantial petroleum production during the late 1800s.
                   By 1895, the Puente Hills Oil Company, started by William Lacy
                   and W.R. Roland, had approximately 30 oil wells in the Puente
                   Hills producing 700 barrels of oil a day. Union Oil Company was
                   also lured by the riches of Brea and began purchasing land for oil
                   production and leasing it out to other oil companies. The hillsides
                   were covered with wooden oil derricks and oil production
                   machinery.

The first real village in Brea was called Olinda, originally sited
where Carbon Canyon Regional Park lies. Olinda, literally
surrounded by hundreds of oil wells, was the workplace for many
of the oil field workers.        The village contained a church,
barbershop, livery stable, boarding house, dance hall, pump
house, Santa Fe Freight Depot, a school, and an oil storage tank.
In July 4, 1910, the Pacific Electric Railway connected Brea to La
Habra, Whittier, and other Los Angeles communities. The official
founding date for the town of Brea is January 19, 1911, with
incorporation in 1917 with a population of 732. Many of the
buildings of the original town were situated on Pomona Avenue
(current day Brea Boulevard). As a booming oil town, the City’s
population began to grow rapidly. Development of new housing,
businesses, and civic buildings began to shape current day Brea.
                                               The Craig building,
                                               completed in 1921,
                                               housed many
                                               important functions
                                               upstairs on the second
                                               floor. Brea’s post
                                               office and drugstore
                                               occupied the first
                                               floor. The building was
                                               located on the east
                                               side of Pomona
                                               Avenue (Brea
                                               Boulevard) just north
                                               of Birch Street.
Following the big oil boom, land in and around the City began
transforming from sheep ranches to orange groves.                  The
Bastanchury Ranch Company in La Habra, Fullerton, and Brea was
said to have the largest citrus groves in the world, which included
over 5,350 acres of orange groves during the 1920s. Union Oil
Company also realized the potential of turning over underutilized
properties to citrus production.
Post-World War II saw an increase in development. Many citrus
groves were plowed under and the land subdivided for greater
profits. Brea also saw major development in the manufacturing

              and industrial businesses. With Union Oil Company still a major
              employer in the City, many oil-related companies moved to Brea.
              In 1972, the SR-57 freeway made agricultural lands and oil lands
              surrounding Brea accessible to even more growth. Five years later,
              the Brea Mall opened, providing economic growth for the City
              while supplying retail opportunities for Breans and the region.
Preservation  In 1989, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 89-125
              establishing the Historical Committee. The Committee was
      Efforts subsequently eliminated in 1995 as it was only established as a
              temporary committee. The purpose of the Committee was to
              increase a level of awareness of Brea’s historical resources by
              establishing goals and policies to guide preservation. A key tool
              adopted toward this end was the 1994 Historic Preservation
              Ordinance, designed to promote the historic, cultural, educational,
              economic, and general welfare through a number of specified
              objectives.
              The Historic Preservation Ordinance establishes the Historic
              Resources Register and describes the procedures for designation
              and/or removal of individual historic resources. Identifying sites
              and structures with historical significance protects these resources
              from potential destruction and creates added awareness of historic
              resources that residents may not know exist. The Planning
              Commission is responsible for establishing and maintaining the
              Register, with input from the Historical Society. Structures and/or
              sites listed in the Register are eligible for a variety of preservation
              incentives provided by the City and various other State and local
              agencies. Figure CR-6 identifies key historic resources, and Table
              CR-2 identifies location, construction date, and a brief description
              for each.
              Many homes within Brea’s southwest residential neighborhoods
              date to the early twentieth century and display unique
              architectural qualities. A historic district represents one possible
              approach to preserving the integrity not just of individual structures
              but of blocks and neighborhoods.
              Brea Historical Society
              Founded in 1971, the Brea Historical Society collects and
              preserves the City’s historical materials and resources. This
              organization meets regularly and provides ongoing display,
              including historic oil equipment outside of the old City Hall. The
              collections include a large inventory of historic black-and-white
              photographs of Brea and residents.

                                         The Brea Historical Society and City Council recognize residents
                                         for renovating and restoring historic structures to reflect their time
                                         period with the Brea Historic Preservation Award. This award
                                         distinguishes residents’ hard work and pride of ownership, which
                                         allows for greater historic preservation awareness and
                                         acknowledgment.

                                         The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 is a federal
                                         law that establishes the legal and administrative context to
                                         encourage preservation of historic resources. In California, the
                                         NHPA is administered by the State Historic Preservation office
                                         (SHPO). The NHPA establishes criteria for inclusion into the
                                         National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The NRHP is an
                                         inventory of the United States' historic resources maintained by the
                                         National Park Service. The inventory includes buildings, structures,
                                         objects, sites, districts, and archeological resources. The listed
                                         properties are not necessarily significant nationally, rather most are
                                         significant primarily at the State or local level.

                                  were grouped together under one identification number by the
                                  NRHP when it was listed on May 5, 1984.
                                  Properties of historical importance in California are designated as
                                  significant resources in three State registration programs: State
                                  Historical Landmarks, Points of Historical Interest, and the
                                  California Register of Historical Resources.           State Historical
                                  Landmarks are sites, buildings, features, or events that are of
                                  statewide significance and have anthropological, cultural, military,
                                  political, architectural, economic, scientific or technical, religious,
                                  experimental, or other value.
                                  The original town site of Olinda (Figure CR-6) is listed as number
                                  918 on the State Historical Landmarks, as well as the California
                                  Register of Historical Resources. Although many of the original
                                  buildings located in Olinda were removed because of flooding
                                  from Carbon Canyon headwaters, several existing structures are
                                  still present today. They are the Doheny/Olinda Oil Well No. 1,
                                  the Jackline Building, an oil production field office, and what could
                                  have been the Olinda Township Jail House. These structures were
                                  all saved from the original oil operations on the site in the 1890s.
The original town site of Olinda, circa 1910, was made up of small homes and businesses on various oil
company properties. Olinda Road (Carbon Canyon Road) can be seen winding east (center) into Carbon
Canyon. Today’s Carbon Canyon Regional Park takes up most of the flat land on the right side of the picture.

                 Citizen Involvement
                 Brea’s senior service programs have the benefit of many
                 committees, commissions, councils, and boards which provide the
                 staff with insight, leadership, and guidance. These partners assist
                 with project fundraising, marketing of programs and services, and
                 community outreach. Citizen involvement groups include the
                 Senior Advisory Board, which identifies senior issues and concerns
                 throughout the community.          The Senior Center Leadership
                 Council, elected by their peers, provide input regarding the
                 operations and programming for the Senior Center. The Senior
                 Site Council is responsible for food distribution programs at the
                 Senior Center.

Community Needs
                Community Forum helped City leaders and service providers
                identify the long-range service needs of Breans. Key issues
                requiring attention are:
                       Affordable housing, particularly rental units
                       Affordable and quality childcare for children under five
                       Young teens (12-14 years) and older teens (15-18 years)
                        have different needs and prefer different activities. While
                        the Teen Zone provides a variety of activities, it is primarily
                        geared towards younger teens
                       Provide additional activities for older teens in Brea
                       Establish stronger working relationships between schools,
                        the Community Center, and parents
                       Affordable transportation is needed from Brea schools to

                        to the Brea Community Center
                       The transportation, housing, and service needs of seniors
                        continues to remain an important issue. Frail seniors,
                        seniors that require transportation assistance and the issue
                        of helping seniors maintain independence are of primary
                        concern
                       Appropriate after-school care
                       Providing services for parents, families and children that do

                Goals and Policies
                Human service programs assist in improving health and self-

these programs, Breans can remain active and healthy, and
interact with people with similar interests. (Goals, polices, and

                     activities, and services that offer youth and teens healthy outlets for
                     their energy and interests, and for involving adults in activities that
                     promote good health. Such programs will continue to be of
                     importance, and established practices of periodically assessing

EDUCATION SERVICES
Education is the foundation of a community. Education is at the
heart of economic prosperity and security; it channels creativity
and success and enriches lives. A community that values and
promotes education and learning benefits its residents and the
business sector. Public and private schools, extension centers, and
continued educational resources are most successful when they
have the support of students, families, City officials, and the
business community. These partnerships are essential to providing
quality education that all deserve.

                                    for all attending students.
Community Context
The City and the Brea Olinda Unified School District long ago
recognized the benefits of partnering to ensure that Brea’s youth
receive outstanding educational services. The District’s boundaries
largely correspond to the corporate City limits; thus, Breans feel as
though the City and School District represent one government
entity, even though the District, under California law, is a separate,
independent agency. The City and School District cooperate on
many fronts, from sharing athletic fields and meeting facilities, to
organizing educational programs.
The Brea Olinda Unified School District provides public school
educational services to children in grades kindergarten through
grade twelve. Test scores for Brea students consistently rank
among the highest in Orange County. A new state-of-the-art high
school campus opened in 1990, and Brea Olinda High School is
  BREA GENERAL PLAN
               5-13

one of the few in California to be part of the Knowledge Network
computer link-up.
Brea’s quality public schools attract young families. New home
construction and new families with children who are purchasing
existing residences have resulted in increased school enrollment
and strains on all District schools. The District has identified a
need for a new elementary school on the east side of Brea and
new junior high and high school classrooms and support facilities.
City staff and policy makers continue to cooperate with District
officials to help address the District’s long-term needs, including
developing a new joint-use sports park and school on Birch Street
east of the 57 freeway.
In addition to fine public schools, Brea is home to many private
schools such as St. Angela's School, Christ Lutheran School, and
Brea Olinda Friends Church School. Breans have identified a
need for additional post-secondary public and private educational
facilities in the community to build on the strong educational ethic
and create broad opportunities for all.
                                 Brea Olinda High School is located
                                 within the hills just east of the 57
                                 freeway and north of Lambert Road.
Goals and Policies
Every school in Brea is committed to providing a comprehensive
education for every student, fostering high academic achievement,
positive self-worth, and responsible citizenship. Brea’s schools are
a source of considerable community pride, as the City is well
known for its quality schools and teachers, extensive parent
involvement, and exceptional students. As the community grows

LIBRARY SERVICES
Libraries provide communities with diverse resources and services.
Libraries preserve culture and history and transmit them from one
generation to the next. They also provide social settings for
community activities, support of formal education, and provide
opportunities for individuals that can last a lifetime.
Community Context
The Brea Branch Library is part of the Orange County Public
Library community library network. The system includes 28
branches that provide many services to residents throughout the
County. The Brea Branch Library, located at the Brea Civic and
Cultural Center, shares a common lobby with the Brea Chamber of
Commerce. While Orange County operates the library, its
location within the Civic and Cultural Center illustrates the
importance the City places on ensuring convenient access to a key
community resource.

CULTURAL ARTS
The cultural arts humanize us. Through visual art, music, dance,
and other performance art we as humans express our emotions,
our convictions, and reach out to share these feelings with others.
Simply put, the arts bring us together as a community.
Brea has long recognized the importance and value that cultural
arts bring to the community. Through its various cultural art
programs, facilities, and activities, as well as being home to one of
the nation’s largest outdoor public art sculpture collections, Brea
has earned the reputation as one of Orange County’s foremost arts
and cultural centers. This ongoing support of the arts has been
achieved through City programs, commissions, volunteers, and
private and public sector support. Brea’s diversity of cultural arts
programs, services, and activities has become a source for
community education and enrichment, and have added to the
special qualities that distinguish Brea from other communities.

                     Council passed a resolution to implement the Art in Public Places
                     Program. The primary goal of this innovative program is to provide
                     permanent outdoor art work throughout the City accessible to the
                     general public. Art works installed and funded by private
                     developers create unique public spaces and help distinguish

                     I     magine Brea, where public safety is a high priority and
                           residents feel protected from hazards. Imagine Brea, where
                           proactive planning addresses how to mitigate hazards, such
                    as crime, flood hazards, earthquake effects, urban and wildland
                    fires, and noise exposure. Imagine rapid and effective emergency
                    response. Imagine quiet residential neighborhoods designed to
                    minimize traffic and other noise sources. Imagine urban and
                    wildland fires quickly extinguished by a fire department that has
                    superior personnel, equipment, and facilities to handle any fire.
                    One of the City’s highest priorities is to ensure a safe and secure
                    community. This Public Safety Chapter sets forth goals and
                    policies to protect and safeguard Brea residents from wildland and
                    urban fires, crime, hazardous materials incidents, flooding,
                    earthquakes, and exposure to excessive noise levels. Brea will
                    strive to be fully prepared for natural disasters and to minimize
                    public exposure to hazards. Brea will maintain and enhance its
                    emergency services to allow police, fire, and paramedics to
                    respond swiftly to emergency situations. The City will maintain
                    public safety facilities to improve public safety and protection.

EMERGENCY SERVICES AND
SAFETY
One of the most fundamental qualities valued in Brea is the safety
and well-being of its neighborhoods and businesses. Brea is highly
regarded for its provision of quality, effective, community-oriented
police and fire services, personnel, and volunteers. Brea will
continue to sustain and improve its commitment to safety through
a comprehensive approach to police and fire services, including
public outreach and education, community awareness, and
partnerships with public agencies and private businesses. Foresight
and planning regarding land use decisions represent proactive
approaches to enhancing safety in the community. Keeping
neighborhoods buffered from both urban and wildland fire hazards
reduces incidents requiring response and minimizes damage to
property when fires do occur.           Incorporating public safety
considerations into the design of new buildings — allowing the
community’s “eyes on the street” to be the first defense against
crime — creates safer environments. The Public Safety goals and
policies reflect Brea’s emphasis on preventing public safety
problems rather than reacting to them.
                               Along with the regular duties of traffic
                               and law enforcement, the Brea Police
                               Department also has activities such as
                               Neighborhood Watch, D.A.R.E. (Drug

                Context
                The Brea Police and Fire departments provide invaluable life-
                saving services and are held in high regard for the high quality and
                commitment of their personnel.
Police Services The mission of the Brea Police Department is to preserve and
                enhance the quality of life in the community by balancing the
                need for traditional response to calls for services with effective
                problem solving. As such, the Brea Police Department is a highly
                valued positive force in the community, providing effective safety
                and emergency response services, but also engaging in community
                programs and educational activities. Volunteerism and community
                involvement continue to be the cornerstone of the Brea Police
                Department. The Police Department includes a number of
                innovative, community-oriented services, including the Bicycle
                Safety Program, the Explorers Program, the Citizen’s Academy, the
                Community Action Patrol, and several traffic safety programs.
                The Police Department provides police services to more than
                94,000 residents and a daytime population of more than 150,000
                in the cities of Brea and Yorba Linda. From the central station at
                the Brea Civic & Cultural Center, an administrative office in Yorba
                Linda, and a substation in Downtown, the Department offers quick
                response to all community law enforcement needs.
                Police Explorers Program
                Initiated in 1969, the Brea Police Explorers Program, an extension
                of the Boy Scouts of America, provides a unique opportunity for
                young people to receive training in fields such as K-9, Narcotics,
                Hostage Negotiation, Weaponless Defense, and Physical Fitness.
                This training can prepare participants for a career in law
                enforcement and teach them valuable life skills.           Explorers
                perform a variety of community services including traffic control,
                crowd control, fingerprinting, and assisting in emergency
                situations.
                Citizen’s Academy
                The Citizen’s Academy consists of evening workshops designed to
                give participants a greater understanding of police work. Taught
                by members of the Police Department, this informal academy
                covers topics such as evidence gathering, patrol deployment,
                special response teams (SWAT), firearms and special weapons, K-9
                units, court procedures, drug and alcohol enforcement, and
                dispatch. Many graduates of this unique program have embarked
                on a career in law enforcement or continue in a volunteer capacity
                for the City.

Community Action Patrol (C.A.P.)
This program enables Police personnel to form and maintain
lasting and effective partnerships with Brea and Yorba Linda
residents and businesses. C.A.P. is a group of residents and
business owners from Brea and Yorba Linda who volunteer time
each month to the Police Department. C.A.P. participants assist
with traffic and crowd control at civic functions; proactively patrol
our community schools, businesses, and residential areas in
specially marked and equipped cars; file records; answer
telephones in the detective bureau; and on occasion, even take
part in surveillance operations to help deter crime.
Bicycle Patrol Program
Since 1992, the Police Bicycle Patrol has allowed Police personnel
to have higher visibility, accessibility, and mobility in Downtown
Brea, residential neighborhoods, and other business areas. The
program provides officers with an ideal means to be actively
involved in neighborhoods, recognizing neighborhood problems
visually and through constant interactive with citizens or business
owners. Bicycle patrols are especially useful during large, public
events like the Fourth of July Celebration and Fiesta Day in Yorba
Linda, and Concerts in the Park and Family Film Festival in Brea.

                                                         and tools, and makes
                                                         recommendations for
                                                         purchase. This applies to
                                                         everything from small

              Each of the Department’s stations is assigned to a Fire
              Management Zone, a geographically based area of responsibility
              that represents the station’s primary assigned emergency response
              district. As new development occurs within the northern and
              eastern areas of Brea, the Department will need to continually
              assess the best approaches to serving new residents, including
              consideration of a new station or stations to maintain minimum
              response times.
              Fire Explorer Program
              Affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, this program allows
              young men and women ages 14 to 19 to experience the career of
              a firefighter. Fire Explorers work under the supervision of career
              firefighters to learn emergency response services and prevention
              programs.

Community Assistance and Response to Emergency Situations
Program (CARES)
CARES is a citizen-based program that teaches residents how to
respond during all types of emergencies.            Classes include
Emergency Preparedness and Fire Extinguishment, Disaster
Medical Aid, Light Search and Rescue, Disaster Psychology, and
CPR. Each course is taught by Brea Fire Department personnel
with a focus on application to the home and workplace.
Fire Flow Analysis
To combat fire, the Fire Department must have sufficient water
pressure and storage throughout the City to quickly extinguish
urban and wildland fires wherever they arise. Insufficient water
pressure can jeopardize fire-fighting capabilities and allow fire to
spread uncontrollably, causing excessive damage to structures. The
fire-flow analysis assesses the ability of the water system to meet
fire flows throughout the planning area while also providing
maximum day demands. The water system must be capable of
providing at least 20 pounds per square inch residual pressure at
one location in the entire water system.
The City has conducted many computer simulations of fire-flow
analysis and has recorded deficiencies only in Olinda Village. For
most areas in Olinda Village, the pressures are adequate for all
demand periods; however, higher elevation areas do not receive
adequate pressure during higher demand periods and fire flows.
The City has placed special requirements on landowners at the
higher elevations to mitigate pressure problems. Prior to approving
new development in remote areas in Carbon Canyon and Olinda
Village, the City will study the requirement of any new booster
pumps, storage tanks, sprinklers, and additional water facilities for
new development. A new reservoir in the Carbon Canyon will
help improve the low pressure areas.
The Wildland Fires Section within this chapter discusses the
protection and services against fires within the Sphere of Influence
and hillside areas. The Infrastructure Section in the Community
Development Chapter discusses water distribution system and
water storage capacity improvements.

 Crime Prevention  Secure streets and public places reduce the potential for criminal
                   activity. One method of addressing crime prevention is defensible
           through
                   space planning.            Defensible space planning uses design
   Environmental   techniques, building orientation, and features of the built
  Design (CPTED)   environment to deter criminal activity and positively influence
                   human behavior and the perception of safety. Defensible space
                   planning is a key element in a local comprehensive crime
                   prevention and safety plan. CPTED techniques look to incorporate
                   four key considerations into site planning and architectural design:
                   territoriality, natural surveillance, activity support, and access

                                                 Chapter 6: Public Safety
Territoriality
People tend to protect territory that they feel is their own and to
respect the territory of others. Low decorative fences, artistic
pavement treatments, well designed signs, good property
maintenance, quality landscaping, and public art express pride in
ownership and identify personal space.
Natural Surveillance
Placing physical features, activity centers, and people in ways that
maximize the ability of passers-by to see what’s going on
discourages crime. Barriers such as bushes, sheds, or shadows
make it difficult to observe activity. Landscaping and lighting that
promote natural surveillance from inside a home or building and
from the outside by neighbors are effective means of passive crime
prevention.
                                  This supermarket uses landscaping,
                                  artistic treatments, walkways and
                                  lighting to reinforce territoriality and
                                  provide natural surveillance.
Activity Support
Encouraging legitimate activity in public spaces assists in
discouraging crime. Improvements like a basketball court in a
public park and community activities such as a clean-up day, block
party, or civic or cultural event bring people out, get them
involved, and help discourage vagrancy and potential illegal acts.
Access Control
Entrances and exits, pedestrian paths, and driveways can be
located to direct people to safe, lighted, visible areas. Strategies
include adding front porches or a front office to an apartment
building, locating drive-up or walk-up business services in view of
the street, and planting low-level landscaping along walkways.

            HAZARDS MANAGEMENT
            Our industrial processes have created a myriad of products and
            materials that make life easier. Unfortunately, many of these
            products and associated by-products present hazards to human
            health. The current regulatory environment provides a high level
            of protection from the hazardous materials manufactured within,
            transported to, and stored in Brea’s industrial businesses. By
            recognizing these hazards and ensuring that an educated public
            can work with City officials to minimize risks associated with
            hazardous materials in the urban environment, Brea can create
            safe conditions citywide.
            Context
            Many industrial businesses and oil production and processing
            companies are permitted to store, transport, and handle hazardous
            materials in Brea. Businesses that handle and generate small
            quantities of hazardous materials include dry cleaners, auto repair
            shops, medical facilities, and photo processing centers. Larger
            businesses, primarily in the industrial areas, can generate large
            quantities of hazardous products.
 Industrial Hazardous materials are handled and stored on a number of
            properties in Brea, primarily in the western industrial districts.
Businesses
            More than 130 small quantity generators produce between 100
            and 1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste annually. Large quantity
            generators, of which several call Brea home, produce over 1,000
            kilograms per year. Per federal law, all such businesses register
            with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
                                                  Used oil and other hazardous
                                                  waste can be dumped at the

Although the use of hazardous materials is carefully regulated
today, past activities have led to the contamination of several sites
in the City. Contamination has resulted from leaking underground
storage tanks, disposal of hazardous materials, and various
industrial practices. These lingering conditions and the potential
for accidents and spills from currently regulated businesses
challenge the City to reduce risks and prepare for emergencies.
The Superfund Act is a federal law designed to protect the
environment from risks created from previous chemical disposal
practices. Eleven “archive” sites in Brea have been identified as
Superfund sites under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Most are
located in the western industrial section of City, although the
Olinda Alpha landfill is included on the list. Archive status
indicates that to the best of the EPA’s knowledge, no immediate or
long-term risks to human health or to the environment are
associated with these sites.
The EPA has identified more than 20 facilities in Brea on the Toxic
Release Inventory (TRI). These are sites that are known to release
toxic chemicals into the air. The EPA closely monitors the
emissions from these facilities to ensure that their annual limits
allowed under federal regulations are not exceeded.
In the 1990s, the State of California’s Department of Toxic
Substances Control aggressively pursued a program to identify and
force remediation of Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST)
sites throughout the State. Some of these fuel leaks resulted in
substantial soil and groundwater contamination. Over 50 sites in
Brea identified as sources of industrial solvent or metals
contamination have likewise been subjected to target clean-up
efforts. Thus, the problems of past practices largely have been
addressed. Focus instead has been turned toward avoiding future
contamination.
The Environmental Health Division of Orange County implements
the Hazardous Waste Inspection Program throughout County. The
program ensures that all hazardous wastes generated by Orange
County businesses are properly handled, recycled, treated, stored,
and disposed. The Orange County Certified Unified Program
Agency is the local administrative agency that coordinates the
following six programs regulating hazardous materials and
hazardous wastes:

Oil Fields Historically, Brea was founded as an oil community. In Spanish,
           brea means tar, of which plenty was discovered in the hills above
           the town. Oil fields in Brea today contain producing wells and
           associated petroleum and natural gas facilities managed by a
           number of energy companies.               Production levels fluctuate
           depending upon world energy prices. Many wells have been
           closed and abandoned after years of operation. Property owners
           continue to explore land use options for the hilly terrain. Land use
           policy limits development based on slopes and other property
           constraints. Should an owner pursue development, remediation
           will be necessary to clean the sites and render them suitable for
           housing. Remediation can include cleanup operations to remove
           soils contaminated with hazardous materials common to oil fields.

                                          crank arm, the sucker rod pump can
                                          easily lift oil 10,000 feet or more.
           Brea may continue to have oil wells and associated uses in its
           midst as long as production remains economically viable. The
           major area of potential of environmental concern is oil spills. Spills
           can occur adjacent to wells, at a storage tank, due to broken pipes,
           and during operation and maintenance. A secondary concern is
           explosions from gas plants and pressurized facilities.

                                  Oil Seeps
                                  The Brea-Olinda oil field (Figure PS-1) is one of the oldest
                                  producing regions in California. Natural oil seeps inspired early
                                  pioneers to drill for oil, leading to the discovery of the oil fields
                                  during the 1880s. Oil seeps are natural springs where liquid
                                  hydrocarbons (mixtures of crude oil, tar, natural gas, and water)
                                  leak out of the ground. Whereas freshwater springs are fed by
                                  underground pools of water, oil seeps are fed by natural
                                  underground deposits of oil.
                                  Unlike human-caused pollutants, most oil and gas seeps are
                                  produced by natural geologic processes that take place over
                                  millions of years. Though natural, they can nevertheless pollute air
                                  and watercourses. The emergence of oil seeps often occurs
                                  following a major earthquake. Oil seeps or concentrations of
                                  methane at explosive or near explosive limits can pose a constraint
                                  to development.

WILDLAND FIRES
Wildland fires pose a major threat to isolated development located
within hillside areas and also to residential development along the
fringes of the hillsides. During the summer season, dry vegetation,
little seasonal rain, and Santa Ana wind conditions can combine to
increase the likelihood of fires. Understanding the risks associated
with development in and near fire-prone areas can help advance
planning to reduce the risks associated with major wildland fires.
Context
A significant portion of Brea’s sphere of influence area remains
undeveloped and consists of rugged topography with highly
flammable native vegetation. The woodlands, grasslands, and
chaparral areas, while providing important open space, natural
resources, and scenic qualities, also create a high fire hazard when
development is located in or adjacent to these areas. Wildland
fires have been documented to have occurred within Carbon
Canyon and the hillsides within Chino Hills State Park.
                           Fires usually last only a few hours or days, but
                           their effects can last much longer. An intense
                           wildfire may destroy all the vegetation. Fire
                           also destroys most of the roots that hold the
                           soil in place, allowing running water to wash
                           the soil away. As a result, even normal rainfall
                           can cause exceptional erosion, flooding, and
                           sediment flows from a burned area.
BREA GENERAL PLAN
                6-17

             Wildland fire is a natural process. In the past, the presumption has
             been that all fire is bad and should be extinguished promptly. This
             has caused fire-starved vegetation to grow more densely, which
             ultimately weakens plants in a struggle for living space and
             increases destruction by pests and disease. Finding the balance
             between accommodating nature’s course and protecting people
             and property from fire’s destructive forces presents a continuing
             challenge to government agencies.
   High Fire The City has established its wildland boundary, known as     the High
             Fire Hazard Area (Figure PS-2), and has developed            wildland
Hazard Areas
             interface construction and development standards for          all new
             structures built within this boundary.           Examples    of such
             construction requirements include:
                     Automatic fire sprinkler system
                     Class A roof covering
                     Exterior wall surface made of one-hour fire rated materials
                     Spark arrestor on chimneys
                     Site landscape fuel modification
             The Brea Fire Department has also developed standards to
             accommodate all types of fire apparatuses utilized by the Brea Fire
             Department, circulation and street design, and water system
             requirements for all new development proposed in the High Fire
             Hazard Areas.
             A computer model was also used to determine different zones of
             fire susceptibility. Different variables such as vegetation, weather,
             topography, and other related factors were imputed into the
             model to determine which areas in the Brea Planning Area were
             vulnerable to wildland fires. Figure PS-2 shows the results of the
             model. Most of the very high fire areas are located in Tonner and
             Brea Canyons.
             Site Landscape Fuel Modification Zones
             A fuel modification zone is the area of land directly adjacent to a
             building where combustible vegetation has been removed or
             modified or both and partially or totally replaced with drought-
             tolerant, fire-resistant plants to provide an acceptable level of risk
             from wildland fires. Fuel modification reduces radiant and
             convective heat, thereby providing fire suppression forces a safer
             area in which to take action. The Brea Fire Department has set a
             minimum distance of 180 feet beyond the construction boundary
             of any property on which a structure can be built as its fuel
             modification zone within the designated High Fire Hazard Areas of
             the City.

                                             Chapter 6: Public Safety
The best proactive measure homeowners can pursue to reduce the
risks wildland fires is to maintain a fuel modification and
vegetation clearance zone around structures consistent with Fire
Department regulations, and to plant landscaping that can slow a
fire’s advance.
Fire-Fighting Resources
The level of hazard to life and property is affected not only by the
fire itself but by road access for evacuation, the number of
available firefighters, vegetation clearance around property,
availability of water and water pressure, and the effectiveness of
building codes and inspection of developments in fire hazard
areas.
Station 4 is located at 170 North Olinda Place to enhance
response to fires in areas accessible directly via Carbon Canyon
Road. During fire season, the station’s staffing levels are often
enhanced to ensure adequate response.             However, should
development levels increase within Carbon Canyon or other
hillside areas within or adjacent to high fire hazard zones,
increased response capabilities will become necessary.
The Emergency Services and Safety Section within this chapter
discusses fire-flow analysis and adequate water pressure to combat
urban and wildland fires within Brea’s Planning Area.
Goals and Policies
New development will create increased fire hazards due to higher
levels of interactions between open grassland and residential
development. The City will continue to reduce the potential for
dangerous fires by coordinating with the Orange County Fire
Agency to implement fire hazard education, fire protection, and
fuel modification programs. In addition, the City will work closely
with the local water districts and the County to ensure that water
pressure is adequate for fire-fighting purposes. Development
proposals within high fire areas will be required to provide
appropriate and adequate safeguards and response capabilities to
prevent the loss of structures and to ensure established
development does not experience reduced service.                New
development may be required to fund new fire facilities or
equipment toward this end.

               FLOOD CONCERNS
               Portions of Brea are susceptible to limited but credible flood
               events from either a major storm or dam failure resulting from a
               significant earthquake.            Recognizing and preparing for such
               occurrences allow Breans to avoid associated dangers.
               Context
               Brea has a history of major flooding in the past, but comprehensive
               storm drain improvements and the construction of Carbon Canyon
               Dam in 1961 have reduced the threat of floods, but not entirely.
               An unusually large storm and flash flooding can create flooding
               hazards within the City.
Storm Flooding The unpredictable seasonal range in rainfall that is typical of
               coastal southern California, coupled with geographic and geologic
               conditions, makes Brea vulnerable to flooding during the winter
               storm season. The Orange County Flood Control District has
               constructed and maintains several improved flood control channels
               within Brea, most notably Brea Creek Channel west of and parallel
               to Brea Boulevard (see Figure PS-3) and the Loftus Channel east of
               SR-57, below Birch Street. The Brea Creek Channel captures and
               conveys significant runoff from the hillsides.                        Any new
               development that would affect the volume or speed of runoff
               within creeks tributary to the Brea Creek Channel would be
               required to ensure that channel capacity and function be
               maintained to protect adjacent and downstream properties.
               The City participates in the National Flood Insurance Program.
               Flood Insurance Rate Maps prepared by the Federal Emergency
               Management Agency, or FEMA, show potential flood zones for the
               100-year and 500-year flood zones.2 Figure PS-3 indicates the
               location of these flood zones, including channelized areas wherein
               the channel is capable of containing 100-year flood volumes. The
               area upstream from Carbon Canyon Dam shown in Figure PS-3 is
               open space specifically designed and intended to accommodate
               flood waters.
               2
                 These are floods that, respectively, have a 1 percent and 0.2 percent chance of
               occurring every year.

Dam and Reservoir The two dams located within the Brea planning area, Carbon
                  Canyon Dam and Orange County Reservoir, provide valuable
          Failure
                  flood control and water storage functions. Carbon Canyon Dam
                  retains water over a 221-acre area and has a capacity of 7,033
                  acre-feet.3 Carbon Canyon Dam is vital for the flood protection of
                  portions of the coastal plains in Orange County, including the
                  cities of Fullerton, Placentia, and Anaheim. The U.S. Army Corps
                  of Engineers is responsible for the dam’s safety and conducts
                  inspections on a regular basis. In the unlikely event of dam failure
                  due possibly to an earthquake, areas below the dam would be
                  flooded to the extent illustrated in Figure PS-3.
                  Orange County Reservoir, used for water storage, is owned by the
                  cities of Brea (40%), La Habra (20%), and Fullerton (40%), and is
                  operated by the Metropolitan Water District. The reservoir covers
                  7 acres and has a capacity of 217 acre-feet. Like Carbon Canyon
                  Dam, this dam receives periodic inspections.                 The flood
                  inundation path (Figure PS-3), should the dam fail, would affect
                  largely residential properties.
                  Five reservoir tanks in the hills above Brea contain a total of 67.3
                  million gallons of domestic-use water. All but the Valencia
                  reservoir have been built consistent with up-to-date seismic codes.
                  Goals and Policies
                  Brea will strive to protect residents and the community at large
                  from flood hazards.
                  Goal PS-7:        Reduce the risk to the community from flooding
                                    hazards.

                                    control facilities are well maintained and capable
                                    of accommodating, at a minimum, 100-year storm
                                    flows.

                GEOLOGIC AND SEISMIC
                CONSIDERATIONS
                The complex topography and geology of the Puente and Chino
                Hills create wonderful visual features that form a strong backdrop
                to Brea. These features are evidence of conditions that pose
                potential constraints to development. Brea lies within one of the
                most potentially seismically active areas of Southern California,
                adjacent to the Whittier fault and atop the Elysian Park Thrust
                fault. Both of these fault zones have the potential to generate
                moderate to large earthquakes that could cause substantial
                property damage and possibly loss of life. Most properties within
                the sphere of influence area and Carbon Canyon are characterized
                by steep rugged hillside terrain subject to landslides and soil
                erosion. Areas adjacent to stream beds and drainage channels
                tend to exhibit liquefaction conditions and ground instability.
                                                Ground shaking associated with
                                                earthquakes can cause slope failures.
                Context
Seismic Hazards Two major faults traverse the planning area, the Whittier fault and
                Elysian Park Thrust fault. The Whittier fault cuts across the hills
                and through the eastern half of the City in a northwesterly
                direction (Figure PS-4). Several traces are considered active. The
                Elysian Park Thrust fault, a buried fault approximately 6 to 10 miles
                below the ground surface, is considered to be more threatening,
                with a greater potential to cause a large magnitude earthquake. In
                hillside areas an earthquake may also trigger landslides. In flat
                valley areas, the deep, alluvial soils can increase the amplitude and
                duration of groundshaking.

Earthquake Magnitude and Intensity
Magnitude and intensity measure different characteristics of
earthquakes. Magnitude measures the energy released at the
source or epicenter of the earthquake with the use of a
seismograph. Intensity measures the strength of shaking produced
by the earthquake at a certain location and is determined from
effects on people, human structures, and the natural environment.
Table PS-1 gives intensities that are typically observed at locations
near the epicenter of earthquakes of different magnitudes.
Preparing for earthquakes requires preparing for the worst-case
scenario earthquake. Engineers construct dams and bridges to
withstand the maximum credible earthquake (MCE) to prevent
structure failure. The MCE is defined as the largest possible
earthquake that could reasonably occur along the recognized faults
or within a particular seismic source, and by definition has a very
low probability of occurrence. City officials can prepare against
the worst case scenario earthquake by understanding the potential
effects of a MCE. Table PS-2 lists magnitude and intensity of the
MCE for faults that could potentially impact Brea.

Computer models can estimate the effects of earthquakes with the
potential magnitudes described in the above table. An earthquake
on either the Elysian Park Thrust or Whittier fault could damage
residential buildings, particularly those constructed with wood or
reinforced masonry, as well as mobile homes.
Computer analyses conducted for Brea estimated more than
12,000 buildings could be damaged during an earthquake on the
Elysian Park Thrust fault, and more than 15,000 buildings could be
at least moderately damaged during an earthquake on the Whittier
fault. Soft-story buildings do not typically perform well in
earthquakes. These buildings are typically characterized by a first
story lacking adequate strength or toughness. The soft-story is
prevalent in the older historic neighborhood along South Brea
Boulevard.

                An MCE earthquake on the Whittier fault could potentially create
                an economic loss of $1.04 billion (equivalent to 27 percent of the
                total replacement value of the City’s buildings). An Elysian Park
                Thrust fault MCE earthquake could potentially create an economic
                loss of $518 million (equivalent to 13 percent of the total
                replacement value of the City’s buildings).         Even an MCE
                earthquake on the San Andreas fault, located approximately 30
                miles away, could be potentially devastating, destroying
                approximately 8,000 buildings and potentially causing an
                economic loss over $300 million.
                Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act
                The State of California, per the requirements of the Alquist-Priolo
                Earthquake Fault Zoning Act, requires the delineation of
                earthquake fault zones along faults that are sufficiently active and
                well-defined. The Act requires cities and counties to withhold
                development permits for sites within an earthquake fault zone until
                geologic investigations demonstrate that the sites are not
                threatened by surface displacements from future faulting. In Brea,
                the Whittier fault meets this definition, and the fault zone
                boundaries shown in Figure PS-4 reflect State-delineated
                boundaries.
  Liquefaction, Geologic hazards associated with ground shaking include
                liquefaction and ground failure. Liquefaction is a phenomenon in
Landslides, and
                which the stiffness of a soil is reduced when ground shaking causes
   Soil Erosion water-saturated soil to become fluid and lose its strength.
                Liquefaction and related phenomena have been responsible for
                tremendous amounts of damage, creating problems with bridges,
                buildings, buried pipes, and tanks. Liquefaction hazards are
                significant along stream channels due to the porous nature and
                high water content of the soil. These areas include Tonner Canyon
                Creek, Brea Canyon, and areas around the Carbon Canyon Dam
                (Figure PS-4).
                Steep topography, fractured and unconsolidated bedrock
                conditions, expansive soils, and high erosion potential make many
                hillside areas highly unstable. Landslides are typical on moderate
                to steep slopes. Historically, Brea’s hillsides have experienced
                many failures, as illustrated in Figure PS-4, and the potential for
                future landslides is high. Landsliding may result from heavy rain,
                erosion, removal of vegetation, and seismic activity. While failed
                slope materials can be removed and slopes stabilized to allow
                development, great care must be taken to identify all potential
                geologic hazards wherever development is proposed.

Goals and Policies
In Brea, hillside development is tricky, given the constraints posed
by local geology. Land use policies set forth in the Community
Development chapter identify the City’s approach to allowing
development in areas with challenging terrain and geologic
conditions, policies that balance the need to protect life and
property with the goal of providing new housing opportunities. In
all cases, development can only occur where living conditions can
be made safe.
The combination of sound planning practices and continued
education of residents will minimize risks to the community from
seismic and geologic hazards, and will protect the health, safety,
and welfare of Brea residents.
Goal PS-1        Reduce the risk to the community from seismic
                 activity and geologic conditions, including
                 ground shaking, fault rupture, liquefaction, and
                 landslides.
Policy PS-8.1    Minimize the potential damage to structures and
                 loss of life that may result from an earthquake.
Policy PS-8.2    Require seismic safety standards for construction of
                 all new buildings.
Policy PS-8.3    Continue to require geological and geotechnical
                 investigations of all new developments in areas of
                 potential seismic or geologic hazards as part of the
                 environmental and development review process.
Policy PS-8.4    Require that careful, site-specific evaluations based
                 on detailed surface and subsurface geotechnical
                 studies be conducted in areas where landslides are
                 suspected or known to occur.
Policy PS-8.5    Participate in Federal, State, and local earthquake
                 preparedness and emergency response programs.

                  NOISE
                  Studies have identified noise as an environmental pollutant that
                  can have substantial and permanent impacts on human health and
                  general well-being. Not only is noise a health hazard, excessive
                  noise can be a source of annoyance, tension, and discomfort that
                  disrupts everyday activities. Brea aims to substantially reduce
                  noise and its impacts within the urban environment, with a focus
                  on protecting residential neighborhoods, schools, and similar
                  sensitive uses.
                  Context
                  In Brea, street and freeway traffic represent the primary noise
                  sources. Industrial and commercial activity present concerns
                  where adjacent to residential neighborhoods.            In addition,
                  mechanical equipment, playgrounds, leaf blowers, and
                  construction equipment are examples of random noise sources
                  that can contribute to neighborhood noise.
                  Figure PS-5 displays a composite picture of average noise levels in
                  Brea in 2001. As Figure PS-5 illustrates, the loudest noise levels
                  occur along State Highway 57, Imperial Highway, Brea Boulevard,
                  and Valencia Avenue, where truck traffic associated with the
                  Olinda Alpha landfill lumbers past homes and places of business.
                  Lambert Road also experiences loud noise levels due to access to
                  State Highway 57.
  Noise and Land  Noise generally is defined as unwanted or intrusive sound.
                  Because noise consists of pitch, loudness, and duration, describing
Use Compatibility
                  noise with a single unit of measure presents a challenge. The A-

                  the loudness of a sound or sound environment based on the
                  sensitivity of the human ear. A sound level meter that measures A-

guidelines that use averaging approaches to noise measurement.
Two measurement scales commonly used in California are the
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and the day-night level
(Ldn). To account for increased human sensitivity at night, the
CNEL level includes a 5-decibel penalty on noise during the 7:00
A.M. to 10:00 P.M. time period and a 10-decibel penalty on noise
during the 10:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M. time period. The Ldn level
includes only the 10 decibel weighting for late-night noise. These
values are nearly identical for all but unusual noise sources.
The City will use land use compatibility standards when planning
and making development decisions in order to ensure that noise
producers do not adversely affect sensitive receptors.
The City’s primary goal with regard to community noise is to
minimize the exposure of residents to unhealthful or excessive
noise levels to the extent possible. To this end, the noise/land use
compatibility guidelines in Figure PS-6, based on cumulative noise
criteria for outdoor noise, are used to review development
proposals and to identify and mitigation measures necessary to
avoid or minimize impacts, including traffic noise impacts, a new
use may have on established uses.

The Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and Day-Night Noise Level (Ldn) are measures of the 24-hour
noise environment. They represent the constant A-weighted noise level that would be measured if all the sound
energy received over the day were averaged. In order to account for the greater sensitivity of people to noise at
night, the CNEL weighting includes a 5-decibel penalty on noise between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. and a
10-decibel penalty on noise between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. of the next day. The Ldn includes only the
10-decibel weighting for late-night noise events. For practical purposes, the two measures are equivalent for
typical urban noise environments.

  Noise Contours The use of noise contours based on the major noise sources can
                 describe the noise environment for the community. Noise
and Noise Impact
                 contours outline areas of equal noise exposure. Future noise
           Areas contours have been estimated using information about existing and
                 projected land use development and transportation activity.
                 The projected noise contours and noise impact areas for Brea are
                 displayed in Figure PS-7. These contours will serve as a guide for
                 land use and development decisions. Contours of 60 dB(A) or
                 greater define noise impact areas. An acoustical analysis must be
                 prepared when noise sensitive land uses are proposed within noise
                 impact areas. The analysis must show that the project is designed
                 to attenuate noise to meet the City’s noise standards in order to
                 receive approval. If the project design does not meet the noise
                 standards, mitigation can be recommended in the analysis. If the
                 analysis demonstrates that the noise standards can be met by
                 implementing the mitigation measures, the project can be
                 approved conditioned upon implementation of the mitigation
                 measures.
  Transportation Transportation activity is the primary source of noise in Brea. The
                 three major sources of transportation related noise are:
   Related Noise
                         Traffic on the Orange Freeway (SR-57)
                         Commercial truck traffic associated with the Olinda Alpha

                          Central Avenue, and Lambert Road
                 Residential neighborhoods bordering the Orange Freeway are
                 subject to loud noise levels. Properties directly adjacent to the
                 freeway can experience decibels as high as 70 to 75 dB(A). Sound
                 attenuation walls, landscaped buffers, and dirt mounds all help to
                 reduce the sound intensity of the freeway. Figure PS-7 illustrates
                 the projected noise contours along the freeway.
                 Commercial trucks associated with the Olinda Alpha landfill
                 contribute to excessive noise levels via the Orange Freeway,
                 Imperial Highway, and Valencia Avenue to connect with the
                 landfill. Commercial trucks are not permitted to access Valencia
                 Avenue via Lambert Road, minimizing some of the noise impacts
                 to adjacent residential neighborhoods. Olinda Alpha is slated to
                 close in the year 2013; however, the County of Orange is
                 investigating extending the life of the landfill much further.
                 BREA GENERAL PLAN
                                 6-41

New residential development has been recently constructed at the
northeast corner of Valencia Avenue and Carbon Canyon Road
just south of the Olinda Alpha landfill entrance. Dense planting of
deciduous and evergreen trees as well as a sound attenuation wall
were set within the landscaped area to minimize the impacts to
residential properties directly abutting Valencia Avenue.
Proposed residential land uses have also been designated for both
sides of Valencia Avenue south of Lambert Road/Carbon Canyon
Road. Residential, school, and park uses are proposed for the
Hartley Research Center. Careful planning and mitigation within
these areas will protect these sensitive uses from excessive noise
levels.
Noise levels along Brea Boulevard, Brea Canyon Road, Central
Avenue, and Lambert Road are above average and can impact
sensitive uses adjacent to these streets.
Traffic noise depends primarily on the speed of traffic and the
percentage of truck traffic. The primary source of noise from
automobiles is high-frequency tire noise, which increases with
speed. In addition, trucks and older automobiles produce engine
and exhaust noise.
The most efficient and effective means of controlling noise from
transportation systems is to reduce noise at the source. However,
the City has little direct control over noise produced by
transportation sources because State noise regulations preempt
local regulations. Because the City cannot control noise at the
source, City noise programs focus on reducing the impact of
transportation noise at reception sites. During the planning stages
of the development process, potential impacts from transportation
noise will be identified and mitigation measures will be required as
needed to meet City noise standards.

 Related Noise attention should be given to non-residential proposals adjacent to
               residential neighborhoods. An acoustical analysis is required for
               projects that will generate noise potentially affecting sensitive
               receptors. Where significant impacts are identified, mitigation
               measures are required. Common mitigation measures that could
               be applied when reviewing projects include acoustically treated
               and quiet design: 1) furnaces, 2) fans, 3) motors, 4) compressors,
               and 5) valves and pumps. The City may also require limited
               delivery hours and hours of operation to minimize impacts on
               adjacent residential users or other sensitive receptors.
               Goals and Policies
               Certain areas of Brea are subject to high levels of noise. This in
               turn can reduce the quality of life within these neighborhoods.
               Consideration of noise sources in the planning process and
               identification of who that noise impacts is an effective method of
               minimizing the impacts of noise on residents. Areas already
               impacted by noise can explore different noise attenuation and
               rehabilitative improvements.

persons per vehicle. TDM attempts to reduce the number of
persons who drive alone on the roadway during the commute
period and to increase the number in carpools, vanpools, buses
and trains, walking, and biking. TDM can be an element of TSM
(see below).
Transportation Systems Management (TSM) - Individual actions
or comprehensive plans to reduce the number of vehicular trips
generated by or attracted to new or existing development. TSM
measures attempt to reduce the number of vehicle trips by
increasing bicycle or pedestrian trips or by expanding the use of
bus, transit, carpool, vanpool, or other high occupancy vehicles.

Trip - A one-way journey that proceeds from an origin to a
destination via a single mode of transportation; the smallest unit of
movement considered in transportation studies. Each trip has one
“production end,” (or origin – often from home, but not always),
and one “attraction end,” (destination).
Uniform Building Code (UBC) - A standard building code which
sets forth minimum standards for construction.
Water Course - Any natural or artificial stream, river, creek, ditch,
channel, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine or
wash in which water flows in a definite channel, bed and banks,
and includes any area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by
reason of overflow or flood water.
Wetland - An area that is inundated or saturated by surface water
or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a
prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil
conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation.
Zoning - A police power measure, enacted primarily by units of
local government, in which the community is divided into districts
or zones within which permitted and special uses are established
as are regulations governing lot size, building bulk, placement, and
other development standards. Requirements vary from district to
district, but they must be uniform within the same district. The
zoning ordinance consists of a map and text.
Zoning District - A geographical area of a city zoned with uniform
regulations and requirements.
Zoning Map - The officially adopted zoning map of the city
specifying the uses permitted within certain geographic areas of
the city.

IMPLEMENTATION
GUIDE
                    T      he General Plan Implementation Guide provides a guide to
                           implement adopted General Plan policies and plans for
                           City elected officials, staff and the public. The purpose of
                     the Implementation Guide is to ensure the overall direction
                     provided in the General Plan for City growth and development
                     is translated from general terms to specific actions.
                     Each implementation measure is a program, procedure, or
                     technique that requires additional City action. This action may
                     either occur on a City-wide basis, or in individual subareas.
                     Some of the implementation measures are processes or
                     procedures the City currently administers on a day-to-day basis
                     (such as development project review), while others identify new
                     programs or projects that will become day-to-day planning
                     activities in Brea.        The City Council, by relating the
                     Implementation Guide to the General Plan, recognizes the
                     importance of long-range planning considerations and
                     budgeting to such day-to-day activities. Implementation of the
                     specific programs will be subject to funding constraints.
                     The Implementation Guide is organized into five subsections
                     that correspond to the General Plan Chapters. Each of the
                     subsections is comprised of programs that directly relate to the
                     policies and plans of the corresponding General Plan element.
 Use of the General The Implementation Guide is intended for use as the basis for
                    preparing the Annual Report to the City Council on the status of
              Plan
                    the City’s progress in implementing the General Plan, as described
   Implementation   in Section 65400 of the California Government Code. Because
             Guide  many of the individual actions and programs described in the
                    Implementation Guide act as mitigation for significant
                    environmental impacts resulting from planned development
                    identified in the General Plan, the annual report can also provide a
                    means of monitoring the application of the mitigation measures as

                                     A-1

required by AB 3180. This Implementation Guide should be
updated annually with the budget process and whenever the City’s
General Plan is amended or updated to ensure continued
consistency and usefulness.

                               classification best reflects the function Brea Canyon Boulevard serves during most travel hours. Only
                               during the evening commute does the roadway experience heavy use, typically as an alternative to
                               the crowded SR-57 freeway. The City will preserve right-of-way adequate for a Minor Arterial, but
                               the Collector designation indicates the anticipated roadway function.

                               intention to maintain no more than two travel lanes in each direction. The land use plan provides
                               for South Brea Boulevard to be a mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly district. The wide right-of-way will
                               provide space for on-street parking, pedestrian enhancements, ample landscaping, and street-

URBAN DESIGN
PRINCIPLES
         This appendix supplements the Urban Design section of the
         Community Development Chapter Element by setting forth eleven
         principles of urban design that underpin the more specific design
         strategies contained in the chapter. These principles emphasize
         the development of a visually appealing and functionally
         integrated community. They encourage the creation of vital
         activity centers, connections from residential to commercial and
         retail areas, and high quality residential areas. The following
         issues are addressed:
             Community Character
             Street Environment
             Site Planning
             Building Design

COMMUNITY CHARACTER
  Community character is largely affected by the
  built and natural environment. Specific attention
  to urban design can provide guidance to enhance
  community character by creating a sense of
  identity, time and place. The following design
  principles seek to enhance Brea’s unique qualities
  while creating a stronger sense of community
  identity and cohesiveness.
  Design Principle 1: Establish a strong community
  identity and unique sense of place that includes the presence of identifiable districts and
  neighborhoods, gateways, landmarks, and natural features.
  CC 1-1      Mark community, district and neighborhood gateways, and identify and
              enhance important visual and pedestrian linkages; street trees and special
              landscape design are recommended for key gateways and linkages.
  CC 1-2)     Create identifiable places and nodes of activity; commercial and mixed-use
              areas should emphasize compact, street-oriented development patterns that
              reinforce social vitality.
  CC 1-3)     Pursue a “main street” urban design concept along streets where pedestrian
              activity is most desired; these streets should feature buildings of sufficient
              height to create a comfortable sense of enclosure, as well as ground floor uses
              that animate the sidewalk.

CC 1-4) Encourage infill development of vacant and underutilized property to
        minimize spatial gaps along the street; in addition, buildings that define the
        street and contribute to local identity should be retained.

                                    B-3
Design Principle 2: Build strong visual and physical connections throughout the
community, for instance, through the protection of view corridors, and the provision of a
comprehensive network of public spaces and paths.
Design Guidelines:
CC 2-1)   Maintain and extend the existing
          street      pattern;      multi-block
          developments that close existing
          streets and alleys are discouraged.
CC 2-2)   Provide safe and accessible paths
          that promote physical continuity
          and      connection;       continuous
          sidewalks, as well as mid-block and
          open air passages are encouraged.
CC 2-3)   Protect and frame important views of natural and built features and
          landmarks; developments that obscure existing views along public rights-of-
          way are discouraged.
CC 2-4)   Enhance important visual and physical connections; for instance, use
          streetscape and landscape improvements to communicate street hierarchy
          and function, and identify key pedestrian connections.

Design Principle 3): Express local history and culture, relying on the preservation and
reuse of architecturally and historically significant structures, a respect for adjacent
architectural character, as well as the provision of public art.
Design Guidelines:
CC 3-1)     Promote sensitive infill development that visually unifies the street; historically
            and architecturally significant structures should be retained.
CC 3-2)     Design harmonious transitions between new and older buildings; the scale,
            massing and articulation of nearby historically and architecturally significant
            structures should be respected.
CC 3-3)     Design harmonious transitions between non-residential and mixed-use
            developments and residential neighborhoods; consider adjacent residential
            character in the design of non-residential and mixed-use projects.
CC 3-4)     Integrate publicly accessible works of art into infrastructure and new
            development projects; civic art that celebrates local history and culture is
            encouraged.

STREET ENVIRONMENT
Brea’s street environment includes roadways,
bicycle and pedestrian paths and trails. Street
environments are not just access routes but
represent means of experiencing Brea.               The
community’s streets offer means of welcoming
visitors, presenting a visual image of the
community, and offer a visual and sensory
experience for those driving, riding transit, walking,
and bicycling throughout the community.
Design Principle 1: Communicate through design that streets are public space intended for a
diversity of users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and transit users.
     Design Guidelines:
     SE 1-1)     Incorporate streetscape amenities such as street trees, street furniture, street
                 lighting, way-finding signage, special paving, etc; a high-level of amenity is
                 critical where pedestrian activity is most desired.
     SE 1-2)     Include well-designed transit stops, especially at or near important pedestrian
                 crossings; seats and shelter should be incorporated for safety and comfort,
                 with consideration given to additional amenities such as waste receptacles,
                 maps, etc.
     SE 1-3)     Use signs and environmental graphics to assist way-finding; street banners,
                 community and district identification signs, directional signage and
                 pedestrian-oriented directories should contribute to a coordinated way-
                 finding system.

STREET ENVIRONMENT
Design Principle 2: Contribute to the physical safety and comfort of pedestrians along
streets and sidewalks, incorporating such features as traffic calming devices and streetscape
amenities, including street trees and street furniture.
Design Guidelines:
SE 2-1)     Minimize curb-cuts to reduce conflicts between pedestrians and autos; where
            there is no alley access, curb-cuts should be consolidated near mid-block.
SE 2-2)     Provide sidewalks with ample width, and where feasible, reduce pedestrian
            crossing distance at intersections; in general, on-street parking is encouraged,
            and street furniture should be sited adjacent the curb as a barrier to
            automobile traffic.
SE 2-3)     Plant and maintain street trees, emphasizing mature canopy trees that allow
            access to sun and shade; in general, consistent tree species, size, and spacing
            are encouraged.
SE 2-4)     Provide ample street furniture, and safe and attractive street lighting;
            pedestrian-scaled light fixtures, benches, trash receptacles, and planters
            should be provided at frequent intervals in active, pedestrian-oriented activity
            nodes.

STREET ENVIRONMENT
Design Principle 3: Make streets active and engaging places that contribute to local
identity, with special emphasis on a creating strong relationship between the building and
street.
Design Guidelines:
SE 3-1)      Define streets at or near their edge with buildings and/or canopy street trees;
             for instance, a continuous building street wall and street trees should be
             maintained where pedestrian activity is encouraged.
SE 3-2)      Orient buildings and uses toward the street; in particular, shops and active
             commercial uses with generous street level windows should be located along
             streets where pedestrian activity is encouraged.
SE 3-3)      Emphasize quality and detail at street level; streetscape enhancements should
             be coordinated to promote local identity and street level facades should
             exhibit a high standard of design that satisfies the pedestrian.
SE 3-4)      Make provisions for site and building elements that contribute to street life;
             canopies, awnings, and architectural lighting are encouraged, and outdoor
             dining should be allowed along pedestrian-oriented shopping streets.

SITE PLANNING
The relationship between structures, open space, cars and pedestrian has a large impact
upon street cohesiveness, accessibility, and comfort. Too often the design of a site, from
all angles is not given adequate consideration resulting in ‘piecemeal’ orientation of
structures, inadequate parking and pedestrian access, and inadequate buffering from
incompatible land uses. The following principles work to provide visual cohesiveness,
pedestrian comfort, access and activity.
Design Principle 1: Encourage site planning that functionally and visually integrates on-
site facilities and uses, including buildings, services, vehicular access and parking,
pedestrian access and circulation, and outdoor spaces.
Design Guidelines:
SP 1-1)       Discourage developments that excessively turn inward or result in “left-over”
              space; site planning should reinforce context, place emphasis on the street,
              and support active public space.
SP 1-2)       Establish a comfortable transition between interior and exterior space; clear
              connections and gracious paths should direct pedestrians between sidewalks,
              parking, outdoor spaces and building entrances.

                                         B-9

SP 1-3) Buffer adjacent sensitive land uses from undesirable impacts that originate
        from a site; dense landscape and/or cohesive architectural treatment are
        desirable methods of screening service and parking facilities.

SITE PLANNING
Design Principle 2: Control vehicular access, on-site parking, and service facilities to
reduce their visual impact along streets, promote sidewalk interest and activity, and
protect adjacent sensitive land uses.
Design Guidelines:
SP 2-1)     Site parking behind buildings or interior to a block, especially along
            pedestrian-oriented streets; most importantly, surface parking should be
            restricted from street corners.
SP 2-2)     Minimize the expansiveness of surface parking lots; shade trees and other
            plants should be provided within parking areas to enhance their appearance
            and reduce heat build-up.
SP 2-2)     Locate service, loading and storage areas away from public streets and
            outdoor gathering places; service facilities should be unobtrusive and should
            not be sited as an afterthought.
SP 2-2)     Screen roof mounted equipment so that it is not visible from streets and
            public areas; screening should be integral to the building form.

SITE PLANNING
Design Principle 3: Incorporate accessible outdoor spaces that are amenable to outdoor
activity and comfortable social interaction.
Design Guidelines:
SP 3-1)      Provide well-defined and comfortable outdoor rooms, such as plazas and
             courtyards, in conjunction with new development projects; outdoor spaces
             should establish a comfortable transition between the exterior and interior of
             a building.
SP 3-2)      Define and contain outdoor rooms through a combination of building and
             landscape; oversized outdoor spaces that lack containment are discouraged.
SP 3-3)      Design outdoor rooms for comfortable human activity and social interaction,
             including a pleasant microclimate; seating and deciduous trees should offer
             opportunities for shade from summer sun and access to winter sunlight.
SP 3-4)      Use plants, furniture, and lighting to shape, embellish, enliven and give
             purpose to outdoor space; a rich, yet coordinated palette of landscape
             materials should provide scale, texture and color.

BUILDING DESIGN
   The location, scale, and orientation of a structure
   have a tremendous impact on the streetscape and
   neighborhood character. Front yards or entryways
   are similar in depth and scale results in a uniform
   alignment of building fronts which creates a sense
   of visual uniformity. By varying setback patterns,
   and design features, streets are more interesting to
   walk, are desirable to shop and visit and contribute
   to a distinct neighborhood character.
   Design Principle 1: Promote architectural design that fits with and enhances it
   surroundings, emphasizing visually attractive buildings that bring interest to the street, and
   add richness and variety to the community.
   Design Guidelines:
   BD 1-1)      Employ simple and strong, yet varied massing, and feature deep wall
                openings that create shadow lines and provide visual relief; discourage large,
                monolithic buildings and blank wall surfaces.
   BD 1-2)      Use articulated sub-volumes as a transition in size to adjacent structures;
                building volumes should maintain a compatible scale with their surroundings.
   BD 1-3)      Unify and articulate street facades; building facades should be based upon a
                pleasing set of proportions and a clear pattern of building openings.
   BD 1-4)      Express roofs in a visually interesting manner that complements the
                composition of the building and the surrounding area; a strong and
                attractively detailed cornice should be provided in conjunction with a flat
                roof, although sculpted roof forms are encouraged.

BUILDING DESIGN
   Design Principle 2: Encourage architectural design that contributes to a more pleasant
   and humane living environment, emphasizing high-quality construction and human-scale
   design.
   Design Guidelines:
   BD 2-1)    Accentuate the ground floor of a building and distinguish it from the upper
             levels; street level facades should receive the most attention to detail, and
             pedestrian-oriented streets should include separate storefronts, frequent shop
             entrances, and window displays.
   BD 2-2)   Demarcate and accentuate building entrances; well-marked, articulated
             building entrances oriented to the street and public gathering places are
             encouraged.
   BD 2-3)   Provide a high-degree of street level transparency, especially along streets
             where pedestrian activity is encouraged; the use of reflective, opaque, and
             darkly tinted glass should be restricted along the ground floor.
   BD 2-4)   Use compatible materials that exhibit permanence and quality, and unify a
             building’s appearance on all sides; in general, the number of materials and
             colors on the exterior of a building should be limited to promote visual
             simplicity and harmony.
   BD 2-5)   Design architectural features and details as an integral part of the building;
             architectural features, including canopies and awnings, should not appear
             “tacked on.”

SIGN APPEARANCE
Signs are an important architectural element for any
business. However, since signs influence the overall
character and appearance of the streetscape, they should
complement the building's style and street character. Sign
fonts should be clear and legible for pedestrians and
motorists, and be consistent in style and color.
Design Principle 1: Require legible signs that make a
positive contribution to the street.
    Design Guidelines:
    SA 1-1)     Use simple, direct signage that is unique to a particular business; high-quality,
                innovative and expressive designs are encouraged.
    SA 1-2)     Offer a clear, simple message; the number of lettering styles should be
                limited, and the use of identifiable symbols and logos is encouraged.
    SA 1-2)     Construct signs with durable materials; internally illuminated cabinet signs, as
                well as paper and cloth signs are discouraged.
    SA 1-3)      Encourage pedestrian-scaled signs that are easily and comfortably read by
                passers-by on foot; for instance, projecting blade signs are especially
                appropriate along pedestrian-oriented streets and outdoor passages.

SIGN APPEARANCE
Design Principle 2: Encourage signs that fit comfortably with their sites, buildings and
surroundings, and that are designed to minimize impacts on adjacent sensitive uses.
Design Guidelines:
SA 2-1)    Require signs that are in balance and scaled to the building, site and
           surrounding area; avoid repetitive signage on the same building frontage.
SA 2-2)    Conceive of signs as an integral part of the building façade; tenant
           identification signs should fit comfortably into storefront architecture and
           should not obscure architectural features.
SA 2-3)    Orient signs away from neighboring residences, and limit the scale and size of
           signs adjacent residential neighborhoods; blinking and flashing lights should
           be discouraged near dwellings.

RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD IDENTITY
Diverse neighborhoods and active citizens are a community’s
greatest asset. Neighborhoods are commonly identified by
distinct geographic features; a business district, and a school,
park, or other public amenity. Neighborhoods are also defined
by the style of the buildings and the characteristics of the people
who inhabit them. Enhancing these features help to define a
neighborhood, and create a sense of identity.
Design Principle 1: Integrate residential developments with their
built and natural surroundings; in particular, encourage a strong
relationship between dwellings and the street.
     Design Guidelines:
     RI 1-1)     Support conservation of established residential neighborhoods; new
                 construction should be sensitive to the character of existing homes, and the
                 rehabilitation and remodeling of existing dwellings is encouraged.
     RI 1-2)     Integrate new residential development with its surroundings, both functionally
                 and aesthetically; discourage isolated residential developments and restrict
                 the backing of residential lots onto a street.
     RI 1-3)     Provide transitions between residential scales; setbacks and building heights
                 should respond to adjacent structures, for instance, through articulated sub-
                 volumes and horizontal regulating lines that establish a visual relationship.

RI 1-4) Site residential buildings to create a sense of continuity along the street;
        proportions, patterns, and materials should also relate to the surrounding
        area.

RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD IDENTITY
Design Principle 2: Establish direct links between residential developments and important
destinations, including transit stops, local shopping, parks and public facilities.
Design Guidelines:
RI 2-1)     Plan new developments as an extension of the street grid, and discourage
            gated projects; where cul-de-sacs are provided, pedestrian connections
            should be introduced.
RI 2-2)     Provide interconnected paths and continuous sidewalks throughout
            residential neighborhoods; at a minimum, sidewalks should be coincident
            with the street system and are encouraged along both sides of the street.
RI 2-3)     Distinguish paths, walks, and crossings with enriched paving material, where
            appropriate; for instance, special paving may delineate pedestrian crossings to
            parks, schools and public facilities located in or near residential
            neighborhoods.

RESIDENTIAL STREET ENVIRONMENT
A      well-designed      residential     street
environment should give residents and
visitors a sense of comfort, and enjoyment
while being accessible to all. Particularly
important in residential areas is the
creation of a sense of neighborhood
identity, intimacy, and safety. A key aspect
of this is to ensure that streets are walkable,
well lit, and protected from traffic. Streets
are     also     made      more      pedestrian
comfortable through the provision of
porches, street lawns, wide sidewalks,
canopy trees and pocket parks.
Design Principle 1: Support neighborliness and offer a sense of security along residential
streets, encouraging dwellings, front entrances and windows that orient to the street.
     Design Guidelines:
     RSE 1-1)     Orient dwellings to the street to help create attractive residential streets;
                  monotonous street scenes dominated by garage doors should be avoided.
     RSE 1-2)      Encourage entry porches and stoops; these will provide a transition between
                  the public space of the sidewalk and the private dwelling.
     RSE 1-3)     Discourage excessively deep front yard setbacks; front yard depth should
                  balance privacy needs with a consistent street-oriented development pattern.

RESIDENTIAL STREET ENVIRONMENT
   Design Principle 2: Make walking safe and appealing along residential streets, for
   instance, through a reduction in the width of travel lanes and the provision of mature
   street trees.
   Design Guidelines:
   RSE 2-1)      Minimize the actual and perceived width of residential streets; for instance,
                 on-street parking should be accommodated, and street trees and tree lawns
                 should be incorporated.
   RSE 2-2)      Create ambiance with mature street trees; street trees should unify the street
                 and provide a spreading, shady canopy that encloses the street.
   RSE 2-3)      Encourage tree lawns between the street and sidewalk; new developments
                 that do not provide this amenity are generally discouraged, and at a
                 minimum, trees should be planted adjacent or near the sidewalk.

                                           B-21
RESIDENTIAL SITE PLANNING
Design Principle 1: Reduce the visual impact of residential parking facilities, and
encourage developments that offer greenery and shade the site with mature canopy trees.
Design Guidelines:
RSP 1-1)   Locate parking facilities to reduce their visibility from the street; for instance,
           lace parking below or interior to the block of a multi-family residential
           development, or setback the garage from the front elevation of a single-family
           residential dwelling.
RSP 1-2)   Minimize the amount of lot frontage devoted to vehicular access and drives,
           and locate points of vehicular access so as to not dominate street elevations;
           access should be taken off of an alley, where feasible.
RSP 1-3)    Reinforce domestic character with abundant landscape; as far as feasible,
            existing mature trees should be retained or replaced.
RSP 1-4)   Plant required yard areas with a combination of trees, shrubs and
           groundcover; front yard landscape should contribute to a pleasing transition
           from the sidewalk to the dwelling.

RESIDENTIAL SITE PLANNING
Design Principle 2: Provide functional outdoor
space in conjunction with residential
development, including private outdoor spaces,
as well as communal gathering areas,
recreational facilities, and outdoor amenities.
Design Guidelines:
RSP 2-1)    Incorporate communal and private outdoor space in conjunction with
            residential developments; communal space may include communal gathering
            areas and recreational facilities, and should be clearly distinguished from
            private outdoor spaces
RSP 2-2)    Site communal open space so that it is centrally located and functional in
            size; in general, a large contiguous space is preferable to a series of small
            isolated spaces.
RSP 2-3)    Include mature canopy trees, attractive plantings and outdoor furnishings with
            communal outdoor space; these spaces should afford residents comfortable
            interaction.

         be located so that it is readily accessed by and adjacent to the dwelling it
         serves.

RESIDENTIAL BUILDING DESIGN
   Design Principle 1: Encourage the design of visually appealing residential dwellings that
   feature varied facades with pleasing compositions.
   Design Guidelines:
   RBD 1-1) Vary residential building plans and facades to add interest, reduce monotony,
                and create identity from building to building; for instance, facades should be
                differentiated from one dwelling to another within low-density residential
                developments.
   RBD 1-2) Modulate the plane of exterior walls in height, depth, and direction to create
                visual interest; roof form and height should complement the building’s mass
                and articulation.
   RBD 1-3) Create a simple and pleasing composition that uses a common vocabulary of
                forms, architectural elements, and materials; collectively, dwellings should
                contribute to an attractive street scene.

RESIDENTIAL BUILDING DESIGN
Design Principle 2: Communicate the residential
function of a building with an emphasis on
domestic details and intimate scale.
Design Guidelines:
RBD 2-1) Include single story building forms that break down mass and promote visual
           interest; this is especially applicable to detached residential developments
           where a single story floor plan should be included within the unit mix.
RBD 2-2) Use windows and doors to articulate facades, establish scale and give
           expression to residential dwellings; three-dimensional features such as front
           porches, bays, and balconies, and trim details are especially encouraged.
RBD 2-3)    Emphasize high-quality design and construction; design elements and
           detailing should be continued around the entire structure.

HILLSIDE RESIDENTIAL SITE PLANNING
The history of Brea lies in its hillsides: in the oil
industry, production camps and early settlements
that predate the city’s founding. Today, Brea’s
rugged hills provide a scenic backdrop to the
community and insulate the community
geographically and emotionally from Los Angeles
and San Bernardino counties.
 While development in some areas is inevitable,
it is important to preserve the unique topography
of the hillsides and limit the impact of new
development. This can be achieved through a variety of design techniques such as
cluster housing, preservation of ridgelines, and maintaining the natural contours of the
land whenever possible.
Design Principle 1: Site hillside residential dwellings to minimize disturbance to hillside
areas and protect significant topographic features, emphasizing large lots with extensive
acreage left unbuilt.
                          BREA GENERAL PLAN
                                         B-27

Design Guidelines:
HRP 1-1)  Minimize disturbance to the natural surroundings; in particular, grading
          should be limited to roadways and building envelopes and naturalistic grading
          techniques should be employed.
HRP 1-2)  Protect environmentally sensitive areas; a significant percentage of each lot
          should remain in its undeveloped state, and preferably, the most sensitive
          hillside areas will be maintained as public open space.
HRP 1-3)  Design roads and driveways that conform to the natural contour of the land
          and limit visual disruption of the landscape; roads that run perpendicular to
          the site contours are generally discouraged.
HRP 1-4)  Locate dwellings and their accessory structures away from visually prominent
          locations; as far as feasible, hillside construction should be unobtrusive and
          retain a generally open and undeveloped character.

HILLSIDE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING DESIGN
  Design Principle 1: Design unobtrusive hillside residential dwellings that are visually
  compatible with the undeveloped terrain.
  Design Guidelines:
  HRD 1-1) Use building forms and materials that contribute to the integration of building
             and site; dwellings should generally exhibit a rural character.
  HRD 1-2) Reduce the bulk of hillside residential dwellings and emphasize building
             forms that conform to the topography; the profile of a hillside dwelling should
             remain close to the land.
  HRD 1-3)    Design visually attractive dwellings that vary from one another; facades
              should be articulated and roof forms should be consistent with the overall
              composition and hillside setting.
