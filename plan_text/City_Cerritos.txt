INTRODUCTION
CERRITOS − “A CITY WITH VISION”
This document represents our vision of Cerritos. Whether or not you are a resident
of our City, this General Plan provides you with an understanding of who we
are as a community, our vision of the future and the steps we will take to
achieve this vision.
Our General Plan was originally adopted in 1971. Responding to changes
in our community, we revised our General Plan again in 1988. Since that
time, many things have changed in our City. Many of the visions and goals
we hoped to accomplish in our previous General Plans have come to be
realized. Our community must now reflect on our past accomplishments,
evaluate new challenges and begin looking forward again to ensure our
future provides the same quality of life that we enjoy in 2003.
REFLECTING ON OUR PAST
Our history provides a glimpse into who we are as a community. We value
our rich history and we understand that our past tells us many things about
our present, and can influence our future.
We became a City on April 24, 1956. As a reflection of our agricultural
heritage, the name Dairy Valley was chosen. The extent of this agricultural
heritage was clear – more than 400 dairies and a cow population that
outnumbered residents twenty-nine to one. Dairy Valley was located in the
southern portion of Los Angeles County, in an area that that was generally
known as the Artesia Zoned District. Our neighboring communities were
Hawaiian Gardens, Artesia, and Monterey Acres, which is now known as
Lakewood. As shown on Exhibit I-1, Regional Location Map, our
geographic location was ideal - centrally located between the region’s
primary economic centers of downtown Los Angeles and Orange County.
INTRODUCTION                                                                       I-1

We began to experience significant change in our community by the early
1960s. The value of land and increased property taxes began to make
dairy operations difficult, and less profitable. Responding to this change,
our City voted in 1963 to allow the development of residences on lots
smaller than five acres. This decision allowed more traditional residential
development to occur within our City for the first time.
As the physical features of our community changed, so did our name. On
January 10, 1967, we officially named our community Cerritos, paying
homage to our historic connection with our Spanish heritage and the
Rancho Los Cerritos Spanish land grant that bears our City’s name.
The 1960s were a period of growth for our community. By 1970, our
population had blossomed to 15,865 residents. Understanding growth was
inevitable, our City wanted to ensure we developed in a well-planned
manner with a balance of residential, commercial and industrial
development.        Creating a well-planned community included being
grounded in a respect for the environment and the provision of a lush, park-
like setting that contributed to a high-quality of life.
On October 27, 1971 we adopted the City’s first General Plan. This Plan’s
purpose was to provide a positive program of urban development that
reflected our values as a community. The General Plan designated almost
50 percent of our community for residential development.
Through the next decade, our community began to mature into the Cerritos
we see today. In 1978, we dedicated our City Hall, which was the first solar-
heated City Hall complex in the Country – a testament to our forward vision.
The Cerritos of today is a thriving community. Exhibit I-2, Aerial Photograph,
provides an aerial view of our community. We’ve become one of the most
ethnically diverse communities of its size in the United States. We’ve seen
our commercial centers grow and diversify. We’ve seen our urban
landscape mature and contribute to the aesthetic quality of our community.
We’ve seen our schools rank as some of the best in the country. We’ve
also seen our City become a regional attraction. Our state-of-the-art
performing arts center, sheriff’s station and Cerritos Library express our
community pride and the importance we place in providing for our citizenry.
LOOKING TO OUR FUTURE
So, today we stand in our present, looking eagerly to our future. We
understand that progressing to the future requires us to evaluate new
challenges and seek solutions to those challenges. We understand that our
community is almost completely developed and we must think of new and

creative ways to continue to provide for the changing economic and social
needs of our community. We also recognize that as times change, so does
our vision. Many of the goals we had hoped to achieve have been
accomplished. Now we must refine our vision, so that it reflects our
community today and what we want for it tomorrow. Our General Plan
helps us to do this. The General Plan clarifies our vision of Cerritos’ future
and provides the road map to take us there.
HOW DOES OUR GENERAL PLAN WORK?
We use our General Plan as a tool that takes our ultimate vision of Cerritos
and provides the policy framework that enables our values, visions and
objectives to become reality.
We are required by California State law to adopt a General Plan that
provides the policy framework for the long-term physical development of
our community. Our General Plan expresses our community’s development
goals and provides specific public policy relative to the public and private
uses of land in our community. Our General Plan links our community
values, visions and objectives with the way we utilize our public and private
land and other community resources. It is comprehensive and long-term,
and provides the primary guidance for specific projects, policy actions or
programs that may occur in the future.
Our General Plan contains ten Elements. State law requires us to include
seven mandatory Elements, including: Land Use, Circulation, Housing,
Conservation, Open Space, Noise, and Safety. State law also allows us to
include optional Elements. We have included three optional Elements as
part of this General Plan, including: Growth Management, Air Quality and
Community Design. The ten Elements of this General Plan are described in
detail below.
    o Land Use Element
        Our Land Use Element serves as a long-range planning guide for
        development within the City. It provides us with an indication of the
        location and extent of development to be allowed over the next 20
        years. Our Land Use Element also identifies the goals and policies
        that will guide development. This Element contains a Land Use
        Policy Map which serves as a visual tool to assist with the
        implementation of the guidelines that are established in this and
        other sections of the General Plan.
    o Community Design Element
        Our Community Design Element will help guide future development
        in the City, so that overall public and private development will
INTRODUCTION                                                                   I-5

               contribute to a high-quality visual environment. This Element
               addresses design issues related to community image, development
               within the public right-of-way and development on private property
               relative to architectural design, site planning and signage.
             o Circulation Element
               Our Circulation Element provides programs and policies to establish
               a roadway system that adequately accommodates future growth
               consistent with the Land Use Element. Our Circulation Element
               seeks to provide for a safe, convenient and efficient transportation
               system allowing for the movement of people and goods throughout
               the City and the region. Additionally, the Circulation Element
               includes policies for bike lanes, street improvements and other
               transportation-related issues.
             o Housing Element
               Our Housing Element provides programs and policies that assist
               our community, region and state in meeting the goal of providing
               housing affordable to all socioeconomic segments of the
               population.       The Element addresses citywide housing and
               population demographics, regional fair-share housing allocations
               and implementation strategies to assist our City in providing a full
               range of housing opportunities.
             o Safety Element
               Our Safety Element is intended to reduce the potential risk of death,
               injuries, property damage, and the economic and social dislocation
               resulting from hazards such as fires, floods, earthquakes,
               landslides, and other hazards. It serves as a guide for our City
               government and the general public in understanding the hazards
               facing the City of Cerritos and how we can reduce the impacts of
               these hazards.
             o Conservation Element
               Our Conservation Element provides an inventory of water resources,
               energy resources, solid waste generation and reduction and historic
               and cultural resources in the City. This Element provides direction
               regarding the conservation, development and utilization of natural
               resources within our City and the policies and programs to achieve
               them.
INTRODUCTION                                                                      I-6
    o Open Space/Recreation Element
        Our Open Space/Recreation Element outlines strategies and actions
        to preserve, and enhance open space areas in Cerritos to meet the
        recreational needs of our residents. Open space in the City
        includes neighborhood, community and regional parks, as well as
        community centers, trailways, golf courses and open space
        easements.
    o Air Quality Element
        Our Air Quality Element is intended to protect the public’s health
        and welfare by implementing measures that allow the South Coast
        Air Basin to attain federal and state air quality standards. To achieve
        this, the Element sets forth a number of programs to reduce current
        pollution emissions and to require new development to include
        measures to comply with air quality standards. In addition, this
        Element contains provisions to address new air quality
        requirements.
    o Noise Element
        Our Noise Element describes the existing noise environment within
        the City and its relationship with Federal, State and City noise
        regulations. This Element also provides a framework to limit noise
        exposure within the City that considers both the existing and future
        noise environments and the compatibility of land uses.
    o Growth Management Element
        Our Growth Management Element focuses on the City’s ability to
        accommodate growth and development, while providing an
        adequate infrastructure and circulation systems. This Element also
        focuses on ways for the City to enhance long-term revenue sources,
        so that the City can continue to provide its residents and businesses
        with the highest level and quality of services.
HOW WE IMPLEMENT OUR GENERAL PLAN
Our General Plan is a policy document that clearly states our community’s
development policy. To further this, our City Council formally adopts our
General Plan as the primary development guidance tool. All future
programs and projects will seek policy guidance from the General Plan.
To further the policies contained in our General Plan, we develop
ordinances and regulations and secure the staffing and financial resources
to carry out programs that implement our policy goals.
INTRODUCTION                                                                    I-7

             In order to assure our General Plan truly works as a tool to implement our
             community’s vision, we periodically review our policies and programs.
             State law requires our City Community Development Department to provide
             an annual report to our City Council about the General Plan and our
             progress in its implementation. We also periodically seek comment or
             conduct surveys of our residents, business owners and community groups
             to ensure our community’s needs and concerns are being addressed
             adequately.
             Our City is a Charter City and therefore is not expressly required by State
             law to provide consistency between our Land Use Element of the General
             Plan and the Zoning Ordinance. As a matter of good planning procedure,
             we make every effort to provide consistency between these two documents.
INTRODUCTION                                                                          I-8

CHAPTER 2
LAND USE ELEMENT
1.0      INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Element, more than any other element in the General Plan,
will shape the way that the City of Cerritos develops and redevelops in the
next 20 years. It will serve as a guide for both public officials and private
citizens for decisions about the type, intensity and general distribution of
uses of land for housing, business, industry, open space and public and
quasi-public uses. To the private citizen, it defines expectations of the type
of neighborhood, the location and type of shopping and service facilities,
and the time and distance to work and to other necessary activities. To the
public official, it is a framework for providing public facilities and services
and for directing new development. It is the basis for short-range and long-
range capital improvement programs.
The essential components of the Land Use Element are the General Plan
Land Use Map (Exhibit LU-4) and the goals and policies that guide future
development. While the General Plan Land Use Map may be seen as the
most essential component of the entire 2002 General Plan, it is basically a
graphic representation of the goals and policies expressed by all of the
General Plan’s elements. Users of this document are advised to refer to the
goals and policies, as well as the diagram when evaluating proposed
development and capital improvement projects.
2.0 AUTHORITY FOR THE ELEMENT
The State of California Government Code Section 65302 (a) requires that a
General Plan include:
         “...a Land Use Element which designates the proposed
         general distribution and general location and extent of the
         uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space
         including agriculture, natural resources, recreation and
         enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public buildings and
         grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities and other
         categories of public and private uses of land.
         The Land Use Element shall include a statement of the
         standards of population density and building intensity
         recommended for the various districts and other territory

                 3.0 SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
                 3.1     SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
                 The City of Cerritos is a mature and urbanized city. Most of the land within
                 the City has been developed (over 99 percent) and redevelopment is
                 occurring throughout the City. Some of the land is undergoing a
                 transformation from uses established 30 years ago into new uses to
                 accommodate the changes over time and changes in the needs of people
                 within the City.
                 When the General Plan was updated in 1988, the number of local shopping
                 centers decreased, regional shopping centers increased, residential lots
                 increased in size, residential densities were re-evaluated and parklands
                 were increased. Changes in the Plan between 1988 and the present have
                 guided development to produce the City of Cerritos as it stands today. The
                 fully developed nature of the City means that most services are developed
                 and the City is responding to changes in the economy and in the
                 demographics of the area.
                 The existing land use pattern within the City closely corresponds with the
                 City’s 1988 General Plan and zoning patterns for the community. Table LU-
                 1, Existing Land Use, quantifies the amount of acreage devoted to each
                 land use, as well as the existing number of dwelling units or square feet
                 within each category.
                 3.1.1   RESIDENTIAL
                 The majority of the land area within the City is developed as residential.
                 Most of the existing residential is single-family homes developed in the
                 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Apartments, townhomes and condominiums also
                 exist throughout the City. New residential opportunities exist for infill on
                 vacant parcels and also on sites available for redevelopment.
                 Low Density Residential Development
                 Approximately 33 percent of the City’s land is developed as Low Density
                 Residential (refer to Table LU-1). The majority of residential development
                 occurred in the period between 1960 and 1970 when the pressure for
                 suburban expansion in the area was greatest.
                 Larger single-family subdivisions were built when the City was going
                 through the process of converting agricultural land to residential. Today,
                 residential development of single-family homes is occurring primarily on
                 vacant or undeveloped parcels. Center Stone, a subdivision on the

southwest corner of Artesia Boulevard and Gridley Road was previously a

Street and Shoemaker Avenue was converted from an educational use for
Whitney High School to a single-family subdivision. Other parcels
throughout the City are being redeveloped. Older homes are being
purchased, torn down and the sites redeveloped with new, contemporary
homes.
All City neighborhoods meet the current street design requirements.
Landscaping throughout City neighborhoods includes lawns and tree-lined
streets. Property maintenance is one of the primary factors in sustaining the
high-quality of life that currently exists in the City.
LAND USE ELEMENT                                                                                  LU-3
                 Medium Density Residential Development
                 Medium Density Residential development is dispersed throughout the City
                 and accounts for 3.6 percent of the City’s total acreage (refer to Table LU-
                 1). As of August 2001, land designated as Medium Density Residential
                 accommodated 2,596 units. Most of the units developed after the 1970s
                 when the demand for different housing types arose.
                 The typical Medium Density Residential development consists of
                 townhomes or condominiums. These housing units represent the majority of
                 the City’s multi-family housing stock. Most of these developments include
                 common open space areas with recreational facilities, including pools and
                 picnic areas. Several of the communities were developed under Area
                 Development Plans, which include design guidelines that may be
                 considered more stringent than the standard development requirements in
                 the City.
                 Three recent developments in the City have been developed in an attempt
                 to satisfy State affordable housing mandates, and are restricted to seniors
                 over the age of 62. A total of 224 senior housing units have been
                 developed in the Emerald Villas and Pioneer Villas projects. The third
                 project, Avalon at Cerritos, is a 147-unit congregate care facility located on
                 the Cerritos Community College Campus. These housing projects are
                 meeting the demands of the aging population. In addition, these
                 developments provide affordable housing, and provide services tailored to
                 meet the needs of the residents.
                 3.1.2   COMMERCIAL
                 Commercial development encompasses about 496 acres of land in the
                 City, which represents about 8.6 percent of the overall land area of the City
                 (refer to Table LU-1). Commercial uses are concentrated into centers
                 located throughout the City to meet the day-to-day needs of its citizens and
                 to serve the surrounding region. The City discourages “strip” or “ribbon”
                 commercial centers.
                 Neighborhood and Community Shopping Centers
                 Neighborhood and community shopping centers are located throughout the
                 community. These centers are limited in size and provide day-to-day goods
                 and services. They are located at major street intersections, most
                 frequently at one-mile intervals. Grocery or major retail stores are the
                 anchors for these centers with a variety of service and commercial uses in
                 the same center, such as restaurants, dry-cleaners and florists.

Many of these centers are older, having been developed in the 1970s as the
residential subdivisions were being built. Architecture and building sizes do
not always reflect the needs of current tenants, or the design of adjacent
uses.
Regional Commercial
The City of Cerritos is very fortunate to have several major regional
commercial centers in the City. The Los Cerritos Center, the Cerritos Auto
Square and the Cerritos Towne Center all provide for major regional
commercial activities that produce significant employment opportunities
and tax revenues for the City.
The Los Cerritos Center is about 95 acres in size, with a floor area of over
1.3 million square feet. Los Cerritos Center includes five major department
stores, approximately 140 specialty shops, theaters, restaurants, financial
institutions and many other customer services. The Center provides a
broad choice of goods and price ranges for comparison shopping and
competitive merchandising. Redevelopment or expansion of the Los
Cerritos Center is possible through the development of parking structures
and improvement of the roads to accommodate increases in traffic.
The Cerritos Auto Square occupies approximately 125 acres west of the I-
605 freeway. The Auto Square houses 24 car dealerships in approximately
800,000 square feet of floor area. Consumers from the entire Southern
California region shop at the Auto Square, making it the world’s most
successful auto mall. Additional information on the Auto Square is found
later in this element under Area Development Plan Five: Cerritos Auto
Square.
The Cerritos Towne Center is about 98 acres in size, with a floor area of
over 2.8 million square feet. The Cerritos Towne Center combines office,
retail, hotel and entertainment facilities in one master planned project. The
Cerritos Towne Center includes the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts,
a 203-room Sheraton Hotel and more than 1.0 million square feet of office
space. The retail portion of the Center includes five major department
stores, 28 specialty shops and services, theaters and 14 restaurants.
Additional information on the Cerritos Towne Center is found later in this
element under Area Development Plan Two: Cerritos Towne Center.
3.1.3     INDUSTRIAL
Industrial areas are located primarily in the north and northeast sections of
the City of Cerritos. Approximately 726 acres of land are designated for
industrial uses within the City, which represents about 13 percent of the
total land area of the City (see Table LU-1). The industrial sites are situated
to provide easy access to truck routes and major transportation routes,
LAND USE ELEMENT                                                                LU-5

                 including freeways and rail. Most of these sites can be accessed from
                 Alondra Boulevard along the City’s northern boundary, as well as from
                 several other major thoroughfares including Valley View Avenue, Marquardt
                 Avenue and Artesia Boulevard. The industrial districts are characterized by
                 large, landscaped setbacks and architectural features to diminish the
                 negative visual impacts of parking and loading facilities.
                 3.1.4   PARKS AND RECREATION
                 Parks
                 The City of Cerritos provides ample park and open space facilities and
                 programs for its residents. The City currently operates 20 parks within the
                 City encompassing 187 acres. The City also pays for the operation and
                 maintenance of two park sites outside the City limits: Bettencourt and
                 Rainbow, as well as for facilities associated with ABC Unified School District
                 sites.
                 The range of neighborhood, community and regional parks provide
                 residents with playing courts, athletic fields, picnic shelters and meeting
                 rooms. Also, residents can swim laps or take courses at the Cerritos
                 Olympic Swim and Fitness Center. The Community Gymnasiums at
                 Cerritos and Whitney High Schools provide youth activities and indoor
                 sports for residents of all ages. The Cerritos Senior Center at Pat Nixon
                 Park offers a variety of special events, recreation, special interest classes
                 and human services to seniors, age 50 and older.
                 Golf Courses
                 The City of Cerritos includes one golf course within its jurisdictional
                 boundaries: the City of Cerritos Iron-Wood Nine Golf Course. The
                 approximately 22.1-acre facility has become one of the more popular nine-
                 hole executive course in the area. The facility offers nine holes of golf,
                 totaling approximately 2,936 yards. A night-lighted driving range is also
                 available on-site.
                 3.1.5   COMMUNITY FACILITIES
                 Community facilities include civic and government buildings, schools,
                 churches, drainage channels and utility easements.               These uses
                 encompass a total of approximately 700 acres, which represents 11.7
                 percent of the City’s total land (refer to Table LU-1).

Civic and Government Facilities
The Civic Center is located on the northwest corner of Bloomfield Avenue
and 183rd Street. The Civic Center is the administrative center for the City
and includes office space for City employees and chambers suitable for
governmental meetings of the City Council, operating departments and City
agencies. In addition, the Cerritos Library and a full service Los Angeles
County Sheriff’s station are located here.
Other civic facilities include the City’s Corporate Yard, which is located at
Marquardt Avenue and 166th Street and consists of warehouse buildings, an
outdoor storage yard and two six million gallon water reservoirs; the City’s
five water well sites, which are located throughout the City; and a 12 million
gallon reservoir located north of SR-91 and west of Studebaker Road at
Reservoir Hill Park.
Other governmental facilities in the City include a post office located on the
northeast corner of 183rd Street and Carmenita Road, and the ABC Unified
School District Center located on the southeast corner of Norwalk
Boulevard and 166th Street.
Library
The first phase of the Cerritos Library (18,000 square feet) was completed in
1973, and the phase two remodel and expansion to 41,500 square feet was
completed in 1987. On March 16, 2002, the City dedicated the new
“Experience Library” adjacent to City Hall. The new three-story, 88,500
square foot facility is twice the size of the previous facility, with a capacity
for over 300,000 volumes, which represents more than five books per
capita. The Cerritos Library is the first titanium-clad building in the United
States; its gold exterior changes color with the atmospheric conditions.
Themed spaces define the library’s collections with an Old World Reading
Room, a World Traditions area; Save the Planet (Children) area; and an Art
Deco (Teen) area with a Main Street linking the themed areas. The
interactive children’s area includes: Stan, an authentic Tyrannosaurus-rex
replica, a 15,000-gallon saltwater aquarium, a scale model of a NASA
space shuttle, a rainforest tree, a lighthouse, an art studio, a theater, and
computer workstations.
The library also functions as a museum, with exhibit spaces and museum -
quality exhibits, cultural artifacts and art from Asia and other cultures,
including pieces by Dale Chihuly, Al Held, Lita Albuquerque, Bruce Everett,
Peter Hopkins, Karen Koblitz, Hung Lia, Soonja Oh Kim, Pat Steir and Jim
Zhang. In addition, the library houses the First Ladies Collection, a
collection of books, quotes, portraits, and personal items about these
important American women.

                 Technology supports all areas of library service and function with 200
                 computer workstations, 600 computer/internet connection ports,
                 Checkpoint system (self check-out), and MyClio intranet.
                 Museum
                 The City is committed to providing its residents with cultural resources. In
                 June 2001, the City acquired a building located on the southeast corner of
                 Bloomfield Avenue and 183 rd Street, for the purpose of creating a high-
                 quality museum. The intent is to create City-owned and operated facility
                 that could serve as a showcase for art, collections of interest and artifacts
                 from the past. At the time, the General Plan was adopted (January 2004),
                 the City was investigating the feasibility of the museum.
                 Cerritos is an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution Museum and Research
                 Center, and as such, would have access to items for both short- and long-
                 term loan. In addition, a number of traveling exhibits are available through
                 Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Services (SITES), Curatorial
                 Assistance Traveling Exhibitions (CATE) as well as other museums and
                 curatorial services that specialize in obtaining pieces from other public and
                 private collections.
                 Schools
                 The City of Cerritos provides for approximately 404 acres of land dedicated

                 Drainage Channels/Utility Easements
                 The two major storm drain channels in the City are the San Gabriel River
                 and Coyote Creek. The San Gabriel River is located along the western
                 edge of the City, while Coyote Creek is located on the eastern edge of the
                 City. Both channels are concrete-lined channels designated as floodways
                 and serve both Cerritos and the region. Recreation trails are incorporated
                 into the design of each facility to provide regional recreation access.

3.1.6       VACANT AND UNDERUTILIZED LAND
Exhibit LU-1, Vacant and Underutilized Land, graphically depicts the location
of sites in the City that are either vacant or have been identified as
underutilized. The acreage total of the sites is shown in Table LU-2,
Summary of Vacant and Underutilized Land. Vacant land refers to parcels
with no development. Underutilized land refers to parcels that are
developed below the potential use or capacity of the site. In some cases
underutilized land can consist of parcels that have: (1) a large portion of
the site in non-building uses, such as excessive surface parking or outdoor
work or storage areas; (2) a high percentage of structure(s) vacant; (3) a
low floor area ratio; (4) buildings that are dilapidated or otherwise impaired
by physical deficiencies; or (5) inefficient or functionally obsolete structures.

LAND USE ELEMENT                                     LU-12
Vacant Land
The City of Cerritos is almost entirely developed. In August 2001, only a
very limited amount of land, approximately 27 acres, in the City was vacant,
which comprises less than one percent of the City’s total acreage. The
limited amount of vacant land results in an increased demand for the
redevelopment of existing parcels. This trend is not new in Cerritos, and the
extent of private redevelopment can be expected to increase.
Underutilized Land
There are approximately 46 acres in the City that are underutilized.
Underutilized sites are located throughout the City and include a variety of
residential, commercial and industrial designated sites. The majority of the
underutilized sites fall into the commercial or industrial use categories.
As previously mentioned, there are a limited number of vacant or
underutilized parcels in the City suitable for large residential, commercial or
industrial infill development. Many factors contribute to the suitability of
these parcels including size, orientation, shape, location, property value and
existing Municipal Code regulations. In addition, many of these parcels are
former service station sites less than one-half acre in size that are located
adjacent to residential land uses and/or located at the corner of major
intersections in the City. All of these factors limit the infill development
potential of these parcels.
Many of the vacant and/or underutilized parcels are the result of the
abandonment of the traditional service station. The industry trend is to
move away from the smaller acreage site, which offered gasoline sales and
automobile service bays, towards a larger acreage site with a convenience
service station that sells merchandise, car washes or other services to
patrons in addition to gasoline sales. The abandonment of service stations
can also be attributed to the State regulations that require operators to
replace all existing single-lined underground storage tanks (UST) with dual-
lined USTs. The cost of upgrading USTs can make it unprofitable for
service station operators to continue their business.
3.2      RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PLANS
The Land Use Element provides the basic guidelines for physical
development within the City of Cerritos. These guidelines form an umbrella
of land use designations and generalized land use patterns that set the
policy of how the City will develop and what it wants to accomplish with its
development. Several other planning tools are used to implement the
policies for land use set forth in this document. These tools include the
City’s zoning ordinance, area development plans, redevelopment plans and
development agreements.
LAND USE ELEMENT                                                                LU-13

                 3.2.1     CITY’S ZONING ORDINANCE
                 Zoning is the means by which cities implement their General Plans. The
                 City of Cerritos’ ordinance does just this – it translates the long-term goals
                 and policies of the plan into the guidelines used for everyday decisions.
                 While the General Plan provides long-range and broad categories of land
                 use, zoning provides specific development requirements, such as density,
                 height, size and development character. Similar to the General Plan, a
                 zoning map accompanies the ordinance, which is primarily text, to define
                 the boundaries of each zoning district.
                 The City of Cerritos’ Zoning Ordinance (Chapter 22.20-22.33 of the Cerritos
                 Municipal Code) establishes land use zones that provide for the compatible
                 grouping of similar and interrelated land uses and applies uniform
                 regulations to properties similarly situated within each zoning classification
                 (City of Cerritos, Ordinance 413, Section 1 (part), 1972). As a charter city in
                 the State of California, zoning is not required to be in conformance with the
                 General Plan. However, in Cerritos, zoning and general plan designation
                 are generally in conformance.
                 3.2.2     AREA DEVELOPMENT PLANS
                 As provided for in Chapter 22.10 of the Cerritos Municipal Code, an area
                 development plan (ADP) is an instrument for guiding, coordinating and
                 regulating the development of property within a given area. Area
                 development plans are a “specific plan” as authorized in Article 8 of
                 Chapter 3 of the State Planning and Zoning Law. They also replace the
                 usual zoning regulations and are required to be consistent with and carry
                 out the provisions and objectives of the General Plan of the City. In the City
                 of Cerritos, the ADP is also adopted into the Zoning Ordinance and
                 replaces the usual zoning regulations for the given area.
                 Area development plans serve as a basis for the City to consider and act
                 upon more detailed precise plans prepared by landowners, developers and
                 public agencies. ADPs promote appropriate land uses and encourage the
                 highest possible quality of design and environment within the designated
                 area. Objectives, policies and standards are established to capitalize upon
                 the special qualities and opportunities of the area while permitting the
                 flexibility required to consider unique and imaginative designs. An ADP
                 establishes a land use pattern, circulation system, open space and other
                 features as necessary to coordinate developments on adjacent parcels and
                 in order to achieve a functionally and visually integrated development of the
                 entire area.
                 As of February 2003, there were 12 Area Development Plans within the City,
                 which are illustrated on Exhibit LU-2, Area Development Plans, as well as on
                 the Land Use Map, Exhibit LU-4. Table LU-3, Area Development Plan
LAND USE ELEMENT                                                                           LU-14

* Net Acres includes only privately owned land in the ADP. The area excludes land area occupied by road and rail rights-of-way.
Area Development Plan One (ADP-1): Cerritos Industrial Park
ADP-1 is an extension of a large industrial area spanning approximately 300
acres in the northern portion of the City. This ADP is bounded by
Bloomfield Avenue on the west, the northern Cerritos City boundary on the
north (a portion of which borders Alondra Boulevard), Carmenita Road on
the east and 166th Street on the south. ADP-1 is located within the Los
Coyotes Redevelopment Project Area.
ADP-1 is an industrial area that provides goods and services to the entire
region through a network of rail, highway and freeway facilities. The area
benefits from having two freeways in the immediate vicinity and three major
highways for boundaries. Thus, it provides unique opportunities for light
industrial uses and is ideally suited for industrial development to service a
regional market. Almost two-thirds of the development area border faces
either residential land uses, a community park or a junior high school. The
borders adjacent to these uses require landscaping and buffering, so that
the industrial development is integrated and compatible with these uses. In
addition, 166th Street, Bloomfield Avenue and Carmenita Road serve as
buffers between the industrial and residential uses.

LAND USE ELEMENT                                     LU-18
ADP-1 permits two land uses: manufacturing-plant and manufacturing-
office. Manufacturing-plant uses are conditional uses, subject to the criteria
and limitations of Municipal Code Section 22.11.130 and other conditions
the planning commission deems necessary to realize the intent of the
development code. The conditional uses for manufacturing-plant include:
     o   Business and research offices;
     o   Bottling works;
     o   Machine shops;
     o   Manufacturing;
     o   Government or public utility facilities;
     o   Publishing, printing, lithographing and engraving;
     o   Recycling facility, pursuant to the provisions of Section 22.40.700 of
         the Municipal Code;
     o   Restaurants, excluding drive-ins and carry-outs;
     o   Scientific research and experimental development laboratories;
     o   Wholesaling and warehousing;
     o   Comparable uses as determined according to Section 22.20.100 of
         the Municipal Code; or
     o   Limited retail sales and service in conjunction with any other use in
         Section 22.11.140 of the Municipal Code.
Manufacturing-office is a conditionally permitted use in ADP-1, which
includes the following:
     o Financial institutions, such as banks, savings and loan associations
         and credit unions;
     o Trade or professional schools;
     o Office uses of a business, administrative, service, consulting or
         professional type including sale of services, equipment, supplies
         and goods to commercial accounts, including limited retail sales
         and service to the public in conjunction with a permitted use;
     o Restaurants, excluding drive-ins and carry-outs;
     o Government or public utility facilities; or
     o Medical, dental or completely enclosed veterinary clinics.
The objectives for ADP-1 are to: (1) provide protection for surrounding
residential land uses; (2) create a highly attractive ni dustrial area both
visually and functionally; (3) provide a source of economic strength to the
community in terms of employment, city revenues and related business
activity; and (4) realize the highest and best use of the area for the
economic benefit of both the City and area property owners.
ADP-1 is almost fully developed. Industry within the ADP-1 designation is
very cohesive. The entire development plan area is surrounded by
landscape buffers making it compatible with adjacent residential areas.
LAND USE ELEMENT                                                                LU-19
                 The few remaining vacant parcels within the development plan area have
                 interim uses such as truck storage.
                 Area Development Plan Two (ADP-2): Cerritos Towne Center
                 ADP-2 encompasses approximately 98 acres in the area bounded by
                 Bloomfield Avenue on the west, SR-91 on the north, Shoemaker Avenue on
                 the east and 183rd Street on the south. The development plan area includes
                 the entire right-of-way of each of the bounding streets and extends to the
                 centerline of SR-91.         ADP-2 is located within the Los Coyotes
                 Redevelopment Project Area.
                 ADP-2 provides for one land use: town center commercial. The area was
                 planned to provide commercial uses primarily on the north side of Towne
                 Center Drive, and office and civic uses to the south of Towne Center Drive.
                 The objectives for ADP-2 are to: (1) establish a “town center” that provides
                 for office professional, governmental, institutional, retail and recreational
                 uses. Facilities for these various activities are to be selectively combined
                 with the nearby civic center, high school, community park and churches in
                 order to form an active focal point of community life; (2) provide an area of
                 outstanding environmental character, including a high-quality visual design,
                 suppression of noise and protection of public health and safety; (3) realize
                 additional tax revenues that can be used to improve the quality of public
                 services for all the citizens of Cerritos; and (4) minimize any undesirable
                 impact on the surrounding residential areas.
                 ADP-2 is highly visible and easily accessible via SR-91, and as such, the
                 site provides an opportunity to create a significant focal point of community
                 life, community identity and pride in the City. Additionally, the area provides
                 a long-range and on-going source of economic strength to the community
                 in terms of employment and tax revenue for community services.
                 ADP-2 offers both community and regional commercial, as well as
                 significant employment opportunities with the offices and hotel. City offices
                 and services are provided adjacent to the ADP, which support the concept
                 of the area being a true “town center.” The Cerritos Towne Center is also
                 home to the Sheraton Hotel and the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts,
                 a cultural and entertainment center that serves not only the City, but the
                 entire region. Most of the Towne Center developed during the 1990s and a
                 few vacant parcels still remain, although development has been planned for
                 these parcels.

Area Development Plan Three (ADP-3): Residential Mixed Density
ADP-3 encompasses approximately 133 acres of land within the northern
portion of the City. The ADP is bounded by 166th Street on the south,
Norwalk Boulevard on the west, Bloomfield Avenue to the east and Alondra
Boulevard and the northern Cerritos City boundary on the north, and
excludes approximately three acres of land located on the northeast corner
of the intersection of Norwalk Boulevard and 166th Street having
approximately 382 feet of street frontage on Norwalk Boulevard. ADP-3 is
located within the Los Coyotes Redevelopment Project Area.
The only permitted category of land use within this ADP is planned
residential development (PRD). The basic objective for development within
ADP-3 is to provide a highly attractive, innovative and stimulating living
environment featuring a combination of single-family and townhome
residential units, as well as generously landscaped common activity areas.
This provides residents of the area with a closely coordinated sense of
diversity and sense of place within a totally planned, park-like community.
Single-family neighborhoods in this ADP include The Courts and Granada
Park. Multi-family neighborhoods include Sundance, Parkside and Tiburon.
Area Development Plan Four (ADP-4): Shadow Park
ADP-4 consists of approximately 116 acres of land. The ADP is generally
bounded by South Street on the north, Bloomfield Avenue on the west,
Coyote Creek and 195th Street on the south and Shoemaker Avenue on the
east. ADP-4 is located within the Los Coyotes Redevelopment Project Area.
The only permitted category of land use within the ADP is planned
residential development (PRD). This ADP is intended to capitalize upon the
highly desirable characteristics of the area and its vicinity by integrating
common open space with low density single-family residential. The
objectives for ADP-4 are to: (1) provide a residential environment that
fosters meaningful human interaction, neighborhood identity and the
opportunity to enjoy a verdant, pedestrian-oriented and park-like
community; and (2) provide for a residential environment that will
compliment the natural beauty of Cerritos Regional Park to the south.
Area Development Plan Five (ADP-5): Cerritos Auto Square
ADP-5 consists of approximately 125 acres of land. The ADP is generally
bounded by Crusader Avenue and the San Gabriel River Channel on the
west, the San Gabriel River Freeway (I-605) on the east, 183rd Street on the

and excludes some parcels north of South Street (refer to Exhibit LU-2, Area
Development Plans). This ADP is located within the Los Cerritos
Redevelopment Project Area.
LAND USE ELEMENT                                                             LU-21
                 ADP-5 provides for four categories of land uses: specialized commercial,
                 related commercial, office commercial and open space. Existing land uses
                 in the ADP include a multi-residential building apartment complex
                 consisting of 150 units, automobile dealerships and office buildings. The
                 apartment complex is located in the middle of the development area.
                 The objectives of ADP-5 are to: (1) establish a regional automobile
                 shopping center with ancillary and coordinated commercial sales, services
                 and uses; (2) establish the cooperation and coordination of participants in
                 the development and operation of the commercial complex; (3) establish a
                 long-range and on-going source of economic strength to the community in
                 terms of employment and tax revenue for community services; (4) protect
                 and enhance the natural, social and physical attributes of the development
                 area so as to not detrimentally affect adjacent existing developments; and
                 (5) establish innovative and quality site planning and architectural design
                 maintaining a prosperous and marketable specialized commercial complex
                 unique and individual in itself.
                 ADP-5 includes the Cerritos Auto Square. In 1976, the ADP was amended
                 to permit restricted commercial uses that would enhance and support the
                 regional character of this commercial area. The restricted commercial uses
                 have enhanced and expanded the marketing capabilities and advantages
                 of this area. The Auto Square is currently fully developed. Vacant land for
                 the expansion of the Auto Square is currently not available, and therefore,
                 the dealerships make use of many of the surrounding power line easements
                 and industrial sites for vehicle storage. Expansion opportunities for the Auto
                 Square are limited because surrounding land is fully developed.

                 includes approximately 275 feet of frontage on SR-91 and 719 feet of
                 frontage on 166 th Street. ADP-6 is located within the Los Coyotes
                 Redevelopment Project Area.
                 The only category of land use within the ADP is planned residential
                 development (PRD). The basic objective for development within ADP-6 is to
                 provide a highly attractive, innovative and stimulating townhouse living
                 environment featuring generously landscaped common activity areas. This
                 provides residents of the area with a closely coordinated sense of diversity
                 and sense of place within a totally planned, park-like community.

3.2.3 REDEVELOPMENT PLANS
The adoption of redevelopment plans by cities is allowed by the State
Legislature under the Community Redevelopment Law of the State of
California. Redevelopment plans are intended to revitalize and rehabilitate
blighted areas. Government assistance is provided initially with the intent to
encourage private investment as well. Because redevelopment projects
must be in conformance with the General Plan, these plans are one of the
more powerful means cities have to implement the goals and policies set
forth in their General Plan.
Two redevelopment plans have been adopted by the City of Cerritos: the
Los Cerritos Redevelopment Plan and the Los Coyotes Redevelopment
Plan (refer to Exhibit LU-3, Redevelopment Project Areas). With the express
purpose of eliminating blight through the redevelopment of buildings,
infrastructure and other facilities in an area, these two redevelopment areas
focus resources that have transformed and continue to improve specific
areas of the City.
In fiscal year 2003-2004, both the Los Cerritos and Los Coyotes
Redevelopment Plans were amended pursuant to Senate Bill 211 (2001,
authored by Senator Torlakson). The amendments are outlined in
Ordinance No. 874 for Los Cerritos, adopted November 11, 2003, and
Ordinance No. 875 for Los Coyotes, adopted November 11, 2003, and
LAND USE ELEMENT                                                               LU-25
                 effectively delete the time limit for the project areas to incur indebtedness
                 provided the Redevelopment Agency complies with Section 33607.7 of the
                 Health and Safety Code. Section 33607.7, as applied to the two
                 redevelopment project areas in Cerritos, requires that the Redevelopment
                 Agency begin making pass-through payments to the affected taxing
                 agencies in fiscal year 2005-2006. Senate Bill 1045 was signed by the
                 Governor in 2003. It is anticipated that the City will need to amend the
                 redevelopment project areas in 2004 to comply with the provisions of the
                 bill.
                 Los Cerritos Redevelopment Project Area
                 Originally established in November 1970, the Los Cerritos Redevelopment
                 Project Area encompassed 820 acres. In 1975, 120 acres were added to
                 the Project Area bringing the total acres to 940. The Los Cerritos
                 Redevelopment Project area is bounded by Alondra Boulevard on the north,
                 South Street on the south, irregularly by Studebaker Road, Eric Avenue and
                 Gridley Road on the east and the San Gabriel River Channel on the west.
                 The Los Cerritos Redevelopment Plan was adopted on November 17, 1970
                 with Ordinance No. 290 and has been amended three times: by Ordinance
                 No. 489 on May 7, 1975, by Ordinance No. 536 on December 1, 1976, and
                 by Ordinance No. 874 on November 24, 2003.
                 The original Los Cerritos Redevelopment Plan expires in November 2011,
                 while the amended Los Cerritos Redevelopment Plan expires in May 2016.
                 The time period for the Redevelopment Plan may be extended as allowable
                 by State law. The Redevelopment Agency may pay indebtedness or
                 receive property taxes in the original Los Cerritos project area through
                 November 2021, and in the amended Los Cerritos project area through May
                 2026.
                 The Cerritos Redevelopment Agency’s primary purpose in establishing the
                 original Los Cerritos Project Area was to remedy and alleviate blighted
                 conditions associated with undeveloped and unproductive vacant land,
                 inadequate street and circulation systems, unsuitable land mixes,
                 inadequate or the total lack of public street improvements and the existence
                 of substandard and incompatible uses and structures.
                 Los Coyotes Redevelopment Project Area
                 Originally established in May 1975, the Los Coyotes Redevelopment Project
                 Area encompasses approximately 1,600 acres throughout the City. The
                 majority of the Project Area is east of the City of Artesia and extends to both
                 the northern and southern City of Cerritos limits (refer to Exhibit LU-3,
                 Redevelopment Project Areas). The Los Coyotes Redevelopment Plan was
                 adopted in May 1975 with Ordinance No. 490 and has been amended two
                 times: by Ordinance No. 537 on December 1, 1976 and by Ordinance No.
                 875 on November 24, 2003.

The Los Coyotes Redevelopment Plan expires in May 2016, although the
time period for the Redevelopment Plan may be extended as allowable by
State law. The Redevelopment Agency may pay indebtedness or receive
property taxes in the Los Coyotes project area through May 2026.
The Cerritos Redevelopment Agency’s primary purpose in establishing the
original Los Cerritos Project Area was to promote sound new community
development that is viable, both physically and economically, within the
Project Area boundaries. The Plan for the Los Coyotes Project Area
responds to the need to correct problems within the Project Area
boundaries related to circulation, land use incompatibility, structural
dilapidation and deterioration, and to assist the private sector in providing
the type of development that will maximize the development of property
within the Project Area boundaries and prevent the reoccurrence of the
blight conditions.
Redevelopment Plan Objectives
The Cerritos Redevelopment Agency uses the process of redevelopment to
eliminate and mitigate visual, economic, physical, social and environmental
blight within the City. The following specific objectives were established by
the Redevelopment Agency and apply to both Redevelopment Project
Areas:
    o The elimination of existing blighted conditions, be they properties or
         structures, and the prevention of reoccurring blight in and about the
         Project Area.
    o The development of property within a coordinated land use pattern
         of residential, commercial, industrial, recreational and public
         facilities in the Project Area, consistent with the goals, policies,
         objectives, standards, guidelines and requirements, as set forth in
         the City’s adopted General Plan and Development Code.
    o The development of public services and facilities, including but not
         limited to recreational, maintenance and operation services and
         facilities as are necessary and required for the development of the
         Project Area.
    o The elimination of environmental deficiencies, including inadequate
         street improvements, inadequate utility systems, inadequate public
         services; and the removal of deficiencies in the freeway system,
         including its circulating movement and its social, physical and
         environmental characteristics of blight prevalent within the Project
         Area.

                 o The development of a more efficient and effective circulation
                   corridor system, free from hazardous vehicular, pedestrian and
                   bicycle interfaces and designed to their ultimate circulation flow.
                 o The implementation of techniques to mitigate blight characteristics
                   resulting from exposure to the freeway, including but not limited to
                   those visual and audible conditions affecting adjacent properties
                   within the Project Area.
                 o Beautification activities to eliminate all forms of blight, including but
                   not limited to visual blight, in order to encourage community identity.
                 o The encouragement, promotion and assistance in the development
                   and expansion of local commerce and needed commercial and
                   industrial facilities, increasing local employment opportunities,
                   improving the economic climate and establishing property within the
                   Project Area.

3.2.4 DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS
Development agreements are authorized by State law to enable a city to
enter into a binding contract with a developer in order to assure the city as
to the type, character and quality of development. In addition, developers
are assured that the necessary development permits will be issued
regardless of changes in regulations that may occur in the future.
Development agreements ensure that a developer of a multi-phased
project, who has based project financing on conditions negotiated with the
City at a particular time, would not be adversely affected by subsequent
change in regulations that might otherwise affect the project. This in turn,
enables the City to obtain additional contributions and benefits from the
developer.
As of August 2001, the City of Cerritos had entered into two development
agreements: one with Transpacific Development Company and one with
Vestar Development Company. Both agreements are associated with
development projects located within ADP-2.
3.3      PROPERTY MAINTENANCE
Cerritos takes great pride in its beautifully maintained neighborhoods,
carefully planned retail areas, and abundant recreational facilities, all of
which contribute to making Cerritos an attractive place to live and work.
The City is committed to maintaining this high-quality image through the
implementation of its Code Enforcement Program, whose authority is
specified in Chapter 6.20, Property Maintenance, of the City’s Municipal
Code. The Community and Safety Services Department is responsible for
implementing the City’s Code Enforcement Program. The intent of the
program is to help maintain the City’s park-like image, enhance property
values and preserve the high-quality of Cerritos neighborhoods. City code
enforcement officers respond to more than 3,000 calls from residents each
year; patrol the City’s streets for health, safety and appearance concerns
before the problems contribute to neighborhood decay; and plan the
annual City-wide Pride program.
4.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE LAND USE PLAN
4.1      OVERVIEW OF THE LAND USE PLAN
The graphic depiction of the City of Cerritos’ official policy relative to land
use is presented on Exhibit LU-4, General Plan Land Use Map. This
diagram illustrates the general pattern and relationship of the various land
uses in Cerritos in 2020.
LAND USE ELEMENT                                                                LU-31

                              An acreage calculation of the land use policy is presented in Table LU-4,
                              General Plan Land Use in 2020. The acreages of the various land uses on
                              the General Plan Land Use Map are presented, along with num ber of
                              dwelling units and the amount of non-residential square footage.
                              The General Plan Land Use Map should be used as general guide for the
                              identification of the location of various land uses in the City. The map
                              should be used in combination with the written goals and policies in the
                              Land Use Element.

                              Land use designations describe the type and intensity of development
                              allowed in a given area. While terms like “residential,” “commercial” or
                              “industrial” are generally understood, State General Plan law requires a
                              clear and concise description of the land use categories that are depicted
                              on Exhibit LU-4, General Plan Land Use Map, at the end of this element.
                              The Land Use Element and General Plan Land Use Map contain the
                              following 11 land use designations:

GENERAL PLAN LAND USE MAP
The General Plan Land Use Map (Exhibit LU-4) indicates the location of the
land use designations within the City. Copies of the General Plan Land
Use Map may be obtained from the City’s Community Development
Department.
LAND USE INTENSITY/DENSITY
State General Plan law requires the Land Use Element to indicate the
maximum building intensities/densities allowed in the City. The Land Use
Element contains 11 land use designations; each allows certain land uses
and establishes corresponding intensity/density standards (refer to Table
LU-5, Land Use Designations and Density/Intensity Standards). Table LU-5
also includes the expected overall levels of development within each land
use designation.
A number of terms are used to describe the land use designations. The
term “intensity” refers to the degree of development based on building
characteristics such as height, bulk, floor area ratio, and percent of lot
coverage. Intensity is most often used to describe non-residential
development levels.
The term “density,” in a land use context, is a measure of the desired
population or residential development capacity of the land. Residential
density is described in terms of dwelling units per gross acre (du/ac); thus,
the density of a residential development of 100 dwelling units occupying 20
acres of land is 5.0 du/acre. A dwelling unit is a building or a portion of a
building used for human habitation and may vary considerably in size
(square footage) from small apartments at 400-500 square feet to large
single-family homes exceeding 5,000 square feet. For purposes of
calculating population, an average number of persons per acre or dwelling
unit for all types and sizes of dwelling units is assumed.

DESIGNATIONS
Low Density Residential
The Low Density Residential designation is intended for the development of
single-family residential neighborhoods that:
    o    Provide access to schools, parks and other community services,
    o    Provide a high-quality architectural design,
    o    Provide an excellent environment for family life, and
    o    Preserve residential property values.
Densities for Low Density Residential range from 2 to 5.5 dwelling units per
acre (du/ac) with detached units each on their own parcel. Non-residential
uses that complement and serve the surrounding residential neighborhood
typically include schools, parks, churches, libraries and public facilities.
Uses such as community centers should also be allowed but with a
conditional use permit as directed through the Zoning Ordinance.
The majority of housing in the City of Cerritos is in this land use designation.
At an average of 3.8 persons per unit, population density in this designation
would be up to 20.9 persons per acre.
Zoning districts compatible with the Low Density Residential designation are
Single-Family Residential (RS), Multi-Family Residential (RM), ADP-3, ADP-
4, ADP-9 and ADP-12.
Medium Density Residential
The Medium Density Residential designation is intended for the
development of single-family and multi-family residential neighborhoods
that:
    o    Provide a variety of housing types,
    o    Provide access to schools, parks and other community services,
    o    Provide a high-quality architectural design that preserves privacy,
    o    Provide common spaces, recreation areas and services convenient
         to residents,
    o Provide an excellent environment for family life, and
    o Preserve residential property values.
Densities range from 6 to 20 dwelling units per acre (du/ac). The dwelling
units could be attached or detached and could include single-family,
duplexes, townhomes, condominiums and apartments. At an average of
3.8 persons per unit, population density in this designation would range
from 22.8 persons per acre to 76.0 persons per acre.

                 Non-residential uses that complement and serve Medium Density
                 Residential neighborhoods and surrounding residential communities, and
                 that are allowed within Medium Density Residential designated areas
                 typically include schools, parks, churches, libraries and public facilities.
                 Quasi-residential uses such as convalescent hospitals and group
                 residential homes are also allowed. Uses such as community centers and
                 offices supporting the neighborhood (such as leasing offices) are allowed
                 with a conditional use permit as directed by the Zoning Ordinance. The
                 same floor area ratios specified under the Community Commercial land use
                 designation apply to such uses.
                 Zoning districts compatible with the Medium Density Residential
                 designation are Multi-Family Residential (RM), ADP-3, ADP-6, ADP-7, ADP-

                 Office − Professional Commercial
                 The Office – Professional Commercial designation is intended for office and
                 professional employment and services that serve the community and
                 region. Uses in this designation include medical, professional, financial,
                 administrative, religious, private schools and their interrelated uses.
                 Commercial uses are minimized and would be more appropriate in the
                 Community Commercial Designation.
                 Sites with this designation need to be sensitive to the surrounding land uses
                 when establishing their site density. Floor area ratios (FAR) should range
                 from 0.5 to 2.5 depending on their relationship to adjacent uses. Sites
                 could accommodate a mix of single- to four-story buildings.
                 Zoning districts compatible with the Office-Professional designation are
                 Commercial-Office-Professional (C-O-P) and ADP-2.
                 Community Commercial
                 The Community Commercial designation is intended to allow a range of
                 commercial activities that serve local residential neighborhoods. Uses in
                 this designation include a variety of retail and professional services such as
                 markets, drug stores, retail shops, financial institutions, service
                 establishments, support offices and restaurants. On sites of acceptable
                 size and that can demonstrate adequate access capacity for vehicular
                 traffic, uses including department stores, retail clothing stores, theaters,
                 hotels and motels would also be allowed. Institutional uses such as
                 churches and schools are also appropriate if they are compatible with
                 surrounding land uses.
                 Sites with this designation need to be sensitive to the surrounding land uses
                 when establishing their development intensity. Floor area ratios (FAR)

range from 0.2 for high trip generating land uses to 1.0 for low trip
generating land uses. A mix of one- and two-story buildings is appropriate
for the sites. This land use designation is typically located along arterials
due to the potential amount of traffic generated.
Zoning districts compatible with the Community Commercial designation
are Commercial-Office-Professional (C-O-P), Neighborhood Commercial
(CN) and Community Commercial (CC).
Regional Commercial
The Regional Commercial designation is intended to apply to large retail
shopping areas that serve a regional market area. The intended uses within
this designation include major department stores, specialty retail outlets,
restaurants, offices, automobile dealerships, hotel and other complemen-
tary uses. Auto sales are allowed within specific zoning designations.
Developments in this designation generate a high volume of traffic because
of the regional draw and therefore, Regional Commercial designated areas
are located near to freeways and away from residential uses. Floor area
ratios (FAR) up to 2.5 are allowed. Buildings can be a mix of one- to four-
story structures with parking structures to accommodate the needs of the
businesses.
Zoning districts compatible with the Regional Commercial designation
include        Commercial-Office-Professional     (C-O-P),    Neighborhood
Commercial (NC), Community Commercial (CC), Regional Commercial
(RC), ADP-2 and ADP-5.
Industrial/Commercial
The Industrial/Commercial designation is intended to provide for a variety of
industrial and compatible office and support commercial uses. Uses
include manufacturing, processing, research, science, engineering,
wholesale trade and institutional services. Development in the designation
is intended to:
     o Provide a high-quality, safe and healthy working environment for the
         employees,
     o Retain a high-quality, campus like feel throughout, and
     o Minimize conflict between the industrial uses in the designation and
         adjacent land uses, especially residential, parks, open space and
         institutional designations.

                 Development within this designation should be contained on large, multiple
                 parcel areas that should retain a similar look and feel between them. Floor
                 area ratios (FAR) for development are limited to a maximum of 1.1, though
                 increases are available for situations where there is a special need. A mix
                 of one- and two-story buildings is appropriate. Because of the truck traffic
                 generated by the uses, the Industrial/Commercial designation is located
                 along major arterials, and also have freeway and rail access. Street layouts
                 are designed to minimize truck traffic adjacent to and through residential
                 areas.
                 Zoning districts compatible with the Industrial/Commercial designation
                 include Industrial (M), Industrial/Commercial (MC), Industrial/Commercial-

                 Light Industrial
                 The Light Industrial designation is intended to provide for a variety of small-
                 and medium-sized industrial, compatible office and commercial support
                 uses that may be more intensive than those developed under the Industrial/
                 Commercial designation. Uses include manufacturing, processing,
                 research, science, engineering, wholesale trade and institutional services.
                 Development in this designation is intended to:
                      o Provide a high-quality, safe and healthy working environment for the
                          employees, and
                      o Minimize conflict between the industrial uses in the designation and
                          adjacent land uses, especially residential, parks and open space
                          and institutional designations.
                 Development with this designation should be contained on large parcels.
                 Floor area ratios (FAR) for development are limited to a maximum of 1.1.
                 Increases are available for situations where there is a special need. A mix
                 of one- and two-story buildings is appropriate. Because of the truck traffic
                 generated by the uses, the Light Industrial designation is located along
                 major arterials, and also has freeway and rail access. Street layouts are
                 designed to minimize truck traffic adjacent to and through residential areas.
                 Zoning districts compatible with the Light Industrial designation include
                 Industrial (M), Industrial/Commercial (MC), Industrial/Commercial-One (MC-

within the City that meets the passive and active recreational needs of the
citizens and that promotes and preserves the health and general welfare of
citizens. Parks and open space and the activities they offer help to sustain
the high-quality of life in the City. Park and open space areas provide
amenities in the community for individual and group activities. Uses
appropriate within this designation include traditional parks, community
gardening, agriculture and golf courses.
Both public and private land can be designated as parks and open space.
Public lands can include areas that are specifically identified for park use,
and utility, rail and flood rights-of-way.

high-quality of life, protect the safety of the citizens and serve as focal
points to join the entire City together. Civic and governmental uses are
intended for this designation, and typically include City offices and yards,
libraries, post offices and fire and police stations. Hospital and medical
centers may also be appropriate. Sites are located throughout the City.
Depending on the use for the site, buildings or other permanent structures
may or may not be present. The maximum building intensity for this
designation is a FAR of 1.1.

                 The Utility and Flood Control designation is intended to designate those
                 areas in the City that are developed for utility and flood control use. Power
                 line rights-of-way and flood control channels are included in this
                 designation. Because of these types of uses, other development is limited
                 though recreational, open space and storage uses are also appropriate with
                 the approval of the agency owning the property and the City.
                 The presence of permanent buildings on a site for purposes to serve the
                 utility or flood control facility is minimal. The maximum building intensity for
                 this designation is a FAR of 0.10.

                 5.0 PLANNING FACTORS, GOALS AND POLICIES
                 PRESERVE AND ENHANCE THE COMMUNITY CHARACTER
                 Planning Factor
                 Cerritos is distinctive. The quality of life and high-quality residential,
                 commercial, industrial and entertainment development make the City
                 unique. Preserving these attributes is important to the community. New
                 development and redevelopment should be well designed to preserve and
                 enhance these attributes.
                 Goal        LU-1       Preserve, promote and protect the existing high-
                                        quality physical development that characterizes the
                                        City and quality of life within the City of Cerritos.
                 Policies     LU-1.1    Encourage high-quality design and construction for
                                        development that is a positive addition to and
                                        compatible with the City’s existing ambiance.
                                        Development shall enhance the character and
                                        unique identity of existing commercial, industrial
                                        and/or residential uses. Development shall be
                                        defined to include landscaping, parking, lighting,
                                        business identification signs and buildings.
                             LU-1.2     Encourage developers to engage in early
                                        discussions with the City regarding the design,
                                        nature and scope of the project and possible
                                        impacts and mitigation requirements.                These
                                        discussions should occur as early as possible in the
                                        project planning stage, preferably preceding land
                                        acquisition.
                             LU-1.3     Promote high-quality, well designed, environmentally
                                        conscious and verdant landscaping in new and
                                        existing developments.
                             LU-1.4     Encourage private/public funding, development and
                                        operation of cultural amenities, activities and centers
                                        consistent with the character of Cerritos.
                             LU-1.5     Achieve compliance with City ordinances and
                                        regulations through education, incentive and other
                                        proactive measures, in addition to issuing citations,
                                        collecting fines or other punitive measures.

A BALANCE OF LAND USES
Planning Factor
The General Plan Land Use Map is intended to provide a balance of
residential, commercial, industrial, educational, recreational and civic
facilities that meet the needs of the citizens of Cerritos.
Goal          LU-2       Provide a balance of residential and non-residential
                         development throughout the City.
Policies      LU-2.1     Achieve a land use balance through the following
                         methods:
                         < Provision of incentives for desired commercial
                              and industrial uses;
                         < Coordination of land use and circulation patterns
                              to ensure proper circulation capacity and
                              infrastructure;
                         < Promotion of a variety of housing types and
                              affordability to meet the development goals of
                              the Housing Element; and
                         < Provision of needed housing opportunities to
                              support employment growth.
              LU-2.2     Coordinate redevelopment and planning activities
                         and resources to balance land uses, amenities and
                         civic facilities in order to sustain or improve the
                         quality of life.
              LU-2.3     Coordinate City strategies with Los Angeles County,
                         Gateway Cities Council of Governments and other
                         appropriate agencies and/or organizations to meet
                         housing and employment needs.
              LU-2.4     Attract and maintain land uses that generate revenue
                         for the City of Cerritos, while maintaining a balance
                         of other community needs such as housing, open
                         space and public facilities.
              LU-2.5     Evaluate land use intensities in conjunction with the
                         review of any zone change and/or General Plan
                         Amendment to permit density or modify intensity.
                         Factors to be considered include, but are not limited
                         to, the maximum intensity allowed for the applicable
                         land use designation in the General Plan, circulation

                                 patterns, environmental constraints and compatibility
                                 with surrounding land uses.
                 Goal     LU-3   Promote and assist the growth and vitality of existing
                                 commercial centers.
                 Policies LU-3.1 Monitor the conditions and status of older
                                 neighborhood commercial centers and underutilized
                                 commercially-zoned parcels.
                          LU-3.2 Provide rehabilitation assistance in targeted
                                 commercial districts to enable the upgrading of
                                 commercial properties.
                          LU-3.3 Encourage owners of neighborhood commercial
                                 centers to provide a mix of tenants consistent with
                                 the consumer demands of the community, which can
                                 be determined by:
                                 < Resident surveys to determine consumer needs;
                                     and
                                 < Marketing studies to determine the appropriate
                                     tenant mix.
                          LU-3.4 Pursue categories of resident retail demand that are
                                 not being met within the City. To this end, initiate
                                 strategies to market, attract, and retain targeted
                                 types of retail commercial and restaurant uses.
                          LU-3.5 Permit drive-thru uses only in areas designated as
                                 regional commercial, and specifically to the area
                                 identified as the Regional Commercial District on
                                 Exhibit CD-2, which includes the Los Cerritos Center,
                                 Best Plaza, South Street Cerritos, and Babies “R” Us
                                 Center.
                          LU-3.6 Consider expanding Area Development Plan Five
                                 (ADP-5), Cerritos Auto Square, to include the area
                                 west of the I-605 Freeway, south of Artesia Boulevard
                                 and east of Crusader Avenue; the area northwest of
                                 the I-605 Freeway along either side of Studebaker
                                 Road and south of Artesia Boulevard; and, the area
                                 and/or parcels located at the northwest and
                                 northeast corners of Studebaker Road and South
                                 Street.
LAND USE ELEMENT                                                                  LU-44

COMPATIBLE LAND USES
Planning Factor
Incompatible land uses immediately adjacent to one another, such as
residential and industrial uses, may significantly hinder the health of a
community. Uses should be appropriately buffered or incompatibilities
should be addressed through redesignation of uses or mitigation of
impacts to adjacent uses in the area.
Goal         LU-4       Adjacent land uses shall be compatible with one
                        another.
Policies     LU-4.1     Require that commercial and industrial development
                        that abuts residential or educational uses be
                        adequately screened and buffered from the
                        residential neighborhood or educational facility.
             LU-4.2     Ensure that any land use that handles, generates
                        and/or transports hazardous substances, as defined
                        by state and federal regulations, will not negatively
                        impact existing sensitive receptors/land uses.
             LU-4.3     Coordinate with adjacent landowners, cities and
                        counties in developing compatible land uses for
                        areas adjacent to the City’s boundaries.
             LU-4.4     Coordinate with the Cerritos Community College
                        District, the ABC Unified School District, the
                        Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and
                        other public entities in the planning and development
                        of property located within the City of Cerritos to
                        ensure compliance with the goals and policies of the
                        General Plan.
EFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OR REDEVELOPMENT                          OF   VACANT,
UNDERUTILIZED OR SMALL PARCELS
Planning Factor
A number of small vacant parcels, mostly former service station sites, exist
in the City. Many of these former service station sites are located on corner
lots and are less than one-half acre in size. Redevelopment of these sites is
limited by both their size, potential contamination, clean-up and inflated
property values. In addition, former developed sites may be left with
LAND USE ELEMENT                                                              LU-45

                 abandoned buildings, which need to be rehabilitated or removed. It is
                 important that incompatible and non-conforming uses that detract from the
                 community be removed or relocated, and that new development
                 compatible with surrounding uses occur on these vacant, underutilized or
                 small parcels.
                 Goal       LU-5       Rehabilitate and/or remove abandoned buildings/
                                       facilities.
                 Policies   LU-5.1     Require property owners to remove abandoned
                                       and/or boarded up buildings and related site
                                       improvements.
                            LU-5.2     Maintain the City’s current level of code enforcement.
                            LU-5.3     Enforce Title 6, Health and Sanitation, of the City’s
                                       Municipal Code in order to maintain properties in
                                       transition and abandoned commercial and industrial
                                       buildings and properties.
                 Goal       LU-6       Remove incompatible and non-conforming uses that
                                       detract from the aesthetics and safety of the
                                       community.
                 Policy     LU-6.1     Encourage compatible land uses to locate in
                                       appropriate areas of the City.
                 Goal       LU-7       Promote infill development on vacant or underutilized
                                       parcels.
                            LU-7.1     Ensure that infill projects contribute to the further
                                       development of the surrounding neighborhood (e.g.,
                                       improve circulation, contribute to or provide
                                       neighborhood unity, eliminate a blighted area and
                                       enhance the existing quality of life).
                            LU-7.2     Design infill projects in context with adjacent
                                       neighborhood and surrounding uses. The design
                                       should consider the existing scale and character of
                                       surrounding structures, and should blend rather than
                                       compete with the established character of the area.
                            LU-7.3     Encourage the development of permanent infill
                                       commercial, office and/or residential uses on vacant
                                       or underutilized sites less than ½-acre in size that
                                       abut residential land uses on two sides. Landscape
LAND USE ELEMENT                                                                        LU-46

                      demonstration gardens, public art or other
                      community oriented programs may also be
                      considered for said sites on a temporary basis.
             LU-7.4   Encourage the development of permanent infill
                      commercial and/or office uses on vacant or
                      underutilized sites greater than ½-acre in size, that
                      are part of a larger commercial center, and zoned
                      CN (Neighborhood Commercial) or CC (Community
                      Commercial). If the subject site is an existing
                      commercial center that is in a state of decline, the
                      City should consider the redevelopment or rezoning
                      of the commercial center to a more appropriate use.
Goal         LU-8     Implement the Redevelopment Plan to enhance the
                      Redevelopment Project Areas.
             LU-8.1   Direct Redevelopment Agency investments to those
                      economic activities and locations with the greatest
                      potential economic return.
             LU-8.2   Use redevelopment financing in conjunction with
                      code enforcement activities to assist in the
                      rehabilitation of non-residential and residential
                      developments.
             LU-8.3   Prioritize and coordinate redevelopment area public
                      improvements with those in the City’s Capital
                      Improvement Program.
             LU-8.4   Provide rehabilitation assistance in targeted
                      commercial districts to enable the upgrading of
                      commercial properties.
PRESERVE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS
Planning Factor
Residential neighborhoods in Cerritos are attractive and well maintained.
Planning for neighborhood preservation and protection is one of the most
important purposes of the City’s General Plan. Maintaining neighborhood
quality requires: conservation of existing housing, good street design,
minimizing and controlling traffic in residential neighborhoods and
development review that adheres to quality design. Factors such as the
LAND USE ELEMENT                                                            LU-47

                 introduction of new or excessive traffic, existing substandard infrastructure
                 or economic pressures may cause disruption of neighborhoods.
                 Goal       LU-9        Maintain the existing character of residential
                                        neighborhoods by controlling development.
                 Policies   LU-9.1      Protect residential areas from the effects of
                                        potentially incompatible uses.             Where new
                                        commercial or industrial development is allowed
                                        adjacent to residentially zoned districts, maintain
                                        standards for circulation, noise, setbacks, buffer
                                        areas, landscaping and architecture, which ensure
                                        compatibility between the uses.
                            LU-9.2      Allow non-residential activity in residential areas only
                                        when the character and the quality of the
                                        neighborhood can be maintained.
                            LU-9.3      Prohibit uses that lead to deterioration of residential
                                        neighborhoods, or adversely impact the safety or the
                                        residential character of a residential neighborhood.
                            LU-9.4      Assure that the type and intensity of land use shall
                                        be consistent with that of the immediate
                                        neighborhood.
                            LU-9.5      Develop and implement appropriate traffic controls
                                        to protect residential neighborhoods from the
                                        impacts of through traffic, such as safety hazards,
                                        speeding, noise and other disturbances.
                            LU-9.6      Allow development only with adequate physical
                                        infrastructure (e.g., transportation, sewers, utilities,
                                        etc.) and social services (e.g., education, public
                                        safety, etc.).
                            LU-9.7      Allow redevelopment of underutilized school sites
                                        commensurate with the surrounding residential
                                        neighborhood and availability of services.
                 Goal        LU-10      Preserve the positive qualities of Cerritos’ residential
                                        areas and extend these qualities into new housing
                                        areas.
LAND USE ELEMENT                                                                           LU-48

Policies     LU-10.1    Encourage “area development plans” which
                        incorporate a more comprehensive and creative
                        approach to residential design.
             LU-10.2    Encourage the construction of new housing at the
                        maximum density permitted by the General Plan,
                        particularly on sites designated for medium density
                        housing.
MAINTAIN THE VARIETY AND INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY OF RESIDENTIAL
NEIGHBORHOODS
Planning Factor
One of Cerritos’ most outstanding assets is the visual diversity of its
individual neighborhoods.          Development represents a variety of
architectural styles from various eras, embodying a variety of sizes, design
features, and building materials resulting in neighborhoods with their own
unique identity. Unique districts or neighborhoods can be the product of an
underlying theme or character (e.g., architectural, cultural or historical) or
can be created by physical barriers (e.g., freeways or major streets).
Goal         LU-11      Preserve and enhance existing community and
                        neighborhood character and sense of place.
Policies     LU-11.1    Encourage a variety of housing types and sizes that
                        are balanced throughout the City and also
                        compatible with the character of the surrounding
                        neighborhood.
             LU-11.2    Ensure that new development is a positive addition
                        to the City’s environment and does not detract from
                        the nature and character of appropriate nearby
                        established development.
             LU-11.3    Maintain the character and identity of existing
                        neighborhoods. Ensure that proposals for new
                        construction, remodels and additions that are larger
                        than those of the neighborhood, be designed to be
                        compatible with and blend in with the existing
                        neighborhood, and minimize impacts on adjacent
                        parcels.
LAND USE ELEMENT                                                               LU-49

                             LU-11.4     Maintain the City’s capacity to meet its housing
                                         needs as identified in the Housing Element.
                 RESIDENTIAL DENSITY VERSUS BUILDING INTENSITY
                 Planning Factor
                 As land prices have increased, lot sizes have become smaller while house
                 sizes have become larger. This intensity of land use gives the impression
                 of a higher density than actually exists. This perception creates both a
                 design and construction challenge for residential infill developments of all
                 densities permitted in the General Plan.
                 Goal        LU-12       Limit the intensity of new development to a level
                                         consistent with surrounding development and the City
                                         at large.
                 Policy      LU-12.1     Balance size and number of units to achieve
                                         appropriate (limit) intensity.
                 Goal        LU-13       Reduce the visual impact of new construction and/or
                                         remodeling on the City and its neighborhoods.
                 Policies    LU-13.1     Review all development applications in light of the
                                         overall mass and scale of the intensity.
                             LU-13.2     Increase building setbacks as mass and height
                                         increase.
                 Goal        LU-14       Preserve the quality of the personal open space on
                                         residentially zoned parcels.
                 Policy      LU-14.1     Maximize quality usable open space in all new
                                         developments.
                 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE AND APPEARANCE
                 Planning Factor
                 Property maintenance is important in Cerritos. In both residential and non-
                 residential areas, continue the focus on property improvement and
                 enhanced property maintenance.
LAND USE ELEMENT                                                                        LU-50

Goal         LU-15   Strive to eliminate all signs of property deterioration
                     in Cerritos.
Policies     LU-15.1 Continue to implement an active Code Enforcement
                     Program.
             LU-15.2 Develop incentive programs for the improved
                     appearance of residential, commercial and industrial
                     areas.
             LU-15.3 Continue to promote and expand programs such as
                     the City Wide Pride Beautification Program, which
                     recognizes excellence in property upkeep.
             LU-15.4 Continue to support the City’s Property Preservation
                     Commission in maintaining the high development
                     standards of private property within the community.
             LU-15.5 Continue to maintain graffiti suppression and
                     removal programs.
Goal         LU-16   Enhance those freeway corridors that act as gateways
                     into the City of Cerritos.
Policies     LU-16.1 Work with Caltrans to provide and maintain an
                     attractive freeway environment in Cerritos, including
                     access ramps and freeway interchanges.
             LU-16.2 Require commercial and industrial development
                     adjacent to, and visible from, the freeways and their
                     ramps, to incorporate enhanced landscape and
                     architectural treatment to the building, which shall
                     include screening of roof top equipment.
Related Goals and Policies:  Refer to Goal CD-1 and Policies CD-1.2 and

CHAPTER 3
COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
1.0      INTRODUCTION
Community identity is the visual image of the community that is held in the
minds of residents and visitors. Cerritos’ identity includes the many visual
images that people associate with the community, including the City’s
physical form, activity nodes, landmarks, street corridors, buildings, signs,
and other similar physical features.
A City’s physical identity is clear if people can readily perceive the
community in images that differentiate it from surrounding communities.
When communities run together in undifferentiated masses they lack a
distinct identity. Cerritos has always aimed to differentiate itself as a unique
place. Through successful efforts such as the Cerritos Towne Center,
community public art program and citywide landscaped medians, the City
stands out as a unique community that is easily differentiated from its
surroundings.
To maintain and strengthen the harmony among the City’s urban design
components, Cerritos will continue to place major emphasis on design
solutions that contribute to the City’s high-quality image. The Community
Design Element contains goals, policies and design concepts aimed at
strengthening Cerritos’ physical identity and high-quality image.
2.0 AUTHORITY FOR THE ELEMENT
Authority for the Community Design Element is found in Section 65303 of
the State Government Code. That section allows cities and counties to add
optional elements beyond the State-mandated elements. This element
focuses on all areas within Cerritos’ City limits.
The Community Design Element establishes goals and policies to enhance
the livability of the City and encourage and protect investment in the City by
ensuring the highest level of quality in the design and re-design of the City’s
physical form. This commitment has and will continue to set Cerritos above
the majority of communities in Southern California. The Community Design
Element illustrates those design concepts that are applicable to the
COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT                                                         CD-1

                         enhancement of Cerritos’ physical identity. The majority of these design
                         concepts apply to generalized situations. Thus, in addition to setting goals
                         and policies, the Community Design Element can also be utilized as a
                         source book of possible solutions for design problems as the op portunity
                         for implementation arises.
                         This element aims to recognize the many positive design features of
                         Cerritos, preserve and enhance those features, improve the livability of the
                         community through physical design considerations in public areas that
                         need improvement, and encourage quality private development through
                         appropriate development policies. The result is a livable community
                         defined by quality, cohesiveness and human needs.
                         3.0 SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
                         3.1      COMMUNITY IMAGE
                         The perceived “im age” of a community is made up of a complex array of
                         physical elements and the relationships between them. The community’s
                         visual image is not static; it changes over time and from location to location
                         within the community. Unique districts and neighborhoods often have their
                         own images apart from the greater community image.
                         Ideally, a City’s visual image matches the values and aspirations of its
                         citizens. Through the implementation of these values and goals, physical
                         development takes place resulting in an image that residents can identify
                         with and visitors can understand.
                         Cerritos is a built out community. The major physical features that define it
                         as a place (e.g., boundaries, circulation routes, San Gabriel River, etc.)
                         have existed for a long time. Yet, while these major features are in place,
                         there is an ongoing process of refining and improving elements of the built
                         environment in a positive way that continues to reinforce Cerritos’ image as
                         a progressive community and a quality place to live.
                         To help understand existing conditions in Cerritos, it is necessary to first
                         understand the components of the City’s urban design framework. The
                         following is a discussion of the elements that contribute to the City of
                         Cerritos’ urban form and character.
                         3.1.1    LANDMARKS
                         Landmarks are well-remembered places, structures, or natural features that
                         provide orientation and identity within a City. Cerritos contains a significant
                         number of objects and places that provide visual and functional points of
                         reference (refer to Exhibit CD-1, Landmarks). Among these are:

     o   Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts

     o   Los Cerritos Center
     o   Cerritos Auto Square
     o   Fountain at Cerritos Towne Center and the SR-91 Freeway (Gore
         Project)
     o Cerritos Senior Center at Pat Nixon Park
3.1.2    GATEWAYS
Gateways are significant points of entry into a community – the community’s
doorstep. They help shape the identity and provide a clear sense of a
community’s boundaries. Because they often provide the first impression of
a community, gateways represent an important opportunity to convey a
positive and lasting image. Currently, Cerritos has 16 existing entry
monument signs at gateways throughout the City. Other community entry
identifiers include street signs with the City name and seal included on the
face. Major gateways in Cerritos are shown in Exhibit CD-2, Districts,
Paths, Edges, and Gateways.
3.1.3    FREEWAY CORRIDORS AND INTERCHANGES
Freeway interchanges are highly visible areas along transportation
corridors, which require special attention. Interchanges can be perceived
as gateways to the community and should offer a “sense of arrival” to
freeway users. The City of Cerritos has several interchanges along the I-605
and SR-91 freeway corridors that offer good opportunities for enhancement.
Views from the freeways contribute a great deal to the City’s image. Special
controls on freeway frontage property (particularly commercial and
industrial) have been instituted to require outdoor storage and maintenance
areas to be screened from view. Roofscape areas are also a major feature,
particularly from elevated sections of the freeways, and aesthetic treatment
of ventilators and other mechanical equipment on rooftops are required.
Signing controls should also be rigorously enforced.
3.1.4    PUBLIC SPACES
Public places are special areas where people can share a sense of
belonging with the City. They are essential to the social cohesion of a
community and provide a context where people of all ages can participate
together. In Cerritos, outdoor public places are found in City parks, plazas
and courtyards around public buildings and pedestrian enclaves. These

3.1.5     PUBLIC ART
Public art can capture the aspirations of the community and express the
City’s cultural and social heritage in a widely understood universal
language. Because of this, artworks can contribute significantly to the
public identity of a place. Public art can stimulate creativity and imagination
while adding a unique human dimension to the outdoor environment.
The City of Cerritos has installed figurative and abstract public art
sculptures at the Civic Center, Cerritos Library, the Cerritos Senior Center at
Pat Nixon Park, Heritage Park, Pioneer Villas, Emerald Villas, Avalon at
Cerritos, and the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. Cerritos
developers with projects valued at more than $350,000 are also required to
devote one-half of one percent of the building permit valuation to the City's
Art in Public Places Program. In addition, a number of art pieces were
installed on private properties as required by the City. In 2000, the City
Council formally recognized the importance of public art in the community
and adopted the Arts In Public Places Program, Section 22.94 of the
Cerritos Municipal Code, which requires developers of privately-owned
projects with a building permit valuation of more than $350,000 to
contribute one-half of one percent of the value to the Art in Public Places
Trust Fund, or install artwork, as approved by the City, of an equal value.
To allow the general public to participate in and express their support for
public art, individuals may also contribute to the program.
The City has also provided a municipal art collection that is located within
the Cerritos Public Library and the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts.
The collection is composed of pieces of various medium and styles to
further enhance the art experience for our residents and visitors to these
facilities. The public art collection not only adds beauty and distinction to
the community environment, it also contributes to the economic growth and
promotes educational opportunities for the community. The location of
existing art pieces is shown in Exhibit CD-3, Public Art.

A path can be defined as those corridors (streets, sidewalks, etc.) along
which people move to get from one place to another. A “path” provides the
means of vehicular and pedestrian movement within the community. There
are two types of paths: “Primary corridors” are the principal corridors
carrying larger volumes of traffic and typically crossing through community
boundaries, and “Secondary corridors” carrying less traffic and often
originating or terminating within the City’s boundaries. The key paths within
the City of Cerritos are classified accordingly below.

                         Civic Center District. The Civic Center District is generally defined as the
                         portion of Bloomfield Avenue between Artesia Boulevard and South Street.
                         Within this district is the Cerritos City Hall, the Cerritos Sheriff Station, the
                         Cerritos Library, Cerritos High School, Heritage Park, the Cerritos Towne
                         Center, Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts and site for a potential
                         Museum. Functionally this district serves all civic purposes for the
                         community, and also includes cultural, commercial, recreational and
                         educational services. The District also serves as a hub for Cerritos on
                         Wheels (COW), the local City transportation system.
                         Auto Square District. This district primarily encompasses the Cerritos Auto
                         Square, which is located on the western edge of the City. Bounded by
                         Interstate 605, South Street, 183rd Street and the San Gabriel River Channel,
                         the Auto Square is at the crossroads of several predominant paths of
                         Cerritos. The Auto Square draws consumers from throughout the Southern
                         California region. The district also encompasses land north of the existing
                         Auto Square, between 183rd Street and Artesia Boulevard. This area is
                         included in this district to acknowledge the potential for future expansion of
                         the Auto Square.

                         variety of regional-serving commercial uses generally located east of I-605
                         and bordering three major streets in the City: South Street, 183rd Street and
                         Gridley Road. The commercial centers within this district include Los
                         Cerritos Center, Best Plaza, South Street Cerritos, Cerritos South and
                         Babies “R” Us Center.
                         Industrial Park District. This district encompasses ADP-1 Industrial Park, which
                         is located in the northern part of the City, bounded on the north by Alondra
                         Boulevard, on the south by 166th Street, on the west by Bloomfield Avenue,
                         and on the east by Carmenita Road. The industrial park offers sites for
                         office and light industrial uses in a well designed high-quality environment.
                         3.1.8     EDGES AND BARRIERS
                         Edges are linear elements that serve as a visual or physical boundary,
                         barrier or transition between districts defining the boundaries of a place.
                         Elements such as freeways, railroad tracks, flood control channels and
                         natural features may be considered as edges. The prominent edges within
                         the City of Cerritos are:
                              o Coyote Creek Channel
                              o San Gabriel River Channel
                              o SR-91 and I-605 Freeway Corridors
COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT                                                                              CD-12

3.2     STREETSCAPE − THE PUBLIC REALM
The City’s “streetscape” – the view from the road – is a powerful and
immediate indicator of the community’s image. The view from the road
consists of many elements, including trees, landscaping in parkways and
medians, street furniture (benches, trash receptacles, etc.) lighting, walls
and utilities. Also included is private development in the form of buildings,
landscaping and signs. The elements of “private” development are
discussed in Section 3.3.
This section looks at the City’s streetscape image from the public realm –
what people see from the street and sidewalk that is located in the public
right-of-way. For many people who pass through Cerritos, but are not
residents, the view from the road is often their only impression of the City.
For residents, the quality of the street environment has a more direct impact
on their daily lives. Roads are a valuable open space asset and should be
treated as such. They affect the daily lives of residents running shopping
errands, children walking to school, recreational walkers and joggers and
residents driving to work. People are touched daily by the quality, or lack
thereof, that the streetscape presents.
The public realm of the street environment can also be viewed as an
extension of private yards. Whether in residential neighborhoods or in
commercial districts, the visual connection between the private realm and
the public realm can be enhanced through effective streetscape treatments.
Additionally, the quality of the street environment affects property values
throughout the City.
All physical features within the public right-of-way are controlled by the City,
including their design, installation and maintenance. This is an important
responsibility considering how the quality of the street environment affects
the City’s image. Cerritos has made a concerted effort to create and
maintain a park-like environment in the City, particularly along major
thoroughfares, with generously landscaped parkways and medians within
the public right-of-way. Great care should be exercised in the evaluation of
streetscape elements in terms of their aesthetic appeal and contribution to
a positive community image.
The following provides a description of the various elements that make up
the public street environment. Elements that establish the private street
environment (e.g., buildings, signs, etc.) are discussed in the next section.
3.2.1   STREET TREES
Tree-lined streets are a very humanizing element in the otherwise hard edge
of the urban street environment. Cerritos prides itself in its excellent street
COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT                                                         CD-13

                         tree planting and maintenance program, and has been named a Tree City
                         USA by the National Arbor Day Foundation.
                         Street trees help unify and identify an area. Trees enhance the public
                         environment by creating comfortable outdoor spaces, serene settings and
                         pleasant fragrances. Trees have a soothing visual impact. They provide a
                         habitat for wildlife, shade for pedestrians and motorists, contribute to
                         fresher air and reduce reflected heat from buildings and pavement.
                         The purpose of the street tree program is to beautify the City’s roadways by
                         planting and maintaining trees along major public rights-of-way. Trees are
                         selected by the City from a list of approved varieties rather than private
                         property owners to ensure continuity in the streetscape and that the trees
                         selected are appropriate to the surrounding area and climate.
                         The visual characteristics of street trees are important in their selection.
                         Trees can be effective in strengthening the City’s form by emphasizing
                         major roadways and important districts, and by identifying neighborhoods
                         and gateways. Street trees should be chosen based on the scale and
                         importance of the roadway. Generally, larger trees are used for major
                         roadways and smaller, pedestrian scale trees are used within
                         neighborhoods. Trees are also chosen for their water conserving and
                         maintenance qualities.
                         In neighborhoods, broad spreading, deciduous trees are preferable. These
                         trees create an attractive canopy and provide shade in the summer while
                         admitting sun in the winter. In commercial districts, it is important that street
                         trees be both deciduous and evergreen, and provide a canopy that does
                         not obscure business signage. Industrial districts are the most flexible in
                         terms of compatible varieties.
                         3.2.2    MEDIANS
                         Landscaped medians serve many different functions. Medians help
                         distinguish the City’s most significant circulation routes and gateways and
                         contribute to the City’s image. Overall, medians can make streets more
                         attractive and motorists more comfortable by reducing the perceived road
                         width. Medians increase safety by separating oncoming cars.
                         Presently, there are 13 arterial streets, or portions of streets that incorporate
                         median landscaping. The arterials with landscaped medians include: 1)
                         Studebaker Road from Del Amo Boulevard to Alondra Boulevard, 2) Gridley
                         Road from South Street to 183 rd Street, 3) Pioneer Boulevard from Del Amo
                         Boulevard to north of 195 th Street (northerly city limit), 4) Norwalk Boulevard
                         from Del Amo Boulevard to north of 195th Street (railroad crossing), 5)
                         Bloomfield Avenue from Del Amo Boulevard to Alondra Boulevard, 6)
                         Carmenita Road from South Street to Alondra Boulevard, 7) Valley View
COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT                                                                              CD-14

Avenue from the southerly to northerly City limits, 8) 166th Street from
Norwalk Boulevard to Carmenita Road, 9) Artesia Boulevard from Palo
Verde Avenue to Valley View Avenue, 10) 183rd Street from Palo Verde
Avenue to Marquadt Avenue, 11) South Street from the westerly to easterly
City limits, 12) 195th Street from Studebaker Road to Pioneer Boulevard, and
13) Del Amo Boulevard from Studebaker Road to Bloomfield Avenue.
Collectively, these landscaped arterial medians, along with other
landscaped roadway medians, encompass approximately 969,615 square
feet of landscaping. The City’s Capital Improvement Program identifies the
location of median improvements that require City maintenance and
funding.
3.2.3 PEDESTRIAN PATHWAYS
It is important to keep in mind that not everyone gets to their destination by
automobile. Sidewalks and other pedestrian pathways are important for
providing connections to schools, parks, shopping, jobs and between
neighborhoods. Additionally, all developments intended for use by the
general public should provide direct public access to the adjacent public
sidewalk.
Since Cerritos is a relatively new City, it has been developed to
contemporary standards of street cross section design with sidewalks
primarily adjacent to the curb in residential areas and with a planting strip
and curvilinear sidewalk along major non-residential thoroughfares.
Handicapped ramps have been provided throughout the City in compliance
with requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
3.2.4 STREET FURNITURE
Street “furniture” consists of the hardware items typically found along
sidewalks for the convenience of the pedestrian and transit user. Items of
street furniture include benches, trash receptacles, drinking fountains, bus
shelters, shade structures, newspaper racks, information kiosks and similar
items aimed at creating a friendly, functional and aesthetically pleasing
environment for pedestrians. The selection and appropriate placement of
street furniture plays an important role in establishing a quality street
environment.
Currently, the City maintains a coordinated palette of street furniture at
Cerritos Towne Center and Cerritos Auto Square. As the City continues to
improve the pedestrian friendliness of its streets and public open spaces, a
comprehensive and uniform palette of street furniture should also be
developed for the entire City.
While not currently provided by the City, newspaper racks are usually
placed within the public right-of-way and become a significant part of the
COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT                                                       CD-15

                         street environment, especially when a variety of dissimilar racks are placed
                         in an uncoordinated manner. This not only creates a negative visual
                         impact, but can also be a safety hazard if they interfere with pedestrian
                         movement. The City should consider adopting a standard newspaper rack
                         design.
                         3.2.5 UTILITIES
                         Other forms of street hardware include utility cabinets, transformers, cable
                         television boxes, standpipes, utility poles and overhead lines. When
                         considered all together, these utilitarian items comprise a significant
                         number of physical elements within the street environment. However, unlike
                         street furniture that is provided for the convenience of the pedestrian, utility
                         hardware often creates clutter, interferes with pedestrian movement and has
                         a negative visual impact on the street environment.
                         While the necessity of utility hardware is recognized for safety reasons and
                         for the provision of utility services, it should also be recognized that the City
                         has some control over the location of these items within or adjacent to the
                         public right-of-way. The City should play a proactive role in reviewing and
                         evaluating the appropriate locations for utility hardware items.
                         3.2.6 PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL WALLS
                         Private perimeter walls of neighborhoods often adjoin the public right-of-
                         way and affect the view from the road. Major thoroughfares are often
                         bordered by a continuous wall of rear yard fencing. In residential areas,
                         fencing provides privacy, blocks the view of traffic and can provide some
                         noise reduction. It is the responsibility of private property owners to
                         maintain the walls, although the City has implemented a graffiti removal
                         program.
                         In single-family neighborhoods, wall materials, design and maintenance can
                         vary with each tract or development. When maintenance of these walls is
                         neglected or the materials are incompatible with adjacent walls, this
                         detracts from the street environment. As these walls continue to age, the
                         City should evaluate programs to ensure that replacement wall designs and
                         materials are consistent along individual street frontages.
                         Residential perim eter walls along the public streets can also create a
                         monotonous flat surface devoid of landscaping or interesting features
                         identifying the neighborhood. Additional landscaping, tree pockets, street
                         furniture and unique entryways identifying each neighborhood would reduce
                         the monotony of long flat walls and would help discourage graffiti.
COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT                                                                             CD-16
3.3      PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT
Private development is as important as public improvements in creating a
vital, enjoyable and comfortable environment for residents and visitors.
Cerritos has long recognized that the design of private development has a
strong impact on residents and the City’s image. As a result, the City has a
history of encouraging and maintaining a high level of design quality for all
types of development.
Cerritos’ zoning regulations and standards coupled with the development
review process have had a positive effect in ensuring that new development
is attractive and compatible with conditions on surrounding properties.
Area development plans have been used as a means of encouraging
quality development by allowing flexibility in the strict application of zoning
regulations.
To have a positive impact on the City’s image, projects should function well
on the site, be compatible with surrounding properties and have
architectural merit. Generally, there are two parts to development that
determine how successfully a project meets these criteria: the site design
and the building design. With good design, these two elements are fully
integrated and complimentary to each other and at the same time are
compatible with surrounding environments.
3.3.1    BUILDING DESIGN
Architectural forms are dominant visual elements in the urban environment,
and as such, play a major role in establishing the image and identity of the
City. Retaining a level of high aesthetic architectural quality and cohesion is
essential to creating a well-designed, visually superior environment.
Cerritos is a built out City. For the most part, new projects will be what can
be termed “infill.” That is, they “fill in” between other existing structures.
For that reason, it is important that buildings be designed in a manner
appropriate to their “context” – taking into account their surroundings and
not trying to vie for exclusive attention by trying to stand out to the detriment
of other buildings. Buildings that are intentionally designed to draw
exclusive attention are appropriate only in a very limited number of
circumstances, such as gateways or major activity nodes, and for a limited
number of uses, such as the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts.
In addition to being in context with their surroundings, buildings should
possess a high degree of design “quality.” The quality quotient can be
expressed in a number of ways, including the use of appropriate materials
and colors, building walls that include variations in the depth of the building
plane which breaks up monotonous flat walls with patterns of light and
shadow, and variations in roof height and pitch to create interesting forms.
COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT                                                          CD-17

                         Buildings that are well designed to create interesting forms and that are in
                         context with their surroundings will strengthen Cerritos’ image as a very
                         livable community.
                         3.3.2 SITE PLANNING
                         A site is generally defined by the boundaries of ownership. Site planning or
                         design is how buildings, parking, pedestrian and automobile circulation,
                         landscaping and open space are arranged on the ground. A good site
                         design organizes and integrates all of these elements. It creates a
                         functional and visually attractive environment. Site plans can be reviewed
                         based on how well the functional elements accommodate the intended use
                         and how well the design is refined to create an attractive and compatible
                         environment.
                         All site designs start with functional elements determined by the intended
                         use. The functional elements of a site plan are the building location,
                         driveways, parking, auxiliary structures, exterior mechanical equipment,
                         lighting and service access. The design of these functional elements is
                         often determined by practical constraints resulting from the nature of the
                         use. For example, uses that generate a high degree of pedestrian traffic
                         should incorporate design elements that accommodate pedestrian
                         circulation in a convenient and safe manner and provide amenities that
                         cater to pedestrian comfort.
                         Functional elements need to be refined to create an environment that is
                         engaging and attractive. In order for a site design to be experienced
                         positively, it must have an appropriate relationship with the surrounding
                         environment and produce an attractive internal environment.
                         A site plan that is well integrated with the external environment will be
                         experienced positively if: (1) the natural features of the site are enhanced,
                         (2) the design is sympathetic with the surrounding features of the built
                         environment, (3) there is a smooth transition from the public roadway to
                         private properties and between properties and (4) the building setbacks
                         and lot coverage are consistent with the surrounding area.
                         3.4      SIGNS
                         Commercial signage is a highly visible part of the City’s environment. Signs
                         affect the visual quality of the roadways and the impression visitors have
                         when passing through. Because signs are intended to communicate
                         visually, they have the potential to conflict with achievement of goals for
                         achieving visual and aesthetic quality in the environment.
                         Cerritos has adopted effective sign regulations to ensure that signs are
                         attractive, easy to read, compatible with the district in which they are
COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT                                                                          CD-18

located and not distracting to motorists. The premise of the Sign Ordinance
is that signs should identify businesses, not advertise them. This principle
is one reason why pole signs and billboards are not allowed in Cerritos.
Active enforcement of the Sign Ordinance is the key to keeping visual blight
under control, especially regarding temporary signage that is inexpensive
and easily placed in windows or on sides of buildings.
Establishing neighborhood identity is another purpose signage serves. The
City effectively uses low-profile monument signs at neighborhood entryways
to serve as both a gateway and landmark for local residents. The
community should continue this effort and add new signs where needed.
And last, as the City continues to mature and older commercial centers are
redeveloped, the establishment of comprehensive sign programs for the
center will be important. The intent of the sign programs should be to
promote creative design, but also to develop a uniform design theme for
the particular center.
3.5      VACANT PARCELS
Throughout the community there are a number of small vacant parcels,
mostly former service station sites, located on corner lots. The vacant,
unused nature of these parcels has a negative effect on surrounding
properties and the community as a whole due to their unkempt nature,
including the accumulation of trash and the overgrowth of weeds.
On an interim basis, the negative effects of these vacant parcels could
partially be mitigated by restoring the subject site to its original condition
and through the provision of perimeter landscaping to screen the parcels.
The City should consider acquiring landscape easements over these
parcels for the purpose of providing decorative landscaping and berming to
achieve continuity of landscaping at the street’s edge and to partially screen
the parcels (refer to Exhibit CD-4, Conceptual Site Plan for Vacant Parcels).
Also, refer to the discussion on vacant and underutilized parcels in the Land
Use Element, Section 3.1.6.

In the maze of Southern California development it is important for Cerritos to
stand out as a discrete, individual, unique community.
Goal        CD-1         Strengthen and maintain Cerritos’ image as a unique
                         place by maintaining, enhancing and creating
                         physical features that distinguish Cerritos from
                         surrounding communities and distinguish it as a
                         livable community.
Policies    CD-1.1       Develop a comprehensive gateway improvement
                         program to select significant gateways along major
                         arterials for improvements including monument-type
                         “City of Cerritos” identification signs, special
                         enhanced landscaping and paving, public art and
                         unique private development standards.
            CD-1.2       Cooperate with Caltrans to improve freeway
                         landscaping, especially at the on- and off-ramps and
                         at the I-605/SR-91 interchange.
            CD-1.3       Work with Caltrans to implement and maintain a
                         unique City feature within the freeway right-of-way at
                         the I-605/SR-91 interchange.
            CD-1.4       Continue the Art in Public Places Program with an
                         emphasis on attaining a variety of artistic pieces
                         located in both exterior and interior spaces.
            CD-1.5       Develop a Master Plan for art work in public places.
                         The Master Plan should address art pieces (i.e.,
                         sculptures, paintings), but should expand the Art in
                         Public Places Program to allow for the creation of
                         landscape environments as usable and functional
                         art, and to establish appropriate settings for the
                         display of art, including within public rights-of-way
                         and landscape medians.

                                     CD-1.6      Support measures that will enhance the identity of
                                                 special districts and neighborhoods to create variety
                                                 and interest in the built environment.
                         STREETSCAPE
                         Planning Factor
                         The “view from the road” is a powerful indicator of the City’s image. While
                         Cerritos has done a good job of creating a positive image along its major
                         streets, opportunities still exist to improve the City’s street environment.
                         Goal        CD-2        Create an attractive street environment that will
                                                 complement private and public properties, create
                                                 beauty within the public right-of-way, and be
                                                 comfortable for residents and visitors.
                         Policies    CD-2.1      Continue to implement the City’s street tree program
                                                 through an established street tree palette.
                                     CD-2.2      Review the list of street trees to phase out trees that
                                                 do not adapt well to the requirements of an urban
                                                 environment and introduce new trees that are more
                                                 suitable.
                                     CD-2.3      Continue to provide planted medians to distinguish
                                                 major thoroughfares in the City. The City should
                                                 prepare a study to determine which streets could
                                                 accommodate landscape medians and then
                                                 implement the plan through the capital improvement
                                                 budget.
                                     CD-2.4      Create unique landscape designs and standards for
                                                 medians for each major thoroughfare to distinguish
                                                 each from the other and to provide a special identity
                                                 to adjacent districts and neighborhoods.
                                     CD-2.5      Promote pedestrian circulation throughout the
                                                 community through the provision of sidewalks and
                                                 other pedestrian paths that connect neighborhoods,
                                                 parks, schools, shopping, employment centers and
                                                 other major activity centers.

            CD-2.6       Provide sidewalks and landscaping with an average
                         50-foot right-of-way, whenever feasible adjacent to
                         non-residential development.
            CD-2.7       Create consistent entry/water features for select
                         intersections throughout the City (e.g., at the Cerritos
                         Auto Square and the Cerritos Civic Center
                         intersections).
            CD-2.8       Develop a coordinated street furniture palette
                         including waste containers and benches, to be
                         implemented throughout the community at
                         appropriate locations.
            CD-2.9       Provide a standard newspaper rack design for
                         newspaper racks located in the public right-of-way.
            CD-2.10      Provide a well-designed, comfortable bus stop at all
                         MTA, COW or other transportation stops in the City,
                         including waste containers and benches, etc.
            CD-2.11      Continue to require undergrounding of utilities on
                         private property.
            CD-2.12      Develop a priority-based program of                 utility
                         undergrounding along public rights-of-way.
            CD-2.13      Study the locational requirements of utility, traffic
                         control and other cabinets and hardware located in
                         the public right-of-way to determine alternative
                         locations for these items in less obtrusive areas of
                         the street environment.
            CD-2.14      Continue to require that public rights-of-way be
                         landscaped with softscape materials to allow for City
                         and/or service utility company access to utility lines.
            CD-2.15      Work with utility providing agencies to coordinate the
                         design of utility facilities (e.g., substations, pump
                         stations, switching buildings, etc.) to ensure that the
                         facilities fit within the context of their surroundings
                         and do not cause negative visual impacts.
            CD-2.16      Ensure the coordinated design of walls on residential
                         lots that back onto highways to achieve a uniform
                         appearance from the street. Walls should be uniform
                         in height, use of materials and color.

                                               soften the visual effect of the block wall.
                                     CD-2.18   Ensure that focal points in the public right-of way and

                         Planning Factor
                         Cerritos places a strong emphasis on high-quality design. Private
                         development is expected to be well designed, to contribute to the City’s
                         image in a positive manner and to be properly maintained to ensure lasting
                         quality.
                         Goal        CD-3      Ensure that buildings and related site improvements
                                               for private development are well designed and
                                               compatible with surrounding properties and districts.
                         Policies    CD-3.1    Continue to place a high priority on quality
                                               architecture, landscape, and site design to enhance

                         redeveloped.
SIGNS
Planning Factor
Sign structures and their graphic messages are highly visible elements
within the street environment. The quality of business signage has a great
influence on the perceived image of the City. The visual image of the City
can be further enhanced by promoting the use of sign programs for new or
redeveloping commercial centers.
Goal        CD-4         Ensure that commercial signs do not detract from the
                         City’s high-quality image, while recognizing the need
                         for effective business identification.

                                         that signs should identify businesses, not advertise
                                         them.
                                  CD-4.2 Vigorously enforce provisions of the Sign Ordinance
                                         to ensure that all businesses have an equal

                                         encourage the placement of new signs at the
                                         entrance of developments that do not have
                                         identification.
                                  CD-4.6 Allow for the provision of comprehensive sign
                                         programs for multi-tenant centers to allow flexibility in
                                         the application of sign regulations in order to
                                         encourage creativity and promote a unified
                                         appearance within commercial centers.                The
                                         development of sign programs is appropriate for new
                                         or redeveloping commercial centers.

                                         signs for redeveloping commercial centers through
                                         the development of planned sign programs to
                                         improve center identity and image by publicizing the
                                         benefits of such programs to developers and local

DESIGN FOR SAFE SPACES
Planning Factor
The physical design of a project can have a profound effect on the overall
safety of the project from the aspect of criminal activity. Projects should
demonstrate concern for users safety by being appropriately designed to
reduce opportunities for criminal activity.
Goal         CD-5        Create a safe place to live, work and play by
                         incorporating public safety considerations into
                         community design.
Policies     CD-5.1      Decrease the opportunity for criminal activity by
                         addressing high-risk circumstances (i.e., a dark
                         alley, an enclosed stairwell, dark entrances). Involve
                         the Police and Fire Department in reviewing and
                         making design recommendations during the project
                         review period.
             CD-5.2      Implement and refine development standards and/or
                         guidelines based on Crime Prevention Through
                         Environmental Design (CPTED) for new development
                         and redevelopment with emphasis on site and
                         building design to minimize vulnerability to criminal
                         activity.
             CD-5.3      Provide CPTED training to City staff to ensure
                         implementation of public safety strategies through
                         better community design.
WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Planning Factor
Wireless telecommunications facilities consist of towers, antennae, and
other associated equipment, which because of their necessary height and
utilitarian design, have the potential to negatively impact the aesthetic
quality of the community. The design of telecommunications projects
should demonstrate concern for aesthetic impacts by following siting and
design criteria that eliminates or significantly reduces potential impacts.
COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT                                                        CD-27
                         Goal     CD-6   Ensure that wireless telecommunication facilities are
                                         located and designed to protect the health, safety,
                                         community welfare, and aesthetic qualities of the
                                         community.
                         Policies CD-6.1 Continue to regulate the siting and design of wireless
                                         telecommunication facilities, accessory buildings,
                                         structures, and associated equipment to minimize
                                         their aesthetic impacts on the community.
                                  CD-6.2 Encourage the use of stealth designed wireless
                                         telecommunications facilities so that the facilities,
                                         including all supporting equipment are concealed or
                                         camouflaged so as to blend with surrounding land
                                         uses.
COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT                                                                  CD-28
CHAPTER 4
CIRCULATION ELEMENT
1.0      INTRODUCTION
The Circulation Element represents the City’s overall transportation plan.
The transportation plan consists not only of the physical transportation
system itself, such as streets, highways, bicycle routes and sidewalks, but
also to the various modes of transportation, such as cars, buses, trucks
(goods movement), rail, bicycles, ridesharing and walking, as well.
Circulation also refers to the movement of people and goods and products
within and through the City. The circulation and transportation system plays
an important role in shaping the overall structure and form of the City, in that
it both divides and connects land uses at the same time.
The relationship of the Circulation Element to the Land Use Element is
critical since the circulation system must adequately handle future traffic as
the City and surrounding areas continue to grow, and provide the means to
move people and goods through and within the City of Cerritos. Land use
and circulation must be closely tied to ensure that citizens are able to move
in and around the City to locations where they live, work, shop and spend
leisure hours. The circulation system is directly affected, and even shaped
by existing and future land use patterns.
The Circulation Element identifies and establishes the City's policies
governing the system of roadways, intersections, bicycle paths, pedestrian
ways and other components of the circulation system, which collectively
provide for the movement of people and goods throughout the City. The
Circulation Element establishes official city policy that:
     o Identifies the transportation facilities that will be required to serve
         both present and future vehicular and non-vehicular travel demand
         in the City;
     o Identifies classifications and design standards for circulation
         facilities; and
     o Identifies strategies to implement the City's circulation system.
CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                              CIR-1

                    The Circulation Element describes existing circulation conditions in the City,
                    and establishes standards for im plementation of future improvements in
                    conjunction with planned growth, and provides a method for measuring
                    system performance for future updates. The Element considers not only the
                    physical requirements of the transportation system (roadway facility type,
                    number of lanes, etc.), but also operational issues such as the provision of
                    transit services, and programs and policies that encourage use of
                    alternative transit modes.
                    2.0 AUTHORITY FOR THE ELEMENT
                    The State of California Government Code Section 65302 (b) requires that a
                    General Plan include:
                         “A circulation element consisting of the general location and extent of
                         existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes,
                         terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated
                         with the land use element of the plan.”
                    3.0 SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
                    3.1      RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PLANS
                    Congestion Management Program (CMP)
                    In June 1990, California voters approved Proposition 111, which established
                    a 9 percent per gallon gas tax, staged over a 5-year period, for the purpose
                    of funding transportation-related improvements statewide. In order to be
                    eligible for the revenues associated with Proposition 111, the CMP
                    legislation (originally AB 471, amended to AB 1791) requires urbanized
                    counties in California to adopt a Congestion Management Program. For the
                    County of Los Angeles, the authorized CMP agency is the Los Angeles
                    County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA).
                    The MTA adopted its first CMP in 1992, and in 2002, adopted its sixth plan
                    since the requirement was established in 1990. The goal of the CMP is to
                    promote a more coordinated approach to land use and transportation
                    decisions.
                    The CMP for Los Angeles County is comprised of a specific system of
                    arterial roadways plus all freeways. A total of 164 intersections are
                    identified for monitoring on the system in the County.
CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                                                 CIR-2

The goal of the CMP is to promote a more coordinated approach to land
use and transportation decisions. As part of the requirements for the CMP,
a traffic study may be required of certain developments. The Los Angeles
County CMP Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) Requirements state that a TIA will
be required for CMP purposes for all proposed developments requiring an
Environmental Impact Report (EIR), and analysis is required at all CMP
monitored intersections through which the project will generate 50 or more
peak hour trips. Based on the list of arterials monitoring stations listed in
the CMP, there are no arterial stations in the City.
The City of Cerritos will be required to show continued compliance with the
countywide Congestion Management Program (CMP). The CMP also
requires traffic studies to analyze all CMP freeway monitoring locations
where the proposed project adds 150 or more trips in either direction during
the AM or PM peak hours. In the City of Cerritos, the Artesia Freeway (SR-
91) and the San Gabriel River Freeway (I-605) are the only CMP facilities on
the CMP Highway System. Compliance with the CMP provisions include:
     o Continued land use coordination through the utilization of
         standardized traffic impact analysis methodologies,
     o Implementation and enforcement of Transportation Demand
         Management (TDM) strategies,
     o Maintenance of transit service standards,
     o Demonstrated transportation modeling consistency with the
         Countywide computer model,
     o Monitoring of CMP highway system levels of service,
     o Development of level of service deficiency plans where applicable,
     o Development of a five-year capital improvement program, and
     o Monitoring and conformance with all CMP provisions.
SCAG 1989 Air Quality Management Plan
The goal of Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) 1989
Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) is to set forth a 20-year action
program for meeting improved National Air Quality Standards in the South
Coast Air Basin by the year 2007. The South Coast Air Quality Management
District (SCAQMD) is the local air quality agency that establishes local air
quality goals. A focus on Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
throughout the 1980’s and early 1990’s was designed to reduce peak hour
traffic through carpooling, vanpooling, transit and parking incentives,
CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                           CIR-3

                    provision of at-work support services, and other programs. As a result of
                    this focus, most cities in Los Angeles County have adopted a Trip
                    Reduction or Emissions Reduction Ordinance. Section 10.34 of the City of
                    Cerritos Municipal Code references the City’s Mobile Source Air Pollution
                    Reduction Ordinance, in pursuit of the SCAG and the SCAQMD goals.
                    Regional Mobility Plan
                    The primary goal of the Regional Mobility Plan (RMP) is to improve
                    transportation mobility levels. The RMP is part of an overall regional
                    planning process and is linked directly to SCAG's Growth Management
                    Plan, the Housing Allocation Process and the South Coast Air Quality
                    Management District's Air Quality Management Plan. The RMP consists of
                    four separate elements:
                         o    Growth Management,
                         o    Transportation Demand Management,
                         o    Transportation System Management, and
                         o    Facilities Development.
                    The intent of the RMP is to give priority to all transit (bus and rail) and ride
                    sharing (HOV) projects over mixed-flow highway capacity expansion
                    projects. Transit and ridesharing facilities are exempt from conformity
                    review. Some other projects exempt from conformity assessment include:
                         o    Modification to ramps/interchanges,
                         o    Ramp metering projects,
                         o    Signals and/or intersection improvements, and
                         o    Primary and interstate system safety projects.
                    The active participation of local governments in transportation conformity is
                    important to ensure that there is consistency between local general plans
                    and the conformity criteria described in the regional Air Quality
                    Management Plan (AQMP).
                    Regional Coordination
                    As reflected in many of the Circulation Element components, regional
                    coordination is essential to the successful implementation of the Circulation
                    Plan. Several of the area roadways required to accommodate buildout
                    traffic flows extend beyond the City's jurisdiction. The solution to this and
                    other regional related traffic problems will require close coordination of
                    traffic issues with adjoining cities and other agencies, particularly the City of
                    Artesia, the County of Los Angeles, Caltrans District 7 and other
                    communities within the area.
CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                                             CIR-4

3.2      EXISTING CONDITIONS
Cerritos shares borders with the Cities of Norwalk and Santa Fe Springs on
the north, Bellflower and Lakewood on the west, La Mirada, Buena Park and
La Palma on the east and southeast and Lakewood on the south. In
addition, the City of Cerritos “wraps around” the City of Artesia, surrounding
it on three sides. Much of the City’s eastern border is also contiguous with
the boundary between the County of Los Angeles and Orange County.
Many of the arterial roadways through the City of Cerritos extend beyond
the city boundaries into neighboring cities. Circulation issues and travel
patterns, likewise, extend beyond the Cerritos City limits. The land use
decisions and traffic patterns in these other jurisdictions have the potential
to affect the quality of traffic flow and mobility in the City of Cerritos, and
conversely, traffic conditions and decisions made by the City of Cerritos can
affect its neighbors. Impacts to the City’s circulation system resulting from
land use decisions and circulation system improvements in adjacent
jurisdictions were considered during the preparation of the Circulation
Element.
3.2.1    REGIONAL ACCESS
The City of Cerritos is well served by area freeways. The Artesia Freeway
(SR-91) provides east-west regional circulation, cutting through the north
and central parts of the City. The San Gabriel River Freeway (I-605)
provides for north-south regional travel on the west side of the City. The
Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) provides for diagonal northwest to southeast travel,
with an interchange just north of the City of Cerritos.
Palo Verde Avenue (at the western boundary of the city), Studebaker Road,
Gridley Road, Pioneer Boulevard, Norwalk Boulevard, Bloomfield Avenue,
Shoemaker Avenue, Carmenita Road, Marquardt Avenue and Valley View
Avenue (at the eastern boundary of the City) are north-south arterials in the
City of Cerritos. Studebaker Road, Pioneer Boulevard, Norwalk Boulevard,
Bloomfield Avenue and Carmenita Road have full or partial interchanges
with SR-91.
East-west arterials that extend through and beyond the City limits are
Alondra Boulevard (at the northern boundary of the City), 166th Street,
Artesia Boulevard, 183rd Street, South Street, 195th Street and Del Amo
Boulevard (at the southern boundary of the City). Alondra Boulevard, South
Street and Del Amo Boulevard have interchanges with I-605. A westbound
entrance ramp to SR-91 is located on 183rd Street.                        South
Street/Orangethorpe Avenue has a full access interchange with SR-91
about one-half mile east of the city limits of Cerritos in neighboring La
Palma in Orange County.
CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                             CIR-5

                    3.2.2     LOCAL ACCESS
                    The City of Cerritos’ circulation needs are served by a traditional grid
                    system of north-south and east-west arterials, with approximately ½-mile
                    spacing, and signals at each arterial intersection. Smaller collector and
                    neighborhood streets connect neighborhoods and commercial land uses to
                    the arterial street system. Because the City of Artesia is surrounded on
                    three sides by the City of Cerritos and a small area of the southern portion
                    of the City of Norwalk is flanked by the City of Cerritos on both the east and
                    the west, a number of the arterials in the City of Cerritos extend through the
                    Cities of Artesia and Norwalk, both north-south and east-west.
                    The City of Cerritos has two primary areas where well-established
                    destination activity centers generate substantial traffic demands, both local
                    and regional. The first is the Los Cerritos Center and Cerritos Auto Square
                    area, on the west side of the City. Regional access to this area is provided
                    by the I-605 Freeway, South Street and Studebaker Road. The second is
                    the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts and Cerritos Towne Center area
                    in the heart of the City. Regional access to this area is provided by the SR-
                    91 Freeway, Bloomfield Avenue and Artesia Boulevard. Infrastructure
                    improvements have been made, as necessary, to accommodate peak
                    traffic flows in these areas.
                    3.2.3 ROADWAY FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
                    The City of Cerritos circulation system consists of a network of local
                    neighborhood streets providing access to the arterial street system, which
                    in turn provide access to the regional freeway system. This network serves
                    two distinct and equally important functions: (1) it provides access to
                    adjacent land uses, and (2) it facilitates the movement of persons and
                    goods to and from, within and through the City. The design and operation
                    of each street is determined by the importance placed on each of these
                    functions. Streets that have a mobility and/or regional access function will
                    have more lanes, higher speed limits and fewer driveways. Where access to
                    properties is required, streets will have fewer lanes, lower speeds, parking
                    and more frequent driveways to serve abutting properties.
                    To define the intended uses of roadways, many jurisdictions, including
                    Cerritos, use a functional classification system. The classification system
                    provides a logical framework for the design and operation of the roadway
                    system and helps residents and elected officials identify preferred
                    characteristics of each street. The City of Cerritos uses a functional
                    classification system that references and is consistent with “the standards
                    followed by the Los Angeles County Road Department,” (now part of the
                    Department of Public Works). The following street classifications have been
                    identified:

     o Major: 100 feet of right-of-way;
     o Secondary: 80 feet of right-of-way; and
     o Local Collector: 60 feet of right-of-way.
In Cerritos, the street system has been developed in a grid pattern, with
most streets running in a north-south or east-west orientation. Major
highways are spaced at one-mile intervals, with secondary highways at half-
mile intervals between them.
In general, the roadways designated as Major arterials cur rently provide two
or three through lanes in each direction, with a center divider, and bike
lanes, parking lanes, or right-turn auxiliary lanes. These roadways provide
access to the regional freeway system, and continue beyond the City
boundaries to provide regional access to surrounding cities.
Secondary arterials provide two through lanes in each direction, either
without a center divider and with bike or parking lanes, or with a center
divider and without bike or parking lanes, and functionally provide access
for several local roadways to an arterial roadway. Collector streets have
one through travel lane in each direction. With limited exceptions, the
Secondary Arterials and Collector Streets in the City of Cerritos generally do
not extend beyond the City limits, making them better suited for local, intra-
city travel.
Table CIR-1, 1988 General Plan Functional Roadway Classification, and
Exhibit CIR-1, Functional Roadway Classifications (1988 General Plan),
indicate the existing functional classification for the arterial roadways in the
City of Cerritos, the total number of lanes for each arterial, and whether a
center divider is provided.
3.2.4 PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SERVICES
The City of Cerritos is well served by public transit systems. The City
provides two local city transit services – Cerritos on Wheels (COW) and
Cerritos Dial-a-Ride. In addition, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority (LACMTA), the Orange County Transportation
Authority (OCTA), Long Beach Transit (LBT) and Norwalk Transit (NT) all
operate routes that extend into or through the City of Cerritos. The City’s
COW services, as well as the routes of the other operators, converge at Los
Cerritos Center, making it possible for passengers to transfer from one
route to another and from one transit operator to another. LACMTA buses
provide a connection to Metrolink service in Fullerton. LBT buses provide
connections to the Metro Green Line in Norwalk and the Metro Blue Line in
Long Beach. NT also provides a connection to the Metro Green Line in
Norwalk and to the Norwalk/Santa Fe Springs Metrolink Station.

3.2.5 BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES
Bicycle lanes and bicycle routes are provided on a number of roadways
within the City of Cerritos. The bike system provides bicyclists with
connections between neighborhoods, parks, schools and other
neighborhood and recreational facilities. Most City bikeways are Class II –
on-street bike lanes marked in the curb or parking lane on selected city
streets. In addition to the City’s on-street bike system, the regional bicycle
trails along the San Gabriel River and Coyote Creek Channels provide
regional bikeways for avid bicycle enthusiasts. The City does not currently
have a formal Bicycle Master Plan, or a program to implement new
bikeways (Class 1 bicycle facilities) or to designate additional bike lanes.

                    Sidewalks are provided on all arterial roadways and on most residential
                    streets. The City’s circulation system has been designed to ensure that
                    adequate facilities are provided for pedestrian circulation, especially in the
                    vicinity of schools, parks, major retail facilities and other locations with high
                    levels of pedestrian activity. The City of Cerritos does not currently have a
                    formal Pedestrian Master Plan.
                    3.2.6 TRUCK ROUTES
                    The City of Cerritos has designated selected roadways as truck routes to
                    provide for the regulated movement of trucks through the City. The
                    designation of truck routes is intended to route truck traffic to those streets
                    where they would cause the least amount of neighborhood intrusion and
                    where noise and other impacts would not be considered nuisances.
                    Roadways providing access to the freeways are the most likely candidates
                    for truck route designation. The designated truck routes in Cerritos are
                    illustrated in Exhibit CIR-3, Truck Routes. The designation of truck routes
                    does not prevent trucks from using other roads or streets to make deliveries
                    or for other reasons as defined in the Vehicle Code of the State of California.
                    3.3      ANALYSIS OF EXISTING OPERATING CONDITIONS
                    3.3.1    DAILY TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
                    Level of Service Definition for Roadways
                    Congestion is a result of a street network that carries traffic volumes in
                    excess of the network’s designed capacity. A roadway’s capacity is
                    primarily a function of the number of lanes provided to carry traffic volumes,
                    and whether or not the roadway is divided with a median or center turn lane.
                    The more lanes provided, the more capacity the roadway has to
                    accommodate traffic demand. Table CIR-2, Daily Roadway Capacity by
                    Roadway Type, is a summary of theoretical daily traffic-carrying capacity for
                    each of the roadway types.
                    The daily capacity of a roadway is dependent on a number of variables,
                    including the type of intersection controls, signal timing, the presence and
                    frequency of driveways, on-street parking, the percentage of the daily traffic
                    in the peak hour, the directionality of traffic in the peak hour and other
                    factors. The daily capacity provides a general guideline as to the adequacy
                    or deficiency of the roadway system.

    Estimated daily capacity for Level of Service (LOS) E, expressed as vehicles per day (vpd).
Level of Service (LOS) terms are used to qualitatively describe prevailing
conditions and their effect on traffic. Broadly interpreted, the LOS concept
denotes any one of a number of differing combinations of operating
conditions that may take place as a roadway is accommodating various
traffic volumes. The LOS is related to the volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C). To
determine the V/C ratio, the average daily traffic volume on a particular
roadway link is divided by the link capacity. There are six defined Levels of
Service, A through F, which describe conditions ranging from “ideal” to
“worst” as defined in Table CIR-3, Level of Service Descriptions.

          A            seldom impeded in their ability to maneuver in the traffic stream. Delays at
                       intersections are minimal.

          B            ability to maneuver in the traffic stream is slightly restricted and delays are not
                       bothersome

          C            be more restricted than LOS B and longer queues are experienced at
                       intersections.
          D            Congestion occurs and a small change in volumes increases delays substantially.        0.81 - 0.90
          E            Severe congestion occurs with extensive delays and low travel speeds occur.            0.91 - 1.00
                       Characterizes arterial flow at extremely low speeds and intersection congestion          > 1.00
          F            occurs with high delays and extensive queuing.

                    As shown in Table CIR-3, traffic conditions are best when the daily traffic
                    volumes on a roadway are less than 60 or 70 percent of the theoretical
                    capacity of the roadway, while extreme congestion and delays can be
                    expected when the daily traffic volumes approach or exceed 100 percent of
                    the roadway capacity. The threshold Level of Service for the City of Cerritos
                    is LOS “D” for planning purposes.
                    Existing Traffic Conditions on Roadways
                    Daily roadway traffic counts were taken city-wide in 1998. Based on
                    historical traffic volume data from 1987 and 1993, the growth in ADT on
                    most roadway segments has typically been less than one percent, and
                    would account for regional traffic passing through Cerritos. Therefore, the
                    1998 data is considered to be representative of existing (2001) conditions.
                    Existing daily traffic volumes on roadway segments are presented in Exhibit
                    CIR-4, 2001 Daily Roadway Segment Traffic Volumes. Existing traffic
                    volumes were compared to roadway capacity to assess existing levels of
                    service. For each roadway segment, the daily capacity was determined in
                    accordance with the current facility type and existing number of lanes, and
                    a V/C ratio was computed. The resulting volumes and associated V/C
                    ratios and LOS are summarized in Table CIR-4, Level of Service on
                    Roadway Segments, Existing Conditions.
                    The data in Table CIR-4 indicates that all roadway segments currently
                    operate at LOS D or better. Traffic operations on a vast majority of the
                    roadway segments would be characterized as LOS A or B.
                    3.3.2 PEAK HOUR TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
                    Level of Service Definition for Intersections
                    Intersections are analyzed using the Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU)
                    methodology as specified by the Los Angeles County CMP. The ICU
                    methodology uses peak hourly traffic volumes and lane capacities to
                    calculate a volume-to-capacity ratio (V/C ratio) for each turning movement
                    on each approach. Critical movements are then identified and an ICU value
                    determined based on a summation of the critical V/C ratios. The ICU
                    methodology provides a comparison of intersection volumes to the
                    intersection capacity and the results are then related to LOS values, ranging
                    from “A” to “F”, according to Table CIR-5, Intersection Level of Service and
                    Corresponding ICU Values.

                    Intersection Capacity Analysis
                    Sixteen (16) intersections were selected for analysis. The selection of the 16
                    intersections was based on which intersections are currently carrying high
                    peak hour volumes, such as those near activity centers and freeway
                    interchanges, as well as those near vacant or underutilized parcels where
                    development could occur and traffic growth might be anticipated. The 16
                    intersections selected for analysis are summarized on Table CIR-6,
                    Intersection Analysis – 2001 Conditions. Morning and evening peak hour
                    traffic counts were conducted at each study intersection in September
                    2001, and the existing peak hour Level of Service at those intersections is
                    summarized on Table CIR-6.
                    Review of Table CIR-6 indicates that, with the exception of one intersection,
                    all study intersections are operating at LOS D or better under existing
                    conditions. One intersection is currently operating at LOS E:
                         o South Street and Carmenita Road: PM peak hour.
                    4.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE CIRCULATION PLAN
                    4.1      ANALYSIS OF BUILDOUT TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
                    Analysis of projected traffic conditions at buildout of the City was conducted
                    to determine whether or not the City’s circulation system can accommodate
                    the future traffic demands of the City’s land use plan. The buildout year is
                    assumed to be Year 2020. If roadway or intersection deficiencies are
                    projected to occur as a result of buildout of General Plan land uses, then
                    improvements needed to accommodate future traffic volumes will be
                    identified.

4.1.1    METHODOLOGY
The methodology for evaluating future traffic volumes on the roadway
segments and at intersections in Cerritos is based on the following major
premises:
     o The Circulation Element must be consistent with all other Elements
         of the General Plan, especially the Land Use Element, such that
         there is a good balance between the transportation capacity to be
         provided and the travel demand to be generated by the buildout
         land uses.
     o The effects of increased traffic in Cerritos due to growth and
         development in neighboring communities must be taken into
         consideration. While “through” traffic is not encouraged, its
         presence must be recognized so that the Circulation Element can
         be responsive.
CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                                                           CIR-25

                         o The City’s current circulation system is built out to its designated
                             capacities, and is assumed to be the network for the buildout
                             analysis. If improvements to the roadway system or intersections
                             are needed to accommodate General Plan Buildout, these will be
                             recommended as mitigation measures.
                    4.1.2    BUILDOUT TRAFFIC PROJECTIONS
                    While the City of Cerritos is generally fully developed, some parcels are still
                    vacant, or are underdeveloped and have the potential for further
                    development. The Land Use Element of the General Plan quantifies the
                    potential development on these under-developed and vacant parcels. The
                    remaining potential development on these parcels of interest in Cerritos is
                    estimated to consist of approximately 2.77 million square feet of
                    development in underutilized parcels, and 1.15 million square feet
                    development on vacant parcels.
                    For the analysis of future traffic conditions, each parcel was identified in
                    terms of its potential future land use, including the land use type
                    (residential, retail, office, industrial, etc.) and the quantity of those land uses
                    (dwelling units, thousand square feet, etc.). The additional trips that would
                    be generated by the proposed developments were estimated and
                    distributed on the surrounding road network as described earlier in the
                    report. The average growth for the street network was calculated from daily
                    traffic volumes that were obtained from the City.
                    4.1.3    BUILDOUT TRAFFIC CONDITIONS ON ROADWAYS
                    Forecasted daily traffic volumes are presented on Exhibit CIR-5, Buildout
                    (2020) Daily Roadway Segment Traffic Volumes. Forecasted operating
                    conditions for Buildout Year 2020 are presented in Table CIR-7, Level of
                    Service on Roadway Segments, Buildout Conditions (2020). Review of
                    Table CIR-7 indicates that all roadway segments would continue to operate
                    at LOS D or better at buildout, with the exception of the following two
                    roadway segments:
                         o South Street west of Studebaker Avenue, LOS E; and
                         o South Street between I-605 and Gridley Avenue, LOS E.
                    In both cases, these roadways are Major Arterials, and are adjacent to or
                    near a freeway interchange. The forecasted LOS E conditions on these
                    segments are reflective of the regional function these roadways provide.

                    Recommended Improvements to Mitigate Impacts
                    Since the acceptable threshold for Level of Service is D, these two
                    segments mentioned above are considered to be impacted. The segment
                    of South Street and Studebaker Road is currently a four-lane divided
                    roadway, and would need to be widened to six lanes in order to achieve the
                    acceptable LOS threshold of D. However, this would require right-of-way
                    take and would have undesirable impacts on adjacent land uses.
                    It should be noted that the projected traffic increases will be the result of
                    buildout of nearby vacant and underutilized parcels within the City, as well
                    as regional growth, and may not occur for some time, if at all. It is also
                    important to note that the adjacent intersection of South Street and
                    Studebaker Road is projected to operate at LOS D or better in both peak
                    hours at buildout, indicating that appropriate intersection improvements
                    exist to accommodate peak traffic volumes. Finally, a signal coordination
                    system is in place along South Street, which provides traffic flow benefits
                    that are not reflected in the daily V/C and LOS calculations. Based on these
                    factors, upgrading South Street to a six-lane major would not necessarily be
                    required. Rather, the City should monitor traffic growth, and be prepared to
                    address unacceptable levels of congestion, should they occur.
                    The segment of South Street between I-605 and Gridley Avenue is already
                    built to six lanes. The increase in traffic on this segment reflects high traffic
                    demands due to new development, as well as increases in regional traffic
                    destined for the freeway. Further widening on this roadway segment would
                    have significant land use implications.               Traffic control system
                    improvements, such as signal coordination, to help expedite access to and
                    from the freeway are already in place, and provide traffic flow benefits that
                    are not reflected in the daily V/C and LOS calculations.
                    4.1.4    BUILDOUT TRAFFIC CONDITIONS AT INTERSECTIONS
                    The ICU analysis was conducted for buildout conditions, and the LOS was
                    determined for each of the 16 intersections. The results are presented in
                    Table CIR-8, Intersection Levels of Service at Buildout (2020). The data in
                    Table CIR-8 indicates that 13 of the 16 intersections analyzed would
                    operate at LOS “D” or better under buildout conditions. Two intersections
                    would operate at LOS “E” and one at LOS “F”:
                        o 183rd Street at Bloomfield Avenue: LOS E in the AM peak hour;
                        o South Street at Carmenita Road: LOS F in the PM peak hour; and
                        o Artesia Avenue at Carmenita Road: LOS E in both the AM and PM
                             peak hours.

Mitigation Measures for Intersections
Improvements were identified that would achieve Level of Service “D” under
buildout conditions at the three impacted intersections.                                  These
improvements are:
    o At 183rd Street and Bloomfield Avenue: The addition of a second
          westbound left-turn lane would improve the Level of Service from
          LOS E to LOS D.
    o At South Street and Carmenita Road: The addition of a third
          southbound through lane, a third eastbound through lane, and a
          westbound through lane would improve the Level of Service from
          LOS F to LOS D.
    o At Artesia Boulevard and Carmenita Road: the addition of a second
          eastbound left-turn lane and the striping of a northbound right-turn
          lane would improvement the level of service from LOS E to LOS D.

                              necessarily be required. Rather, the City should monitor traffic growth, and

CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                     CIR-36
To accommodate traffic volume levels in the future will likely require the
addition of lanes on some roadway segments. The City’s current
classification system does not have a roadway category that specifically
reflects a six-lane configuration within a 100-foot right-of-way. Major
Arterials with 100 feet of right-of-way (also referred to as “Primary”
roadways in the City’s Standard Plan document) are intended to be four -
lane facilities. However, some Major Arterial roadway segments in the City,
specifically sections of South Street, Bloomfield Avenue and Valley View
Avenue, have been upgraded to six lanes. In some cases, the City has
acquired additional right-of-way (more than 100 feet) to achieve this six-lane
cross-section.      In most cases, however, the six lanes have been
accommodated within the 100-foot right-of-way by narrowing lanes or
eliminating parking or bike lanes.
It is proposed that a “Major with six lanes” category be added to the City’s
classification system, and assigned to selected roadway segments. This
category would have a right-of-way width of 120 feet. Assigning this
designation to selected roadway segments would make it possible for the
City to preserve or acquire additional right-of-way as development or re-
development takes place along these Arterials. With additional right-of-
way, the City can achieve desirable design standards with appropriate lane
widths, center dividers and appropriate curb lane treatment.
4.2.1    MAJOR ARTERIALS
Major Arterials would be four-lane or six-lane divided facilities that would
carry the highest levels of traffic volumes in the City, mostly in excess of
40,000 to 50,000 vehicles per day (vpd). Major Arterials carry a large
volume of intra-regional through traffic destined to and from major activity
centers in the City, and to and from the freeway system. Frequent access
to abutting land uses is discouraged.
     o The right-of-way width for a 6-lane Major Arterial would be 100 feet.
         The LOS E capacity of a 6-lane Major would be 53,000 vpd.
     o The right-of-way for a 4-lane Major Arterial would be 100 feet. The
         LOS E daily capacity of a 4-lane Major would remain at 40,400 vpd.
4.2.2 SECONDARY ARTERIALS
Secondary arterials would be four-lane divided or undivided facilities
capable of carrying up to 30,000 to 35,000 vehicles per day without serious
traffic delays. They are designed to carry traffic between Major Arterials or to
lesser thoroughfares and have right-of-way widths of 80 feet with 64 feet of
roadway width curb to curb. The major difference between divided and
undivided Secondary Arterials would be that the vehicle-carrying capacity
for a divided facility would be higher than for an undivided facility. Most of
CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                              CIR-37

                    the roadways designated as Secondary roadways in the City of Cerritos
                    have been improved to provide some form of center roadway divider for
                    left-turn channelization. Adoption of this recommended classification will
                    simply acknowledge the difference between the divided and undivided
                    Secondary facilities in the City.
                         o The Secondary Divided Arterial would have two travel lanes in each
                             direction, and a center roadway divider to provide separate
                             channelization for left-turning vehicles. The daily LOS E capacity of a
                             Secondary Divided Arterial would be 36,000 vpd.
                         o The Secondary Undivided Arterial would have two travel lanes in
                             each direction, and no center divider. Parking lanes or bike lanes
                             are usually provided. The daily LOS E capacity of Secondary
                             Undivided Arterial would be 31,000 vpd.
                    Secondary Arterials are better suited than Major Arterials to serve adjacent
                    land uses, and to carry traffic between adjacent neighborhoods, distributing
                    traffic between local streets and Major Arterials. Side street access and
                    driveways to individual properties are more frequent.
                    4.2.3 LOCAL STREETS
                    Local streets would be comprised of Collector and Residential streets.
                    Collector streets are normally two lanes that functionally provide access for
                    several local roadways to an arterial roadway. They are intended to collect
                    and route local traffic to the higher classification roads. A Collector street
                    usually has a roadway width of 40 feet within 60 feet of right-of-way.
                    Residential streets are not included in the basic circulation network
                    contained in the Circulation Element, yet they constitute a major part of the
                    road network in the City of Cerritos. They would have a right-of-way
                    between 50 and 60 feet, with two travel lanes, parking lanes, sidewalk and
                    parkway. The intent of the residential street system is simply to carry
                    residential traffic from the neighborhoods to the higher classification street
                    system.
                    With this revised classification system, some changes to the current
                    roadway designations are recommended. The recommended
                    classifications changes are illustrated in Exhibit CIR-7, Functional Roadway
                    Classifications (2002 General Plan). Table CIR-10, Functional Roadway
                    Classifications, summarizes roadway segments for which changes in
                    classification are recommended.

Right-of-way and travelway cross-sections for the recommended roadway
classifications are presented in Exhibit CIR-8, Recommended Typical
Sections for Arterials. Cross-sections for local streets are not shown
because collector and residential streets are not considered to be a part of
the Circulation Element.
5.0 PLANNING FACTORS, GOALS AND POLICIES
REDUCE THE EFFECTS OF REGIONAL TRAFFIC ON THE COMMUNITY
Planning Factor
Regional traffic does not recognize city boundaries. Cerritos is a city
surrounded on all sides by urbanized communities. A comprehensive
freeway system and a continuous grid street system in and around the City
of Cerritos allows for the free flow of traffic between and through adjoining
cities. The street system must be planned, designed and preserved to
support the movement of all people and goods within and through the City
in a safe and efficient manner, while maintaining a quality of life for
residents. The design of the circulation system should provide a balance
between economic development, regional mobility and the preservation of
residential neighborhoods and community facilities.
CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                                              CIR-39
                    Goal     CIR-1   Provide a safe and efficient regionally-oriented
                                     transportation system designed to channel non-local
                                     traffic and trucks onto the major arterial street
                                     system and discourage encroachment into community
                                     areas or residential neighborhoods.
                    Policies CIR-1.1 Use the Circulation Element to guide detailed
                                     planning and implementation of the City's roadway
                                     system.
                             CIR-1.2 Adopt street cross-section standards and ensure all
                                     new and upgraded roadway facilities are constructed
                                     or upgraded to meet City standards, where feasible.
                             CIR-1.3 Provide adequate capacity on the Major Arterials to
                                     encourage through traffic to stay on the Major
                                     Arterial street system, and to discourage diversion
                                     onto the secondary and residential street system.
                             CIR-1.4 Evaluate the City’s truck routes to ensure that
                                     movement of truck traffic is accommodated by and
                                     confined to the designated streets to the greatest
                                     extent possible.
                             CIR-1.5 Implement traffic signal coordination to enhance
                                     traffic flow, and reduce delay at signalized
                                     intersections.        Coordinate with neighboring
                                     jurisdictions and Caltrans, as needed.
                             CIR-1.6 Where deemed necessary, upgrade major arterial
                                     facilities to accommodate regional traffic demand,
                                     improve access to and from freeway ramp facilities
                                     and to facilitate truck movements.
                    Goal     CIR-2   Provide and maintain a secondary network of arterial
                                     streets and local streets to accommodate the internal
                                     circulation needs of Cerritos' businesses and
                                     residents.
                    Policies CIR-2.1 Maintain the current City policy that specifically
                                     precludes through traffic on 183 rd Street at the
                                     easterly boundary of the City; Shoemaker Avenue at
                                     the southerly boundary of the City; and 195th Street at
                                     the westerly boundary of the City.

                                CIR-2.2    Make arterial or intersection improvements where
                                           necessary to accommodate traffic demand that
                                           would otherwise divert to secondary and local
                                           streets.
                                CIR-2.3    Enforce speed restrictions throughout the City,
                                           especially on local streets.
                    Goal        CIR-3      Influence the design of secondary and local streets to
                                           discourage through traffic in residential areas without
                                           inhibiting internal circulation within and between
                                           neighborhoods.
                    Policies    CIR-3.1    Review vicinity of circulation plans of commercial
                                           development to minimize conflicts with residential
                                           neighborhoods.
                                CIR-3.2    Develop mechanisms to periodically monitor local
                                           traffic at the neighborhood level.
                                CIR-3.3    Encourage citizen notification of areas with through-
                                           traffic problems.        Implement and evaluate turn
                                           restrictions or other measures to reduce or
                                           discourage problematic traffic movements or
                                           patterns.
                                CIR-3.4    On an as-needed basis for identified problem areas,
                                           test and evaluate traffic calming solutions on
                                           neighborhood streets, such as curb lane striping,
                                           traffic diverters and street closures.
                                CIR-3.5    Continue to implement arterial improvements to draw
                                           traffic off of local streets.
                    SAFETY
                    Planning Factor
                    The efficient and safe movement of vehicular and non-motorized traffic on
                    City streets is a concern of both City officials and residents of the
                    community. Planning and design of the Circulation System needs to
                    include policies to minimize safety hazards and encourage safe operating
                    conditions on City streets.
CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                                          CIR-44
Goal         CIR-4   Enhance the safety of all motorists on the City street
                     system.
Policies     CIR-4.1 Identify and evaluate high-accident locations.
                     Recommend and implement improvements to
                     address deficiencies.
             CIR-4.2 Evaluate and upgrade sub-standard intersections or
                     roadway segments.
             CIR-4.3 In coordination with the railroad companies, upgrade
                     at-grade railroad crossings to improve timing,
                     visibility and motorist safety.
             CIR-4.4 Clearly sign City streets, including advance signing
                     for intersections on Major Arterials, and overhead
                     signs at signalized intersections.
             CIR-4.5 Identify and, where feasible, remove distracting
                     signage and sight-distance barriers.
             CIR-4.6 Update and enforce a defensible city-wide speed
                     limit program.
             CIR-4.7 Continue to implement and maintain a red-light
                     camera program to prevent traffic accidents at
                     primary signalized intersections.
Goal         CIR-5   Promote the safety of bicyclists and pedestrians on
                     the public streets through street design and
                     evaluation.
Policies     CIR-5.1 Identify and address bicycle and pedestrian safety
                     hazards, including mid-block crossings, missing or
                     deficient sidewalks or bike lanes and unsafe
                     intersections.
             CIR-5.2 In cooperation with the ABC Unified School District,
                     implement and maintain a “Recommended Routes
                     to School” guide for parents.
             CIR-5.3 Work cooperatively with the ABC Unified School
                     District with regard to the location and procedures of
                     crossing guards.

                    MANAGEMENT
                    Planning Factor
                    As the City reaches buildout, and surrounding cities continue to develop, it
                    will become increasingly important to maximize the efficiency of the
                    roadway network through the use of Transportation System Management
                    (TSM) and Travel Demand Management (TDM) strategies.
                    Goal        CIR-6     Reduce traffic demand through TDM measures, such
                                          as ridesharing programs, rideshare support services,
                                          shuttle services, bicycle and pedestrian system
                                          improvements, information dissemination and other
                                          trip reduction measures.
                    Policies    CIR-6.1   Implement land use and employment strategies to
                                          reduce the need for travel.
                                CIR-6.2   Promote ridesharing through publicity and provision
                                          of information to the public.
                                CIR-6.3   Require new development to incorporate design
                                          features which facilitate transit service and
                                          encourage transit ridership such as bus stop
                                          facilities, and efficient pedestrian paths through
                                          projects to transit stops.
                                CIR-6.4   Require mixed-use projects to provide an internal
                                          system of pedestrian and bicycle amenities, linking
                                          site uses and providing linkages to surrounding
                                          uses.
                                CIR-6.5   Encourage a mix of uses within a project, designed
                                          to maximize internal trip making, maximize the use of
                                          parking facilities and to promote a shift from auto
                                          use to pedestrian and bicycle modes of travel.
                                CIR-6.6   Encourage the provision of additional regional public
                                          transportation services and support facilities,
                                          including park-and-ride lots near the freeway
                                          interchanges and within village centers.
                                CIR-6.7   Investigate and encourage innovative transportation
                                          solutions to serve the community and/or the region.
CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                                       CIR-46
Goal         CIR-7   Using Transportation System Management strategies,
                     improve the flow of traffic on City streets through
                     means other than adding roadway capacity.
Policies     CIR-7.1 Require proper spacing and interconnect traffic
                     signals where feasible to maximize the smooth
                     progression of traffic flows and to minimize delay
                     and stop and go conditions.
             CIR-7.2 Implement time-of-day signal timing plans to be
                     responsive to varying traffic patterns at different
                     times of the day.
             CIR-7.3 Discourage the provision of on-street (curbside)
                     parking along principal arterial roadways (e.g.,
                     Studebaker Road at the Cerritos Auto Square) to
                     minimize traffic conflicts and increase the traffic
                     carrying capacity of these roadways.
             CIR-7.4 Evaluate the use of protected-permissive left-turn
                     phasing at appropriate intersections, to reduce
                     vehicle delay during off-peak periods.
             CIR-7.5 Promote the consolidation of parking and related
                     circulation facilities, where appropriate, to minimize
                     the number of ingress and egress points onto
                     arterials.
Goal         CIR-8   Strive to achieve a public transportation system which
                     serves the needs of the community, is accessible to
                     all and is a viable alternative to the single occupant
                     vehicle.
Policies     CIR-8.1 Promote an increase in bus services offered, and a
                     reduction in wait times within City limits.
             CIR-8.2 Promote an increase in the use of public transit and
                     para-transit services.
             CIR-8.3 Provide adequate lane width and capacity, and
                     reduce travel time on streets utilized by fixed-route
                     transit.
             CIR-8.4 Review       new        developments       to   include
                     accommodations for Transportation Demand
                     Management (TDM) programs, including public
                     transportation and parking management.

                    ROADWAY/PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY AESTHETICS
                    Planning Factor
                    The City of Cerritos takes pride in its high-quality of visual aesthetics
                    throughout the City, including on its public street system. The inclusion of
                    landscaped medians, streetscape furniture, a consistent sign program, and
                    other features all serve to make the individual’s travel through the City more
                    pleasing.
                    Goal        CIR-9       Plan and manage public rights-of-way and median
                                            islands to provide attractive streetscapes, while
                                            ensuring that street capacity, functionality, sight
                                            distance and public safety are not adversely affected.
                    Policies    CIR-9.1     Provide attractive streetscapes in a cost-effective,
                                            low-maintenance manner.
                                CIR-9.2     Develop and implement a consistent street and
                                            landmark signing program throughout the City.
                                CIR-9.3     Maintain and replace street trees as needed to

CHAPTER 5
HOUSING ELEMENT
1.0      INTRODUCTION
As the population of the State continues to grow and pressure on resources
increases, Cerritos is concerned with providing adequate housing
opportunities while maintaining a high standard of living for all citizens in the
community.
Recognizing the importance of providing adequate housing, the State has
mandated a Housing Element with every General Plan since 1969. This
Housing Element (1998-2005) was created in compliance with State
General Plan law pertaining to Housing Elements and was certified by the
California Department of Housing and Community Development on June
10, 2002. In compliance with State law, the population and housing
numbers in the adopted Housing Element are based upon the 1990 Census
and Department of Finance numbers, and not the 2000 Census. The next
update of the Housing Element will be based upon the 2000 Census.
This Chapter focuses primarily on goals, policies and action plans related to
housing in the City. The following sections have been synthesized from the
data and analysis contained in the Housing Element, which can be found in
its entirety as Appendix H.
1.1      PURPOSE
The State of California has declared that “the availability of housing is of
vital statewide importance and the early attainment of decent housing and a
suitable living environment for every California family is a priority of the
highest order.” In addition, government and the private sector should make
an effort to provide a diversity of housing opportunities and accommodate
regional housing needs through a cooperative effort, while maintaining a
responsibility toward economic, environmental and fiscal factors and
community goals within the General Plan.
The City of Cerritos’ General Plan Housing Element articulates the City’s
seven-year plan (1998 to 2005) relative to the maintenance and
development of housing to meet the needs of existing and future residents.
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                   H-1

                The Housing Element, as required by State law, will provide a detailed
                analysis of existing housing stock, housing and household characteristics,
                ability of the housing industry to provide the necessary type and cost of
                housing, housing needs for all economic levels and for special needs
                groups and specific housing program development and priority.
                The purpose of these requirements is to develop an understanding of the
                existing and projected housing needs within the community and to set forth
                policies and schedules that promote preservation, improvement and
                development of diverse types and costs of housing throughout Cerritos.
                1.2      CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
                Public participation for the 1998-2005 Housing Element included a series of
                study sessions and public hearings. In addition, a public review draft was
                prepared and made available to the community for a 30-day review period.
                The public review draft was sent to the Los Angeles County Housing
                Authority (LACHA), eight neighboring cities, Los Angeles County, Orange
                County, 18 non-profit organizations and various service providers (See
                Attachment 1 in Appendix H). The public review draft included comments
                received from City staff and the Planning Commission.
                1.3      HOUSING ELEMENT PLANNING CYCLE
                State planning law mandates that jurisdictions within the Southern California
                Association of Governments (SCAG) region adopt and update their
                Housing Element by July 1, 2000. As a consequence of this due date, a
                series of time frames for various aspects of the Housing Element
                preparation are established. There are three relevant time periods
                identified:
                    o 1989-1997: the review period to measure accomplishments of the
                         1989 Housing Element;
                    o 1998-July 2005: the planning period for assessing housing
                         construction needs; and
                    o 2000-2005: the implementation period for programs identified within
                         this Housing Element.
                The planning period for the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA)
                as prepared by SCAG, is from January 1998 to June 2005. Pursuant to
                State law, the City of Cerritos, along with other jurisdictions prepare their
                next revision of the housing element to cover the period from 2005 to 2010.
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                           H-2
2.0 AUTHORITY FOR THE ELEMENT
The Housing Element is one of the seven General Plan Elements mandated
by the State of California, as expressed in Sections 65580 to 65589.8 of the
California Government Code. California State Law requires that the
Housing Element consist of “an identification and analysis of existing and
projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified
objectives, and scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement and
development of housing.” The Housing Element establishes policies that
will guide the City’s decision-making in developing and implementing its
goals through 2005.
The State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) sets
forth specific requirements regarding the scope and content of City and
county housing elements.
3.0 COMMUNITY FACTORS
3.1      DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS
The growth trends in Cerritos show significant population growth between
1970 and 2000. Cerritos grew by 266.2 percent during this time, making it
the largest growing city amidst the eight neighboring cities. The recent
growth can be attributed to the fact that the surrounding cities were built out
earlier and in turn had experienced greater population growth decades
before. In addition, Cerritos converted large amounts of its agricultural land
to housing and commercial uses in the 1960s and 1970s, allowing for rapid
growth. Current data shows the population growth in Cerritos has
diminished drastically over time. According to the California Department of
Finance, the 2000 population is 58,0631 persons and is projected to grow
by 4,140 persons or 7.1 percent over the next 20 years.
The 2000 Census data shows Cerritos is ethnically and culturally diverse,
with 58.4 percent of the population of Asian/Pacific Islander origin, 21.4
percent of white origin, 10.4 percent of Hispanic/Latino origin and 6.7
percent of Black/African American origin. The median age of the population
is 34 years, however there is a growing population of seniors.
There are segments of the population that may have more difficulty finding
affordable housing due to their special needs. The special needs groups in
Cerritos may include the elderly, disabled persons, large families, single-
parent households or the homeless. These special needs groups along
         1
           The 2000 U.S. Census showed the City’s population in 2000 to be 51,488, which
represents a 3.3 percent decrease from the 1990 census population of 53,240.
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                          H-3

                with low-income groups should be addressed in the City’s implementation
                of the Housing Element.
                2000 Census data has the median family income for Cerritos as $76,944.
                This figure represents an increase of 39.7 percent from the 1990 median
                family income of $55,076. The area median income (AMI) determined by
                the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for Los
                Angeles-Long Beach MSA 2000 counties was $52,100, which is
                substantially lower than Cerritos.
                NEIGHBORHOOD AND HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
                The population growth in Cerritos has increased at a greater rate than the
                housing supply. During the period of 1990 to 2000, the estimated
                population increased by 4,823 persons, while the housing stock increased
                by 147 units. Cerritos has a high percentage of single-family residential
                units, comprising 93.5 percent of its housing stock. Cerritos has a
                proportionally larger number of owners than renters. In 2000, 84.4 percent
                of the households are owners and 15.6 percent are renters.
                The elderly population in Cerritos has increased dramatically. From the
                period of 1980 to 1990, the elderly population grew by 109.9 percent. It
                grew another 44.1 percent during the period of 1990 to 2000. This increase
                suggests a high demand for senior housing. Currently there are two senior
                housing communities in Cerritos, Pioneer Villas and Emerald Villas. The
                City is currently constructing another senior complex, Avalon at Cerritos. All
                three of these senior housing communities contain affordable and market
                rate units.
                Cerritos is predominately built out, with limited potential for new residential
                construction. As of 1998 there were approximately 17 acres of vacant land
                zoned for residential uses in the City. This vacant land could provide 387
                additional housing units in Cerritos. The City has also identified 4.8 units of
                underutilized land that has potential for residential redevelopment. This
                land could potentially provide 32 additional housing units.
                The condition of the City’s housing stock may be characterized by its age.
                In Cerritos only 1.3 percent of the housing stock was built before 1959. A
                majority of the housing units, 68.2 percent, were built in the period of 1970
                to 1979. This demonstrates Cerritos housing stock is young, and only a
                small percentage of housing units are likely to be substandard due to age.
                The City has developed neighborhood improvement plans and has made
                available various resources to maintain the integrity of Cerritos’ residential
                communities.

4.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE HOUSING PLAN
4.1       QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
Based on the objectives and past monitoring reports, the City should be
able to construct, rehabilitate or preserve approximately 505 units between
1998 and 2005. Eighty-eight (88) percent of the total production will be
through new construction, while the remainder will be through rehabilitation.
Through new construction between 1998 and 2001, the City of Cerritos has
already been able to meet their 1998-2005 RHNA Very Low and Low
housing need.

5.0 PLANNING FACTORS, GOALS AND POLICIES
5.1       CERRITOS HOUSING ISSUES
The following is a summary of housing issues in Cerritos, pertinent to the
establishment of the housing program.
The City has been successful with many programs from the last housing
element and Cerritos should continue these programs. These programs
include:
     o    Density Bonus,
     o    Senior Housing Program,
     o    Reduced Development Fees,
     o    Homeless Shelter Program,
     o    City Wide Pride Program,
     o    Grant Program,
     o    Cerritos Code Enforcement Program, and
     o    Substandard Property Abatement Program.
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                     H-5
                The City had many programs within the last housing element that were
                appropriate toward the state housing goal, but which were not effective.
                These programs can be improved through more effective actions.
                Programs that need improvement include:
                    o   Shared Housing Program,
                    o   Equal Housing Program,
                    o   Simplified Residential Development Review Process,
                    o   Deferred Rehabilitation Loans,
                    o   Senior and Disabled Citizen Labor Assistance Program,
                    o   One-for-One Replacement Housing Program (at-risk), and
                    o   First-time Home Buyers Assistance Program.
                Population and household growth in the last decade has stabilized as
                Cerritos approaches buildout. Population growth has been more rapid than
                household growth, which suggests the average household size is
                increasing.
                Cerritos unemployment rate has consistently been low and the number of
                persons in the labor force has remained stable.
                Only 1.3 percent of the housing stock was built before 1959, which
                indicates that Cerritos’ housing stock is young, and only a small percentage
                of housing units are likely to be substandard, due to age. Also, large
                portions of the housing stock are 20 to 30 years old and could need
                maintenance over the next five years.
                There are no units “at-risk” of converting to market rate over the next 20
                years, but the City should have a definite approach to housing units at-risk.
                Cerritos plays an important regional role in providing housing opportunities
                to families and other households seeking ownership. Consequently, the
                City should make strong commitments toward the improvement of first-time
                homebuyer opportunities.
                As the City continues to approach buildout, providing adequate housing
                sites will present a major challenge. Future residential development will rely
                heavily on innovative actions.
                5.2     GOALS AND POLICIES
                The goals and policies of the Housing Element provide the direction for the
                City’s programs or actions. The goals and polices and subsequent

                6.0 HOUSING ACTION PLAN
                DENSITY BONUS PROGRAM
                Action: Continue the City’s Density Bonus Program that grants a density
                bonus of 25 percent, along with other regulatory concessions, to ensure
                lower development costs for developers that allocate at least 20 percent of
                the units in a housing project to lower income households, or 10 percent for
                very low income households, or at least 50 percent for “qualifying residents”
                (e.g. senior citizens). The Program ensures affordability of all lower income

                Eligible participants must have a Moderate Income (between 80 and 120
                percent of the median income). Terms of the proposed program may
                require: 1) participants to live in the subject property as their sole residence
                for at least fifteen years after purchase; and 2) include a discount off the list
                price of the subject property in the form of a second mortgage that is the
                equivalent of the discounted price that will be waived after the mandatory
                occupancy period is satisfied. If the buyer leaves the home during the
                mandatory occupancy period, he/she will be required to repay the Agency a
                portion of the second mortgage depending on length of occupancy.

LAND USE ELEMENT REVIEW PROGRAM
Action: As part of the General Plan Update, the Land Use Element will be
reviewed by 2002 to determine if any non-residential zoned land can be
converted to residential uses and to evaluate possibilities of higher
residential land densities in an effort to investigate ways of maximizing land
use and identify possible new or under-utilized sites appropriate for
multifamily development.
Objective: Maximize housing development on existing land.
Source of Funding: General Fund
Responsible Agency: Department of Community Development
Schedule: 2003
MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM
Action: After the Land Use Element is updated and a site database of
vacant or under-utilized land has been created, the Redevelopment Agency
will identify appropriate sites for multifamily development. The City will then
discuss with the owners of the identified sites, the possibility of the City
acquiring the sites for future multifamily development. The zoning
requirement of multifamily development being on no less than 3 acres of
land will not apply to this Program. Specifically, since multifamily
developments such as the Emerald Villas and Pioneer Villas Affordable
Senior Housing Projects require the creation of unique development
guidelines, standard Multifamily Residential (RM) zoning requirements are
not applicable resulting in the creation of an Area Development Plan (ADP).
In addition to the 126-unit Emerald Villas, 98-unit Pioneer Villas, and 147-
unit Avalon at Cerritos projects, the City is proposing to develop a for-sale
senior housing project at the southeast corner of Carmenita Road and 183rd
Street.
Objective: Construct affordable rental housing in Cerritos.

CHAPTER 6
SAFETY ELEMENT
1.0       INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the Safety Element is “to reduce the potential risk of death,
injuries, property damage and the economic and social dislocation resulting
from hazards such as fires, floods, earthquakes, landslides and other
hazards”.1 It serves as a guide for the City government and public for
understanding the hazards facing the City of Cerritos and how to reduce the
impacts of these hazards.
2.0 AUTHORITY FOR THE ELEMENT
The State of California Government Code Section 65302(g) requires that a
General Plan include:
       “...a safety element for the protection of the community from any
       unreasonable risks associated with the effects of seismically
       induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure,
       tsunami, seiche, and dam failure; slope instability leading to
       mudslides and landslides; subsidence, liquefaction and other
       seismic hazards identified pursuant to Chapter 7.8 (commencing
       with §2690) of the Public Resources Code, and other geologic
       hazards known to the legislative body; flooding; and wild land
       and urban fires.”
Policies and information for this element are contained in the Alquist-Priolo
Earthquake Fault Zoning Act (Public Resources Code Section 2621, et
seq.), the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act (Public Resources Code Section
2690, et seq.), and the Unreinforced Masonry Law (Government Code
Section 8875, et seq.).

               3.0 SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
               3.1      CITY PLANS AND PROGRAMS
               MULTI-HAZARD FUNCTIONAL PLAN
               The Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS), California
               Code of Regulations, Title 19, Division 2, Section 2443, requires compliance
               with the SEMS to.... “be documented in the areas of planning, training,
               exercise, and performance." To be in compliance, emergency plans should
               address five SEMS functions:
                    o   Management;
                    o   Operations;
                    o   Logistics;
                    o   Planning/Intelligence; and
                    o   Finance/Administration.
               The plan also addresses mutual aid, operational areas and multi/inter-
               agency coordination.
               Cerritos has prepared a Multi-Hazard Functional Plan for emergency
               response within the City. The Plan meets the Standardized Emergency
               Management System requirements of State law. The City also complies
               with the Los Angeles County Emergency Management Plan.
               Emergency response and threats are thoroughly described and outlined in
               the Multi-Hazard Functional Plan. Key points of the plan include the
               identification of critical areas in the City that represent both dangers, as well
               as areas for meeting and staging in an emergency event, communications
               and emergency evacuation. Parks and other large areas are identified as
               emergency shelter and meeting locations. An Emergency Operation Center
               (EOC), fully equipped with emergency communication equipment and
               cooking, showering and sleeping facilities is provided adjacent to City Hall
               for seismic and other disaster situations. A citywide Ham operating system
               has been implemented to maintain communications should other systems
               fail. Finally, emergency evacuation routes have been identified as shown in
               Exhibit SAF-1, Emergency Evacuation Routes.
               The City is fortunate in having two major freeways that would serve as
               potential evacuation routes during a disaster. Arterial streets with right-of-
               way widths of from 80 to 100 feet form a grid pattern throughout the City at
               one-half mile intervals. The right-of-way width of local streets ranges from
               56 to 60 feet. Street widths and clearance around structures are reviewed
               by City Staff and the County of Los Angeles Fire Department at the time of
               application for development permits.

CITY OF CERRITOS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
The City of Cerritos conducts an annual review and update of its Capital
Improvement Program (CIP). The Capital Improvement Program provides
the primary planning and budget mechanism for improvement projects
throughout the City. The CIP must provide consistency with City policies as
set forth in the City’s General Plan. Projects within the CIP typically include
water, recycled water, sewer, storm drains and public right-of-way
improvements.
CERRITOS MUNICIPAL CODE
The Cerritos Municipal Code contains all Ordinances adopted by the
Cerritos City Council. Many of these chapters provide direct relevance to
policies and programs in the Safety Element. Relevant Code sections
include:
    o    Title 6: Health and Sanitation;
    o    Title 9: Public Peace, Safety and Morals;
    o    Title 13: Water and Sewers; and
    o    Title 15: Buildings and Construction.
3.2      EXISTING CONDITIONS
The Safety Element specifically addresses both natural and man-made
hazards. Natural hazards include flooding, seismic activity, geology and
soils and wind. Man-made hazards include fire, crime, hazardous materials
and aircraft overflight. This section of the Safety Element addresses the
existing conditions of these hazards and the programs currently in place to
address them.
3.2.1    NATURAL HAZARDS
Geologic, hydrologic, seismic and soil conditions present in the City have
been evaluated in order to identify potential seismic hazards, such as
surface faulting (ground rupture), ground shaking, liquefaction, ground
lurching, differential compaction, ground cracking and seismically induced
landslides. These data were used to evaluate potential seismic hazards to
existing public and private facilities, and future land development.
3.2.1.1 Geology
Cerritos lies in the northeastern portion of the coastal plain, where
sedimentary and volcanic rocks in the subsurface attain great thicknesses.
This portion of the plain is immediately underlain by a sequence of alluvial
deposits about 1,000 feet in thickness, consisting predominantly of marine

               and non-marine sand and silt. Newer alluvial deposits exist along the San
               Gabriel River. According to the Geologic Map of California, Long Beach
               Sheet, 1978, the City of Cerritos is underlain by alluvium 2, Qal, which stands
               for alluvium deposited in the Quaternary period.
               Groundwater-producing zones (aquifers) lie at various depths below the
               ground surface. The highest historical depth for groundwater in Cerritos
               ranges from 20 to 100 feet. Perched water is present within several feet of
               the surface in many areas of the City, giving indication that hazards related
               to liquefaction effects (ground failure) constitute a primary seismic concern
               throughout the City limits. Refer to Exhibit SAF -2, Geologic Conditions.
               3.2.1.2 Seismic Hazards
               The following section describes seismic hazards present in the City of
               Cerritos including earthquake faults, surface rupture, ground shaking,
               liquefaction, hazardous buildings and seismic response.
               Earthquake Faults
               Active faults, structural zones and historically destructive earthquakes are
               characteristic of Southern California. The San Andreas Fault is 50 miles to
               the northeast of Cerritos. Northwest trending faults lie to the northeast and
               southwest of the City, but there are no identified Alquist-Priolo Earthquake
               Fault Zones within the City limits. The closest fault to Cerritos is the
               projected trace of the buried Norwalk Fault, which lies approximately one
               mile to the north. A map illustrating the location of faults in Southern
               California is shown in Exhibit SAF-3, Regional Fault Map.
               An earthquake along the San Andreas fault zone could affect most of
               Southern California, and an earthquake on the Newport-Inglewood fault
               zone could affect the entire Los Angeles Basin. Earthquakes on other
               active faults are likely to have more localized effects. Geology, soils and
               groundwater conditions are similar throughout Cerritos, so that no firm
               geographical distinction can be made as to earthquake effects in different
               parts of the City. The level of seismicity in Cerritos, both as to maximum
               credible earthquake intensity and likely earthquake occurrences, is
               considered to be approximately the same as for the Los Angeles Basin.

               occur on terraces well above present streams, on the present flood plains or deltas, or as a
               fan at the base of a slope. Source: Glossary of Soil Science Terms, Soil Science Society of

                   Most of the data shown on this map were
                   compiled from 1989 to 1992.
                   A Preliminary version was released in 1992.
                   Additional data were added and revisions made in
                   1993 and 1994; this map supersedes the 1992
                   version. This compilation was completed before the
                   preliminary Earthquake Fault    Zones Maps of 1994
                   were completed so there may be minor differences.

               Newport-Inglewood Structural Zone.      The Newport-Inglewood Structural Zone
               consists of northwesterly trending folded hills and echelon faults extending
               over 40 miles from the Santa Monica Mountains to Newport Beach where it
               projects offshore for an unknown distance. This zone is seismically active
               with numerous recorded earthquakes. The largest and most completely
               documented was the Long Beach earthquake of 1933 (6.3M), which
               resulted in strong shaking throughout the Cerritos area and Southern
               California. Fault segments of this structural zone include:
                    o   Charnock Fault;
                    o   Overland Avenue Fault;
                    o   Inglewood Fault;
                    o   Portrero Fault;
                    o   Avalon-Compton Fault;
                    o   Cherry Hill Fault; and
                    o   Seal Beach Fault.
               Whittier-Elsinore Fault. The Whittier fault extends over 20 miles from the Whittier
               Narrows near Whittier, southeasterly to the Santa Ana River where it merges
               with the southeasterly tending Elsinore fault. Collectively, these two faults
               combined with smaller faults are known as the Whittier-Elsinore fault zone.
               No major or moderate size earthquakes have occurred along the Whittier
               fault in historic time; however, microseismic data show clustering of events
               along its trace demonstrates that it is seismically active. On October 1,
               1987, an earthquake seriously impacted the Whittier area, but did not occur
               on the Whittier fault. This 5.9 magnitude earthquake occurred along a
               previously unidentified fault located in Los Angeles. The fault has since
               been named the Elysian Hills fault.
               Norwalk Fault. The Norwalk fault is approximately 16 miles long and is located
               generally to the north of Cerritos. Seismic activity has occurred along this
               fault and may have been the cause of a recent 4.7 magnitude earthquake.
               Elysian Park Fault. The Elysian Park Fault, situated in the Montebello and
               Monterey Park areas, is located approximately 15 miles north of the City.
               This fault was the origin of the 5.9 magnitude Whittier Narrows earthquake.
               Liquefaction Hazards
               The entire City is in a liquefaction hazard zone according to the Seismic
               Hazard Evaluations of the Los Alamitos 7.5 Minute Quadrangle (March 1999)
               prepared by the California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines
               and Geology (refer to Exhibit SAF-4, Potential Liquefaction Areas). These
               reports and maps are prepared by the State and updated regularly as new
               information comes available. The City receives these maps as they are
               updated, which are available for review at Cerritos City Hall.

Liquefaction is a phenomenon in which the strength and stiffness of a soil is
reduced by earthquake shaking or other events. Liquefaction occurs in
saturated soils, which are soils in which the space between individual soil
particles is completely filled with water. This water exerts a pressure on the
soil particles that influences how tightly the particles themselves are
pressed together. Prior to an earthquake, the water pressure is relatively
low. However, earthquake shaking can cause the water pressure to
increase to the point where the soil particles can readily move with respect
to each other. Because liquefaction only occurs in saturated soil, its effects
are most commonly observed in low-lying areas. These features indicate
that hazards related to liquefaction effects (ground failure) constitute a
primary seismic concern throughout the City.
Landslide Hazards
According to the Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and
Geology’s report, Seismic Hazard Evaluations of the Los Alamitos 7.5 Minute
Quadrangle (March 1999), the City of Cerritos does not have the potential
for landslides.
Structure Failure
Cerritos is fortunate that most of its buildings have been built under recent
building codes and design criteria. In fact, a substantial amount of
construction has occurred in Cerritos under design standards that take into
account some of the lessons of the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.
Seismic Response
Because most of the structures and infrastructure in Cerritos have recently
been built under modern building codes, it is possible to survive the
maximum expected earthquake with relatively moderate losses. Possible
geologic effects of a likely major earthquake on Cerritos include:
     o Rupture of the ground surface associated directly with movement on
         geologic faults (not likely to occur within the City).
     o Ground failure due to liquefaction (a momentary quick condition,
         similar to quicksand) could occur in Cerritos wherever the right
         combination of perched water and low density, sandy material
         exists. Liquefaction conditions may occur at any location within the
         City.
     o Ground shaking with moderate to high lateral accelerations would
         be the primary seismic effect in the City.
SAFETY ELEMENT                                                                 SAF-13

                    o In general, complete collapse of buildings is not likely to occur and
                       building damage is likely to be only moderate. However, partial to
                       total collapse could occur among the very few pre-1933 buildings
                       still existing, and partial collapse of some tilt-up and concrete block
                       buildings built prior to March 1972 must be counted as a possibility,
                       based on the evidence of the San Fernando earthquake. The
                       majority of construction has been under modern building codes.
                       Where current state-of-the-art seismic evaluations can enter into all
                       future development, and where disaster preparedness is being
                       maintained, it is possible to survive the maximum expected
                       earthquake with relatively moderate losses.
                       Possible impacts to the City from a major seismic event include:
                             <   Injuries and loss of life;
                             <   Economic losses;
                             <   Property damage;
                             <   Economic disruption – loss of jobs, loss of productive time,
                                 interference with trade, transportation, communication and
                                 other utilities;
                             <   Social disruption;
                             <   Housing dislocation;
                             <   Interference with community activities and services;
                             <   Emergency welfare requirements – shelter, food,
                                 communications, financial assistance; or
                             <   Psychological trauma – especially among young children.
                       However, the full extent of these impacts will be influenced by many
                       factors.
               3.2.1.3 Flooding
               According to Federal Guidelines from the Federal Emergency Management
               Agency (FEMA), the built areas of the City are in Flood Zone C, meaning
               that the area has a moderate or minimal hazard of flooding. FEMA maps
               showing areas that require flood insurance are maintained at City Hall.
               Two flood channels run through the City: the San Gabriel River Channel and
               Coyote Creek Wash.               Both channels are concrete-lined channels
               designated as floodways to serve the region. Access to these channels is
               limited at all times for public safety.
               3.2.1.4 Dam Inundation
               Dam inundation is flooding that occurs due to structural failure of a dam.
               Failure of a dam may be caused by seismic activity, severe flooding that
SAFETY ELEMENT                                                                           SAF-14

causes water to exceed the capacity of the dam or landslides that flow into
a reservoir displacing the water.
The City of Cerritos faces a potential hazard from dam inundation resulting
from the failure of either of two dams: Whittier Narrows Dam and Prado
Dam. It is considered unlikely that either dam would fail during a
catastrophic event.3 The SEMS Multi-Hazard Functional Plan prepared by
the City of Cerritos outlines the City’s response for dam failure.
Whittier Narrows Dam. The Whittier Narrows Dam is owned and operated by
the Los Angeles District, Corps of Engineers. It is located in Los Angeles
County on the San Gabriel and Rio Hondo Rivers approximately three miles
south of the City of El Monte, three miles northwest of the City of Whittier,
and approximately 7.5 miles downstream of the Santa Fe flood control
channel. The City of Cerritos is approximately 11 miles downstream of the
Dam. It is normally empty, except during or immediately after periods of
significant runoff.
Should a breach occur, the water would flow southerly toward the City of
Long Beach. All of Cerritos, excluding the area north of the SR-91 freeway
and east of Bloomfield Avenue, is within the dam’s floodplain/inundation
path. The affected area is comprised of commercial, industrial, educational
and residential uses. Exhibit SAF-5, Dam Inundation Areas, shows the area
that would be affected by a dam failure. If a breach occurred, the flood
wave would reach the City in approximately 15 hours and would be about
four feet deep.
Prado Dam. The Prado Dam is owned and operated by the Los Angeles
District, Corps of Engineers. It is located south of the City of Corona on the
Santa Ana River adjacent to State Route 91 (Riverside Freeway) in Riverside
County. The City of Cerritos is about 27 miles downstream of the Dam. It is
normally empty, except during or immediately after periods of significant
runoff.
Should a breach occur, the water would flow south along the Santa Ana
River inundating most of Orange County. A small portion of Los Angeles
County would be affected. In Cerritos, the water would first affect the
northeastern area and then travel southwesterly through the City.
Commercial, industrial, educational and residential uses would be affected
by the inundation. Exhibit SAF-5, Dam Inundation Areas, shows the areas
that would be affected by a dam failure. If a breach occurred, the flood
wave would reach the City in approximately 8½ hours and would be about
seven feet deep.

3.2.2    MAN-MADE HAZARDS
3.2.2.1 Hazardous and Toxic Materials
Hazardous materials are any substance or combination of substances
which, because of quantity, concentration, or characteristics, may cause or
significantly contribute to an increase in death or serious injury, or pose
substantial hazards to humans and/or the environment. Local governments
have little control over the production and use of these materials because
they are part of our society. Even household wastes can be hazardous
materials.
Emergency response plans are in place with the City per the SEMS Multi-
Hazard Functional Plan in the case that a hazardous or toxic materials event
occurs. In addition, the County of Los Angeles Fire Department provides
emergency response to hazardous materials. The County provides two
engines, one hazardous materials task force, one squad and a battalion
chief that directly respond to hazardous materials incidents.
Transport of Hazardous Materials
In Cerritos, a hazardous chemical release would most likely occur as a
result of either transportation of chemicals by railroad or truck, use of
chemicals at a business or illegal dumping of chemical waste. Interstates 5
and 605 (I-5 and I-605) and the SR-91 freeway are heavily traveled by trucks
and thus, represent the most likely location of a release.
Fixed Facility. The second most likely threat from hazardous materials comes
from the potential of an accidental spill and/or incident at one of the
estimated 119 known facilities that manufacture, warehouse and process
toxic chemicals and/or generate hazardous waste materials within or next to
the City. This potential also exists at former facilities, such as abandoned
service stations or industrial businesses. The threat is significantly lessened
though, because of required plan contingency and evacuation plans.
Clandestine Dumping.    Clandestine dumping of hazardous materials is a
criminal act and could pose a threat. The City anticipates that there will be
an increase in dumping as costs to legally dump materials at designation
hazardous waste disposal sites increases, but cannot anticipate if or when
such an act would occur.
Pipelines. Nine underground pipelines cross through the City of Cerritos.
Exhibit SAF -6, Potentially Hazardous Pipelines, illustrates the locations of
each of these facilities. Pipelines represent a hazard due to the contents of
the pipelines and the potential for them to rupture causing chemical leaks,
explosions or fires.

Household Hazardous Waste. Household hazardous waste poses a risk to the
City. Cerritos participates in the Los Angeles County sponsored monthly
Household Hazardous Waste Roundups for County residents.
3.3       CRIME, FIRE AND MEDICAL EMERGENCIES
Crime and fire hazards can result in injury and even death and in property
damage. Medical emergencies require quick and effective response. The
fire and police departments are prepared to service most emergencies.
Cerritos also supports many programs to provide for citizen education and
organization that can do the most to prevent panic, preserve order and
alleviate hardships in case of a major disaster.
3.3.1     FIRE PROTECTION
The City of Cerritos addresses fire protection through contracted services
by the Los Angeles County Fire Protection District, land use regulations and
building and fire codes. Regulations, standards and codes consider the
degree of fire risk associated with various occupancies and land uses.
Fire Protection Services
The Los Angeles County Fire Protection District contracts with the City of
Cerritos to provide fire and emergency response to the City. Four fire
stations provide services to the City of Cerritos (refer to Table SAF -1, Fire
Stations Serving Cerritos and Exhibit SAF-7, Fire Stations In Cerritos).
In addition to fire-fighting, the Fire Protection District is responsible for
inspection of structures and properties with regard to prevention of fires and
for the enforcement of applicable fire-related ordinances of the City of
Cerritos and the State of California. The Fire Protection District also
investigates, gathers and preserves evidence, educates the public on fire
prevention, cardio-pulminary resuscitation and first aid. The Fire Protection
District also provides temporary emergency paramedical care for life-
threatening or traumatic injuries.
Fire District Response Times. The Los Angeles County Fire Protection District
has a standard average response time of four minutes. Although no
officially adopted standards for response are in effect, the Fire Protection
District has identified no deficiencies in their ability to respond within the
four minute response window.

Volunteer Opportunities
Cerritos residents contribute to the safety of the community by serving as
volunteers at the Cerritos Sheriff's Station/Community Safety Center.
Volunteers perform a number of non-hazardous duties within the facility,
including filing reports, entering computer data, providing services at the
front counter and assisting Station personnel with a variety of public-safety
related tasks. Additional volunteer opportunities with the Community Safety
Division include Cerritos Volunteers on Patrol, Cerritos Sheriff’s Explorer
Program and the Sheriff’s Reserve Program.
Cerritos Volunteers on Patrol

               provide valuable information to the Cerritos deputies based on their
               observations and interaction with the community.
               Cerritos Sheriff’s Explorer Program
               The Cerritos Sheriff’s Station Law Enforcement Explorer Program provides a
               means by which young men and women can determine, through actual
               experience, if they would like to pursue a career in law enforcement as
               adults.
               Sheriff’s Reserve Program
               The Reserve Company has recently been established with nine deputies
               assisting the community by performing law enforcement duties, including
               responding to calls, crime prevention and investigation, traffic control and
               foreign language translation for victims and witnesses of crimes.
               Volunteer application forms are available in the Community Safety Division
               at the Cerritos Sheriff's Station. All applicants undergo a routine limited
               background investigation, including a fingerprint search. Volunteers must
               be at least 18 and in reasonably good health.
               3.5      AIRCRAFT OVERFLIGHT
               While the City of Cerritos is not within the direct flight paths of any particular
               airport, aircraft fly over the City throughout the day and night because of the
               high number of airports in the region. Because of the large number of
               flights over the City, there is the risk of an air disaster resulting from a variety
               of aircraft situations. The major airports in the area include: Los Angeles
               International Airport, Long Beach Airport, John Wayne Airport, Ontario
               Airport and Burbank Airport. There are also a number of smaller private and
               military airports in the region that could affect the City.
               The City of Cerritos Multi-Hazard Functional Plan provides the policies and
               procedures addressing emergency response to air disasters.
               Aircraft flying over Cerritos are located in the Los Angeles Terminal Control
               Area (TCA). The TCA is airspace restricted to large, commercial airliners.
               Each TCA has an established maximum and minimum altitude in which a
               large aircraft must travel. Smaller aircraft desiring to transit the TCA may do
               so by obtaining Air Traffic Control clearance. The aircraft may then proceed
               to transit when traffic conditions permit. Aircraft departing from other than
               LAX, whose route of flight would penetrate the TCA, are required to give this
               information to Air Traffic Control on appropriate frequencies. Pilots
               operating small aircraft often rely on landmarks, rather than charts, to
               indicate their locations. If a pilot is unfamiliar with the geographical
SAFETY ELEMENT                                                                               SAF-30

landmarks within the Southern California Basin, he/she could inadvertently
enter the restricted TCA airspace. This misunderstanding could result in a
mid-air collision.
4.0 PLANNING FACTORS, GOALS AND POLICIES
FLOODING
Planning Factor
Flooding has the potential to significantly affect the safety of Cerritos
residents and severely impact the econom ic integrity of the City. Therefore,
it is important to ensure that facilities and programs are maintained and
operable to prevent excessive flood damage.
Goal         SAF-1      Protect Cerritos residents from potential flood
                        hazards, including dam inundation.
Policies     SAF-1.1    Manage development activity so that flooding
                        damage will be avoided.
             SAF-1.2    Minimize potential flood damage through the
                        identification     of       necessary      storm    drain
                        improvements.
             SAF-1.3    Provide an annual review of the Standardized
                        Emergency Management System Multi-Hazard
                        Functional Plan to ensure evacuation routes are
                        sufficient in the event of flooding.
             SAF-1.4    Continue the maintenance of flood control facilities
                        within Cerritos to ensure their efficient operation.
SEISMIC SAFETY
Planning Factor
The threat of earthquakes is a concern to all California residents. The City’s
location in an active seismic region underlies the importance of seismic
safety. Cerritos seeks to protect its residents from the effects of seismic
activity to reduce the potential for loss of life, injuries and property damage.
Employing strategies and specific actions toward reducing this potential is
of the utmost concern to the City of Cerritos.
SAFETY ELEMENT                                                                    SAF-31

               Goal         SAF-2      Protect Cerritos residents from potential harm due to
                                       a seismic event.
               Policies     SAF-2.1    Provide instructional materials, classes and other
                                       educational resources to ensure residents and the
                                       day-time population are knowledgeable of the risks
                                       and methods to reduce such risks, as well as involve
                                       the residents and community groups in the City’s
                                       annual emergency preparedness event.
                            SAF-2.2    Ensure building code standards are enforced and
                                       maintained so that that new development shall be
                                       located, designed and operated to reduce the
                                       effects of a seismic event.
                            SAF-2.3    Identify and correct potential areas of deficiencies in
                                       the level of safety present in existing structures and
                                       facilities.
               TOXIC AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
               Planning Factor
               Cerritos is aware hazardous waste is produced as the by-product of a
               variety of industrial activities and is present in many common household
               products. The potential threat to the community by these hazards must be
               addressed through precautionary actions and contingency plans.
               Goal         SAF-3      Minimize the threat of life and property associated
                                       with the transport, use, storage and disposal of toxic
                                       and/or hazardous materials.
               Policies     SAF-3.1    Encourage the proper disposal of household
                                       hazardous waste through the dissemination of
                                       information through educational and outreach
                                       activities.
                            SAF-3.2    Monitor facilities or businesses that utilize, store or

CHAPTER 7
CONSERVATION ELEMENT
1.0    INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the Conservation Element is to provide direction regarding
the conservation, development and utilization of natural resources. It serves
as a guide for the City of Cerritos, its residents and businesses to
understand what natural or other resources exist in the City, how
development impacts these resources and what methods should be
employed to maintain, preserve or conserve these resources. The
Conservation Element will look at the following resources: water, energy,
solid waste, biological and cultural/historical.
2.0 AUTHORITY FOR THE ELEMENT
The State of California Government Code Section 65302(d) requires that a
General Plan include:
       “..a conservation element for the conservation, development,
       and utilization of natural resources including water and its
       hydraulic force, forests, soils, rivers and other waters,
       harbors, fisheries, wildlife, minerals and other natural
       resources.
       The conservation element may also cover:                (1) the
       reclamation of land and waters; (2) prevention and control of
       the pollution of streams and other waters; (3) regulation of the
       use of land in stream channels and other areas required for
       the accomplishment of the conservation plan; (4) prevention,
       control and correction of the erosion of soils, beaches and
       shores; (5) protection of watersheds; (6) the location, quantity
       and quality of the rock, sand and gravel resources; and (7)
       flood control.”

                     3.0 SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
                     The following section provides an inventory of conservation resources in the
                     City of Cerritos, including water resources, biological resources, energy
                     resources, solid waste, land resources and cultural/historical resources.
                     3.1     WATER RESOURCES
                     3.1.1   WATER SUPPLY AND SOURCES
                     The City of Cerritos receives its water from two primary water sources – the
                     Central Basin Municipal Water District (CBMWD) and local groundwater.
                     The City receives its water from the CBMWD via Service Connection CEN.
                     B-46, which is located near the intersection of Woodruff Avenue and South
                     Street. In 2000, the City of Cerritos received approximately 1.07 billion
                     gallons, or 26.1 percent of its total water supply from the CBMWD, which is
                     a member agency of The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California
                     (MWD). MWD water is transported from the Colorado River and State Water
                     Project in northern California.
                     Water distribution to consumers within the City of Cerritos is distributed
                     through a City-owned system of pipes, ranging in size from six inches to 30
                     inches in diameter. Approximately 177 miles of pipe supply water to
                     approximately 16,000 homes, businesses and industrial sites.
                     The water system also utilizes one 12-million gallon tank at the Reservoir Hill
                     site and two six-million gallon tanks at the C-2 Corporate Yard Site.
                     3.1.2   LOCAL GROUNDWATER
                     Local groundwater resources originate from three deep wells within the City
                     of Cerritos. These wells are drilled to a depth of between 700 and 1,000
                     feet. The C-1 well is located in the area of Bloomfield Avenue and Artesia
                     Boulevard. The C-2 well is located at the City’s Corporate Yard at 166th
                     Street and Marquardt Avenue and the C-4 well is located in the area of
                     Reservoir Hill Park at Studebaker Road and 166 th Street. These three
                     groundwater sources supplied approximately 3.04 billion gallons, or 73.9
                     percent of the City’s total water supply in 2000.
                     The pumping station at the C-4 well site is capable of delivering
                     approximately 18,000 gallons per minute. The C-2 pumping station is
                     capable of delivering approximately 17,000 gallons per minute.
                     The City of Cerritos recently expanded its municipal water supply system
                     with the addition of a new water well. While the C-5 well is still under
                     construction, when complete it will have an operational capacity of 2,500 to
CONSERVATION ELEMENT                                                                         CON-2

3,500 gallons per minute. The City’s water system uses a combination of
electrical and natural gas power to ensure uninterrupted water service. The
location of the City’s water wells is shown on Exhibit CON-1, Water Sources.
The operational capacity of the four wells is shown in Table CON-1, Existing
Groundwater Resources.

3.1.3     SURFACE WATER
No naturally occurring permanent surface water features exist within the City
of Cerritos. A number of man-made lakes are located within the City’s
recreational facilities, at Cerritos Regional Park, Heritage Park and Iron-
Wood Nine Golf Course. In addition, existing storm drain facilities carry
water during wet weather events.
3.1.4     RECYCLED WATER
The City of Cerritos has made significant efforts to conserve water. The
City’s existing recycled water distribution system saves approximately 815
million gallons of potable water each year.
In efforts to reduce potable water consumption, the City of Cerritos irrigates
more than 200 acres of City-owned property, which includes most parks,
parkways and medians with recycled water. The wastewater originates
from industries, businesses and homes and is treated by a tertiary (three-
stage) process by the County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County
before being used for irrigation.
The City of Cerritos purchases its recycled water from the Los Coyotes
Water Reclamation Plant, located west of the I-605 freeway and north of the
SR-91 freeway, adjacent to the Iron-Wood Nine Golf Course. The City of
Cerritos has constructed a 15,000 gallon per minute pump station on the
County Sanitation District’s property, along with a recycled water distribution
system that distributes recycled water through 25 miles of water lines

In addition, recycled water is also used for landscape irrigation at schools,
Cerritos Community College, a county park, cemetery, freeway landscaping
and privately-owned landscape areas, such as the Cerritos Towne Center
and commercial nurseries located in the City. The City-owned Iron-Wood
Golf Course was the first facility in the City to utilize recycled water for
irrigation purposes.
To encourage homeowners in the City to reduce the use of potable water
for irrigation purposes, the City has established a 2,500 square-foot water
conservation and demonstration garden at Cerritos Park East. Located in
the southeast section of the park along Ironbark Drive, the garden features
nearly 40 varieties of drought-tolerant trees, ground cover and shrubs.
3.2      ENERGY RESOURCES
3.2.1    ELECTRICITY AND POWER
Southern California Edison (SCE) is the primary supplier of electricity for the
City of Cerritos. SCE has a total service area of over 50,000 square miles.
The City of Cerritos represents a very small share of the total energy market.
The State of California deregulated the energy generation market in early
1998. Deregulation allowed other providers the opportunity to supply
electricity to the consumer. Since this time, the State has experienced
periods of insufficient power generation, rapid increases in wholesale
energy costs and increased costs to consumers. As a result, the State has
imposed rolling blackouts across the State that are expected to continue
until power supplies can be increased. Until the power crisis is resolved,
the City of Cerritos will continue to promote methods of conservation and
investigate ways to ensure an adequate and reliable energy source for its
residents.
3.2.2    NATURAL GAS
The Southern California Gas Company supplies natural gas to 18 million
consumers, for over 23,000 square miles of Southern California, including
the City of Cerritos.
Southern California Gas Company has the ability to serve existing and
future residents in Cerritos, as indicated in this General Plan.

                     3.3     WASTE MANAGEMENT
                     3.3.1   SOLID WASTE
                     Solid waste collection and recycling in the City of Cerritos is provided by a
                     private contractor, CalMet Services, Inc. CalMet trucks pick up trash from
                     residents, businesses and industrial customers weekly. The refuse is first
                     hauled to a Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) in the City of Downey, where
                     recyclable items are pulled from the waste stream.
                     The Cerritos recycling program was implemented on June 1, 1995 in
                     response to Assembly Bill 939, the California Integrated Waste
                     Management Act. Under this law, all California cities are required to divert
                     25 percent of their waste stream from landfill by 1995 and 50 percent by the
                     year 2000. Cerritos is succeeding in these goals. Each year, the MRF
                     system diverts more that 15,000 tons of Cerritos trash from landfills.
                     3.3.2 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
                     The City of Cerritos understands stormwater runoff is a significant
                     contributor to local and regional pollution. Urban stormwater runoff is the
                     largest source of unregulated pollution to the waterway and coastal areas of
                     the United States. Stormwater can be contaminated with a variety of
                     pollutants that contribute to increased health risks and environmental
                     damage.
                     The City of Cerritos seeks to protect and promote the health, safety and
                     welfare of its citizens by controlling non-stormwater discharges to the
                     stormwater conveyance system. The City of Cerritos is required by the
                     Clean Water Act and other federal, state and regional regulations to control
                     the discharge of pollutants to the storm drain system, including the
                     discharge of pollutants from construction sites and areas of new
                     development or significant redevelopment.
                     FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS
                     Local stormwater pollution control measures are implemented pursuant to
                     the Clean Water Act, Federal Water Quality Control Act and National
                     Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
                     Clean Water Act
                     The Clean Water Act prohibits any person from discharging pollutants
                     through a “point source” into a “water of the United States” unless they
                     have an NPDES permit. NPDES permits regulate the discharges from
                     publicly owned facilities. The NPDES program also regulates wet weather
CONSERVATION ELEMENT                                                                         CON-8

discharges such as stormwater discharges from industrial activities, and
municipal stormwater discharges including, urban stormwater runoff,
combined sewer overflows and storm sewer overflows.
The Clean Water Act amendments of 1987 established a framework for
regulating stormwater discharges from municipal, industrial and
construction activities under the NPDES program. The primary objectives of
the municipal stormwater program requirements are to effectively prohibit
non-stormwater discharges and reduce the discharge of pollutants from
stormwater conveyance systems to the maximum extent practicable (MEP),
including management practices, control techniques and system, design
engineering method and such other provisions that the U.S. EPA or the
California State Water Resources Control Board deem appropriate for the
control of such pollutants.
National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Stormwater Program
Mandated by Congress under the Clean Water Act, the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Stormwater Program is a
comprehensive two-phased national program for addressing the non-
agricultural sources of stormwater discharges adversely affecting the quality
of the nation’s waters. The Program uses the NPDES permitting
mechanism to require the implementation of control and monitoring
measures designed to prevent harmful pollutants from being washed into
local water bodies by stormwater runoff.
The NPDES program requires the owner or operator of any facility, or any
person responsible for any activity that discharges waste into the surface
waters of the U.S. to obtain a NPDES permit from the Regional Water
Quality Control Board, as mandated by the Clean Water Act.
STATE AND REGIONAL PROGRAMS
The Clean Water Act provides that states are authorized to operate their
own NPDES programs provided such programs meet minimum federal
requirements. The municipal storm water National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit is issued by the Los Angeles Regional Water
Quality Control Board. The City of Cerritos currently operates under Permit
No. CAS004001, Order No. 01-182. The Permit was adopted on December
31, 2001 and expires on December 31, 2006.
The objective of Order No. 01-182 is to protect the beneficial uses of
receiving waters in Los Angeles County. To meet this objective, the Order
requires that the Los Angeles Countywide Storm Water Quality
Management Plan (SQMP) specify Best Management Practices (BMPs) that
will be implemented to reduce the discharge of pollutants in storm water to
the MEP. Further, Permittees are to assure that storm water discharges
CONSERVATION ELEMENT                                                          CON-9

                     from the MS4 shall neither cause nor contribute to the exceedance of water
                     quality, standards and objectives nor create conditions of nuisance in the
                     receiving waters, and that the discharge of non-storm water to the MS4 has
                     been effectively prohibited.
                     Permit No. CAS004001 requires the implementation of a Storm Water
                     Quality Management Program (SQMP), which provides specific guidelines
                     to control, reduce and monitor discharges of waste to storm drain systems.
                     The emphasis of the SQMP is pollution prevention through education,
                     public outreach, planning and implementation as source control BMPs first
                     and structural and treatment control BMPs second.
                     Standard Urban Storm Water Mitigation Plan (SUSMP)
                     The Standard Urban Stormwater Mitigation Plan (SUSMP) was developed
                     as part of the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board’s
                     Municipal Stormwater Program. The SUSMP addresses stormwater
                     pollution from certain types of new development and redevelopment. The
                     SUSMP specifies the minimum required Best Management Practices
                     (BMPs) that must be used for a designated project. Additional BMPs may
                     be required on certain targeted categories of projects based on these
                     regulations at the discretion of the City of Cerritos. Applicable project
                     applicants are required to incorporate appropriate SUSMP requirements
                     into their development plans.
                     CITY OF CERRITOS PROGRAMS
                     The City of Cerritos provides local implementation of the Federal, State and
                     Regional stormwater regulations through the establishment of ordinances,
                     policies and programs.
                     Stormwater and Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention Controls Ordinance
                     The Stormwater and Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention Controls Ordinance
                     (Ord. 777) provides specific local regulations related to stormwater pollution
                     prevention. The intent of the ordinance is to protect the health, safety and
                     general welfare of the citizens of the City through regulating non-stormwater
                     discharge to the storm drain system; providing for the control of spillage,
                     dumping or disposal of materials into the storm drain system; and reducing
                     pollutants in stormwater and urban runoff to the maximum extent
                     practicable.
                     Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP)
                     The City of Cerritos requires a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan
                     (SWPPP) be completed prior to any construction activity on projects that will

disturb more than two acres of soil. SWPPP’s are operator/owner-prepared
plans that identify BMP’s for implementation and monitor the effectiveness
of the BMPs. The SWPPP applies to all on-site construction activities and
must identify the source control and/or treatment control practices (BMP’s)
that would significantly reduce, avoid or mitigate runoff pollutants to the
“maximum extent practicable.”
PUBLIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH
Educating the public about stormwater pollution prevention contributes to
the effectiveness of local and regional stormwater management programs.
The County of Los Angeles and the City of Cerritos have implemented
public information and outreach programs that assist residents and
businesses to understand the current stormwater problem and
implementation strategies that reduce stormwater pollution.
Consistent with Federal requirements, the County of Los Angeles has
developed a five-year countywide stormwater public education strategy.
This strategy focuses on residents, school children, businesses and public
employees and includes a full range of outreach tools and methods to
educate and train these audiences about stormwater pollution management
and prevention. The City of Cerritos contributes financially to this program.
In addition, the City of Cerritos has implemented a local public education
and outreach effort. This public outreach and education effort promotes
public awareness of stormwater pollution thorough distribution of literature
and other outreach materials so that residents are informed of ways to
prevent stormwater pollution through safe housekeeping practices.
3.3.3 HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE
Cerritos residents can safely dispose of used motor oil, cleaners with acids
or lye, paint, batteries, pesticides, weed killer and chemicals from hobby
and art projects at a Household Hazardous Waste Roundup.                    In
cooperation with the City of Cerritos, the Los Angeles County Department of
Public Works plans regular collection of household hazardous waste. In
previous years, more than 500 Cerritos residents have appropriately
disposed of more than 53,000 pounds of toxic materials.
3.3.4 USED OIL COLLECTION
The City of Cerritos has been awarded a three-year $60,000 grant from the
California Integrated Waste Management Board to educate residents about
used motor oil recycling. The funds will be used for a public outreach and
educational campaign, including printed materials, movie screen
advertisements and other means of public outreach.
CONSERVATION ELEMENT                                                           CON-11

                     Used motor oil can be disposed of, free of charge, at two locations within
                     the City of Cerritos:
                          o Cerritos Towne Center Chevron, 17255 Bloomfield Avenue; and
                          o Firestone Auto Square, 11524 South Street.
                     3.4      BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
                     Biological resources include natural and altered biotic habitats (vegetative
                     communities and corresponding wildlife habitat), as well as associated flora
                     and fauna.
                     The City of Cerritos is almost entirely urbanized and landscaped with mostly
                     non-native species. No rare or endangered plant or animal species have
                     been identified within the City. The City’s most significant plant resources
                     are its ornamentals. The extensive urban landscaping that occurs within the
                     City provides habitat for small animals. However, the urbanized nature of
                     the City provides a less than ideal habitat.
                     3.5      COMMUNITY FOREST
                     The urbanized, built out nature of the City of Cerritos limits the existence of
                     naturally occurring native tree stands. In an effort to capture the aesthetic
                     quality of a “community forest,” the City of Cerritos has made significant
                     efforts in planting tree resources. The City’s Tree Division has coordinated
                     the planting of nearly 30,000 trees within the City. The City plants, or
                     coordinates with developers to plant, an average of 250 new and
                     replacement trees per year in an effort to preserve and enhance the park-
                     like atmosphere.
                     The City of Cerritos has adopted a Tree Ordinance (Chapter 9.75) to ensure
                     compliance with the City’s objective of creating and maintaining a
                     community forest. The Ordinance provides specific regulations, which
                     strive to preserve and enhance the existing tree resources within the City. To
                     exemplify this, the City was named a “Tree City USA” by the National Arbor
                     Day Foundation. This designation was granted to the City of Cerritos
                     through a proven record of tree care, planting and conservation.
                     The City of Cerritos has begun utilizing the City’s GIS mapping capabilities
                     to inventory existing street trees. The development of this inventory will
                     assist the City in identifying important information regarding the age, type,
                     and conditions of the various species.

3.6      CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL RESOURCES
The City of Cerritos has a rich and diverse history. This history is comprised
of buildings, trees, artifacts of historical significance, cultural traditions and
community memories. The City takes pride in its heritage and seeks to
preserve its historic resources and the memories they evoke. The City has
created a special section dedicated to the history of Cerritos in the Cerritos
Public Library. This collection of books, documents, photographs and other
resources provides a substantial documentation of Cerritos’ past.
4.0 PLANNING FACTORS, GOALS AND POLICIES
WATER RESOURCES
Planning Factor
The City of Cerritos recognizes that water is a limited resource requiring
conservation. Therefore, protection and conservation of the City’s water
resources should be a factor in all land use decisions.
Goal        CON-1        Protect and conserve the City of Cerritos’ existing and
                         future water resources.
Policies    CON-1.1      Continue to expand the utilization of recycled water
                         for irrigation purposes and other appropriate uses.
            CON-1.2      Enhance outreach activities to educate residents on
                         the importance of water conservation (e.g., promote
                         use of drought tolerant plant material in both
                         residential and commercial applications).
            CON-1.3      Reduce the demand for non-local water resources
                         through the utilization of local groundwater
                         resources.
            CON-1.4      Establish and implement water conservation
                         methods for all city-maintained facilities in order to
                         provide a demonstrable example of conservation
                         techniques.
CONSERVATION ELEMENT                                                               CON-13

                     ENERGY
                     Planning Factor
                     Energy issues have become a local and statewide concern in recent years.
                     The ability of the state’s energy producers to supply the City of Cerritos with
                     a sufficient and reliable energy source can have significant impacts on
                     safety and economic integrity. Therefore, the City must investigate ways to
                     generate and conserve our energy resources so that it contributes to
                     reductions in demand locally and statewide.
                     Goal         CON-2       Conserve and generate energy resources through the
                                              use of available technology and conservation
                                              practices.
                     Policies     CON-2.1     Pursue new opportunities to enhance the provision
                                              of safe, reliable and affordable energy to Cerritos
                                              residents, businesses, public facilities, institutional
                                              uses, and educational facilities.
                                  CON-2.2     Apply applicable government energy standards to all
                                              new development.
                                  CON-2.3     Establish a standardized menu of incentives for
                                              future development activity, so that conservation
                                              methods are an integral part of new development.
                                  CON-2.4     Strive to incorporate energy conservation methods
                                              into all city facilities to set an example for the
                                              community.
                     SOLID WASTE
                     Planning Factor
                     The City of Cerritos understands that the generation of solid waste impacts
                     local landfills. The limited capacities of our region’s landfills requires a
                     universal effort by all communities. Therefore, the City must continue its
                     efforts in source reduction of solid wastes and recycling.
                     Goal         CON-3       Establish programs and policies to reduce the
                                              generation of solid waste.
CONSERVATION ELEMENT                                                                          CON-14

Policies    CON-3.1      Continue to fulfill requirements as set forth in
                         California Integrated Waste Management Act for the
                         diversion of solid waste within the City.
            CON-3.2      Continue to provide education and outreach to
                         residents and businesses to contribute to the
                         reduction, recycling and disposal of solid wastes.
            CON-3.3      Continue to expand recycling efforts.
WASTEWATER
Planning Factor
The City of Cerritos understands that wastewater, if not properly conveyed,
can have dire consequences to the health of residents and the health of the
environment. Not only does wastewater have effects on the local
environment, it can also affect environments downstream.
Goal        CON-4        Ensure proper conveyance and disposal of wastewater
                         within the City of Cerritos.
Policies    CON-4.1      Ensure major collection and trunk lines and lift
                         stations within the City are adequately maintained
                         through continued monitoring and maintenance.
            CON-4.2      Ensure new development provides an analysis of
                         potential impacts to the existing conveyance system.
STORMWATER POLLUTION
Planning Factor
Stormwater resulting from periods of wet weather can influence the quality
of the environment. Not only does polluted stormwater flow and non-
stormwater flow cause potential safety concerns, it also can increase the
level of pollutants in the local and regional environment. Periods of rapid
runoff can carry pollutants into the existing drainage system, resulting in
high concentrations of pollutants in the local and downstream environment.
The City of Cerritos is authorized to discharge stormwater, and in some
instances, non-storm water into the storm drain system under a National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.
CONSERVATION ELEMENT                                                          CON-15

                                             stormwater.
                                 CON-5.5     Continue to implement development planning
                                             requirements specified in the City’s municipal
                                             NPDES permit, including, to the maximum extent
                                             practicable, watershed protection measures.
                     Related Goals and Policies: Refer to Goal OSR-7 and its related policy,
                     which address the benefits that open space provide related to stormwater

CULTURAL AND HISTORIC RESOURCES
Planning Factor
The City of Cerritos values its history. The historic and cultural resources
and the memories they evoke are unique to the City and should be
documented, preserved and made available to all residents of Cerritos.

CHAPTER 8
OPEN SPACE/
RECREATION ELEMENT
1.0       INTRODUCTION
The Open Space and Recreation Element outlines strategies and actions to
preserve and enhance open space areas in the City and meet the
recreational needs of its residents. Open space and recreational resources
in the City of Cerritos includes neighborhood, community and regional
parks, as well as community centers, trails, golf courses, aquatic facilities,
open space easements and other publicly accessible outdoor and indoor
facilities.
2.0 AUTHORITY FOR THE ELEMENT
The State of California Government Code Section 65302(e) requires that a
General Plan “include an open space element.” Recreation Elements are an
optional element of the General Plan, pursuant to Section 65303 of the
Government Code. Other relevant sections of the Government Code that
are applicable to the Open Space and Recreation Element include Sections
65560, 65562, 65563, 65564, 65566 and 65567, as well as Public
Resources Code Section 5076, which allows cities to consider the demands
for trail-oriented recreational use. In addition, Government Code Section
66477, more commonly referred to as the Quimby Act, allows cities to
adopt ordinances addressing park land and/or fees for residential
subdivisions.
The Open Space Element must contain goals and policies concerned with
managing all open space areas, including undeveloped lands and outdoor
recreation areas. Specifically, the Open Space Element includes open
space that is left undeveloped for public health and safety reasons, and
open space that is used for the preservation of natural resources, for the
managed production of resources and for outdoor recreation.
OPEN SPACE/RECREATION ELEMENT                                                  OSR-1

                         3.0 SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
                         3.1     EXISTING OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION FACILITIES
                         The City of Cerritos’ open space and recreation resources include parks,
                         schools, community facilities and privately owned recreational facilities. The
                         combination of these resources constitute the City of Cerritos’ open space
                         and recreational opportunities. The City’s open space/recreational
                         resources can be categorized into the following three areas:
                              o Open Space for Outdoor Recreation;

                         3.1.1   OPEN SPACE FOR OUTDOOR RECREATION
                         The parks, open space and other recreational opportunities within Cerritos
                         contribute to the high-quality of life residents enjoy. The provision of a
                         variety of public parks and the availability of small-scale residential,
                         industrial and commercial open space/recreation areas is a contributing
                         factor to the well-being and health of Cerritos residents.
                         Open Space for outdoor recreation in Cerritos includes:
                              o  Mini-Parks;
                              o  Neighborhood Parks;
                              o  Community Parks;
                              o  Regional Parks;
                              o  Sports Facilities (golf courses, ball fields, aquatics, skate park, etc.);
                              o  Railways and Bikeways; and
                              o  Greenbelts.
                         Table OSR-1, City of Cerritos Park and Recreation Inventory, provides a
                         summary of existing Park and Recreation resources within the City of
                         Cerritos. Exhibit OSR-1, Open Space and Recreational Facilities, shows the
                         location of these resources.
                         3.1.2   OPEN SPACE FOR “DAY RESIDENTS”
                         Cerritos enjoys an extensive employment base. Successful growth in the
                         office, industrial and retail sectors has increased the number of “Day
                         Residents” – those who reside in Cerritos during business hours. The
                         increased “day resident” population increases demand for additional viable
                         public open space resources. This may include areas for lunch hours,
                         breaks, recreational needs or just quiet contemplation and reflection.

Urban open spaces utilized by “day residents” requires deliberate thought
in project development and urban design.
3.1.3     OPEN SPACE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY
As Cerritos is a built out community with a generally urbanized character, a
portion of the open space inventory is utilized for the protection of public
health and/or public safety. Certain open space areas in Cerritos provide for
the protection from potentially harmful natural and man-made hazards.
Open space adjacent to overhead electrical wires, pipelines, or setbacks
from drainage channels or retention basins are examples of this type of
open space.
The City of Cerritos has also utilized these open spaces for multiple
purposes. For example, Jacob, Gridley, Liberty and El Rancho Verde Parks
are linear parks, which also serve as open space buffers from residential
and public school uses. Exhibit OSR-2, Open Space for Public Health and
Safety, provides an overview of open resources for public health and safety.
3.1.4     CERRITOS RECREATIONAL FACILITIES
The City of Cerritos has a number of facilities that contribute to the City’s
recreational resources. These facilities include community centers, sports
facilities, community gymnasiums, a golf course, swimming facilities, fitness
centers and a senior center. It should be noted the majority of these
facilities are located within existing park and recreational facilities (refer to
Exhibit OSR-1).
3.1.5     MAINTENANCE OF NON-CITY PARKS
The City of Cerritos provides regular maintenance of two parks that are not
within the City limits. As shown in Table OSR-2, Parks Maintained by City of
Cerritos, these facilities contribute to the recreational resources of Cerritos
residents, but may not be applied towards the Quimby target acreage (refer
to page OSR-16 for a discussion of the Quimby Act).

                         3.1.6     CERRITOS RECREATIONAL PROGRAMS
                         The City of Cerritos has a number of recreational programs that supplement
                         the City’s overall recreation resources. The City coordinates with a variety
                         of community groups to provide these recreational programs to Cerritos
                         residents. Programs include sports activities, youth services, classes,
                         cultural arts and senior citizen/human services. The City’s relatively built out
                         conditions place additional importance on recreational programming to
                         meet the needs of its residents.
                         Community Facilities. Community-based facilities provide a location for the
                         majority of City-sponsored educational and recreational opportunities.
                         During the 1999-2000 fiscal year, the Recreation Services Division involved
                         more than 1,119,000 people in programs, use of facilities and sponsored
                         events.
                         Community Classes. Cerritos residents regularly take advantage of the nearly
                         900 non-aquatics, fee-based programs. During the 1999-2000 fiscal year,
                         approximately 10,100 residents participated in a wide range of class
                         offerings.
                         Community Organizations. The City of Cerritos Recreation Services Division
                         provides the facilities and other resources to facilitate the development of
                         community-based organizations. A total of 130 Community Organizations
                         utilized facilities in Cerritos during the 1999-2000 fiscal year.
                         After School Programs. The City of Cerritos enjoys a cooperative arrangement
                         with the ABC Unified School District to provide drop -in after school and
                         summer recreational programs.
                         Under the supervision of the City’s Special Activities Department, Frontier
                         Park, Sunshine Park, Friendship Park and Westgate Park provided children
                         with activities such as sports, crafts, table games and a monthly excursion
                         to local sites, including the Cerritos Olympic Swim and Fitness Center, and
                         El Dorado Nature Center. In addition, the City also cooperates with ABC
                         Unified School District to offer the Carmenita Recreation Academic Study
                         Hall (C.R.A.S.H.) for Middle School students from September through June.
                         The program is intended to provide middle school students with viable
                         alternatives for after-school activities. The C.R.A.S.H. program provides
                         students with games, arts and crafts and excursions to local recreational
                         facilities.

                         4.0 OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION PLAN
                         The Open Space and Recreation Plan for the City of Cerritos details how the

                         City’s residents. This section of the Open Space and Recreation Element

                         agencies and community groups to provide citywide recreation
                         opportunities. The City will enhance its overall open space and recreational
                         to the satisfaction of Cerritos residents.

                         The State of California Planning and Zoning Law (Government Code
                         Sections 65000 through 66037) and The Quimby Act1 (Government Code
                                     1
                                       The Quimby Act was established by the California legislature in 1965 to provide
                         parks for the growing communities in the State. The Act only allows cities and counties to
                         establish ordinances requiring new residential subdivisions to provide park/recreation land
                         and/or in-lieu fees as well as specifying acceptable uses and expenditures of such funds.

OPEN SPACE/RECREATION ELEMENT                                OSR-18
Section 66477) indicate that the legislative body of a municipality or county
may, by ordinance, require the dedication of land, the payment of fees in
lieu thereof, or a combination of both for park recreational purposes as a
condition to the approval for a final tract map or parcel map. In cases
where such dedications or fees have not been obtained for particular lots
through a map, they may be imposed at the time that building permits are
issued.
Among other requirements, the following conditions must be met:
    o The ordinance must include definite standards for determining the
         proportion of a subdivision to be dedicated and the amount of any
         fee to be paid in lieu thereof; and
    o The legislative body has an adopted General Plan containing a
         Recreation Element, and any proposed park and recreational
         facilities are in accordance with definite principles and standards
         contained therein.
The City may also obtain parkland through the methods outlined below.
Area Development Plans. Acting as a Specific Plan, Area Development Plans
(ADP) guide, coordinate and regulate the development of property within a
given area. These areas have been found and declared to be in some
degree different and unique in comparison with other areas of the City due
to differences in location; accessibility; natural characteristics of the land;
patterns of the land ownership; age and conditions of improvements;
characteristics and desires of occupants and other factors. There were 12
ADPs within the City as of February 2003.
Assessment Districts. California state law provides for the establishment of
special assessment districts to provide public facilities. Certain types of
these districts, mello-roos, can be used to develop and maintain public
parks in newly developing areas based upon a vote of current land owners.
Developer Land Dedications and Exactions. The City, at its discretion, may require
dedication of land and/or payment of fees for the purpose of providing and
preserving open space and recreational facilities and improvements in
developing areas as approved in Chapter 17.40 of the Municipal Code.
The City of Cerritos does not have an adopted park standard. However, the
City is providing 3.2 acres per 1,000 residents based upon the 2000
Census. Table OSR-4, City of Cerritos Park Development Guidelines,
provides an overview of guidelines for park facilities within the City.

                         This Element contains measures to ensure that adequate recreational
                         opportunities are provided for Cerritos residents. The City of Cerritos has
                         approximately 228 acres of parks, which include community, neighborhood
                         and regional parks.
                         In conformance with government statutes, this Element includes standards

4.3     URBAN OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION PROGRAMS
Cerritos will continue to expand and enhance its recreational programs and
services to serve the City’s population. Actions that will continue the City’s
high level of recreational services for the Cerritos Community include:
     o Develop cooperative arrangements with adjacent jurisdictions and
        park departments for providing a coordinated set of recreational
        programs that provide a broader range of recreational programs
        than are already available.
     o Continue to employ cooperative agreements with the ABC Unified
        School District to provide additional recreational resources.
     o Continue to coordinate with various civic and private groups to
        provide an overall recreation program that is well coordinated and
        responsive to the needs of the community.
4.4     ASSESSMENT OF RECREATION FACILITY NEEDS
The City conducted a Public Opinion Survey of its residents in July 1999.
The survey provided extensive analysis of public opinion and needs related
to services provided to the community. A substantial component of the
study involved assessing residents’ opinions and behavior with respect to
recreational activities, programs and facilities in the City of Cerritos. The
following themes were apparent in the survey:
     o Residents found youth-related recreational programs as the most
        important aspect of recreational needs.
     o Residents indicated after-school recreation and teen recreation
        activities are services in which the City has the greatest opportunity
        and need for improvement.
     o Utilization of recreational facilities and services was relatively high.
Therefore, the City of Cerritos acknowledges and places a high priority in
enhancing the programs and activities residents are most satisfied with.
4.5     VACANT LAND FOR PARKLAND DEVELOPMENT
Future population growth in Cerritos will require the utilization of existing
vacant land resources as a means to provide additional open space and
recreational resources.
OPEN SPACE/RECREATION ELEMENT                                                   OSR-21

                         The City has identified vacant parcels, totaling 26.62 acres, as shown in
                         Exhibit LU-1, Vacant and Underutilized Land and in Table LU-2, Summary of
                         Vacant and Underutilized Land, in the Land Use Element. Meeting future
                         park and recreation needs of the community will require additional analysis
                         of these parcels to determine if their size, location and other land use and
                         environmental constraints make them suitable for parkland.
                         4.6      RECREATION PROGRAMMING NEEDS
                         The City of Cerritos seeks to enhance “Family Enrichment” as the theme for
                         recreational activities throughout the City. Family-oriented programs such
                         as “mommy & me,” tap, and a family choir are examples of the type of
                         activities the City would like to continue and expand.
                         The City provides and seeks to expand family-oriented evening
                         entertainment, such as concerts in the park and outdoor movies.
                         In keeping with the “Family Enrichment” theme, the City seeks to revolve its
                         recreational programs around the following:
                              o   Teens;
                              o   Families;
                              o   Cultural/Performing Arts; and
                              o   Seniors.
                         5.0 PLANNING FACTORS, GOALS AND POLICIES
                         OPEN SPACE IS A VALUABLE RESOURCE
                         Planning Factor
                         Open space is a resource that comes in many forms. The variety of open
                         space in the City is a valuable resource.
                         Goal         OSR-1       Preserve and enhance open space resources in the
                                                  City to maintain and promote the high-quality of life

LIMITED RESOURCES FOR NEW OPEN SPACE AND RECREATIONAL
FACILITIES OR PROGRAMS
Planning Factor
The City of Cerritos is a built out community. The availability of vacant land
resources for open space and recreational resources is severely limited.
Therefore, the provision of future open space and recreation amenities must
take into account this limited supply of land.
Goal        OSR-2        Provide park and recreation facilities and programs
                         for all those who live and work in the City of Cerritos.
Policies    OSR-2.1      Continue to exceed the State’s and the City’s park
                         guideline of three acres per 1,000 residents.
            OSR-2.2      Carefully consider geographic locations, hours of
                         operation and other factors influencing access when
                         evaluating future park and facility locations.
            OSR-2.3      Enhance access to and utilization of recreational
                         facilities by those with disabilities.
            OSR-2.4      Ensure parks and recreational facilities are
                         developed with amenities that are appropriate to
                         persons of all ages.
Goal        OSR-3        Continue to expand and improve              recreational
                         resources within existing facilities.
Policies    OSR-3.1      Strive to update and modernize existing recreational
                         and park facilities through the provision of updated
                         equipment and facilities.
OPEN SPACE/RECREATION ELEMENT                                                     OSR-23

                                     OSR-3.2     Continuously monitor residents’ needs so that future
                                                 development of open space and recreational
                                                 resources reflect the desires of Cerritos residents.
                         Goal        OSR-4       Provide for a broad range of recreational facilities.
                         Policies    OSR-4.1     Ensure recreational resources provide for a variety of
                                                 recreational needs so that the widest range of
                                                 Cerritos residents utilize these facilities.

                         MAINTAIN OPEN SPACE IN THE CITY
                         Planning Factor
                         Open space in Cerritos is a valuable and scarce resource. Open space not
                         only serves as a place for recreation, it also provides buffers from potential
                         hazards, enhances the aesthetic quality of the environment and provides

RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES
Planning Factor
Cerritos is proud of the range of recreational opportunities available to its
residents. Recreational programs provide a safe environment for children,
enhance family-oriented activities and promote the health of Cerritos
residents. Cerritos strives to continue providing its residents with the
highest quality of recreational opportunities.
Goal        OSR-7        Provide a high level of community outreach to inform
                         residents of the variety of recreational programs
                         available.
Policies    OSR-7.1      Ensure all residents of Cerritos are aware of
                         recreational opportunities through the regular
                         distribution of information about programs.
            OSR-7.2      Continually strive to better inform the community of
                         existing and future recreational programs by
                         improving and expanding the methods of
                         communication (i.e., City’s website, reader boards,
                         newsletters, etc.).
STORMWATER BENEFITS FROM OPEN SPACE
Planning Factor
The City of Cerritos recognizes that open space is beneficial to the
environment. In general, storm water and non-storm water runoff from
open-space is absorbed into pervious surfaces, thereby reducing the
amount of runoff originating in the City and flowing into the storm drain
system.
Goal        OSR-8:       Preserve existing open spaces and their pervious
                         surfaces.
Policies    OSR-8.1       Strive to maintain the current ratio of pervious
                          surfaces within the City’s open space.
Related Goals and Policies: Refer to Goal CON-5 and its associated
policies, which address stormwater pollution.

CHAPTER 9
AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
1.0      INTRODUCTION
The Air Quality Element is intended to protect the public’s health and
welfare by implementing measures that allow the South Coast Air Basin to
attain Federal and State air quality standards. To achieve this goal, the
Element sets forth a number of programs to reduce current pollution
emissions and to require new development to include measures to comply
with air quality standards. In addition, this Element contains provisions to
address new air quality requirements.
2.0 AUTHORITY FOR THE ELEMENT
The State of California Government Code Section 65302(d), which provides
the statutory requirements for the Conservation Element, also serves as the
applicable Government Code section for the Air Quality Element. Further
guidance is provided in the 1998 General Plan Guidelines regarding the
assessment of air quality impacts in General Plans.1 Other relevant
sections of the Government Code that are applicable to the Air Quality
Element include Section 65303, which allows cities to include any other
element or address any other subjects that may relate to the physical
development of the city.
3.0 SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
Air quality conditions in Cerritos are influenced by many factors, including
the topography, climate and the number and type of pollution producers.
This section examines these issues and historical pollution levels in the
community, as compared to State and Federal air quality standards.
3.1      CLIMATE
Cerritos is located within the South Coast Air Basin. This Basin is a 6,600
square mile area that includes all of Orange County and the non-desert
         1

AIR QUALITY ELEMENT                                                                      AQ-1

                    portions of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The South
                    Coast Air Basin is topographically bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the
                    west with the San Gabriel, San Bernardino and San Jacinto mountains to
                    the north and east.
                    The topography and climate of southern California combine to make the
                    South Coast Air Basin an area of air pollution potential. During the summer
                    months, a warm air mass frequently descends over the cool, moist marine
                    layer produced by the interaction between the ocean's surface and the
                    lowest layer of the atmosphere. The warm upper layer forms a cap over the
                    cool marine layer and prevents pollutants from dispersing upward and
                    allows pollutants to accumulate within the lower layer. This situation is
                    called a temporary inversion. In addition, light winds during the summer
                    further limit ventilation.
                    Because of the low average wind speeds in the summer and a persistent
                    daytime temperature inversion, emissions of hydrocarbons and oxides of
                    nitrogen have an opportunity to combine with sunlight in a complex series
                    of reactions producing photochemical oxidant (smog). The smog potential
                    is increased in the basin, because the South Coast region experiences
                    more days of sunlight than any other major urban area except Phoenix,
                    Arizona.
                    However, the City of Cerritos is rarely affected by the same heat and smog
                    conditions as the Central Los Angeles Basin. Based on its proximity to the
                    Pacific Ocean, Cerritos has a “semi-marine” climate. The ocean plays an
                    important role in affecting local temperatures. As a result of the fairly narrow
                    spread between the warmest and coldest monthly mean sea surface
                    temperature in southern California coastal waters, the relatively warm ocean
                    modifies the climate in Cerritos in winter and provides cooling sea breezes
                    in summer. In the summer breezes travel up the San Gabriel River Channel
                    from the ocean. This breeze serves to disperse pollutants through the air
                    basin.
                    Additionally, Cerritos is not prone to the effects of Santa Ana winds.
                    Summers are warm to hot with an average temperature of 74 degrees
                    Fahrenheit. Winters are cool with an average temperature of 52 degrees
                    Fahrenheit. The average annual temperature is 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
                    Average annual precipitation is approximately 13 inches. The average high
                    and low humidity readings are 81 percent and 54 percent respectively. The
                    prevailing winds are generally 3 mph from the southwest.

3.2      REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
3.2.1    FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT
The 1970 Clean Air Act (CAA) authorized the establishment of the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and set deadlines for their
attainment. The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 made major
changes in deadlines for attaining NAAQS and in the actions required of
areas of the nation that exceeded these standards. Other changes to the
1990 Clean Air Act occurred in 1997. In 1997, after observing the numerous
studies citing the adverse effects of ozone under the then existing
standards, the EPA changed 1990 ozone standards to reflect a change in
averaging times and levels that are considered more appropriate and
stringent. Additionally, in 1997 the U.S. EPA changed the particulate matter
criteria to provide for more stringent goals for fine air particles.2
3.2.2    CALIFORNIA CLEAN AIR ACT
The 1988 California Clean Air Act (CCAA) requires that all air districts in the
State endeavor to achieve and maintain California Ambient Air Quality
Standards (CAAQS) for ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur oxides
(SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NO2) by the earliest practical date. The CCAA
specifies that districts focus particular attention on reducing the emissions
from transportation and area-wide emission sources. The Act also gives
districts new authority to regulate indirect sources. Each district plan is to
achieve a five-percent annual reduction (averaged over consecutive three-
year periods) in district-wide emissions of each non-attainment pollutant or
its precursors. Any additional development within the region would impede
the “no net” increase prohibition, in that further emissions reductions must
be affected from all other airshed sources to fit any project development
mobile source emissions increase.
A strict interpretation of the “no net” increase prohibition suggests that any
general development within the region, no matter how large or small, would
have a significant, project-specific air quality impact unless the
development-related emissions are offset by concurrent emissions
reduction elsewhere within the airshed. Any planning effort for air quality
attainment would thus need to consider both State and Federal planning
requirements.

3.2.3 SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT
The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) has prepared
multiple Air Quality Management Plans (AQMPs) to accomplish the five
percent annual reduction goal. The most recent AQMP was published in
1997. To accomplish its task, the AQMP relies on a multi-level partnership
of governmental agencies at the Federal, State, regional and local level.
These agencies, which include EPA, CARB, local governments, Southern
California Association of Governments (SCAG) and the SCAQMD, are the
primary agencies that implement the AQMP programs.
1997 AQMP
A 1997 AQMP was prepared and adopted by the SCAQMD on November
15, 1996. The 1997 AQMP was adopted by CARB on January 23, 1997.
The 1997 Plan contains two tiers of control measures: short- and
intermediate-term, and long-term. Short- and intermediate-term measures
are scheduled to be adopted between 1997 and the year 2005. These
measures rely on known technologies and other actions to be taken by
several agencies that currently have the statutory authority to implement the
measures. They are designed to satisfy the Federal CAA requirement of
Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) and the CCAA
requirement of Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (BARCT). There
are 37 stationary source and 24 mobile source control measures in this
group.
The most recent amendment to the 1997 AMQP is the 1999 Ozone SIP
Revision. This revision was adopted by the SCAQMD in December 1999
and ratified by the EPA in April 2000. The provisions of the 1999 SIP
Revision are intended to: (1) include new short-term control measures that
implement and replace portions of the 1997 long-term measures, (2)
expedite the implementation schedule of a portion of the short-term
measures in the 1997 AQMP; and (3) revise the adoption and
implementation schedule for those 1997 AQMP control measures with
lapsed adoption dates.
To ultimately achieve ambient air quality standards, further development
and refinement of known low- and zero-emission control technologies, in
addition to technological breakthroughs, would be necessary. Long-term
measures rely on the advancement of technologies and control methods
that can reasonably be expected to occur between 1994 and 2010.
The 1997 AQMP continues to include most of the control measures outlined
in the previous 1994 Ozone Plan with minor exceptions, but postpones
many marginal measures found to be less cost-effective, drops future
indirect-source rules that are now deemed infeasible, and focuses the
SCAQMD’s efforts on about ten major emission-reduction rules. The
AIR QUALITY ELEMENT                                                           AQ-5

                    SCAQMD will focus its efforts on seven major rules to reduce volatile
                    organic compounds (VOCs), a key ingredient in smog; and the Plan
                    includes new market-based measures giving businesses greater flexibility in
                    meeting emission-reduction requirements, such as intercredit trading and
                    additional credits for mobile source emission reductions.
                    The 1997 AQMP shows that measures outlined in the 1994 Ozone Plan are
                    sufficient to attain the Federal health standards for the two most difficult
                    ingredients in smog, PM10 and ground level O3, by the years 2006 and
                    2010, respectively. The region already has met the three other Federal
                    health standards for Pb, SO2 and NO2.
                    To help reduce PM10 pollution, the 1997 Plan outlines seven control
                    measures for directly emitted particulates that will reduce emissions from
                    agricultural areas, livestock waste, wood-working operations, construction,
                    and restaurants. The measures will also help control dust from paved and
                    unpaved roads, which accounts for two-thirds of the directly-emitted
                    particulates.
                    1997 AQMP Control Strategies. The 1997 AQMP’s off-road mobile source
                    control measures are based on the EPA’s proposed Federal
                    Implementation Plan (FIP) for the South Coast Air Basin. The FIP’s
                    proposed control measures are based on a combination of stringent
                    emission standards, declining caps on emission levels and emission/user
                    fees.
                    3.3      AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
                    Ambient air quality is described in terms of compliance with Federal and
                    State standards. Ambient air quality standards are the levels of air pollutant
                    concentration considered safe to protect the public health and welfare.
                    They are designed to protect people most sensitive to respiratory distress
                    such as asthmatics, the elderly, very young children, people already
                    weakened by other disease or illness and persons engaged in strenuous
                    work or exercise. National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) were
                    established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in
                    1971 for six air pollutants. States have the option of adding other pollutants,
                    to require more stringent compliance, or to include different exposure
                    periods.
                    The California Air Resource Board (CARB) is required to designate areas of
                    the State as attainment, non-attainment or unclassified for any State
                    standard. An “attainment” designation for an area signifies that pollutant
                    concentrations did not violate the standard for that pollutant in that area. A
                    “non-attainment” designation indicates that a pollutant concentration
                    violated the standard at least once, excluding those occasions when a
                    violation was caused by an exceptional event, as defined in the criteria. An
AIR QUALITY ELEMENT                                                                            AQ-6

“unclassified” designation signifies that data do not support either an
attainment or non-attainment status.
State and Federal ambient air quality standards have been established for
the following pollutants: ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen
dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), fine particulate matter less than 10
microns in diameter (PM10) and lead. For some of these pollutants, notably
O3 and PM10, the State standards are more stringent than the Federal
standards. The State has also established ambient air quality standards for
sulfates, hydrogen sulfide, vinyl chloride and visibility reducing particles.
The above-mentioned pollutants are generally known as “criteria
pollutants.”
In 1997, the EPA announced new ambient air quality standards for O3 and
PM10. The new standards were intended to provide greater protection of
public health. The EPA proposed to phase out the 1- hour O3 standard and
replace it with an 8-hour standard.
In 1997, the EPA also announced new PM2.5 standards. Industry groups
challenged the new standard in court and the implementation of the
standard was blocked. However, upon appeal by the EPA, the U.S.
Supreme Court reversed this decision and upheld the EPA’s new
standards. Beginning in 2002, based on three years of monitoring data,
the EPA will designate areas as non-attainment that do not meet the new
PM2.5 standards.3
Following the announcement of the new national standards, the SCAQMD
began collecting monitoring data to determine the region’s attainment
status with respect to the new standards. On June 20, 2002, CARB adopted
amendments for statewide annual ambient particulate matter air quality
standards. The ambient annual PM10 standard was lowered from 30
micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) to 20 µg/m 3. As no ambient annual
state standard existed for PM2.5 , a new annual standard was established at
12 µg/m3. A 24-hour average standard for both PM10 and PM2.5 was
retained. These standards were revised/established due to increasing
concerns by CARB that previous standards were inadequate, as almost
everyone in California is exposed to levels at or above the current State
PM10 standards during some parts of the year, and the statewide potential
for significant health impacts associated with particulate matter exposure
was determined to be large and wide-ranging.4 Particulate matter impacts

                    primarily effect infants, children, the elderly and those with pre-existing
                    cardiopulmonary disease.
                    The South Coast Air Basin has the worst air quality problem in the State.
                    Despite implementing many strict controls, the SCAQMD portions of the
                    basin still fail to meet the Federal air quality for three of the six criteria
                    pollutants: ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter
                    (PM10). Because Federal pollution standards have not been achieved, the
                    basin is considered a non-attainment area for Federal standards for these
                    pollutants. For State standards, the Los Angeles County portion of the
                    basin is designated as non-attainment for O3 and PM10.5
                    3.4       LOCAL AMBIENT AIR QUALITY
                    The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) operates
                    several air quality monitoring stations within the Air Basin. The City of
                    Cerritos is located within Source Receptor Area (SRA) 4. The communities
                    within an SRA are expected to have similar climatology and subsequently,
                    similar ambient air pollutant concentrations. The nearest air monitoring
                    stations to the City of Cerritos within SRA 4 is located in the north portion of
                    the City of Long Beach. Air Quality Data from 1997 to 2001 for the North
                    Long Beach Monitoring Station is provided in Table AQ-1, Local Air Quality
                    Levels.
                    Local air quality in Cerritos is influenced by the presence of three freeways
                    that traverse the City: I-605, SR-91, and I-5. These freeways carry a large
                    amount of regional traffic, and thus, generate large amounts of vehicular
                    emersions from both automobiles and trucks.
                    3.5       SENSITIVE RECEPTORS
                    Sensitive populations are more susceptible to the effects of air pollution
                    than are the general population. Sensitive populations (sensitive receptors)
                    who are in proximity to localized sources of toxins and carbon monoxide are
                    of particular concern. Land uses considered sensitive receptors include
                    residences, schools, playgrounds, childcare centers, athletic facilities, long-
                    term health care facilities, rehabilitation centers, convalescent centers and
                    retirement homes.

3.6      TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS (TACs)
SCAQMD implements TAC controls through Federal, State and local
programs. Federally, TACs are regulated by EPA under Title III of the CAA.
At the State level, the CARB has designated all 243 Federal hazardous air
pollutants as TACs, under the authority of AB 1807. The Air Toxic Hot Spots
Information and Assessment Act (AB 2588) requires inventories and public
notices for facilities that emit TACs. Senate Bill 1731 amended AB 2588 to
require facilities with “significant risks” to prepare a risk reduction plan
(reflected in SCAQMD Rule 1402). SCAQMD also regulates source-specific
TACs.
The City of Cerritos, as a local government, will be primarily responsible for
implementing the transportation and land use measures included in the
AQMP and reducing emissions in the areas of energy conservation, dust
control and trip reduction. This may be done, in part, through the adoption
of this Air Quality Element as part of the City's General Plan.
4.0 PLANNING FACTORS, GOALS AND POLICIES
Air quality is a regional issue affecting the entire South Coast Air Basin
(SCAB), which includes the City of Cerritos. The SCAB has been in violation
with state and federal air quality standards for the past several years. In an
effort to attain air quality standards, this section of the Cerritos Air Quality
Element identifies goals and policies to reduce the generation of pollutants.
Specifically, this section focuses on improving air quality through the
reduction of total air emissions, education of the public on pollution control
measures and encouraging the best use of available technologies.
LAND USE PLANNING
Planning Factor
Land use decisions influence the distribution, density and location of
housing, employment and other land uses within the City of Cerritos. The
widespread distribution of land use types contribute to reductions in air
quality.
Goal          AQ-1        Reduce air pollution through proper land use and
                          regulatory planning.

                                             through the Los Angeles Basin.
                    TRANSPORTATION
                    Planning Factor
                    Automobile use in Southern California is virtually a necessity for many
                    people. The necessity of transportation contributes substantially to poor air
                    quality. Automobile trips to and from employment constitutes the primary
                    contributor to poor air quality. Reducing the need for such trips will
                    significantly contribute to improved air quality.
                    Goal         AQ-2        Improve air quality by reducing the amount of
                                             vehicular emissions in Cerritos.
                    Policies     AQ-2.1      Promote and encourage ride sharing activities,
                                             including such programs as preferential parking and
                                             park-and-ride lots on privately owned property within

CHAPTER 10
NOISE ELEMENT
1.0      INTRODUCTION
The Noise Element of the General Plan provides a framework to limit noise
exposure within the City. Existing and future noise environments and the
compatibility of land uses are considered in the Element, as well as
sensitive receptors and generators of stationary noise. Projected noise
levels are included to help guide future land use policy and prevent high
noise levels in sensitive areas at buildout. In addition, noise contours in the
form of community noise equivalent level (CNEL) or day-night average level
(Ldn) are provided for all referenced sources.
Various measures are described in order to mitigate potential noise
conflicts. These measures are designed to lessen impacts from
unavoidable noise conflicts within the City of Cerritos. The Noise Element
also serves as a guideline for compliance with the State’s Noise Insulation
Standards.
2.0 AUTHORITY FOR THE ELEMENT
The State of California Government Code Section 65302(f) requires that a
General Plan include:
    “..a noise element which shall identify and appraise noise problems
    in the community. The Noise Element shall recognize the guidelines
    established by the Office of Noise Control in the State Department of
    Health Services and shall analyze and quantify…current and
    projected noise levels for all of the following sources: (1) highways
    and freeways; (2) primary arterials and major local streets; (3)
    passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and ground rapid
    transit systems; (4) commercial, general aviation, heliport, and
    military airport operations, aircraft overflights, jet engine test stands,
    and all other ground facilities and maintenance functions related to
    airport operation; (5) local industrial plants, including but not limited
    to, railroad classification yards; (6) other ground stationary noise
    sources identified by local agencies as contributing to the
    community noise environment.”
NOISE ELEMENT                                                                   N-1

              3.0 SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
              3.1     NOISE SCALES AND DEFINITIONS
              Decibels (dB) are based on the logarithmic scale. The logarithmic scale
              compresses the wide range in sound pressure levels to a more usable
              range of numbers in a manner similar to the Richter scale used to measure
              earthquakes. In terms of human response to noise, a sound 10 dB higher
              than another is judged to be twice as loud; and 20 dB higher four times as
              loud; and so forth. Everyday sounds normally range from 30 dBA (very
              quiet) to 100 dBA (very loud). The A-weighted sound pressure level is the
              sound pressure level, in decibels, as measured on a sound level meter
              using the A-weighted filter network. The A-weighting filter de-emphasizes
              the very low and very high frequency components of the sound, placing
              greater emphasis on those frequencies within the sensitivity range of the
              human ear. Examples of various sound levels in different environments are
              shown in Table N-1, Sound Levels and Human Response.
              Many methods have been developed for evaluating community noise to
              account for, among other things:
                   o The variation of noise levels over time;
                   o The influence of periodic individual loud events; and
                   o The community response to changes in the community noise
                      environment.
              Numerous methods have been developed to measure sound over a period
              of time. These methods include: 1) the Community Noise Equivalent Level
              (CNEL); 2) the Equivalent Sound Level (Leq); and 3) the Day/Night Average
              Sound Level (Ldn).
              3.1.1   COMMUNITY NOISE EQUIVALENT LEVEL (CNEL)
              The predominant community noise rating scale used in California for land
              use compatibility assessment is the Community Noise Equivalent Level
              (CNEL). The CNEL rating represents the average of 24 hourly readings of
              equivalent levels, known as Leq’s, for a 24-hour period based on an A-
              weighted decibel with upward adjustments added to account for increased
              noise sensitivity in the evening and night periods. These adjustments are
              +5 dBA for the evening, 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., and +10 dBA for the
              night, 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. CNEL may be indicated by “dBA CNEL” or
              just “CNEL.”

NOISE ELEMENT                                                                                                        N-3
              3.1.2   LEQ
              The Leq is the sound level containing the same total energy over a given
              sample time period. The Leq can be thought of as the steady sound level
              which, in a stated period of time, would contain the same acoustic energy
              as the time-varying sound level during the same period. Leq is typically
              computed over 1, 8 and 24-hour sample periods.
              3.1.3   DAY NIGHT AVERAGE (LDN)
              Another commonly used method is the day/night average level or Ldn. The
              Ldn is a measure of the 24-hour average noise level at a given location. It
              was adopted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
              for developing criteria for the evaluation of community noise exposure. It is
              based on a measure of the average noise level over a given time period
              called the Leq. The Ldn is calculated by averaging the Leq’s for each hour
              of the day at a given location after penalizing the “sleeping hours” (defined
              as 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.), by 10 dBA to account for the increased
              sensitivity of people to noises that occur at night.
              3.1.4   OTHER NOISE MATRICES
              The maximum noise level recorded during a noise event is typically
              expressed as Lmax. The sound level exceeded over a specified time frame
              can be expressed as Ln (i.e., L90, L50, L10, etc.). L50 equals the level
              exceeded 50 percent of the time, L10 ten percent of the time, etc.
              As previously mentioned, people tend to respond to changes in sound
              pressure in a logarithmic manner. In general, a 1 dBA change in the sound
              pressure levels of a given sound is detectable only under laboratory
              conditions. A 3 dBA change in sound pressure level is considered a
              detectable difference in most situations. A 5 dBA change is readily
              noticeable and a 10 dBA change is considered a doubling (or halving) of
              the subjective loudness. It should be noted that a 3 dBA increase or
              decrease in the average traffic noise level is realized by a doubling or
              halving of the traffic volume; or by about a 7 mile per hour (mph) increase or
              decrease in speed.
              For each doubling of distance from a point noise source, the sound level
              will decrease by 6 dBA. In other words, if a person is 100 feet from a
              machine, and moves to 200 feet from that source, sound levels will drop
              approximately 6 dBA. For each doubling of distance from a line source, like
              a roadway, noise levels are reduced by 3 to 5 decibels, depending on the
              ground cover between the source and the receiver.
NOISE ELEMENT                                                                            N-4

Noise barriers can provide approximately a 5 dBA CNEL noise reduction
(additional reduction may be provided with a barrier of appropriate height,
material, location and length). A row of buildings provides up to 5 dBA
CNEL noise reduction with a 1.5 dBA CNEL reduction for each additional
row up to a maximum reduction of approximately 10 dBA. The exact degree
of noise attenuation depends on the nature and orientation of the structure
and intervening barriers.
3.2      NOISE STANDARDS
3.2.1    FEDERAL NOISE STANDARDS
The United States Noise Control Act of 1972 (NCA) recognized the role of
the Federal government in dealing with major commercial noise sources in
order to provide for uniform treatment of such sources. As Congress has
the authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, regulation of
noise generated by such commerce also falls under congressional
authority. The Federal government specifically preempts local control of
noise emissions from aircraft, railroad and interstate highways.
The EPA has identified acceptable noise levels for various land uses, in
order to protect public welfare, allowing for an adequate margin of safety, in
addition to establishing noise emission standards for interstate commerce
activities.
3.2.2    STATE NOISE STANDARDS
The Office of Noise Control in the State Department of Health Services has
developed criteria and guidelines for local governments to use when setting
standards for human exposure to noise and preparing noise elements for
General Plans. These guidelines include noise exposure levels for both
exterior and interior environments. In addition, Title 25, Section 1092 of the
California Code of Regulations, sets forth requirements for the insulation of
multiple-family residential dwelling units from excessive and potentially
harmful noise. The State indicates that locating units in areas where exterior
ambient noise levels exceed 65 CNEL is undesirable. Whenever such units
are to be located in such areas, the developer must incorporate into
building design construction features which reduce interior noise levels to
45 dBA CNEL. Tables N-2, N-3, and N-4 summarize standards adopted by
various local, State, and Federal agencies. Table N-3, Noise and Land Use
Compatibility Matrix, presents criteria used to assess the compatibility of
proposed land uses with the noise environment. Table N-4, State Interior
and Exterior Noise Standards, indicates standards and criteria that specify
acceptable limits of noise for various land uses throughout Cerritos. These
standards and criteria will be incorporated into the land use planning
process to reduce future noise and land use incompatibilities. These tables
are the primary tools that allow the City to ensure integrated planning for
compatibility between land uses and outdoor noise.

              3.2.3 CITY NOISE STANDARDS
              The City of Cerritos maintains a comprehensive Noise Ordinance within the
              Municipal Code that sets standards for noise levels citywide and provides
              the means to enforce the reduction of obnoxious or offensive noises.
              Section 22.80.480 establishes noise standards and enforcement
              procedures.
              CITY NOISE ORDINANCE
              The City Noise Ordinance (Section 22.80.480) establishes outdoor and
              indoor noise standards. The Ordinance is designed to control unnecessary,
              excessive and annoying sounds generated on one piece of property from
              impacting an adjacent property, and to protect residential areas from noise
              sources, including noise generated by traffic. Between the hours of 7:00
              p.m. and 7:00 a.m., the noise standards are more stringent than during the
              day hours of 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
              The Noise Ordinance prohibits stationary noise sources to exceed the
              following during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.:
                   o The noise standard plus 5 dBA for a cumulative period of more than
                       15 minutes in any hour;
                   o The noise standard plus 10 dBA for a cumulative period of more
                       than 5 minutes in any hour; or
                   o The noise standard plus 15 dBA for a cumulative period of more
                       than one minute in any hour.
              The noise environment of Cerritos is dominated by vehicular traffic including
              vehicular generated noise along Interstate 605 (I-605), Interstate 5 (I-5),
              State Route 91 (SR-91), and primary and secondary arterials. In addition, a
              number of other sources contribute to the total noise environment. These
              noise sources include construction activities, power tools and gardening
              equipment, loudspeakers, auto repair, radios, children playing and dogs
              barking. In order to provide a description of the existing noise environment
              in Cerritos, noise contours were quantified for highway and local street
              traffic. As referenced in Table N-5, Field Noise Measurements, field noise
              measurements were taken at various locations in the City to reflect ambient
              noise levels primarily in the vicinity of sensitive uses (i.e., schools,
              residences, churches, hospitals, etc.).
NOISE ELEMENT                                                                           N-8
3.3      EXISTING NOISE CONDITIONS
3.3.1    TRAFFIC NOISE
Traffic noise levels can be reliably predicted using formulas that take into
account traffic volume, speed and percentage of trucks. Existing noise
contours were calculated for all the City’s primary and major arterials, as
well as the three freeways (I-605, I-5, and SR-91) that traverse the City. In
addition a number of secondary and commuter streets were modeled as
well. Noise generation for each roadway segment was calculated and the
distance to the 60, 65, and 70 dBA CNEL contours was determined. (A
noise contour is a line behind which the noise level does not exceed a
certain value. For instance, the 60 dBA CNEL contour indicates that the
CNEL between the street and the contour line is equal to, or greater than 60
dBA; the CNEL beyond the contour line - away from the street - is less than
60 dBA). Refer to Exhibit N-1, Existing Noise Contours, for the approximate
location of existing noise contours based on average daily traffic (ADT).
In an effort to reduce the effects of roadway noise on the local population,
the City of Cerritos expended several million dollars and constructed sound
walls adjacent to all freeways in the City. These sound walls have been
constructed to greater design standards than Caltrans requirements.
3.3.2 STATIONARY NOISE SOURCES
Commercial and industrial land uses located near residential areas currently
generate occasional noise impacts. The primary noise sources associated
with these facilities are caused by delivery trucks, air compressors,
generators, outdoor loudspeakers and gas venting. Other significant
stationary noise sources in the City include noise from construction activity,
street sweepers and gas-powered leaf blowers. Residential land uses and
areas identified as noise-sensitive must be protected from excessive noise
from stationary sources including commercial and industrial centers. These
impacts are best controlled through effective land use planning and
application of the City Noise Ordinance.
3.3.3 OTHER STATIONARY NOISE SOURCES
Los Cerritos Center
The Los Cerritos Center is a retail/commercial mall in the City of Cerritos,
and is a major contributor to traffic noise generation. The Center is located
along Gridley Road between 183 rd Street and South Street, with the I-605

AMBIENT NOISE
In order to describe the ambient or background noise level throughout the
City, noise measurement samples were taken. The locations included a mix
of public schools, private schools, preschools (childcare centers),
churches, hospitals, parks and a senior day activity center. The numerous
locations shown in Exhibit N-2, Noise Sensitive Land Uses, are distributed
throughout the City in order to provide an overall understanding of the noise
environment. Noise monitoring equipment used for the ambient noise
survey consisted of a Larson Davis Laboratories Model LDL 820 sound level
analyzer equipped with a Bruel & Kjaer (B&K) Type 4176 ½” microphone.

The instrumentation was calibrated prior to use with a B&K Type 4230
acoustical calibrator to ensure the accuracy of the measurements, and
complies with applicable requirements of the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) for Type I (precision) sound level meters.
The noise measurement locations also functioned as noise sensitive
indicators. These noise sensitive indicators are uses such as schools and
hospitals, which have a lower tolerance for noise than do industrial and
commercial activities or normal residential uses. Noise levels measured at
these locations are reported in Table N-5, Field Noise Measurements.

4.0 NOISE CONTOURS
Exhibits N-1 and N-3 provide existing and expected 2020 noise contours
along many of the City’s major and secondary arterials and the two
freeways that traverse the City. Tables are included in the General Plan
Environmental Impact Report that indicate traffic volumes on designated
roadway segments.
The exhibits display the average daily traffic (ADT) volume noise levels at
100 feet from the roadway centerline and the distance from the roadway
centerline to the 70, 65 and 60 dBA CNEL contours. Tables in the
Circulation Element indicate traffic volumes on designated street segments.
Surface traffic noise has the greatest impact on the noise environment of
Cerritos’ residential and sensitive-receptor properties. Contours between
55 and 60 dBA CNEL are common along City collector streets, while 65
dBA CNEL or great contours are common along major streets.
The inclusion of an area within a 60 or 65 CNEL contour on Exhibit N-1 or N-
3 indicates that noise levels are high enough to be of potential concern, but
does not imply that excessive noise levels are present uniformly on all sites
within the area. Buildings, walls, berms, and changes in topography affect
noise levels. Some locations may be screened from noise impact by the
presence of one or more of these features.
Exhibit N-3 shows projected 60 dB contours ranging between
approximately 74 feet and 334 feet from the roadway centerlines. The 65
dB contour ranges between 34 feet and 155 feet along the roadways
modeled. This impacts existing residential neighborhoods and school
facilities located throughout the City, as identified below:
     o Along Artesia Boulevard from Bloomfield to Shoemaker;
     o Along Artesia Boulevard from Shoemaker to Carmenita; and
     o Along Carmenita Road north of 166th.
In the City of Cerritos, soundwalls are adjacent to residential or other noise-
sensitive uses along major thoroughfares. These soundwalls serve as a
noise barrier and as noise attenuation. The three roadway segments along
Artesia Boulevard and Carmenita that exceed the noise thresholds are
adjacent to residential areas and have soundwalls that exceed six feet in
height and block the line-of-sight from the residences to the roadway.
Since the walls along Artesia Boulevard and Carmenita Road are over six
feet tall, attenuation levels are expected to be between 3 – 5 dBA. All other
noise impacts are located within commercial or industrial areas in the City,
which are not identified as sensitive receptors.

              5.0 DESCRIPTION OF NOISE PLAN
              Transportation noise is the most serious noise problem in Cerritos.
              However, local government has little direct control of transportation noise at
              the source. State and federal agencies have the responsibility to control
              vehicle noise emission levels. The most effective method the City has to
              mitigate transportation noise is by reducing noise impact on the community.
              Mitigation through site planning and the design and construction of a noise
              barrier (generally a wall or berm) are the most common ways of alleviating
              traffic noise impacts in existing urban environments.
              TYPICAL NOISE ATTENUATION TECHNIQUES
              Noise impacts can be mitigated in three basic ways: by reducing the sound
              level of the noise generator, by increasing the distance between the source
              and receiver, and by insulating the receiver.
              Noise reduction can be accomplished by placement of walls, landscaped
              berms, or a combination of the two, between the noise source and the
              receiver. Generally, effective noise shielding requires a solid barrier with a
              mass of at least four pounds per square-foot of surface area which is large
              enough to block the line of sight between source and receiver. Variations
              may be appropriate in individual cases based on distance, nature and
              orientation of buildings behind the barrier, and a number of other factors.
              Garages or other buildings may be used to shield dwelling units and
              outdoor living areas from traffic noise.
              In addition to site design techniques, noise insulation can be accomplished
              through proper design of buildings. Nearby noise generators should be
              recognized in determining the location of doors, windows and vent
              openings. Sound-rated windows (extra thick or multi-paned) and wall
              insulation are also effective. None of these measures, however, can realize
              their full potential unless care is taken in actual construction: doors and
              windows fitted properly; openings sealed; joints caulked; plumbing
              adequately insulated from structural members.
              And, of course, sound-rated doors and windows will have little effect if left
              open. This may require installation of air conditioning for adequate
              ventilation. The chain of design, construction and operation is only as
              effective as its weakest link.
              Noise impacts can be reduced by insulating noise sensitive uses, such as
              residences, schools, libraries, hospitals, nursing and carehomes and some
              types of commercial activities. But perhaps a more efficient approach
              involves limiting the level of noise generation at the source. State and
              Federal statutes have largely preempted local control over vehicular noise
NOISE ELEMENT                                                                            N-20
emissions but commercial and industrial operations and certain residential
activities provide opportunities for local government to assist in noise
abatement. Local ordinances may establish maximum levels for noise
generated on-site. This usually takes the form of limiting the level of noise
permitted to leave the property where it may impact other uses.
Although vehicular noise emissions standards are established at the State
and Federal levels, local agencies can play a significant part in reducing
traffic noise by controlling traffic volume and congestion. Traffic noise is
greatest at intersections due to acceleration, deceleration and gear shifting.
Measures such as signal synchronization can help to minimize this
problem. Likewise, reduction of congestion aids in reduction of noise. This
can be accomplished through the application of traffic engineering
techniques such as channelization of turning movements, parking
restrictions, separation of modes (bus, auto, bicycle, pedestrian) and
restrictions on truck traffic.
Noise reduction through reduction of traffic volumes can also be
accomplished with incentive programs for use of public transit facilities and
high-occupancy vehicles, staggering of work hours and land use controls.
Vehicle trips can be turned into pedestrian trips with integration of housing
and employment into the same project or area, construction of high-density,
affordable housing in proximity to employment, shopping and public transit
facilities and other techniques.
NOISE AND LAND USE PLANNING INTEGRATION
Information relative to the existing and future noise environments within
Cerritos should be integrated into future land use planning decisions. The
Element presents the existing and future noise environments so that the City
will include noise impact considerations in development programs. Noise
and land use compatibility guidelines are presented, as well as noise
standards for new developments. Community noise considerations are to
be incorporated into land use planning to the maximum extent feasible.
TRANSPORTATION NOISE CONTROL
The most efficient and effective means of controlling noise from
transportation systems is to reduce noise at the source. However, since the
City has little direct control over source noise levels because of State and
federal preemption (for example, State motor vehicle noise standards and
federal air regulations), the City should focus on reducing the impact of the
noise on the community.

              NON-TRANSPORTATION NOISE CONTROL
              People must be protected from excessive noise from non-transpor tation
              sources, including commercial and industrial centers. These impacts are
              most effectively controlled through the application of the City’s Noise
              Ordinance.
              6.0 PLANNING FACTORS, GOALS AND POLICIES
              TRANSPORTATION NOISE IMPACTS
              Planning Factor
              Noise impacts resulting from transportation sources are difficult to mitigate
              at the source. The City has little control over reducing transportation noise
              due to State and Federal noise standards preemption.
              Goal        N-1        Reduction in noise impacts from transportation
                                     sources.
              Policies    N-1.1      Mitigate transportation     equipment    impacts     at
                                     construction sites.
                          N-1.2      Ensure noise mitigation measures are included in the
                                     design of new developments.
                          N-1.3      Encourage programs to retrofit existing homes to
                                     reduce noise impacts in the homes.
                          N-1.4      Encourage the use of double-paned windows for
                                     residential uses adjacent to the freeways and along
                                     major arterials.
              NON-TRANSPORTATION NOISE IMPACTS
              Planning Factor
              Commercial and industrial uses, construction activity and other non-
              transportation related sources of noise can contribute negatively to the
              noise environment. Identifying and mitigating these potential noise sources
              will reduce negative impacts.
              Goal        N-2        Develop measures to control non-transportation noise
                                     impacts.

Policies      N-2.1   Continuously review the Noise Ordinance to ensure
                      noise generating uses are adequately addressed.
              N-2.2   Strive to resolve existing and potential conflicts
                      between noise generating uses and human activities.
              N-2.3   Ensure noise mitigation techniques are incorporated
                      into all construction-related activities.
              N-2.4   Consider developing maximum noise standards for
                      ventilation systems (i.e., air conditioning units) in
                      residential areas.
              N-2.5   Consider developing regulations to prohibit the use
                      of public address systems and encourage the use of
                      alternative (noise sensitive) communication devices
                      (i.e., walkie-talkies, hand-held phones, or other
                      similar methods).
LAND USE PLANNING
Planning Factor
Land use planning decisions directly relate to potential noise impacts.
Therefore, careful consideration of noise impacts should be a part of all
land use decisions.
Goal          N-3     Include noise considerations as a part of land use
                      planning decisions.
Policies      N-3.1   Enforce noise standards, as contained in the City’s
                      Noise Ordinance.
              N-3.2   Ensure Community Noise Equivalent Levels (CNEL)
                      levels for noise sensitive land uses meet or exceed
                      normally acceptable levels, as defined by State of
                      California standards.
              N-3.3   Incorporate noise reduction measures into all
                      development proposals, as necessary.
              N-3.4   Consider noise impacts associated with the
                      development of non-residential uses in the vicinity of
                      residential uses.

CHAPTER 11
GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
1.0      INTRODUCTION
The Growth Management Element focuses on the City’s ability to
accommodate growth and development, while providing an adequate
infrastructure and circulation system. The Growth Management Element
also focuses on ways for the City to enhance long-term revenue sources, so
that the City can continue to provide its residents and businesses with the
highest level and quality of services.
2.0 AUTHORITY FOR THE ELEMENT
State Government Code Section 65303 allows jurisdictions to adopt, “any
other elements or address any other subjects, which, in the judgment of the
legislative body, relate to the physical development of the county or city.”
Once adopted, an optional element carries the same legal weight as any
other of the elements as required by Government Code Section 65300.5.
3.0 SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
This section provides an overview of existing conditions related to growth
management, including public facilities and fiscal resources.

                       3.1.5     COMMUNITY/CIVIC/EDUCATIONAL/AND CULTURAL FACILITIES
                       The City offers a wide range of cultural, community civic and education
                       facilities and services. Existing conditions for these facilities and services
                       can be found in Section 3.2 of Chapter 2, Land Use Element, Section 3.0 of
                       Chapter 3, Community Design Element, and Section 3.1 of Chapter 8, Open
                       Space/Recreation Element.
                       3.2       FISCAL RESOURCES
                       3.2.1     FACTORS AFFECTING FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
                       Many factors affect the performance of the Cerritos municipal budget –
                       local needs, state legislation, national economy, etc. But two factors stand
                       out as being significant, especially as they relate to the General Plan update
                       process. The first is the City’s stage of land use development, having now
                       developed nearly all developable parcels. The second is the City’s strategic
                       fiscal positioning in the formative period of its development. Both factors
                       now exert a strong influence on the fiscal performance and sustainability of
                       Cerritos.
                       Cerritos completed its initial growth phase and is now a fully developed City
                       with little available developable land. Nearly all of the City is fully developed
                       with urban land uses and complete urban infrastructure. This means,
                       among other things, that the City has reached a stabilized population and
                       land use pattern. This stabilized population and land use pattern can be
                       expected to remain into the indefinite future without significant changes in
                       land use intensity and residential density.
                       There is very little vacancy in the local real estate market, indicating that
                       homes, stores, offices and industries in the City are fully occupied. While
                       some turnover continues, residential, retail, commercial and industrial
                       vacancy rates are low, when space is available at all. This condition of
                       stabilized occupancy can also be expected to prevail into the indefinite
                       future without significant changes in the City’s subregional com petitiveness.
GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT                                                                            GM-2

Cerritos has reached a plateau for providing new roads, public facilities,
and public services to a stable population. The fiscal performance of the
City will be qualitatively different now than it was when the City was rapidly
growing. With a stabilized population and a physically built out city, Cerritos
faces a future with more maintenance than new construction, as well as
more stability than growth.
The other factor that significantly affects the fiscal performance of Cerritos is
the strategic planning and programs initiated early in the City’s municipal
history. The formation of the Cerritos Redevelopment Agency (CRA) with
favorable tax increment benefits helped provide the tools to attract major
regional retail users. Most notably, these include the Cerritos Auto Square,
the Los Cerritos Center and the Cerritos Towne Center.
These regional sales tax generators and the CRA tax increment revenues
have provided the City with substantive, stable and long-term revenue
streams. These revenue streams have provided the resources that enable
the City to provide high-quality public services and public facilities. In
addition, these revenue streams have enabled the City to build substantial
reserves to secure future services for City residents and businesses. The
high-quality of life enjoyed in Cerritos is an indication of the fiscal stability
the City has so far experienced, by design.
A general high level of satisfaction was revealed in the Cerritos 2000
Community Assessment interview and focus groups of residents, business
leaders and City officials. The survey indicates that there are no major
concerns facing the City at this time. Some concerns were raised, but had
little to do with the scope, level of quality of the public services or facilities,
except roadway maintenance. The financial resources captured by the City
early in its development period helped pay for many of the high-quality
public services and facilities that satisfy local residents and businesses.
The fact that the City is now built out, within a fixed jurisdictional boundary,
fully occupied, with a stable population, and with fully financed public
infrastructure and facilities, suggests that the main concern for the City now
is how to continue to sustain this high level of services indefinitely.
3.2.2     MUNICIPAL COST PROFILE
Overall municipal service costs are reflected in the budgetary expenditures
of the City’s General Fund budget and Redevelopment Agency budget.
Both budgets had a combined total expenditure of $146,000,000 for Fiscal
Year 2000-2001 (00-01). These expenditures cover all operating and capital
expenses.
GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT                                                           GM-3

                       The General Fund budget for Fiscal year 2000-2001 exceeded $66,000,000
                       for operations and $32,000,000 in capital projects.              Similarly, the
                       Redevelopment Agency budget is nearly $32,000,000 with another
                       $15,000,000 for low/moderate income housing. The General Funding
                       expenditures cover most of the direct public services to City residents,
                       businesses and visitors. These include Community and Safety Services,
                       Public Works, Community Development, Administrative Services and the
                       Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts.
                       Growth in the scope and quality for public services is reflected in the growth
                       of General Fund expenditures. General Fund expenditures were half of
                       today’s $66 million in Fiscal Year 93-94, and half of that in Fiscal Year 88-
                       89. Aside from inflationary increases, its is clear that the City is increasing
                       the scope and quality of its municipal services.
                       Capital expenditures continue to provide high-quality public facilities, such
                       as the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, Civic Center Complex,
                       Cerritos Senior Center at Pat Nixon Park, Heritage Park and Cerritos
                       Sheriff’s Station/Community Safety Center. The $35 million Cerritos Library,
                       with associated civic center parking, is the newest addition to this list of
                       extraordinary public facilities. The City is also interested in providing a
                       museum for its residents, and in July 2001 purchased a building on the
                       southeast corner of Bloomfield Avenue and 183rd Street for this purpose.
                       Maintenance of streets also continues to consume capital expenditures. A
                       street rehabilitation program is part of the City’s Capital Improvement
                       Program (CIP) to systematically maintain the City’s street system.
                       The Cerritos Redevelopment Agency is limited in scope to mainly capital
                       projects in the Los Cerritos and Los Coyotes Redevelopment Project Areas.
                       The CRA also provides capital for low/moderate housing within the City.
                       The $32 million FY 00-01 expenditures for the CRA cover mainly
                       government buildings, streets and highways and parks and open space.
                       Over $15 million will be allocated in FY 00-01 for low/moderate income
                       housing programs in the City. Much of the work of the CRA has been
                       already completed within the redevelopment project areas, and thus, the
                       CRA will primarily by paying off indebtedness until the agency reaches the
                       sunset date for each project area.
                       MUNICIPAL REVENUE SOURCES
                       The Cerritos General Fund receives revenue from several major sources.
                       Retail sales tax is the single largest revenue source for the City, generating
                       an expected $24 million in FY 00-01. Revenue from interest income
                       generated from the General Fund reserve fund amount to over $12.5 million
                       for FY 00-01. These two sources alone account for one-half of all General
                       Fund revenues. Smaller sources of revenue include ground rent ($2.8
                       million), property tax ($1.5 million) and a variety of intergovernmental
GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT                                                                         GM-4

transfers. It is clear that the Cerritos General Fund is critically dependent on
retail sales tax and interest income from reserves. Any significant decrease
in these two revenue streams has the potential to reduce discretionary
monies in the General Fund and thus result in budget consolidation or
tightening efforts by the City.
Tax increment revenue from each project area, interest income, property
rental and lease revenues provide revenue for the CRA. These property tax
based revenue streams amounted to $19.7 million in FY 00-01. However,
both redevelopment project areas are expected to terminate between 2011
and 2016, with a possible extension to 2020 and 2025. Much of the CRA
revenue is obligated to pay back outstanding development bonds. Aside
from low/moderate income housing allocations, the CRA has limited
borrowing capacity to finance major capital improvements at this time.
The City is fortunate to have a continuing stream of retail sales tax and a
huge reserve from which it can draw interest income. Retail sales tax
revenues to the City increased from $14 million in 1990 to $24 million in FY
00-01. Interest income has grown from $10.2 million in 1990 to $12.5
million today. Similarly, ground rent income has increased from $0.5 million
to $2.9 million. Tax increment revenues have increased from $14.3 million a
decade ago to $19.7 million in FY 00-01. These growth rates have helped
the City finance the growing scope and level of public services and facilities.
BUDGET SUSTAINABILITY
From the review of existing fiscal resources, it is evident the City and CRA
budget are fiscally sustainable, though highly dependent on retail sales tax
revenue. The retail sales tax and interest income revenue streams to
Cerritos have helped create the City’s extraordinary fiscal stability. The
establishment of retail sales tax revenue streams, the formation of a CRA,
the formation and maintenance of a reserve fund, and the near completion
of capital projects will allow Cerritos to enjoy fiscal stability indefinitely,
under current conditions.
The City’s fiscal stability is largely dependent, however, on a number of
factors. Any significant decrease in the retail sales tax and interest income
streams of revenue could limit the amount of resources available to
maintain the City’s high level of public services and facilities. Similarly, any
significant increase in new capital expenditures for public facilities could
reduce the amount of the reserve fund, weakening interest income. Finally,
any significant expansion in the scope and level of public services may
trigger deficit financing from the reserve fund also. Thus, any significant
changes to future revenue streams or expenditures may jeopardize the
fiscal sustainability Cerritos now enjoys.

                       INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS AND SERVICE
                       Planning Factor
                       The City’s infrastructure systems must be expanded, improved and
                       regularly maintained to meet both existing and future needs. The City’s built
                       out nature increases the likelihood of potential impacts of new development
                       on infrastructure systems. As new development occurs, ensuring adequate
                       infrastructure is provided should be of particular concern to the City. The
                       City must make every effort to ensure infrastructure and services meet the
                       needs of existing development and provide necessary improvement to
                       meet the needs of future development. The City’s infrastructure includes
                       water, sewer, storm drainage, energy, communication, fiber optic and other
                       systems.
                       Goal        GM-1        Water and sewer service shall be adequate to meet
                                               the health and safety needs of residents and
                                               businesses in Cerritos.

                                               associated with providing adequate water and sewer
                                               service.

Goal      GM-3         Provide continued solid waste services to residents
                       and businesses.
Policy    GM-3.1       Ensure residents and businesses contribute to costs
                       for solid waste services.
Goal      GM-4         Promote and provide state-of-the-art energy,
                       communication, fiber optic and other systems that
                       meet the needs of the community.

                       Cerritos to maintain, improve, expand and replace,
                       when necessary, these systems throughout the City.
                       To this end, the City should inform system providers
                       of roadways projects requiring the reconstruction of
                       streets, so that the providers may evaluate their
                       infrastructure systems to determine if improvements
                       are necessary and could be made during the street
                       improvement or reconstruction project.

                                   GM-4.2      Encourage the provision of energy, communication,
                                               fiber optic and other systems that are adequate to
                                               accommodate any intensification of uses, as well as
                                               existing uses, particularly as development intensifies
                                               and/or redevelopment occurs in the City.
                       Related Goals and Policies:   Refer to Goal CON-2 and Policy CON-2.1 in the
                       Conservation Element, which addresses the City’s desire to ensure an
                       adequate energy supply to the community.
                       POLICE, FIRE AND MEDICAL SERVICES
                       Planning Factor
                       Safety from crime and urban fires, and readily available medical facilities is
                       a primary concern for the City. Cerritos is committed to ensuring the safety
                       of the community from crime, such as graffiti, burglary or assault, and
                       minimizing the risks to both residents and workers from urban fires. In
                       addition, the City seeks to ensure that adequate medical facilities are
                       readily available within the City limits. As of 2002, no hospitals or
                       emergency care facilities operated within the City, forcing residents and
                       workers to drive to neighboring cities to receive emergency medical care.
                       Goal        GM-5        Provide a high level of emergency services including,
                                               sheriff, fire and medical for residents.
                       Policies    GM-5.1      Provide periodic reviews of emergency response
                                               times to ensure existing staffing and facilities meets
                                               demand.
                                   GM-5.2      Coordinate with Los Angeles County Sheriff’s
                                               Department and Los Angeles County Fire Protection
                                               District to ensure a continued level of services to
                                               meet the needs of the community.
                                   GM-5.3      Encourage the development and operation of
                                               medical facilities, including emergency care facilities,
                                               medical offices, and hospitals, within the City.

TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION IMPROVEMENTS
Planning Factor
As future development is reviewed, it is important to consider their impacts
on the local road system. Therefore, to consider potential impacts, it is
important to consider the relationship between new development and
transportation system improvements to ensure a balance between
development levels and the capacity of the transportation system.
Goal        GM-6       Provide adequate transportation and circulation
                       system to meet the needs of residents and businesses
                       in Cerritos.
Policies    GM-6.1     Ensure that new development shall contribute its
                       share of transportation and circulation costs.
            GM-6.2     Ensure that all future development is consistent with
                       the City’s adopted Capital Improvement Program.
            GM-6.3     Ensure that all future development’s transportation
                       and circulation impacts are properly mitigated.
            GM-6.4     Coordinate with regional transportation authorities to
                       ensure compliance with regional strategies.
Related Goals and Policies:   Refer to Goal CIR-8 and its associated policies
in the Circulation Element, which address the need for a public
transportation system to serve the needs of the community.
COMMUNITY, CIVIC, EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL FACILITIES
Planning Factor
Cerritos takes great pride in providing the community with an extraordinary
level of community facilities. Through continual evaluation of community
needs and through public participation, Cerritos should continue to provide
the high-quality community services residents enjoy.
Goal        GM-7       Provide extraordinary public facilities, including
                       libraries, schools, civic facilities and cultural
                       facilities.
GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT                                                     GM-9

                       Policies     GM-7.1      Continually assess community needs for civic and
                                                cultural facilities and services.
                                    GM-7.2      Ensure that private development contributes
                                                financially to the quality of the civic, educational and
                                                cultural environment.
                                    GM-7.3      Explore the potential of developing a Community
                                                Theater in cooperation with the ABC Unified School
                                                District.
                       FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
                       Planning Factor
                       In order to continue to provide the highest level of services to the
                       community and continue to provide for adequate infrastructure to meet the
                       needs of new development, sustainable long-term revenue sources are
                       needed, particularly as the fiscal benefits associated with the City’s two
                       redevelopment project areas come to a close in the near future. The ability
                       of the City of Cerritos to adequately maintain reliable sources of revenue will
                       be critical in ensuring that the high-quality of services continues in the
                       future.
                       Goal         GM-8        Ensure Cerritos continues to provide a reliable and
                                                sustainable fiscal resource to fund municipal
                                                operations to ensure high-quality public services and
                                                facilities.

                                                retail sales tax base.
                                    GM-8.2      Support legislation designed to protect sales tax
                                                revenue from other methods of distribution (i.e., per
                                                capita distribution) and State acquisition.
                                    GM-8.3      Promote the development and/or redevelopment of
                                                commercial retail facilities on vacant and/or
                                                underutilized properties within the City.
                                    GM-8.4      Provide incentives to attract additional high-quality
                                                restaurants to the City.
                                    GM-8.5      Assist local merchants and/or property owners that
                                                wish to revitalize older businesses or shopping

                      California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA): A State law requiring State
                      and local agencies to regulate activities with consideration for
                      environmental protection. If a proposed activity has the potential for a
                      significant adverse environmental impact, an Environmental Impact Report
                      (EIR) must be prepared and certified as to its adequacy before taking action
                      on the proposed project.

                      to 7 AM) periods, respectively, to allow for the greater sensitivity to noise
                      during these hours.
                      Community Park: Land with full public access intended to provide
                      recreation opportunities beyond those supplied by neighborhood parks.
                      Community parks are larger in scale than neighborhood parks but smaller
                      than regional parks.
                      Congestion Management Plan (CMP): A mechanism employing growth
                      management techniques, including traffic level of service requirements,
                      standards for public transit, trip reduction programs involving transportation
                      systems management and jobs/housing balance strategies, and capital

improvement programming, for the purpose of controlling and/or reducing
the cumulative regional traffic impacts of development.
Consistency; Consistent With: Free from significant variation or
contradiction. The various diagrams, text, goals, policies, and programs in
the general plan must be consistent with each other, not contradictory or
preferential. The term “consistent with” is used interchangeably with
“conformity with.” The courts have held that the phrase “consistent with”
means “agreement with; harmonious with.” Webster defines “conformity
with” as meaning harmony, agreement when used with “with.” The term
“conformity means in harmony therewith or agreeable to (Sec 58
Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 21, 25 [1975]). California State law also requires that a
general plan be internally consistent and also requires consistency between
a general plan and implementation measures such as the zoning
ordinance. As a general rule, an action program or project is consistent with
the general plan if, considering all its aspects, it will further the objectives
and policies of the general plan and not obstruct their attainment.
Cul-de-Sac: A short street or alley with only a single means of ingress and
egress at one end and with a large turnaround at its other end.
dB: Decibel; a unit used to express the relative intensity of a sound as it is
heard by the human ear.
dBA: The “A-weighted” scale for measuring sound in decibels; weighs or
reduces the effects of low and high frequencies in order to simulate human
hearing. Every increase of 10 dBA doubles the perceived loudness though
the noise is actually ten times more intense.
Density, Residential: The number of permanent residential dwelling units per
acre of land. Densities specified in the General Plan may be expressed in
units per gross acre or per net developable acre. (See “Acres, Gross,” and
“Developable Acres, Net.”)
Density, Employment: A measure of the number of employed persons per
specific area (for example, employees/acre).
Developable Acres, Net: The portion of a site that can be used for density
calculations. Some communities calculate density based on gross acreage.
Public or private road rights-of-way are not included in the net developable
acreage of a site.
Developable Land: Land that is suitable as a location for structures and that
can be developed free of hazards to, and without disruption of, or
significant impact on, natural resource areas.

                      within the jurisdiction (California Government Code §65865 et. seq.) that
                      “freezes” certain rules, regulations, and policies applicable to development
                      of a property for a specified period of time, usually in exchange for certain

                      Dwelling Unit: A room or group of rooms (including sleeping, eating,
                      cooking, and sanitation facilities, but not more than one kitchen), that
                      constitutes an independent house-keeping unit, occupied or intended for
                      occupancy by one household on a long-term basis. Also see Residential
                      Unit.
                      Easement: Usually the right to use property owned by another for specific
                      purposes or to gain access to another property. For example, utility
                      companies often have easements on the private property of individuals to
                      be able to install and maintain utility facilities.
                      Emergency Shelter: A facility that provides immediate and short-term
                      housing and supplemental services for the homeless. Supplemental

                      programs.
                      Emission Standard: The maximum amount of pollutant legally permitted to
                      be discharged from a single source, either mobile or stationary.
                      Environment: CEQA defines environment as “the physical conditions which
                      exist within the area which will be affected by a proposed project, including
                      land, air, water, mineral, flora, fauna, noise, and objects of historic or
                      aesthetic significance.”
                      Environmental Impact Report (EIR): A report required pursuant to the
                      California Environmental Quality Act which assesses all the environmental
                      characteristics of an area, determines what effects or impacts will result if
                      the area is altered or disturbed by a proposed action, and identifies
                      alternatives or other measures to avoid or reduce those impacts. (See
                      “California Environmental Quality Act.”)
                      Erosion: (1) The loosening and transportation of rock and soil debris by

Fault: A fracture in the earth’s crust forming a boundary between rock
masses that have shifted.
Flood, 100-Year: The magnitude of a flood expected to occur on the
average every 100 years, based on historical data. The 100-year flood has a
1/100, or one percent, chance of occurring in any given year.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): For each community, the official map on
which the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated areas of special
flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to that community.
Floodplain: The relatively level land area on either side of the banks of a
stream regularly subject to flooding. That part of the floodplain subject to a
one percent chance of flooding in any given year is designated as an “area
of special flood hazard” by the Federal Insurance Administration.
Floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the “base flood”
without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one
foot. No development is allowed in floodways.
Floor Area, Gross: “Gross Floor Area” means the floor area of the ground
floor and any additional floors or basements of a building that extend
beyond a height of three fee above exterior finished grade. Measurements
shall be taken from the exterior faces of walls and sides, including patios,
porches, and balconies that are enclosed but not including the areas of
open inner courts or shaft enclosures. For any residential uses, gross floor
area shall not include garages, carports, attics, roofed terraces,
breezeways, basements that do not extend beyond a height of three feet
above exterior finished grade, or any patios, porches or balconies that are
open-sided.
Floor Area Ratio (FAR): A numerical value obtained by dividing the total
gross floor area of all buildings on a lot, plus the floor areas of garages and
accessory structures with solid covers, by the lot area, which is expressed
in decimals to one or two places.
For example, on a site with 10,000 net sq. ft. of land area, a Floor Area Ratio
of 1.0 will allow a maximum of 10,000 gross sq. ft. of building floor area to
be built. On the same site, an FAR of 1.5 would allow 15,000 sq. ft. of floor
area; an FAR of 2.0 would allow 20,000 sq. ft.; and an FAR of 0.5 would
allow only 5,000 sq. ft. Also commonly used in zoning, FARs typically are
applied on a parcel-by-parcel basis as opposed to an average FAR for an
entire land use or zoning district.

                      and county-wide travel. Such roads are free of tolls, as contrasted with
                      “turnpikes” or other “toll roads” now being introduced into Southern
                      California. Freeways generally are used for long trips between major land
                      use generators. At Level of Service “E,” they carry approximately 1,875
                      vehicles per lane per hour, in both directions. Major streets cross at a
                      different grade level.
                      Ground Failure: Ground movement or rupture caused by strong shaking

                      and subsidence.
                      Ground Shaking: Ground movement resulting from the transmission of
                      seismic waves during an earthquake.
                      Groundwater: Water under the earth’s surface, often confined to aquifers

                      Growth Management: The use by a community of a wide range of
                      techniques in combination to determine the amount, type, and rate of
                      development desired by the community and to channel that growth into
                      designated areas. Growth management policies can be implemented
                      through growth rates, zoning, capital improvement programs, public
                      facilities ordinances, urban limit lines, standards for levels of service, and
                      other programs. (See “Congestion Management Plan.”)
                      Habitat: The physical location or type of environment in which an organism
                      or biological population lives or occurs.
                      Hazardous Material: Any substance that, because of its quantity,
                      concentration, or physical or chemical characteristics, poses a significant
                      present or potential hazard to human health and safety or to the
                      environment if released into the workplace or the environment. The term
                      includes, but is not limited to, hazardous substances and hazardous
                      wastes.
                      Historic Preservation: The preservation of historically significant structures,
                      and neighborhoods until such time as, and in order to facilitate, restoration
                      and rehabilitation of the building(s) to a former condition. Also see Tree
                      Preservation.
                      Household: All those persons—related or unrelated—who occupy a single
                      housing unit. (See “Family.”) Households, Number of: The count of all year-
                      round housing units occupied by one or more persons. The concept of
                      household is important because the formation of new households
                      generates the demand for housing. Each new household formed creates
                      the need for one additional housing unit or requires that one existing

continue to take place even without an increase in population, thereby
increasing the demand for housing.
Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of (HUD): A cabinet-
level department of the federal government that administers housing and
community development programs.
Housing Unit: The place of permanent or customary abode of a person or
family. A housing unit may be a single-family dwelling, a multi-family
dwelling, a condominium, a modular home, a mobile home, a cooperative,
or any other residential unit considered real property under State law. A
housing unit has, at least, cooking facilities, a bathroom, and a place to
sleep. It also is a dwelling that cannot be moved without substantial
damage or unreasonable cost. Also see Residential Unit.
Impervious Surface: Surface through which water cannot penetrate, such as
roof, road, sidewalk, and paved parking lot. The amount of impervious
surface increases with development and establishes the need for drainage
facilities to carry the increased runoff.
Industrial: The manufacture, production, and processing of consumer
goods. Industrial is often divided into “heavy industrial” uses, such as
construction yards, quarrying, and factories; and “light industrial” uses,
such as research and development and less intensive warehousing and
manufacturing.
Infill Development: Development of vacant land (usually individual lots or
left-over properties) within areas that are already largely developed.
Infrastructure: Public services and facilities, such as sewage-disposal
systems, water-supply systems, other utility systems, and roads.
Institutional Uses: (1) Publicly or privately owned and operated activities
such as hospitals, convalescent hospitals, intermediate care facilities,
nursing homes, museums, and schools and colleges; (2) churches and
other religious organizations; and (3) other non-profit activities of a welfare,
educational, or philanthropic nature that cannot be considered residential,
commercial, or industrial. (See “Public and Quasi-public Facilities.”)
Intensity, Building: For residential uses, the actual number or the allowable
range of dwelling units per net or gross acre. For non-residential uses, the
actual or the maximum permitted floor area ratios (FARs).
Issues: Important unsettled community matters or problems that are
identified in a community’s general plan and dealt with by the plan’s
objectives, policies, plan proposals, and implementation programs.

                      dB weighting applied to night-time sound levels. The Ldn is approximately
                      numerically equal to the CNEL for most environmental settings.
                      Level of Service (LOS) Standard: A standard used by government agencies
                      to measure the quality or effectiveness of a municipal service, such as
                      police, fire, or library, or the performance of a facility, such as a street or
                      highway.
                      Level of Service (Traffic): A scale that measures the amount of traffic that a
                      roadway or intersection can accommodate, based on such factors as
                      maneuverability, driver dissatisfaction, and delay.
                      Level of Service A: Indicates a relatively free flow of traffic, with little or no
                      limitation on vehicle movement or speed.
                      Level of Service B: Describes a steady flow of traffic, with only slight delays

                      with some limitations on movement and speed, and occasional backups on
                      critical approaches.
                      Level of Service D: Designates the level where traffic nears an unstable flow.
                      Intersections still function, but short queues develop and cars may have to
                      wait through one cycle during short peaks.
                      Level of Service E: Represents traffic characterized by slow movement and
                      frequent (although momentary) stoppages. This type of congestion is
                      considered severe, but is not uncommon at peak traffic hours, with frequent
                      stopping, long-standing queues, and blocked intersections.
                      Level of Service F: Describes unsatisfactory stop-and-go traffic
                      characterized by “traffic jams” and stoppages of long duration. Vehicles at

state, often as a result of ground shaking during an earthquake.
Low-Income Household: A household with an annual income usually no
greater than 80 percent of the area median family income adjusted by
household size, as determined by a survey of incomes conducted by a city
or a county, or in the absence of such a survey, based on the latest
available eligibility limits established by the California Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD) and/or the United States
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
Low-Income Housing Tax Credits: Tax reductions provided by the Federal
and State governments for investors in housing for low-income households.

exceeded ten percent of the time. It is a commonly used descriptor of
community noise, and has been used in Federal Highway Administration
standards and the standards of some cities and counties.
Mercalli Intensity Scale: A subjective measure of the observed effects
(human reactions, structural damage, geologic effects) of an earthquake.
Expressed in Roman numerals from I to XII.
Mineral Resource: Land on which known deposits of commercially viable
mineral or aggregate deposits exist. This designation is applied to sites

operations and protect them from encroachment of incompatible land uses.
Mixed-Use: Properties on which various uses, such as office, commercial,
institutional, and residential, are combined in a single building or on a single
site in an integrated development project with significant functional
interrelationships and a coherent physical design. A “single site” may
include contiguous properties.
Moderate-Income Household: A household with an annual income between
the lower income eligibility limits and 120 percent of the area median family
income adjusted by household size, usually as established by the California
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) and/or the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

                      the park.
                      Noise: Any sound that is undesirable because it interferes with speech and
                      hearing, or is intense enough to damage hearing, or is otherwise annoying.
                      Noise, simply, is “unwanted sound.”
                      Noise Attenuation: Reduction of the level of a noise source using a
                      substance, material, or surface, such as earth berms and/or solid concrete
                      walls.
                      Noise Contour: A line connecting points of equal noise level as measured
                      on the same scale. Noise levels greater than the 60 Ldn contour (measured
                      in dBA) require noise attenuation in residential development.
                      Non-Attainment: The condition of not achieving a desired or required level
                      of performance. Frequently used in reference to air quality. (See

                      balconies or areas under projections which are less than 8 feet above
                      grade.
                      Ordinance: A law or regulation set forth and adopted by a governmental
                      authority, usually a city or county.
                      Parks: Open-space lands whose primary purpose is recreation.
GENERAL PLAN GLOSSARY                                                                          G-12

Performance Standards: Zoning regulations that permit uses based on a
particular set of standards of operation rather than on particular type of use.
Performance standards provide specific criteria limiting noise, air pollution,
emissions, odors, vibration, dust, dirt, glare, heat, fire hazards, wastes,
traffic impacts, and visual impact of a use.
Planning Area: The area directly addressed by the general plan. A city’s
planning area typically encompasses the city limits and potentially
annexable land within its sphere of influence.
Pollution, Non-Point: Sources for pollution that are less definable and
usually cover broad areas of land, such as agricultural land with fertilizers
that are carried from the land by runoff, or automobiles.
Pollution, Point: In reference to water quality, a discrete source from which
pollution is generated before it enters receiving waters, such as a sewer
outfall, a smokestack, or an industrial waste pipe.
Public and Quasi-public Facilities: Institutional, academic, governmental
and community service uses, either owned publicly or operated by non-
profit organizations, including private hospitals and cemeteries.
Redevelop: To demolish existing buildings; or to increase the overall floor
area existing on a property; or both; irrespective of whether a change
occurs in land use.
Regional: Pertaining to activities or economies at a scale greater than that
of a single jurisdiction, and affecting a broad geographic area.
Regional Housing Needs Plan/Share: A quantification by a COG or by HCD
of existing and projected housing need, by household income group, for all
localities within a region.
Regional Park: A park typically 150-500 acres in size focusing on activities
and natural features not included in most other types of parks and often
based on a specific scenic or recreational opportunity.
Residential Unit: A house, apartment, congregate care or shared housing
facility consisting of a group of rooms, or a single room occupied as
separate living quarters. Each separate living quarters shall be considered
as a separate housing unit. Separate living quarters are those in which the
occupants live separately from any other person in the building and have
direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall,
without regard to the type of dining facilities available.
GENERAL PLAN GLOSSARY                                                           G-13

                      Rezoning: An amendment to the map and/or text of a zoning ordinance to
                      effect a change in the nature, density, or intensity of uses allowed in a
                      zoning district and/or on a designated parcel or land area.
                      Richter Scale: A measure of the size or energy release of an earthquake at
                      its source. The scale is logarithmic; the wave amplitude of each whole
                      number on the scale is 10 times greater than that of the previous whole
                      number.
                      Right-of-Way: A strip of lane occupied or intended to be occupied by
                      certain transportation and public use facilities, such as roads, railroads, and
                      utility lines.
                      Sanitary Landfill: The controlled placement of refuse within a limited area,
                      followed by compaction and covering with a suitable thickness of earth and
                      other containment material.
                      Sanitary Sewer: A system of subterranean conduits that carries refuse
                      liquids or waste matter to a plant where the sewage is treated, as
                      contrasted with storm drainage systems (that carry surface water) and
                      septic tanks or leech fields (that hold refuse liquids and waste matter on-
                      site).
                      Seiche: An earthquake-generated wave in an enclosed body of water such
                      as a lake, reservoir, or bay.
                      Seismic: Caused by or subject to earthquakes or earth vibrations.
                      Solid Waste: Any unwanted or discarded material that is not a liquid or gas.
                      Includes organic wastes, paper products, metals, glass, plastics, cloth,
                      brick, rock, soil, leather, rubber, yard wastes, and wood, but does not
                      include sewage and hazardous materials. Organic wastes and paper
                      products comprise about 75 percent of typical urban solid waste.
                      Standards: (1) A rule or measure establishing a level of quality or quantity
                      that must be complied with or satisfied. Government Code §65302 requires
                      that general plans spell out the objectives, principles, “standards,” and
                      proposals of the general plan. Examples of standards might include the
                      number of acres of park land per 1,000 population that the community will
                      attempt to acquire and improve, or the “traffic Level of Service” (LOS) that
                      the plan hopes to attain. (2) Requirements in a zoning ordinance that
                      govern building and development as distinguished from use restrictions--for
                      example, site-design regulations such as lot area, height limit, frontage,
                      landscaping, and floor area ratio.
GENERAL PLAN GLOSSARY                                                                             G-14

Structure: Anything, including a building, located on the ground in a
permanent location or attached to something having a permanent location
on the ground.
Subdivision: The division of a tract of land into defined lots, either improved
or unimproved, which can be separately conveyed by sale or lease, and
which can be altered or developed. “Subdivision” includes a condominium
project as defined in Section 1350 of the California Civil Code and a
community apartment project as defined in Section 11004 of the Business
and Professions Code.
Subregional: Pertaining to a portion of a region.
Subsidence: The sudden sinking or gradual downward settling and
compaction of soil and other surface material with little or no horizontal
motion. Subsidence may be caused by a variety of human and natural
activity, including earthquakes.
Subsidize: To assist by payment of a sum of money or by the granting of
terms or favors that reduce the need for monetary expenditures. Housing
subsidies may take the forms of mortgage interest deductions or tax credits
from federal and/or state income taxes, sale or lease at less than market
value of land to be used for the construction of housing, payments to
supplement a minimum affordable rent, and the like.
Substandard Housing: Residential dwellings that, because of their physical
condition, do not provide safe and sanitary housing.
Sustainability: Community use of natural resources in a way that does not
jeopardize the ability of future generations to live and prosper.
Sustainable Development: Development that maintains or enhances
economic opportunity and community well-being while protecting and
restoring the natural environment upon which people and economies
depend. Sustainable development meets the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
(Source: Minnesota State Legislature.)
Traffic Model: A mathematical representation of traffic movement within an
area or region based on observed relationships between the kind and
intensity of development in specific areas. Many traffic models operate on
the theory that trips are produced by persons living in residential areas and
are attracted by various non-residential land uses.
Transit: The conveyance of persons or goods from one place to another by
means of a local, public transportation system.
GENERAL PLAN GLOSSARY                                                           G-15

                      Transit, Public: A system of regularly-scheduled buses and/or trains
                      available to the public on a fee-per-ride basis. Also called “Mass Transit.”
                      Transportation Demand Management (TDM): A strategy for reducing
                      demand on the road system by reducing the number of vehicles using the
                      roadways and/or increasing the number of persons per vehicle. TDM
                      attempts to reduce the number of persons who drive alone on the roadway
                      during the commute period and to increase the number in carpools,
                      vanpools, buses and trains, walking, and biking. TDM can be an element of
                      TSM (see below).
                      Transportation Systems Management (TSM): A comprehensive strategy
                      developed to address the problems caused by additional development,
                      increasing trips, and a shortfall in transportation capacity. Transportation
                      Systems Management focuses on more efficiently utilizing existing highway
                      and transit systems rather than expanding them. TSM measures are
                      characterized by their low cost and quick implementation time frame, such
                      as computerized traffic signals, metered freeway ramps, and one-way
                      streets.
                      Tree Preservation: The identification and preservation of “landmark” or
                      “heritage” trees, so that the trees may be enhanced and preserved as part
                      of the City’s “Community Forest.”
                      Trip: A one-way vehicular journey either to or from a site, or totally within the
                      site, i.e., internal trip. Each trip has two trip ends, one at the beginning and
                      the other at the destination.
                      Trip Generation: The dynamics that account for people making trips in
                      automobiles or by means of public transportation. Trip generation is the
                      basis for estimating the level of use for a transportation system and the
                      impact of additional development or transportation facilities on an existing,
                      local transportation system. Trip generations of households are correlated
                      with destinations that attract household members for specific purposes.
                      Tsunami: A large ocean wave generated by an earthquake in or near the
                      ocean.
                      Uniform Building Code (UBC) : A standard building code that sets forth
                      minimum standards for construction.
                      Urban: Of, relating to, characteristic of, or constituting a city. Urban areas
                      are generally characterized by moderate and higher density residential
                      development (i.e., three or more dwelling units per acre), commercial
                      development, and industrial development, and the availability of public
                      services required for that development, specifically central water and sewer,
                      an extensive road network, public transit, and other such services (e.g.,
GENERAL PLAN GLOSSARY                                                                              G-16

safety and emergency response). Development not providing such services
may be “non-urban” or “rural.” (See “Urban Land Use.”) CEQA defines
“urbanized area” as an area that has a population density of at least 1,000
persons per square mile - (Public Resources Code 21080.14(b)).
Urban Design: The attempt to give form, in terms of both beauty and
function, to selected urban areas or to whole cities. Urban design is
concerned with the location, mass, and design of various urban
components and combines elements of urban planning, architecture, and
landscape architecture.
Vehicle-Miles Traveled (VMT): A key measure of overall street and highway
use. Reducing VMT is often a major objective in efforts to reduce vehicular
congestion and achieve regional air quality goals.
Very-Low Income Household: A household with an annual income usually
no greater than 50 percent of the area median family income adjusted by
household size, as determined by a survey of incomes conducted by a city
or a county, or in the absence of such a survey, based on the latest
available eligibility limits established by the California Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD) and/or the United States
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
Volume-to-Capacity Ratio: A measure of the operating capacity of a
roadway or intersection, in terms of the number of vehicles passing through,
divided by the number of vehicles that theoretically could pass through
when the roadway or intersection is operating at its designed capacity.
Abbreviated as “V/C”. At a V/C ratio of 1.0, the roadway or intersection is
operating at capacity. If the ratio is less than 1.0, the traffic facility has
additional capacity. Although ratios slightly greater than 1.0 are possible, it
is more likely that the peak hour will elongate into a “peak period.”
Zoning: The division of a city or county by legislative regulations into areas,
or zones, that specify allowable uses for real property and size restrictions
for buildings within these areas; a program that implements policies of the
General Plan.
GENERAL PLAN GLOSSARY                                                           G-17

CHAPTER 13
IMPLEMENTATION
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Cerritos General Plan Implementation Program describes the actions to
be undertaken to implement the goals and policies as expressed in each of
the General Plan’s ten Elements. The City of Cerritos shall conduct an
annual review of the Implementation Program in conjunction with the annual
budget cycle to ensure the City’s fiscal resources can adequately respond
to the policies and programs expressed in the General Plan.
The actions described in the implementation program are organized by
General Plan Element. The implementation actions are not organized to
imply priority of a particular sequence of actions. Annual review of this
program in conjunction with fiscal resources shall determine future
implementation priorities.
The City of Cerritos intends to ensure continuous interaction between the
General Plan and its Implementation Actions that will ensure a high level of
consistency. As conditions or circumstances merit change, refinements to
the General Plan and Implementation Program will be initiated.
IMPLEMENTATION                                                               IMP-1

               LAND USE ELEMENT
               o IMP-LU-1: Update Cerritos Zoning Ordinance
                 The City of Cerritos strives to provide a balance of residential,
                 commercial and industrial land uses through the provision of incentives,
                 coordinated land use and circulation planning, and variety of housing
                 types.
                 To ensure the provision of balance of land uses, the City of Cerritos will
                 evaluate the existing zoning code in relation to the goals, policies and
                 objectives of the General Plan to evaluate potential conflicts with the
                 Zoning Code. The evaluation will seek the establishment of a high level
                 of consistency between the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance.
               o IMP-LU-2: Establish an Economic Development Strategic Plan
                 The City of Cerritos seeks the promotion of existing commercial centers
                 to assist in their growth and vitality. The City also encourages the
                 participation of property owners and tenants in assure future success
                 responds to market demands, local and regional consumer needs.
                 To assist in future growth and vitality of retail/commercial development,
                 the City should establish an Economic Development Strategic Plan that
                 will initiate specific strategies to market, attract and retain a variety of
                 retail and commercial uses. The Plan will determine market demand
                 through resident surveys and market studies.
               o IMP-LU-3: Expansion of ADP-5
                 ADP-5 includes the Cerritos Auto Square. The original ADP was
                 subsequently amended to permit restricted commercial uses that would
                 enhance and support the regional character of this commercial area.
                 ADP-5 provides a significant contribution to the economic vitality of the
                 City. The regulated and strategic growth of this area is a priority for the
                 City. The Cerritos Auto Square is currently fully developed. Vacant land
                 for the expansion of the Auto Square is currently not available, and
                 therefore, the dealerships make use of many of the surrounding power
                 line easements and industrial sites for vehicle storage.
                 To enhance the future economic strength of the Cerritos Auto Square,
                 the City will evaluate expanding ADP-5 to include the area west of the I-
                 605 Freeway, south of Artesia Boulevard and east of Crusader Avenue;
                 the area northeast of the I-605 Freeway along either side of Studebaker
                 Road and south of Artesia Boulevard; and, the area and/or parcels
                 located at the northwest and northeast corners of Studebaker Road and
                 South Street.
IMPLEMENTATION                                                                           IMP-2
o IMP-LU-4: Continue Proactive Code Enforcement Activities
     The City of Cerritos strives to preserve, promote and protect the existing
     high-quality development that characterizes the quality of life in Cerritos.
     Preservation and protection of the quality of life is partly accomplished
     through the proactive engagement in code enforcement activities.
     The City of Cerritos will continue to proactively conduct code
     enforcement activities citywide.
IMPLEMENTATION                                                                    IMP-3
               COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
               o IMP-CD-1: Establish Comprehensive Gateway Improvement Program
                 The City of Cerritos seeks the strengthening and maintenance of the
                 physical features that distinguish Cerritos from surrounding
                 communities. The City of Cerritos prides itself on the quality of major
                 gateways and arterials citywide.
                 To enhance and maintain the quality of gateways, the City of Cerritos
                 intends to implement a gateway improvement program for select
                 significant gateways along major arterials. The gateway program may
                 include a combination of monument identification signs, enhanced
                 landscaping and public art.
               o IMP-CD-2: Master Plan for Artwork in Public Places
                 The City of Cerritos has an Art in Public Places Program that
                 encourages the incorporation of publicly-accessible artwork in exterior
                 and interior places. The City places great value in public art and seeks
                 opportunities to utilize public art in all public and private development
                 projects.
                 To enhance the provision of public art citywide, the City should develop
                 a Master Plan for artwork in public places as an extension of the Art in
                 Public Places program to include the creation of landscape
                 environments and to establish standards and guidelines for the setting
                 and display of artwork.
               o IMP-CD-3: Establish a Street Tree and Furniture Palette
                 An attractive streetscape is an important factor in the creation of a
                 positive image for the City of Cerritos. Attractive street environments will
                 complement private and public properties, create beauty within the
                 public right-of-way and provide a heightened level of pedestrian
                 comfort.
                 To enhance the quality of the streetscape environment, the City shall
                 implement a comprehensive street tree and furniture palette citywide.
                 The palette shall provide a comprehensive and uniform set of guidelines
                 for the development of future improvements within the public right-of-
                 way.
               o IMP-CD-4: Implement Priority-Based Utility Undergrounding Program
                 Overhead utilities play a significant role in degrading the physical quality
                 of the built environment. The City considers the undergrounding of
IMPLEMENTATION                                                                          IMP-4
     utilities an effective means for enhancing the quality of the streetscape
     environment.
     To contribute to the enhancement of the streetscape environment in the
     public right-of-way, the City of Cerritos shall implement a priority-based
     program for the underground of utilities. The program shall be
     coordinated with other physical improvements and prioritized based on
     a variety of factors, including location and cost.
o IMP-CD-5: Continued Enforcement of Sign Ordinance
     Poor signage is viewed as a significant factor in degrading the quality of
     the built environment. The City of Cerritos seeks to ensure commercial
     signs do not detract from the City’s high-quality image, while
     recognizing the need for effective business identification.
     The City of Cerritos will continue to enforce the Sign Ordinance to
     ensure that quality sign programs are maintained citywide.
o IMP-CD-6: Review Design and Location of Wireless Telecommunication
     Facilities
     Wireless telecommunication facilities have the potential to negatively
     impact the aesthetic quality of the community.
     The City of Cerritos will continue to regulate where wireless
     telecommunications are sited in the City. In addition, the City will ensure
     that the design of the facilities are consistent with and maintain the high-
     quality aesthetic values of the community.
IMPLEMENTATION                                                                    IMP-5

               CIRCULATION ELEMENT

                  the City of Cerritos will implement, monitor and enforce the LOS
                  standards established in the Circulation Element of the General Plan.
               o IMP-CIR-2: Implement Traffic Signal Coordination
                  The City of Cerritos seeks to provide an efficient transportation system.
                  To achieve greater system efficiency, the City shall implement a traffic
                  signal coordination program that will enhance traffic flow and reduce
                  delays incurred at signalized intersections.
               o IMP-CIR-3: Develop Neighborhood Traffic Monitoring
                  The function of secondary and local roadways throughout the City
                  should reduce and or eliminate through traffic in residential areas
                  without negatively impacting circulation within and between
                  neighborhoods.
                  To ensure neighborhood traffic does not become negatively impacted
                  due to congestion on arterials and primary roadways, the City shall
                  develop and implement and neighborhood traffic monitoring program.
                  This program shall periodically monitor traffic at the neighborhood level.
               o IMP-CIR-4: Identify and Evaluate High-Accident Locations
                  The safety of motorists on Cerritos roadways is a concern to the City
                  and residents of the community. Planning and design of the circulation
                  system should minimize safety hazards and encourage safe operating
                  conditions.
                  To ensure the continued safety of roadways in Cerritos, the City will
                  identify and evaluate locations that have experienced higher accident
                  rates. The City shall evaluate these locations and recommend and
                  implements improvements to address identified deficiencies.
               o IMP-CIR-5: Implement and Maintain “Recommended Routes to School”
                  Program
                  The safety of bicyclists and pedestrians, especially children, is a priority
                  for the City. To enhance safety of children traveling to and from school,
                  the City shall coordinate with ABC Unified School District to implement
                  and maintain a “Recommended Routes to School” Program. The
IMPLEMENTATION                                                                           IMP-6

     Program is intended to provide a guide to parents and guardians
     related to the most safe routes to schools and provide guidance on
     safety measures students can take when traveling to school.
o IMP-CIR-6: Implement Transportation Demand Management Strategies
     The City of Cerritos strives to provide various options for the reduction in
     transportation demand for Cerritos residents and employers. To
     provide a variety of transportation reduction options, the City shall
     investigate and implement transportation demand management
     strategies for new developments citywide. Programs may include
     public transportation, parking management and other demand-related
     options, as well as the use of technology (i.e., use of the internet) to
     reduce the number of trips in the community.
o IMP-CIR-7: Consistent Street and Landmark Sign Program
     The City of Cerritos understands that adequate wayfinding and signage
     plays an integral role in aesthetics and efficient movement of traffic
     citywide. To enhance the aesthetic quality of the environment and
     contribute to the efficient movement of traffic, the City shall implement a
     consistent street and landmark sign program.
IMPLEMENTATION                                                                    IMP-7
               HOUSING ELEMENT
               o IMP-HOU-1: Density Bonus Program
                 Continue the City’s Density Bonus Program that grants a density bonus
                 of 25 percent, along with other regulatory concessions to ensure lower
                 development costs, for developers that allocate at least 20 percent of
                 the units in a housing project to lower income households, or 10
                 percent for very low income households, or at least 50 percent for
                 “qualifying residents” (e.g. senior citizens). The Program ensures
                 affordability of all lower income density bonus units for a minimum 30-
                 year period.
               o IMP-HOU-2: Single-Family Housing Addition Program
                 Create a program that will use the Cerritos Redevelopment Agency’s
                 set-aside funds to offer grants and low interest loans to single family
                 homeowners that would allow for the construction of housing additions.
                 Very Low and Low Income households would be eligible for grants and
                 Moderate Income households would be eligible for low interest loans.
               o IMP-HOU-3: Large Family Housing Study
                 Investigate the various housing needs of large families in the
                 community.
               o IMP-HOU-4: Shared Housing Program
                 Establish membership with the Area Agency on Ageing-Shared Housing
                 Program or other such organizations that assist seniors in finding
                 roommates. The establishment of this program would allow seniors to
                 reduce their individual housing costs.
               o IMP-HOU-5: Officer/Fireman/Teacher/City           Employee      Next   Door
                 Homeowners Assistance Program
                 Investigate the feasibility of creating a program that would offer single-
                 family homes at a discount to sheriffs or firemen assigned to the City of
                 Cerritos, peace officers or firemen assigned to adjacent jurisdictions,
                 ABC Unified School District teachers, and City of Cerritos employees.
                 Eligible participants must have a Moderate Income (between 80 and
                 120 percent of the median income). Terms of the proposed program
                 may require: 1) participants to live in the subject property as their sole
                 residence for at least fifteen years after purchase; and 2) include a
                 discount off the list price of the subject property in the form of a second
                 mortgage that is the equivalent of the discounted price that will be
                 waived after the mandatory occupancy period is satisfied. If the buyer
IMPLEMENTATION                                                                           IMP-8

     leaves the home during the mandatory occupancy period, he/she will be
     required to repay the Agency a portion of the second mortgage
     depending on length of occupancy.
o IMP-HOU-6: Equal Housing Program
     Obtain services from the Fair Housing Council of Los Angeles County to
     administer the Equal Housing Program and act as an independent third-
     party to discrimination complaints. The City will make available literature
     on the Program at the Cerritos City Hall, Chamber of Commerce,
     Library, website and other areas that the community gathers
     information.
o IMP-HOU-7: Homeless Shelter Program
     Continued annual contribution to local homeless shelters in the region.
     Specifically, the continued $50,000 contribution to the Rio Hondo shelter
     for the homeless and the $20,000 contribution to the Su Casa Crisis and
     Support Center/Transitional Housing for battered women.
o IMP-HOU-8: Senior and Disabled Citizen Labor Assistance Program
     Organize additional county and local community groups and
     organizations to provide labor for minor housing repair and
     maintenance for the senior and disabled community.
o IMP-HOU-9: Simplified Residential Development Review Process
     The City will review the development process in order to further
     encourage the development of affordable housing through fast-tracking,
     streamlining or consolidation.
o IMP-HOU-10: Review of Residential Development Fees
     Review residential development fees to encourage the continued
     development of housing. The City should also determine the need and
     appropriateness of said fee requirements to ensure that developers are
     adequately contributing towards their fair share of the development
     costs.
o IMP-HOU-11: Land Use Element Review Program
     As part of the General Plan, the Land Use Element will be reviewed
     periodically to determine if any non-residential zoned land can be
     converted to residential uses and to evaluate possibilities of higher
     residential land densities in an effort to investigate ways of maximizing
IMPLEMENTATION                                                                   IMP-9
                 land use and identify possible new or under-utilized sites appropriate for
                 multifamily development.
               o IMP-HOU-12: Multi-Family Housing Program
                 After the Land Use Element is updated and a site database of vacant or
                 under-utilized land has been created, the Redevelopment Agency will
                 identify appropriate sites for multifamily development. The City will then
                 discuss with the owners of the identified sites, the possibility of the City
                 acquiring the sites for future multifamily development. The zoning
                 requirement of multifamily development being on no less than 3-acres
                 of land will not apply to this Program. Specifically, since multifamily
                 developments such as the Emerald Villas and Pioneer Villas Affordable
                 Senior Housing Projects require the creation of unique development
                 guidelines, standard Multifamily Residential (RM) zoning requirements
                 are not applicable resulting in the creation of an Area Development Plan
                 (ADP). In addition to the 126 unit Emerald Villas, 98 units Pioneer Villas,
                 and 147 units Chancellor Village projects, the City is proposing to
                 develop a for -sale senior housing project at the southeast corner of
                 Carmenita Road and 183rd Street.
               o IMP-HOU-13: Housing Element Review Program
                 The Housing Element will be reviewed annually to evaluate the
                 effectiveness, appropriateness and progress of the Cerritos housing
                 goals, programs and actions.
               o IMP-HOU-14: Redevelopment Set-Aside Fund Transfers
                 Research feasibility and need of redevelopment set-aside fund
                 transfers. Explore the possible benefits of AB 2041, which recognizes
                 the difficulty cities may have building low and moderate income housing
                 due to the availability and cost of land. The Assembly Bill would allow
                 cities to establish a joint powers authority that would pool their low and
                 moderate income housing funds to allow for affordable housing to be
                 built in their surrounding area. Determine the likelihood the surrounding
                 cities in the immediate area would participate.
               o IMP-HOU-15: Regional Cooperation
                 Work in conjunction with other municipalities and regional agencies like
                 the Gateway Cities COG in an effort to promote regional cooperation
                 regarding housing needs.
IMPLEMENTATION                                                                          IMP-10
o IMP-HOU-16: Owner-Occupied Housing Rehabilitation
     Investigate need for a low interest rehabilitation loan or grant program
     that would be utilized to allow citizens of Cerritos to make improvements
     to their homes or correct code violations on first-need criteria. If the
     need is present, implement program with priority for senior and disabled
     persons that are within the Very Low, Low and Moderate Income
     Groups and homeowners that have been identified as violating City
     housing codes that are within the Very Low, Low and Moderate Income
     Groups.
o IMP-HOU-17: City Wide Pride Program
     Continue to support and expand the City Wide Pride beautification
     program and other neighborhood associations in an effort to maintain
     the City’s existing housing stock by encouraging residents and property
     owners, through proactive enforcement and positive reinforcement, to
     maintain their property.
o IMP-HOU-18: Residential Assistance Program
     Continue the Residential Assistance Program to maintain the existing
     housing stock in the City. Priority status will be given to homeowners
     that have been identified as violating the Cerritos Municipal Code and
     that are within the Very Low, Low and Moderate income groups.
o IMP-HOU-19: Cerritos Code Enforcement Program
     Continue proactive enforcement of existing Municipal Code provisions
     relating to the appropriate use and development of properties
     throughout the City.
o IMP-HOU-20: Sub-Standard Property Abatement Program
     Continuation of Program that allows for the removal of sub-standard
     properties and properties in continual violation of the Municipal Code
     which threaten the health, safety and welfare of the community.

     Preserve government assisted units at-risk of conversion to market rate
     uses.
IMPLEMENTATION                                                                 IMP-11

               o IMP-HOU-22: Energy Conservation Program
                 Implement a program that educates the public regarding energy
                 conservation and promotes the use of alternative energy sources
                 through financial reimbursement programs.
               o IMP-HOU-23: Lead-Based Paint and Asbestos Reduction Program
                 Evaluate the need for a lead-based paint and asbestos reduction
                 program. If a need exists, implement a program that offers financial
                 reimbursements to affected housing unit owners.
               o IMP-HOU-24: First-Time Home Buyers Assistance Program
                 Determine if there is a need for a First-Time Home Buyers Assistance
                 Program. If need exists, investigate possible consulting firms with
                 whom to contract out that can coordinate and administer such a
                 program. The program, if necessary, would target households that are
                 in the Low and Moderate Income Groups.
               o IMP-HOU-25: Downtown Rebound Planning Grant
                 Apply for a Downtown Rebound Planning Grant. The City will conduct a
                 feasibility analysis and create an action plan regarding increasing
                 housing through removing barriers and promoting infill housing, mixed-
                 use developments and transit corridor development in Cerritos
                 “downtown” area, with an emphasis on creating the maximum amount
                 of affordable housing under the Downtown Rebound Planning Grant
                 guidelines.
               o IMP-HOU-26: AB 1290 - Redevelopment Agency Implementation Plan
                 The Redevelopment Agency Implementation Plan (AB 1290) will be
                 reviewed on an annual basis to evaluate the effectiveness,
                 appropriateness and progress of the Cerritos Redevelopment Agency.
IMPLEMENTATION                                                                    IMP-12

o IMP-SAF-1: Annually Review SEMS Multi-Hazard Functional Plan
     A variety of man-made and natural hazards have the potential to harm
     Cerritos residents. The City’s Standardized Emergency Management
     System Multi-Hazard Functional Plan provides the evaluation of
     potential hazards and the programs and methods to respond to a
     hazard event.
     To ensure the evaluation of potential hazards in the City is current and
     contingency plans are in place, the City will conduct an annual review of
     the SEMS Multi-Hazard Functional Plan. The review will examine
     potential hazard and appropriateness of contingency plans to address
     potential hazards.
o IMP-SAF-2: Implement a Public Outreach/Educational Program for
     Hazardous Materials
     The City of Cerritos understands many of the threats associated with the
     use, storage and disposal of hazardous materials can be reduced
     through the incorporation of a variety of precautions. Business,
     property owner and resident knowledge and implementation of
     appropriate precautions significantly reduce the potential danger
     associated with hazardous materials.
     To enhance public awareness of the appropriate methods/techniques
     for the use, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, the City shall
     implement and public outreach and educational program for hazardous
     materials. The program shall consist of the provision of educational
     literature and other outreach materials as appropriate.
o IMP-SAF-3: Implement a GIS-based Inventory of all Underground
     Pipelines
     Knowledge of the location and extent of underground utilities citywide is
     an important factor in reducing the likelihood of hazards associated with
     construction activities or natural events.
     To reduce the potential for hazards associated with undergound
     pipelines, the City shall implement a GIS-based inventory of
     underground utilities citywide. The inventory will provide the City with a
     comprehensive database of underground pipelines, including the
     location and type of facilities located within the City limits.
IMPLEMENTATION                                                                  IMP-13

               o IMP-SAF-4: Implement Safety Considerations into the Development
                 Review Process
                 The City of Cerritos understands the most effective means to mitigate
                 potential safety concerns related to new development is through
                 evaluation during the development review process.
                 To ensure safety issues are adequately addressed for all new
                 development, the City will incorporate review procedures into the
                 development review process. These procedures will be coordinated
                 with applicable City agencies, including police and fire, and provide a
                 means for applicable agencies to comment on potential safety
                 concerns.
               o IMP-SAF-5: Implement Educational Outreach Program Related to Crime
                 Toward Cerritos’ Youth
                 The reduction in the potential for crime can be maintained and
                 expanded outreach to the community. The City of Cerritos understands
                 that focused efforts in community involvement and education related to
                 crime prevention and public safety. Cerritos’ youth population is a
                 particularly important segment to educate.
                 The City of Cerritos will implement a focused educational outreach
                 program towards Cerritos’ youth population. The outreach activities
                 may include programs, educational materials and cooperation with the
                 Sheriff’s Department, schools, business organizations and other
