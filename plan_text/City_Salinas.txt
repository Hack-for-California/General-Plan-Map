Introduction
Introduction to the General Plan
GENERAL PLAN
Need for	Today, Salinas is a compact urban community within a unique
General Plan	agricultural setting. Unlike the vaguely defined boundaries and sprawl
that characterize so much of urban California, the highly-productive agricultural lands surrounding Salinas create a distinct urban/agricultural edge that serves as a reminder of the source of the area’s economic well-being. The City lies at the north end of the Salinas Valley, known as “The Salad Bowl of the World,” and is the processing and shipping point for lettuce, broccoli, mushrooms, and strawberries, along with numerous other crops. The climate is also ideal for the floral industry and grape vineyards planted by world-famous vintners. With its mild climate and fertile soil, Salinas has become the processing and shipping point for one of the world’s largest agricultural centers. Although agriculture forms its economic base, the
economy has diversified substantially over the last 20 years.
To protect this valuable agricultural resource and economic base, Salinas must continue to actively manage its future growth and development. Planning for the future means providing for employment and housing to meet the demands of new population growth, while also providing urban services and facilities to maintain the community’s quality of life. This can be accomplished by: stimulating new economic growth; revitalizing older areas; finding new uses for underutilized land, assuring public safety and quality urban services; and developing new land adjacent to the existing City, in selected areas, to minimize the conflicts on agricultural productivity and to protect the continued viability of the most productive agricultural lands. To that end, the General Plan serves as a policy guide for determining the appropriate physical development and character of Salinas.
The Salinas General Plan was last comprehensively updated in 1988, and substantial changes have occurred both within and outside the community during the last 14 years. Salinas has grown from a population of approximately 100,000 persons at that time to over 150,000 in 2002, while the population in Monterey County has increased 60,000 from a population of under 350,000 to over 410,000 during that same period. This indicates that Salinas absorbed 83 percent (50,000 -5- 60,000) of Monterey County’s growth within that

period. The community of Salinas faces significant challenges ahead as it attempts to accommodate future growth, while protecting its agricultural heritage and quality of life.
Over the past fifty years, the community of Salinas has undergone extensive change. Once a small agricultural community of 14,000 persons in 1950, Salinas has expanded to become the largest city in the County with a population of over 143,000. The City’s rapid growth has occurred largely over the last thirty years with population more than doubling from 58,896 residents in 1970 to 143,776 in 2000. The City’s population is expected to continue to grow at a similar pace over the next twenty to thirty years.
Salinas is also the employment center of Monterey County, supporting about one-third of all jobs in the County. Business services comprise one-third of all jobs in Salinas. The wholesale/retail sector is the second largest group, comprising 26 percent of all jobs. The third sector includes all agricultural related jobs, including manufacturing, and comprises approximately 16 percent of the City’s economy. Salinas is projected to receive over 25 percent of the countywide employment growth over the next twenty years. As with the current workforce percentages, most of this employment will occur in the business services, wholesale/retail, and agricultural sectors, with average salaries ranging from a high of approximately $53,000 annually for managerial and professional occupations to a low of about $12,000 annually for farm workers.
Likely because of the large percentage of workers in the agricultural field, whose employment is often seasonal, Salinas’ unemployment rate was more than double the State average of 5.3 percent in 2001, with even greater spikes in unemployment occurring in the winter months. These weak employment levels serve as an indicator of the City’s labor market conditions and point to potential cost-of-living imbalances between housing prices and employment in the community.1
The City’s rapid growth and role as the employment center of Monterey County has placed significant demand on the City’s housing supply. Substantial growth in employment opportunities in the Silicon

Introduction
Valley has also placed pressure on the Salinas housing market as persons moving to the Central Coast and Bay Area look to Salinas for more affordable housing opportunities than exist in the Silicon Valley. Also adding pressure has been growth in the tourism/hospitality industry on the Monterey Peninsula without corresponding construction of housing for the workers. This increasing demand has resulted in both steady construction and escalating prices for housing in Salinas.
Higher homeownership and rental prices mixed with high unemployment rates and lower wages has resulted in families and nonfamily households doubling up to be able to afford their housing payments. It is estimated that overcrowding affects at least 29 percent of all renter households in Salinas and 11 percent of owner households. Overcrowding rates in Salinas are higher in comparison to Monterey County as a whole, where 21 percent of renters and 8 percent of owners lived in overcrowded housing conditions.
These challenges indicate a need for the continued development of a variety of housing and employment opportunities in the community to create more affordable housing opportunities and diversify the types of jobs available. Expansion of the housing and employment opportunities available in the community, which will require expansion of urban development into some areas currently used for agriculture, will help address the cost of living imbalance in the community and provide the housing necessary to meet the future growth projected for Salinas. Addressing this imbalance and providing a variety of housing and employment opportunities will result in a strengthened economy, more affordable housing opportunities and less overcrowding, and will increase quality of life for many residents in the community.
Agriculture is not only the third largest employment sector in the County, it is also the economic base for Salinas. Thus, there needs to be a balance between agricultural land and other land uses that are needed if agriculture is to survive. This includes housing and services for farmworkers and land for agricultural support industries.
A General Plan that reflects the values and aspirations of the community for the future provides valuable assistance in meeting these challenges and achieving success through thoughtful decision making.

Introduction
Salinas Planning Area
Salinas contains approximately 18.8 square miles of land (or about 12,000 acres) and is located in northern Monterey County about ten miles east of Monterey Bay, between the Gabilan Mountain range to the northeast and the Santa Lucia to the southwest. The community is divided by the Highway 101 corridor which extends to the north connecting with the San Francisco Bay Area and to the south connecting with other smaller agricultural communities, such as Gonzales, Soledad, Greenfield, and King City.
Figure 1-1 depicts the planning area for Salinas, which includes the City and adjacent unincorporated land that relates to long-range planning for the community. Much of the land in the planning area surrounding the City is in agricultural use and is not identified for urban development. However, maintaining compatibility between future urban development described in the General Plan and adjacent agricultural use is an important aspect of long-range planning.
For centuries prior to the arrival of Spanish soldiers and missionaries, and the establishment of the presidio at Monterey and missions at Carmel, San Antonio, Soledad and San Juan Bautista, the Salinas area was home to the Costanoan Indians. The Salinas Indians „ and Esselen Indians were also found in Monterey County. While the Salinas Valley remained generally unpopulated under Spanish rule, there were small settlements around the

missions.
Salinas was bom after Mexico seceded from Spain in 1822 and began granting rancho lands to settlers. In the 1850s, two of these ranchos, the 6,700-acre Rancho Nacional and the 10,000-acre Rancho Sausal, formed the nucleus of what is today the City of Salinas.
Named for a nearby salt marsh, Salinas has existed as a town since 1856. Salinas began as a cattle-raising center and, through the California Rodeo, the community pays homage annually to this western heritage. With its beginnings in wheat, barley, and cattle ranching, growth as a town began in the late 1860s when the fertility of the valley was publicized. Salinas became the seat of Monterey County in 1872,

coinciding with the arrival of the Southern Pacific Railroad, and incorporated in 1874.
In 1899, Claus Spreckels completed construction of the world’s largest sugar beet processing factory and the sugar beet reigned from the early 1900s to the 1920s. Growing sugar beets for the huge mill at Spreckels (1899-1982) established large-scale irrigated agriculture. Also, by the early 1900s, dairies had become a major component of the valley’s economy, employing newly developed condensing processes.
During the 1920s, a major change in agriculture occurred with the introduction of lettuce and other row crops, including the artichoke. The development of ice-bunkered railroad cars made it possible to ship fresh produce nationwide, and lettuce soon replaced the sugar beet as the Salinas Valley mainstay. Construction of Reclamation Ditch 1665 in 1917 also had an effect on agricultural production in the area because construction of the ditch allowed marshland areas to be converted to farmland. The availability of electrical power also affected farming practices as electric power allowed farmers to extract groundwater, which allowed for a greater variety of crops to be planted and harvested, as the agricultural operations no longer had to rely solely on rainwater.
The significant points of identification for Salinas today are its agricultural crops and the life and work of Nobel/Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist John Steinbeck. The community offers many attractions for locals and visitors, including the California Rodeo, National Steinbeck Center, Steinbeck House, California International Airshow, Mariachi Festival, antique fairs, and community festivals. With its rich heritage of ethnic and cultural diversity, Salinas has retained its western town image and its status as the dominant urban center in Monterey County.

The community of Salinas offers excellent quality of life and a livable community for its residents by maintaining an appropriate balance among its various interests. A compact city form is maintained by revitalizing older neighborhoods through redevelopment, infill development, and selective increases in residential density.

another, so that residents can live, work, shop, and play in the community. A variety of housing types is available to meet the needs of all residents.
While allowing for new growth in prescribed areas, agricultural lands are preserved. Agriculture and retail continue to be the primary economic bases for Salinas, although expansion of other industries provides job opportunities that allow greater upward mobility in the community. Upward mobility is also encouraged through training and educational opportunities creating a more educated workforce.
Surrounded by and instilled with natural beauty, the community of Salinas values both the natural and human-made resources that contribute to its character. To protect these resources and community character, management offuture growth is important.
As growth occurs, the City provides adequate public services, facilities and infrastructure to support its population and maintain the community’s quali ty of life. Public safety in Salinas is ensured through a variety of community programs, public services and community design techniques. Adequate parkland offers recreational opportunities for all. The circulation system provides convenient access for City residents and regional travelers, as well as access for pedestrians and cyclists.
Purpose of the	California law requires each city to adopt a comprehensive, long-term
General Plan	General Plan to guide the physical development of the incorporated
area and land outside municipal boundaries that bears a relationship to its planning activities. In essence, a city’s General Plan serves as the blueprint for future growth and development. As a blueprint for the future, the plan must contain policies and programs designed to provide decision makers with a solid basis for decisions related to land use and development.
According to State law, the General Plan is the primary document the City uses to regulate land use. Consequendy, the Zoning Code, Specific Plans, and individual public and private development proposals must be consistent with the Plan goals, policies, and standards.

Introduction
The Salinas General Plan addresses many issues that are directly related to and influence land use decisions. In addition to land use, State law requires the Plan to address circulation, housing, conservation of natural resources, preservation of open space, noise environment, and protection of public safety (Section 65302 of the California Government Code). These issues are discussed in the General Plan to the extent that they apply to Salinas. The Plan also addresses community design, a topic of special interest.
The Community Design Element is an integral component of the General Plan and is essential in achieving the community’s vision for the future. The Community Design Element addresses actions the City can take to protect its image and identity, preserve and maintain its neighborhoods, and enhance community livability. The community livability principles and practices contained within the element promote land uses, design guidelines, and services and facilities that enhance quality of life and promote a vibrant community.
Although community livability principles are primarily addressed in the Community Design Element, these principles are woven throughout the General Plan. For example, policies within the Circulation Element addressing alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycle and pedestrian facilities, support community livability principles, as do Land Use Element policies encouraging mixed uses and compact development. The policies and programs within the Housing Element also promote community livability by providing for a diversity of housing types that enables citizens from a wide range of economic levels and age groups to live within the community. Policies within the
Conservation/Open Space Element addressing natural and historic resource preservation and enhancement, the provision and maintenance of open space and recreational facilities, as well as energy conservation also promote local and regional livability. Implemented together, these goals, policies, and programs provide a framework for enhancing the quality of life for residents, workers, and businesses in Salinas.

Introduction
Organization and Use of the Plan
The City of Salinas General Plan contains goals, policies, and plans that are intended to guide land use and development decisions in the future. The General Plan consists of a Land Use Policy Map and the following seven elements, or chapters, which together fulfill the State requirements for a General Plan:
Land Use Element Community Design Element Housing Element Conservation/Open Space Element Circulation Element Safety Element
Noise Element
The Salinas elements sometimes deviate from the State-mandated elements in non-substantive ways. For example, public utilities are included in the State requirements for the Circulation Element, but are addressed in the Land Use Element of the Salinas General Plan. The Plan also includes a non-mandatory element, Community Design.
Supporting Documentation
Several supporting documents were produced during the development of the Salinas General Plan, including the Existing Conditions Report, and the General Plan Program Environmental Impact Report (Program EIR). Other technical reports used in preparing the Plan include those for traffic/circulation, fiscal impact, and market conditions.
Plan Organization and Use
The General Plan is comprised of this Introduction and seven elements. Each element is complete in itself, but is an integral part of the General Plan. The General Plan is accompanied by a Glossary (Appendices A). The elements, with associated Implementation Program will help the City achieve its vision for the future. Each of the seven General Plan elements is organized according to the following format:	1)
Introduction; 2) Issues, Goals and Policies; 3) Plan; and 4) Implementation Programs. Except the Housing Element which is slightly modified to meet State requirements.

Introduction
The Introduction of each element describes the focus and the purpose of the element. The Introduction identifies other plans and programs outside of the General Plan that may be used to achieve specific General Plan goals. The relationship of the element to other General Plan elements is also specified in the Introduction.
The Issues, Goals and Policies section of each element contains a description of identified planning issues, goals, and policies related to the element topic. The issues, goals, and policies are based on input received from the community, members of the Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC), members of the Planning Commission and City Council, and City staff.
The issues represent the needs, concerns or desires addressed by the General Plan. The goals are overall statements of community desires and consist of broad statements of purpose or direction. The policies serve as guides to the City Council, Planning Commission, other City commissions and boards, and City staff in reviewing development proposals and making other decisions that affect the future growth and development of Salinas.
Each element also contains a Plan section. The Plan section offers an overview of the City’s course of action to implement the identified goals and policies. For example, the Land Use Element contains a “Land Use Plan” indicating the types and intensities of land use permitted in the City. The Circulation Element contains a “Circulation Plan” describing the overall circulation system required to meet the future needs of Salinas. Wherever possible, the Plan contains illustrative maps, diagrams, and tables.
Following the Plan is the Implementation Program which identifies specific actions to achieve the goals, policies, and plans identified in each General Plan element. The Implementation Program is reviewed and updated periodically to update specific actions, schedules, responsible parties, and measures to ensure that General Plan goals, policies, and plans are implemented.

Introduction
Community Participation in the General Plan Program
The Glossary is an appendix of the General Plan (Appendix A) and provides a set of definitions for technical terms used in the Plan.
The organization of the General Plan allows users to turn to the section that interests them and quickly obtain a perspective of City policies on the subject. However, General Plan users should realize that the policies in the various elements are interrelated and should be examined comprehensively. Policies are presented as written statements, tables, diagrams, and maps. All of these policy components must be considered together when making planning decisions.
Public participation played an important role in the Salinas General Plan program and update. Because the General Plan reflects community goals, citizen input was essential in identifying issues and formulating goals. Public participation in the General Plan preparation process occurred through the following methods:
Public participation began with a series of three bilingual (English/Spanish) Visioning Workshops involving City staff, consultants, and the public. Community members were invited to the Workshops to discuss their visions for the future of Salinas and to comment on major issues facing the City.
Three bilingual Council District Meetings were then held in different locations throughout Salinas. The purpose of these meetings was to describe the overall General Plan program to the community and identify major issues to be addressed in the General Plan based on input provided at the district and neighborhood level.
Topic Group Meetings (Spanish translation available and written materials bilingual) were held as part of the General Plan program. Members of the community were provided information about six major topics of importance in the General Plan program, including housing, agriculture, transportation, economic development, water, and community livability.
Eight meetings were held with a City Council-appointed Citizen Advisory Committee(CAC). The CAC consisted of: representatives of the Planning Commission and other standing commissions; representatives of the community at large; and leaders from the housing, water, agriculture and business communities within Salinas. The CAC assisted in the formulation of a long-range vision

for the future of Salinas, as well as identified General Plan issues, developed goals and policies, and provided recommendations to the Planning Commission and City Council for land use and circulation alternatives. The public was invited to share their comments and concerns with members of the CAC during these meetings.
The City used its Website to provide current information on the General Plan update program. Summaries of the public participation meetings and information on program progress were posted on the website.
A bilingual brochure describing the General Plan and update process was mailed to all addresses in the City. It included a mail-back survey card, which asked respondents to rank from a list of nine issues the five most important issues facing the City. Out of the 45,000 surveys mailed, 1,727 responded.
During the early stages of the program, a statistically valid, scientific Telephone Survey of Salinas residents was conducted to verify major issues of importance for the General Plan program and provide housing information not available from the 2000 Census. Results of both surveys were reported in a city-wide newsletter.
a1 A Newsletter summarizing the Draft General Plan was prepared and distributed to provide residents with a brief description of the proposed General Plan and its contents.
> The publi c was able to address decision makers regarding the General Plan at four Joint Planning Commission/City Council Workshops (Spanish translation available). These workshops were conducted to: review the vision for the future and confirm major issues; review land use and circulation alternatives; and review the preliminary Draft General Plan prior to public hearings.
The public was able to address decision makers at one Planning Commission and one City Council hearing on the preferred land use and circulation alternative.
The Draft General Plan and Draft Environmental Impact Report were circulated for public review and comment prior to the General Plan Public Hearings (Spanish translation available) held before the

Land Use Element
GENERAL PLAN
Introduction
The Land Use Element is a guide to future land use within Salinas and affects many of the issues addressed in the other General Plan elements. The Land Use Element identifies the type and location of future land uses within the City. The specific land uses and their location within the community in turn affect the remaining General Plan elements. For example, the location and type of land uses outlined in the Land Use Element affect the circulation system that is identified in the Circulation Element, and the land uses identified in the Land Use Element also reflect the community’s goals for its future form and character, as outlined in the Community Design Element. In addition to land uses, the Land Use Element also addresses how growth will occur, with special attention given to the public services and facilities and economic development.
Purpose of the Land Use Element
As a city, state law requires that Salinas prepare and adopt a General Plan as a tool to manage growth and development. The Land Use Element is a mandatory element of the General Plan.
The purpose of the Land Use Element is to describe present and planned land uses and their relationship to the community’s long-range goals for the future. The Land Use Element identifies the proposed general distribution, location, and extent of land uses such as open space, residential, commercial and office, industrial, and publiq/semi public. The element consists of text, maps, and diagrams that outline the future land uses within the City and how these uses are integrated with the other General Plan elements and policies. The Land Use and Circulation Policy Map (“Land Use Map”) is a particularly important feature of the element since it shows the location, and types of development within the City. The Land Use Map is located on page 27 of this element. The element also describes the intensity or density of

development planned for the community. The general location of future growth is also defined in the element, and the City’s growth management plan is described. The Land Use Element also addresses the relationship between development and environmental quality, potential hazards, and social and economic objectives.
The Land Use Element of the Salinas General Plan represents the City’s desire for long-range changes and enhancements of land uses. Finally, the goals and policies contained in this element establish the framework for future land use planning and decision making in Salinas.
The Land Use Element complies with the requirements of the General Plan Land Use Element mandated in Government Code Section 65302(a). The element is comprised of three sections: 1) Introduction, 2) Issues, Goals, and Policies, and 3) the Land Use Plan. In the Issues, Goals, and Policies section, major land use issues are identified and related goals and policies are established to address these issues. The goals, which are overall statements of community desires, are comprised of broad statements of purpose and direction. The policies serve as guides for reviewing development proposals, planning facilities to accommodate anticipated growth, and accomplishing community economic development strategies. To achieve the goals and policies, a logical, organized land use pattern is established in the Plan with standards for future community development. The Plan contains the Land Use Map that graphically identifies the planned land uses within Salinas. The land use designations are described, including the type and density of allowed uses, and a statistical summary of the future land use composition is provided. A growth management system is also included, with standards for public services that will be used to evaluate development proposals. An economic development strategy for the community is also outlined in the element. Specific implementation programs for the element are located in the Land Use Implementation Program section.
There are a number of related plans and programs that are considered in the formulation, adoption, and implementation of local land use policy. Related plans and programs are both local and regional in nature. Regional planning agencies, such as the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG), recognize that planning issues extend beyond the boundaries of individual cities. Efforts to address regional planning issues such as air quality, transportation, affordable housing, and water quality have resulted in the adoption of

regional plans. The form and distribution of development in Salinas are affected by regional plans. Relevant regional and local plans related to the Land Use Element are discussed briefly in the following section.
Salinas Zoning Code
Salinas completed a comprehensive revision of its Zoning Code in 1993. The ordinance has since been updated to clarify and refine some of the content. The Zoning Code is the primary implementation tool for the Land Use Element. The Code identifies specific types of land use, intensity of use, and development and performance standards applicable to specific areas and parcels of land within the City. The Zoning Code will be updated to reflect the land use and development policies contained in this Element.
Salinas Redevelopment Plan
In the 1960’s and 70’s, Salinas created three Redevelopment Project Areas in accordance with the California Community Redevelopment Law to eliminate blight within the designated areas. The Sunset Avenue and Buena Vista Project Areas have been combined into a single project area for financing purposes. With the adoption of Assembly Bill 1290, the Salinas Redevelopment Agency prepared a five year implementation plan in 1999 for the Central City and Sunset Avenue/Buena Vista Redevelopment Project Areas. The Redevelopment Plan is one of the tools that the City uses to implement policies included in the Land Use Element.
Salinas Public Library Plan of Service
The Library Plan of Service identifies future need for library facilities and services for a five year period. To meet this need, goals and objectives are presented in the plan to address the issues of: staffing, collections, facilities, services, technology, and collaboration. The standards identified in this document are incorporated into the Land Use Element.

	Greater Salinas Area Plan The Monterey County General Plan, adopted in 1982, was updated by the Greater Salinas Area Plan (GSAP), adopted in 1986. The purpose of the GSAP is to amend the land use designations of the Monterey County General Plan and provide supplemental policies to guide land use decisions within the Greater Salinas Planning Area. Development occurring outside of the City limits is subject to this plan prior to annexation. Rancho San Juan Specific Plan The County of Monterey is processing the Rancho San Juan Specific Plan, a development proposal located north of Salinas, along Highway 101. The area is identified as a Community Area by the County and is proposed for a mixture of residential, employment generating, and recreational development. Since the Specific Plan area is located outside the City limits the County is responsible for planning for the area and ensuring that adequate public services will be available to meet the demand generated by the project. Salinas Municipal Airport Master Plan The Salinas Municipal Airport is subject to the Salinas Municipal Airport Master Plan 1990-2010. This plan identifies improvements for the airport to meet future aviation demand. The plan also addresses appropriate land uses for those areas surrounding the airport. The Land Use Plan has designated land subject to aircraft noise and safety issues for uses that are not negatively impacted by flight operations. Funding has been approved to update the Salinas Municipal Airport Master Plan in 2002-2003 and the General Plan will be reviewed for consistency with the revised plan once the master plan has been adopted. Monterey County Airport Land Use Plan The County of Monterey has adopted a County Airport Land Use Plan. The plan identifies areas impacted by aircraft operations and includes policies to allow for the continued operation of county airports, while protecting the public safety. The General Plan incorporates these policies. As the Land Use Plan is updated on a periodic basis, the City will review its General Plan to ensure consistency.

Sewage and Drainage Master Plan
The City of Salinas Sewage and Drainage Master Plan estimates future demand for City sewage and drainage. Based on an evaluation of both systems, an improvement plan is outlined in the plan to meet future demand. The City will continue to implement the Sewage and Drainage Master Plan to ensure that adequate service is provided.
California Water Code Sections 10910-10915
Sections 10910-10915 of the California Water Code identify consultation, noticing, and water assessment and provision requirements for proposed projects meeting the specific criteria identified in Sections 10910 and 10913 of the Code. The City must consult with local and regional water agencies to assess whether the water demand associated with the project is included in the agency’s most recent Urban Water Management Plan and whether existing supplies can meet the project’s demand for water. Based on the entire record, the City shall determine within an EIR whether projected water supplies available during normal, single-dry, and multiple-diy water years will be sufficient to satisfy the demands of the proposed project, in addition to existing and planned future uses.
School District Long-Range Facility Plans and Master Plans
To plan for future facility needs, school districts typically implement a long-range planning approach with Long-Range Facility Plans and Master Plans. These documents allow school districts to estimate the number of additional students that new development will generate and plan for needed improvements to meet the demand. The plans may also consider demographic trends, such as increased household size, that can affect the
need for future school services.
Coordination with the school districts to provide adequate educational facilities is an issue addressed in this element.

Urban Water Management Plans and Water Master Plans
Water purveyors use a variety of planning processes to plan for the provision of water within their service areas. Urban Water Management Plans and Water Master Plans are typically used to estimate future demand for water, and required improvements to meet future need. Sources of water, and other issues that affect the provision of water within the service area are addressed in the plans. The Land Use Plan addresses the need to coordinate with the water purveyors’ planning processes to ensure adequate water is available to existing and future development.
Monterey Bay Air Quality Management Plan
The Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District’s Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) includes transportation control measures that are either implemented by transportation planning agencies through the regional transportation planning process or by cities and counties on a voluntary basis. To comply with the AQMP, the Land Use Element organizes land uses in relation to the circulation system, promoting compact, pedestrian and transit-friendly development, and provides a balanced Land Use Plan that promotes a favorable relationship between jobs and housing.
California Environmental Quality Act and Guidelines
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted by the state legislature in response to a public mandate for thorough environmental analysis of projects that might affect the environment. The provisions of the law and environmental review procedures are described in the CEQA Statutes and the CEQA Guidelines. Implementation of CEQA ensures that during the decision making stage of development, City officials and the general public will be able to assess the environmental impacts associated with private and public development projects.

Relationship to Other General Plan Elements	According to state planning law, the Land Use Element must be consistent with the other General Plan Elements. Each element is independent and all the elements together comprise the General Plan. All elements of the General Plan are interrelated to a degree, and certain goals and policies of one element may also address issues that are the primary subjects of other elements. The integration of overlapping issues throughout the General Plan elements provides a strong basis for implementation of plans and programs, and achievement of community goals. The Land Use Element relates very closely to all of the other General Plan elements. This element establishes the planned land use pattern for Salinas based on the historic formation of the city and the community’s vision of the future. Additionally, the other General Plan elements ensure that future development occurs in an appropriate manner and that the unique qualities of Salinas are safeguarded and enhanced. Because this General Plan emphasizes the application of New Urbanism principles in Future Growth Areas, the patterns of development shown in these areas on the Land Use and Circulation Policy Map are directly supported by policy defined in the Community Design Element. These two elements, in conjunction with one another, are designed to provide definitive direction for new development in the Future Growth Areas so that the benefits of New Urbanism can be realized. The Circulation Element provides a Circulation Plan to accommodate increased traffic from planned development. The use of alternative transportation modes and reduction of automobile trips are addressed in the Circulation Element to meet the transportation demands from new development, and to promote a transit-friendly community. A number of areas are designated for parks and open space on the Land Use Map and acquiring and maintaining such lands is a key to improving the quality of life in Salinas. The Conservation/Open Space Element provides policy and plans to maintain and enhance existing parks and recreational facilities and to develop new facilities to meet new demand from population growth. In addition, the Housing Element of the General Plan provides the basis for establishing housing stock that meets the affordability requirements and other special needs of the community.

Issues, Goals and Policies
GENERAL PLAN
The Land Use Element addresses future land use within the community. The Element focuses on how vacant land will be allowed to develop, as well as how certain developed land may be redeveloped for other use. Future growth is visualized in a compact form, that is pedestrian and transit-friendly, with activity nodes located throughout the Future Growth Area (undeveloped areas targeted for growth). Additional growth is also visualized for Focused Growth Areas (existing developed areas targeted for redevelopment or revitalization) within the community. In addition, the element addresses the need to direct future growth, ensure that adequate public services and facilities are provided, and positive economic development occurs.
Four major issues are addressed in the goals, policies, and implementation actions of the Land Use Element. These major issues include: 1) balancing land uses within the City to ensure that revenue generation matches service provision responsibilities; 2) managing and directing future growth so that agricultural resources are protected; 3) promoting economic development within the community; and 4) providing necessary public services and facilities for existing and future development. Each issue and the related goals, policies, and implementing actions are identified and discussed in the following section.
Balance of	Salinas currently has a substantial amount of its land devoted to
Land Uses	residential use (about 33 percent) and commercial retail use (about 9
percent); however, the amount of land devoted to industrial use (about 6 percent) is limited and most industrial land is devoted to agricultural product processing. Achieving greater diversification of the City’s future economy and increasing City revenues to meet the service demands of population growth will require the provision of additional vacant land for industrial/business development. Serving the growing population will also require an increase in the amount of land devoted to parks and recreation and residential use. The following goal and policies are designed to achieve a balanced land use pattern in the
community.

Salinas has experienced substantial growth over the past 30 years, particularly during the 1990s when the population increased approximately 33 percent from about 108,000 in 1990 to almost 144,000 in 2000. The community is compact with a density of about 7,700 persons per square mile and is substantially built out within the present City boundary to accommodate future growth. Annexation of additional land to the City will be necessary to accommodate future growth. Annexed land will be converted from agricultural use to urban use, but loss of agricultural land can be lessened if the density and intensity of development in selected areas is increased to encourage more compact development and reuse/revitalization. The following goal and policies are designed to appropriately manage future growth within the community.
Goal LU-2:	Manage future growth to minimize impacts
to the existing community and surrounding agricultural lands.
Policy LU-2.1: Minimize disruption of agriculture by maintaining a compact city form and directing urban expansion to the North and East, away from the most productive agricultural land.

The current economy of Salinas is based on agriculture, agriculture-related businesses, retail sales, and governmental services. However, Salinas is strategically located south of the Silicon Valley and may be able to diversify its economy by encouraging high technology industry with higher paying jobs to locate in the area. To locate in Salinas, such industry will be seeking land for development, affordable housing prices, and an educated workforce. As part of Land Use Plan, land has been designated for industrial use, including agricultural processing. The following goal and policies address the need for a more diverse economy in Salinas.
Goal LU-3:	Encourage a diverse economy that allows for
the continued economic success of the community, while not sacrificing its agricultural base.

GENERAL PLAN
Land Use Plan
Salinas has taken a progressive approach to the planning of future development within the community. With a strong agricultural base, the Land Use Plan has been designed to protect agricultural lands, as well as ensuring a healthy economy and good quality of life within Salinas to support the agricultural industry.
The following Land Use Plan provides for growth in the Future Growth Area outside the city limits, and within the Focused Growth Areas within the urbanized city limits. New growth outside the city will occur on land that is currently under agricultural production. Future Growth Area is the area outside the city limits that is designated for urban uses on Figure LU-1. To minimize the amount of agricultural land lost to urban development
and create a livable community, New Urbanism principles were used to design a land use plan that is compact and pedestrian-friendly, with a mixture of higher density uses surrounding activity
centers/neighborhood focal points. Higher density residential uses surround retail, recreational, and governmental uses in the Future Growth Area1, and all of these core activity centers are connected with pedestrian, bicycle, and transit routes to help reduce the number of vehicle trips generated by the new development.
The Focused Growth Areas (shown in Figure LU-2) are existing urbanized areas where additional growth and/or redevelopment and revitalization would be appropriate and provide benefits to the community. By selectively increasing density of development in a

manner compatible with the surrounding neighborhoods, the pressure to develop agricultural lands is also reduced.
The following Land Use Plan focuses on the location of various land uses, as well as growth management techniques, economic development, and provision of public services and facilities. The other elements within the General Plan expand on how the Land Use Plan will be implemented to create a compact and livable community. The Community Design Element is especially important as a reference.
The variety of land uses within Salinas affects the important balance between the generation of public revenues and the provision of public services and facilities. Achieving and maintaining a balance of land uses can ensure fiscal stability and also create a desirable community in which people can work, shop, reside, and recreate. As discussed later in this element, implementation of the Land Use Plan will result in a positive net revenue for Salinas.
Implementation of the Land Use Plan will also assist in creating a balance between jobs and housing units within the City. A balance between jobs and housing allows people to live and work within the same community, and often within the same neighborhood. This results in a reduction of traffic, thereby reducing the level of air pollution and improving the quality of life for the community.
While agricultural land will be converted to urban uses as the planning area is developed, the City has selectively focused future growth away from the most important agricultural lands surrounding Salinas. The resulting urban development will provide necessary support for the regional agricultural economy by providing housing and agricultural related industrial services, as well as other necessary uses. Ensuring that affordable housing is available for those lower income households working within the agricultural, retail, and service industries of Salinas is important, especially as local workers increasingly compete with higher paid workers from the Silicon Valley. An economic development strategy is discussed later in this element, and the provision of adequate housing is discussed in the Housing Element.

Land Use Classification System
The Land Use Map (Figure LU-3) illustrates the various types and distribution of land uses planned for Salinas. The land uses classification system is presented in Table LU-2 and includes 14 land use designations. These land use designations identify the types and nature of development allowed in particular locations depicted on the Land Use Map. Higher density uses, both residential and non-residential, are concentrated around activity centers within the Future Growth Area to implement New Urbanism
principles and reduce vehicle trips generated by the new development by encouraging the use of transit and other non-automobile means of transportation.
The Residential categories include three designations that allow for a range of housing types and densities. The non-residential categories include a variety of designations, such as Retail, Office, Business Park, Industrial, and Arterial Frontage to promote a range of revenue- and employment-generating businesses. Other non-residential designations include Agriculture, Open Space and Parks. The Publiq/Semipublic designation allows for the provision of important public facilities.
The Land Use Map also includes a Mixed Use land use category. This category is extremely important for achieving the Salinas of the future. The Mixed Use category is designated in areas where a vibrant combination of residential and non-residential uses is desired, either to create new New Urbanism activity centers in the Future Growth Area, or to help revitalize or redevelop the Focused Growth Areas. These mixed use areas will allow City residents to utilize community connections for walking, bicycling, or taking transit to work, school, shopping, medical, and recreation.
The City will revise its Zoning Code to ensure consistency with the land uses described in this Element. The Zoning Code update will also focus on revising the code to ensure that the New Urbanism development promoted in the General Plan is implemented through the Zoning Code.

They are not intended to be parcel specific. 2-	The minimum densities within the landuse designations are 6.0 du/ac for Low Density Residential, 9.0 du/ac for Medium Density Residential, and 16.0 du/ac for High Density Residential. 3 - A FAR of 8.0 may be allowed for receiving properties in the core of the downtown commercial area under a transfer of development rights (TDR) program that may be adopted by the City. 4- Residential development of comparable impact may be considered. Comparable impact is considered to be the substitution of 1,000 sq. ft. of non-residential floor area for one residential dwelling unit. For this calculation, 40 dwelling units per acre equals 1.0 floor area ratio; 20 dwelling units per acre equals 0.S FAR, etc. Sources: CBA, Inc., City of Salinas, 2001.

Land Use Element
	Land Use Density and Intensity This Element uses certain terminology to describe land use designations. The term density is used for residential uses and refers to the population and development capacity of residential land. Density is described in terms of dwelling units per net acre of land (du/acre), exclusive of existing or proposed streets and rights-of-way. Development intensity, which applies to non-residential uses, refers to the extent of development on a parcel of land or lot (i.e., the total building floor area square footage, building height, the floor area ratio, and/or the percent of lot coverage). Intensity is often used to describe non-residential development levels; but in a broader sense, intensity is also used to describe overall levels of both residential and non-residential development types. In this element, floor area ratio and building floor area square footage are used as measures of non-residential development intensity. Floor area ratio (FAR) expresses the intensity of use on a lot (see Figure LU-4). The FAR represents the ratio between the total gross floor area of all buildings on a lot and the total land area of that lot. For example, a 20,000 square foot building on a 40,000 square foot lot yields a FAR of 0.S, A 0.5 FAR describes a single-story building that covers half of the lot, a two-story building covering approximately one-quarter of the lot, or a four-story building covering one-eighth of the lot. State General Plan law requires that the Land Use Element indicate the maximum densities and intensities permitted within the Land Use Plan. The land use designations shown on the Land Use Map are described in detail in this Element. Table LU-2 lists each of the land use designations shown on the Land Use Map and provides a corresponding indication of maximum density or intensity of development. Maximum allowable development on individual parcels of land is governed by these measures of density or intensity. For various reasons, many parcels in the community have not been developed to their maximum density or intensity. In the future, the maximum development potential described in this element can be expected to occur only on a limited number of parcels. Therefore, the overall future development of the City is anticipated to occur at the average level of development intensity or density indicated in Table LU-2.

In a zone district with a maximum FAR of 0.5, the maximum allowable floor area of a building on a

The average levels of development identified in Table LU-2 represent an anticipated overall density and intensity of development for the City and are, therefore, usually less than the maximum allowed for an individual parcel of land. Additionally, a density bonus is required by State law to be offered for certain residential projects affordable to lower income households or other qualifying households. Because the City requires the provision of affordable units in all projects of 10 units or more, many larger projects in the City may be eligible and request a density bonus. The effect of this has been factored into the average density levels identified in Table LU-2.
Land Use Designations
The various land use designations for Salinas are described below in greater detail. These designations are organized into the six major land

LU-31
Land Use Element
use groupings identified previously: Open Space; Residential; Commercial/Office; Industrial; Publiq/Semipublic; and Other.
Open Space Designations
Agriculture: The Agriculture designation provides lands for the managed production of natural resources and agricultural land intended to remain in production during the General Plan planning period.
Open Space: The Open Space designation provides lands, both private and public as shown on the Land Use Map, for the preservation of natural resources, hillsides and creeks; as well as open space for the protection of public health and safety, including floodways and stormwater retention areas.
Parks: The Parks designation provides for existing and proposed public and private recreation sites for parks and golf courses. Activity areas that may be developed include large multipurpose fields for community events and informal recreation, areas for active sports play, tot lots, picnic areas, multipurpose sports fields and courts, golf courses, concessions, community event space, outdoor amphitheaters, nature study centers, maintenance/support facilities and caretaker facilities. Interim agricultural uses would be permitted on sites designated for park use until such time as park facilities are constructed. The maximum intensity of development is a floor area ratio of 0.2. Residential Land Use Designations
Low Density Residential: The Low Density residential land use designation provides for the development of single-family detached and attached homes. The designation allows a maximum density of 8.0 units per net acre. Uses such as mobile and modular homes, second single-family units, public facilities, day care, churches and others that are compatible with and oriented toward serving the needs of the low density single-family neighborhood may also be considered when consistent with applicable State law.
The maximum density of this land use designation may be increased in accordance with the density bonus provisions of the California Government Code and the City’s Zoning Ordinance.

Medium Density Residential: The Medium Density residential designation provides for the development of small-lot single-family homes, town houses, row houses, duplexes and most mobile home parks. Allowable multifamily uses include condominiums as well as apartment units clustered to look like single-family units. The designation allows a maximum of 1 S.O units per net acre. Uses such as mobile and modular homes, second single-family units, public facilities, day care, churches and others that are compatible with and oriented toward serving the needs of the medium density neighborhood may also be considered.
The maximum density of this land use designation may be increased in accordance with the density bonus provisions of the California Government Code and the City’s Zoning Ordinance.
High Density Residential:
The High Density residential designation provides for the development of row houses, condominiums	and
apartments. The designation allows a maximum of 24.0 units per net acre. Uses such as mobile and modular homes, public facilities, day
care, churches and others that are compatible with and oriented toward serving the needs of the high density neighborhood may also be considered.
The maximum density of this land use designation may be increased in accordance with the density bonus provisions of the California Government Code and the City’s Zoning Ordinance.
Commercial/Office Land Use Designations
Retail: The Retail land use designation provides for a variety of retail uses such as retail stores, restaurants, hotels, personal services, business services and financial services. The maximum intensity of development is a floor area ratio of 0.4. For the Central City only, this designation allows a FAR of 3.0. This designation also may allow for residential development at a maximum intensity of 10 dwelling units per acre to be mixed with retail uses in order to foster pedestrian oriented activity

	centers. For residential projects without retail a maximum density of 24 dwelling units per acre may be allowed. For the Central City only, this designation may allow 18 units per acre if the project combines residential and commercial uses, and a maximum of up to 30 dwelling units per acre if the project is residential without retail uses. Office: The Office land use designation allows for single-tenant and multi-tenant offices that include professional, legal, medical, financial, administrative, research & development, corporate and general business offices and other supporting uses, such as restaurants. Also included are small convenience or service commercial activities intended to meet the needs of the on-site employee population. This designation also allows for residential development in order to foster pedestrian oriented activity centers. The maximum intensity of development is a floor area ratio of 0.4 + 10 units per acre. For the Central City only, the maximum allowable intensity is increased to 3.0 + 22 units per acre, and in the East Romie Lane area only, the maximum allowable intensity is 1.0 + 10 units per acre, and a maximum of up to 20 dwelling units per acre for a residential project without office uses. Industrial Land Use Designations Business Park: The Business Park designation provides for single or mixed light industrial uses that do not create nuisances due to odor, dust, noise or heavy truck traffic. Suitable uses include corporate and general business offices, research and development, light manufacturing, light industrial, and warehousing. Although most business parks are controlled through deed restrictions or single ownership of multi-tenant space, business park standards can be applied to existing parcels in separate ownership. Common features of business parks are high quality design, building materials, landscaping, and absence of nuisances. The maximum intensity of development is a floor area ratio of 0.4. General Commercial/Light Industrial: The General Commercial/ Light Industrial land use designation provides for uses such as automobile dealerships and repair shops, building materials sales, light manufacturing, distribution, warehousing and wholesaling that would generally not be appropriate in more restrictive designations because of potential nuisance factors. The maximum intensity of development is a floor area ratio of 0.4. Residential development (e.g., Single Room

Arterial Frontage: Portions of streets such as North Main and East and West Market Street include a broad mix of uses that do not fit in any one of the aforementioned land use categories. Many of the areas in the City that have a highly mixed land use pattern are designated for Arterial Frontage uses and future development in these areas are best determined by detailed study. Appropriate uses in this zone may include residential, commercial and small-scale non-nuisance industry. The maximum intensity of development is a floor area ratio of 0.3 and the average intensity of development is a floor area ratio of 0.2S. Residential uses may be developed in areas designated as Arterial Frontage subject to a detailed plan. The average residential density in this categoiy is 5 units per net acre. This land use designation is intended primarily for existing uses that fit the description listed above. Development Capacity
The Fand Use Plan for Salinas includes average levels of residential and non-residential development, where all land in the planning area is developed according to the Plan. The average levels of development establish a capacity for the Fand Use Plan that is expressed as estimates of total dwelling units, total population, and total square footage of non-residential development in the future. Average values for dwelling units per net acre and FAR per net acre are used for purposes of estimating population and employment capacity of land use alternatives. They are not intended to be parcel-specific.
Table FU-3 summarizes the development capacity of the Land Use Plan. This table provides a breakdown of land uses within Salinas for purposes of identifying the estimated development capacity of the Land Use Plan. For the Salinas planning area, the projected population is approximately 213,063 persons.
Specific Plans
Salinas has four areas within the community that have been developed using the Specific Plan or Precise Plan process, as shown in Figure LU-5. These include Harden Ranch, Williams Ranch, Westridge, and the Auto Center. A fifth Specific Plan area, Mountain Valley, was approved by the City Council in 1999, but remains undeveloped. The policies of each of these Specific Plans are incorporated by reference herein. The purpose of a Specific Plan is to allow for the detailed and flexible planning of a larger area of land.

proposals within the Future Growth Area, developers will need to prepare Specific Plans. This requires will allow for a comprehensive planning approach that implements the New Urbanism principles, as described throughout this General Plan. A more specific description of these principles is provided in the Community Design Element.
For each Specific Plan in the Future Growth Areas containing over 1,000 residential units, a mix of low density, medium density, and high density units shall be included. From 1596-2596 of the housing units in such developments shall fall within the density range of 16-24 units per net residential developable acre, and 3 596-45% of the housing units shall fall within the density range of 7-14 units per net residential developable acre.
In Future Growth Areas, new commercial and professional office developments within the Mixed Use land use designation shall incorporate residential housing opportunities on site. The City Council may make a finding that it would be inappropriate to require on-site housing in a proposed new commercial or professional office development, and in that case shall require equivalent housing to be constructed at an off-site location.
Management of Future Growth
Over the last decade, Salinas and the Monterey region have grown at a significant rate. Factors affecting growth have changed during that time, with pressure for affordable housing now coming all the way from the Silicon Valley to the north. Understanding that growth will occur in the future, directing how and where growth will occur is important, as it will have a great impact on the quality of life and economic wellbeing of the community as a whole. To prepare for population increases in the next 20 years, Salinas will direct growth within the Future Growth Area and Focused Growth Areas, as described below, to create a community that is compact and pedestrian and transit-oriented, avoids removing from production more valuable agricultural land than necessary, and is able to meet the public service and infrastructure needs of existing and future residents.
Growth Management System and Future Growth Areas
As part of the General Plan process, the community of Salinas decided that land designated for future growth outside the City limits should be

minimized to protect the valuable agricultural resources. The area designated for future growth (Future Growth Area) is located to the north of Salinas, north of Boronda Road, and east, surrounding the Salinas Municipal Airport, as shown in Figure LU-1. The Future Growth Area is the appropriate area for expansion of urban uses since it is located away from the best agricultural lands in the south and west, and will allow the rational extension of public services and facilities. Land uses for the Future Growth Area are shown on Figure LU-3 Land Use Map. The City will work with the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) to expand the City’s sphere of influence to include the Future Growth Area. The City’s current sphere of influence is shown in Figure LU-6.
Figure LU-1 generally depicts the area identified as the Future Growth Area. The specific boundaries of the Future Growth Area will be determined by the City Council as specific proposals within the area are received. New public services and infrastructure will be extended within the Future Growth Area as new development occurs during the buildout of this General Plan.
Prior to approval of development within the Future Growth Area, a Specific Plan, to include an annexation plan, will be completed. As part of the annexation plan, developers will need to prepare a plan for providing and financing services that oudines how adequate levels of public services and facilities will be provided to serve the new development, without reducing the level of service for existing urbanized areas. The plan will identify who will be responsible for the provision of the various public services and facilities, as well as identifying funding sources to finance the services and facilities. Prior to City approval, the plan for providing and financing services will need to demonstrate that the proposed development will be able to meet the service standards oudined in the next section.
As part of the plan for providing and financing services, a fiscal analysis shall be prepared prior to the consideration or approval of Specific Plans in Future Growth Areas to determine the impact that additional development will have on existing Salinas neighborhoods and on the community as a whole. Such fiscal analysis shall identify any impact fees necessary to offset the public costs that would be caused by the proposed project. The fiscal analysis shall include an examination of fiscal and service impacts of the proposed project on roads, water,

Provision of Public Services and Infrastructure
The plan for providing and financing services is required to address the public services and facilities identified in Table LU-4. Necessary service and infrastructure expansion and improvements will be identified in the plan to show how the service standards identified in Table LU-4 will be achieved. While these plans are not required for development outside the Future Growth Area, a development proposal received for any location within the community will be reviewed by the City to ensure that adequate public services and facilities are provided.
The plan for providing and financing services will also identify funding sources and other forms of development exaction to achieve the service standards. Currently, the City has policies and programs in place to ensure that new development pays its fair share of needed public improvements. The City will continue to collect and impose impact fees on new development to help pay for circulation improvements, sewer and storm drain infrastructure, parks and libraries. In addition, development in the Future Growth Area will participate in maintenance assessment districts to help fund ongoing operation and maintenance of certain facilities and services, such as lighting and landscaping.
The City will review and update these funding mechanisms on a regular basis to reflect the specific facilities required, including project costs of build out of the General Plan. The City will also complete and implement a Capital Financing Plan for the General Plan to address the funding of future infrastructure needs. The City may also participate in any regional funding programs for certain key facilities such as road improvements.

Economic Development	Reuse/Revitalization of Existing Areas In addition to the Future Growth Area, growth in Salinas will occur in the Focused Growth Areas. These areas are located within the urbanized City limits, as shown in Figure LU-2. These areas of existing development would benefit from redevelopment or revitalization, change of land uses, and/or the incorporation of mixed use residential uses. By encouraging future growth in these areas, conversion of agricultural lands will be reduced and the quality of life within the community improved. The City will implement a variety of approaches to direct growth into the Focused Growth Areas. The actual approach will vary between the different Focused Growth Areas, depending on the specific conditions. Some areas will be redeveloped by private developers without City assistance since the land use changes make private development economically feasible. Other Focused Growth Areas will need additional help from the City through the Redevelopment Agency or with the implementation of the Economic Development Strategy described below. Salinas recognizes the importance of focusing on continued economic development in the City. The fiscal analysis of the land uses designated in the Land Use Map indicates that the Land Use Plan is anticipated to generate sufficient tax revenues to cover the annual costs of increased services for new development. Much of this net benefit would be generated by new and expanded businesses in Salinas and maintaining a balance of housing and job growth is important in balancing the City budget. To promote the economic well-being of the community, the City will encourage business growth through the following Economic Development Strategy. The essential focus of this strategy is on business retention and expansion. Provide an adequate inventory of land for job development; Continue investments in infrastructure (such as the Salinas Municipal Airport and Highway 101 overpasses); > Build the capacity of the workforce (present and future) through education and job training;

Agriculture as Primary Industry
The history of Salinas, and the region as a whole, is based on the importance of agriculture. As an approximately $2.9 billion annual industry (2000) in Monterey County, agriculture continues to occupy an important role
for the economy of Salinas. While litde actual agricultural growing	exists
within the City, with the exception of Carr Lake, the City is surrounded

	by some of the most productive agricultural land in the nation, and Salinas provides important support infrastructure needed by agricultural producers. Approximately 16 percent of Salinas jobs are agriculturally-related (i.e. agricultural activities ranging from food processing and distribution to a variety of agricultural support services). Monterey County is even more dependent on agriculture, with approximately 27 percent of its jobs related to agriculture. Three of the top four employers in the Salinas Valley are related to agriculture, employing over 7,300 people. While agriculture is an important source of employment, many of the available jobs are low paying and seasonal, resulting in an increase in unemployment during the winter months. For example, in 2001, Monterey County had a low unemployment rate of S.4 percent in August and September, with a high in January of IS.8 percent. While agriculture is important to the economy of Salinas, agriculture also depends on Salinas for support. Salinas provides necessary housing, education, childcare, retail, and other public services and facilities for agricultural workers and their families, as well as industrial land for food processing. The Salinas Municipal Airport also supports agricultural activities as a center for the operation of agricultural-related equipment such as helicopters and corporate aircraft owned by organizations involved in agricultural production. The community of Salinas recognizes the importance of agriculture to the City, and will continue to preserve agricultural lands to the extent possible. The Future Growth Area has been designed to direct future growth away from the most productive agricultural areas in the south and west of the City. In addition, growth within the Future Growth Area is designed to provide compact development, minimizing the amount of agricultural land that will be needed to meet future growth within the community. Additional growth in the Focused Growth Areas within the urbanized city limits will also help reduce the pressure to convert agricultural lands. Other agricultural preservation programs are discussed in the Conservation/Open Space Element. The Economic Development Strategy will also address the need for economic development that does not negatively affect the viability of the agricultural industry. Programs will be included that enhance the community’s unique market niche in agriculture; strengthening and

working with agricultural employers to create “value added jobs” in agriculture that provide higher wages.
Employment-Generation and Diversification
As the largest city in the County, with approximately one-third of the population, Salinas has more jobs than any other city in the County. While Salinas has the greatest number of jobs, there are still more workers living in Salinas than working in the community. As a result, some Salinas residents are commuting to the Monterey Peninsula and Santa Clara County to work.
As shown in Figure LU-7, the Salinas economic base is comprised of local-serving (including retail), agriculture, other basic, tourism, and information technology jobs.2 Besides agriculture, which is discussed above, other major employment sectors include government, retail, manufacturing, and medical. Eight of the largest employers in the Salinas area are governmental agencies, with schools accounting for four of the agencies. The City of Salinas and Monterey County also are large governmental employers. Retail provides approximately 20 percent of the jobs in Salinas since the City serves as the regional retail center for the County (as discussed below). Approximately 10 percent of Salinas jobs are within the manufacturing sector, including both agricultural and non-agricultural industry. Finally, with two regional hospitals, there is also a cluster of medical service providers in Salinas.
While the City has a more diverse economy than the County as a whole, many of the employment opportunities within the community are lower paying jobs, such as agriculture-related and retail. A major concern raised by the community is the lack of higher paying, professional jobs. Without this type of employment, the City will find itself losing its educated, young adult population who will be forced to leave to find employment elsewhere.
Basic jobs are those that manufacture goods or provide services that ultimately are sold primarily outside the City itself and which, therefore, bring income and wealth into the city. In contrast, local-serving businesses provide goods and services to the local population and thereby recirculate the income generated by basic industries.

City of Salinas Economic Base
To achieve a more diverse economy, while not negatively impacting the viability of agriculture, the City will implement the Economic Development Strategy described in the previous section. Programs for diversification will include building the capacity of the workforce (present and future) through education and job training, and collaborating with the Chambers of Commerce, education institutions, and related business interests to pursue business retention strategies including capital formation. A focus will be placed on attracting high-tech and other diverse businesses that are ecologically compatible with Salinas. Emphasis will be given to create employment opportunities in areas with access to public transportation.
Revitalization of Existing Commercial Areas
As discussed in the previous section, retail uses provide an important source of employment and revenue for the community. Salinas is a regional center for retail trade, serving a market area that extends beyond the City to include neighboring communities and

unincorporated areas of Northern Monterey and Western San Benito counties. In addition to serving the population of the Salinas Valley, many Salinas retail businesses also draw customers from outside the valley who are traveling along Highway 101. Overall, Salinas retail businesses are currently absorbing not only the household spending generated by Salinas residents, but also roughly that same amount of spending from people living outside the community, who are shopping in Salinas.
The Salinas retail market is segmented into distinct geographic areas, including North Salinas, Old Town, South Salinas, and East Salinas. The most successful area is the North Salinas retail area with its regional and community malls, big box retailers, and the Salinas Auto Center.
Unlike North Salinas, the retail centers in South Salinas have much smaller natural trade areas, drawing customers primarily from the adjacent residential neighborhoods. South Main Street, the primary retail corridor in South Salinas, is characterized by neighborhood shopping centers anchored by supermarkets. Unfortunately, parts of the area have fallen into decline, with significant underutilized and vacant retail space along South Main. The market barriers contributing to this decline include competition from the North Salinas malls, aging buildings, insufficient parking, and stagnant demand due to lack of residential growth in that area.
To help revitalize those older commercial areas in the southern portion of Salinas, the City encourages redevelopment of the properties. These areas are included in the Focused Growth Areas, as shown in Figure LU-2. Mixed-use development is encouraged to bring additional residents into the area to support the local retail. In addition, higher density and intensity of development is allowed for retail, office, and mixed-use in the Central City Focused Growth Area to provide incentives for private redevelopment of the area.
Within the core of the downtown commercial area, the City hopes to achieve intensified development that would refocus the downtown as the City’s heart of commercial, entertainment and cultural activities, with a mix of uses that retain the downtown’s historic character and pedestrian orientation. The City may therefore consider limited opportunities to achieve development intensities on some properties within the core area that are somewhat higher than otherwise

established for the rest of downtown through a transfer of development rights (TDR) from one property that, for example, has a historic building worthy of preservation, to another development nearby. Such an exchange would result in an overall maximum intensity among the exchanging properties of the 6.0 FAR specified for downtown mixed use, and a maximum 8.0 FAR for the receiving property.
Redevelopment Projects
The City originally adopted three Redevelopment Project Areas within Salinas: the Central City, Sunset Avenue, and Buena Vista Redevelopment Areas. The Sunset Avenue and Buena Vista Project Areas have been combined for financing purposes. The Project Areas are depicted in Figure LU-8. The Project Areas were adopted in accordance with state law to address blight within the designated areas. The Salinas Redevelopment Agency has prepared a five-year implementation plan for the Project Areas, and identifies goals and objectives for each. Table LU-S summarizes the goals for each project area. The plan also includes programs that work to address blight within the Project Areas. Recognizing the importance of economic development to reduce blight, much of the Implementation Plan focuses on programs that directly or indirectly address economic issues.
By including areas within a Redevelopment Project Area, the Redevelopment Agency is able to utilize eminent domain and tax increment financing to help reduce blight within the area. A portion of the tax increment financing is required to be used to provide affordable housing, as discussed in more detail in the Housing Element. As the Buena Vista Redevelopment Project Area has experienced full build-out of industrial uses, its revenues have been combined with those of the Sunset Avenue project. The Salinas Redevelopment Agency will continue to implement the five-year implementation plan. Some of the programs that specifically address economic development include: constructing a parking garage in the downtown, a facade improvement program, and assisting the Oldtown Salinas Association.

Public Facilities	The City provides a range of public services to the community including
and Services	fire protection and emergency services, police protection, sewer
collection, local flood control, library services, and other community and institutional services. Other services are provided by a variety of other agencies, including the school and water districts and the
Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency.
Fire Protection and Emergency Services

The Salinas Fire Department provides both emergency response and prevention services to the community. The prevention activities include inspections of all types, fire investigation, public education presentations, Neighborhood Emergency Response Training (NERT), and advice to the general public on fire protection systems, safety issues, and concerns.
Emergency services provided include fire suppression (structural, vegetation, and vehicular fires), paramedic emergency medical response, vehicular accident response, and rescue situations which include extrication and basic confined space rescue. Additionally, the Salinas Fire Department responds to hazardous conditions that include arching or downed power lines, electrical system malfunctions, water system malfunctions, smell or odor problems/concems, and responses to hazardous materials releases or spills and public assistance.
The Fire Department is headquartered at 65 West Alisal, Suite 210, and has six additional stations located throughout the City. Figure LU-9 depicts the location of the various fire stations.
The Salinas Fire Department has a response time goal for both fire and medical emergencies of arriving on scene within six minutes of the 911 call at least 90 percent of the time. Many efforts have been made to shorten the response time of the Department, including installing emergency vehicle preemption devices at strategically placed locations to change the traffic signals at street intersections to green for more rapid fire apparatus response. Additionally, the Department has entered into mutual aide agreements with neighboring fire districts in the region to provide back-up and enhanced suppression service.

On a regular basis, the City will continue to review the funding available to the Fire Department for fire protection, emergency medical, and educational programs, to ensure that effective and responsive fire protection and emergency medical service is provided to the community. The City will also continue to update and enforce regulations, such as zoning codes, building-related codes, and fire codes, to minimize the risk of structural fires.
Police Protection
Public safety is an important concern for the community. The Salinas Police Department is responsible for law enforcement within the City. The Police Department is centrally located adjacent to City Hall at 222 Lincoln Avenue, as shown in Figure LU-9. The Department is organized into three divisions: Field Operations, Administration, and Investigations. The Police Department currently provides a ratio of approximately 1.1 officers per thousand residents. This ratio may change in the future as law enforcement needs are reevaluated on a regular basis. In addition to traditional policing activities, such as criminal investigation and traffic control, the Salinas Police Department is actively involved in violence and crime prevention programs, as discussed in the Safety Element. The City will continue to review funding levels and programs for the Police Department on a regular basis so that an effective and responsive level of police protection is provided.
Water Supply, Treatment, and Distribution
The Salinas planning area is served by two water providers: California Water Service Corporation (CalWater) and Alco Water Service (Alco). Figure LU-10 depicts that service area for each water provider.
CalWater serves the majority of the urbanized planning area. The district has over 30 wells to serve Salinas and the outlining areas. The major difficulty that is affecting CalWater’s ability to provide sufficient water to its service area is that the District is losing wells to various types of contamination, with the greatest impact resulting from nitrate contamination. Alco has not experienced the same issue of contaminated wells since the majority of Alco wells are deeper than

CalWater. The issue of groundwater contamination may become an issue for Alco as contaminates continue to filter down to deeper aquifers.
Groundwater is the source of all urban water for Salinas as well as agriculture in the planning area. Water supplies for the planning area are limited to the watershed since no imported water sources are available. The high dependence on ground water and the growth in water demand by urban and agricultural users has put a strain on ground water resources of the Salinas Valley. Despite efforts to maintain a balance in the Valley, increased pumping during the irrigation season has resulted in seasonal as well as long-term declines in ground water levels in some parts of the Valley. The overdrafting of groundwater is not only an issue of supply, but also leads to contamination of the water supply by seawater intrusion, and exacerbates the degradation of the water supply by nitrate contamination. As a result, Salinas will need to continue to work with CalWater, Alco, and regional water agencies such as the Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA) to identify the solution to future water needs within the watershed. Programs that address this issue are discussed in the Conservation/Open Space Element.
The City will continue to work with CalWater, Alco, and MCWRA to ensure that adequate water supplies are available to meet the needs of existing and future growth. As part of this cooperation, the City will provide land use and other necessary data to the districts for use in updating their Urban Water Management Plans, as well as other planning documents. The City will also review proposed development projects to determine if they are subject to California State Water Code 10910-1091S, such as subdivisions of 500 or more units and other large scale projects. Those projects found to be subject to State law will be required to be reviewed by the applicable water purveyor to ensure adequate water supplies will be available. The City will also participate with CalWater and Alco to implement water conservation programs to reduce future water consumption. A more detailed discussion of water conservation programs is contained in the Conservation/Open Space Element.
September 2002

Encouraging good water service in the planning area will require maintaining the water infrastructure and extending new infrastructure to serve new development. The City will review new development proposals to ensure that new development provides its fair share of water improvements consistent with the adopted Water Master Plan and Urban Water Management Plan. Mitigation measures, such as requiring the developers to install or contribute to necessary infrastructure, will be required to ensure that adequate capacity is met. If proposed development is not consistent with the Water Master Plan and/or Urban Water Management Plan, or if the Plans are out of date, the Plans will need to be updated to reflect the proposed project and identify necessary improvements. Project proponents will be responsible for paying their proportional cost of updating the Plan.
Sewer Treatment and Distribution
Salinas is responsible for the collection of wastewater within the City. The wastewater is carried by the City’s sanitary collection system to the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency (MRWPCA) pump station near Davis and Blanco Road. From there it is pumped to the MRWPCA treatment plant near Marina. The plant was constructed with a permitted capacity of approximately 29 million gallons per day (MGD). There are still several MGDs of capacity available to meet future demand, and expansion of the treatment plant is not anticipated to be necessary in the near future. As discussed below, the City will continue to monitor the capacity of the sewer plant through the Sewer and Drainage Master Plan and as new development projects are proposed to identify required improvements to expand the plant’s capacity.
The City also treats industrial waste at its industrial treatment plant near Davis Road and the Salinas River. The plant’s permitted capacity is approximately 4 MGD, of which only SO percent is currently being used.
New development will generate the need for additional sewer infrastructure. Since the existing treatment plants have unused treatment capacity, future infrastructure improvements will focus on the collection system. The City will continue to have the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that adequate sewer mains are installed to transport all residential wastewater to the regional treatment plant.

The City an existing Sewer and Drainage Master Plan that identifies necessary improvements required to meet the needs of new development. The City will continue to implement this plan, as well as review new development proposals to ensure that new development provides its fair share of sewer improvements consistent with the adopted Sewer and Drainage Master Plan. Mitigation measures, such as construction of sewer facilities by developers, will be required to achieve sewer treatment standards. If proposed development is not consistent with the Sewer and Drainage Master Plan, or if the Plan is out of date, the Plan will need to be updated at the project proponent’s expense to reflect the proposed project and identify necessary improvements. An updated Storm Drain Master Plan is being prepared which will supercede the storm drain component of the existing Plan.
Flood Control
The two agencies responsible for flood control within Salinas are the City and the Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA). The City is responsible for local flood control facilities and MCWRA is responsible for regional flood control facilities. As discussed in detail in the Safety Element, the MCWRA Reclamation Ditch 1665, with the associated lakebed system, is the major drainage feature for the community. The location of the Reclamation Ditch is shown in Figure S-2 of the Safety Element.
As new development occurs, increased runoff will occur. New development is required to provide stormwater retention/detention facilities to regulate runoff and siltation and meet local, State, and federal regulations. Larger facilities have generally taken the form of ponds that have been designed to handle the difference between the 100-year post development stormwater discharge and the 10-year predevelopment discharge. In other, smaller developments, retention facilities have included expanding existing storm drain infrastructure or oversizing on-site storm drain systems to store the additional runoff capacity underground and allowing a discharge to the 10-year predevelopment runoff rate. The City will continue to require developments to provide adequate stormwater drainage systems, as determined on a project specific basis, concurrently with the construction of new development, including detention/retention facilities.

Education
Elementary and Alisal Union School District), one K-8 district (Santa Rita School District), and one 7-12 district (Salinas Union High School District), as described below. Hartnell College is part of the California Community College system, and offers two-year Associate Degrees and certificates. Figure LU-9 depicts the location of all Salinas public schools.
There are no four-year colleges located within the planning area. The closest facilities are California State University Monterey Bay, Golden Gate University’s Monterey Campus, and the University of California Santa Cruz. In addition to the public schools, there are also several private secular and religious academic schools, as well as continuation, adult and vocational schools.
Salmas City Elementary School District: The Salinas City Elementary School District is the largest K-6 district in Salinas, with the following 14 schools: Baldwin Park (community day school), Boronda, El Gabilan, Kammann, Laurel Wood, Lincoln, Loma Vista, Los Padres, Mission Park, Monterey Park, Natividad, Roosevelt, Sherwood, and University schools. The District boundary, with the exception of Boronda School, is within the City of Salinas. The District experienced a 20 percent growth rate during the 1990s. Construction of additional school sites within the district is difficult, due to limited available land for development. The District has limited or no space for additional growth in its existing sites, and therefore, continues to look at all alternatives to accommodate growth.
Alisal Union School District: The Alisal Union School District has the following 10 K-6 schools in the East Salinas area: Dr. Oscar F. Loya, Creekside, Alisal Community, Bardin, Frank Paul, Fremont, Jesse G. Sanchez, John Steinbeck, Virginia Rocca Barton, and Cesar Chavez. Overcrowding is an issue for the District. The migrant population in East Salinas requires available space for students, though it is only used during part of the year. The District estimates that approximately 38 percent of the total enrollment is comprised of migrant students.
September 2002
City of Salinas

LU-60
Land Use Element
Overcrowded housing conditions, in addition to a high degree of transience, makes enrollment projections particularly difficult, and enrollment varies significantly during the year.
Santa Rita School District: The Santa Rita School District serves most of North Salinas and is the City’s only K-8 district with the following three schools: Santa Rita (K-5), La Joya (K-5), and Gavilan View (6-8). All three schools are extremely overcrowded. To address overcrowding, the District is beginning the construction of a new K-5 elementary school (McKinnon Elementary), and has plans to construct two additional schools once funding is approved (Bolsa Knolls [6-8] and New Republic [K-5]). The 40-year old La Joya Elementary School is also in need of modernization. The District may eventually expand its grade levels to provide K-12.
Salinas Union High School District: The District operates the following five high schools that service the entire City: Alisal, Everett Alvarez, North Salinas, Salinas, and Mt. Toro. The District also provides middle school education to all of the City, except the Santa Rita School District area, with the following four middle schools: El Sausal, Harden, Washington, and La Paz. Overcrowding is also an issue for the school district. Planned improvements include expansion of Everett Alvarez High School, expansion of Harden Middle School, and modernization of Alisal High School. It is also anticipated that within the next five years, plans and construction will be completed on a new high school and a middle school site. The District continues to look at alternatives to accommodate growth to the fullest extent of the law.
New residential development in the planning area will create additional demand for schools. Since most of the current facilities are over capacity, additional schools will be required.
The City will cooperate with the various school districts to update information in their Master Plans and Long-Range Facility Plans, identify future facility sites, student generation formulas, and facility improvement plans. The Land Use Policies Map also identifies potential locations for future schools.
To the extent allowed by State law, the City will also assist the school districts in their review of development proposals to ensure that the proposals are consistent with school facilities requirements. The City will also review proposals prior to approval of building permits to

ensure that all required fees and/or land dedication have been provided to the school districts.
Libraries
Public libraries serve several community purposes including education, recreation, and public access to information. The library system has a mission “to be the focal point in the community for opening the doors to lifelong learning and enjoyment and the catalyst for promoting equal access to information.” To meet this mission, the Salinas Public Library serves residents of the City and surrounding areas with three facilities: El Gabilan Library (North Salinas), Cesar Chavez Library (East Salinas), and John
Steinbeck Library (South Salinas). Additional branches, the Creekbridge Library and McKinnon Library, are proposed for the North Salinas area.
Figure LU-9 depicts the locations of the existing libraries.
The City will continue to work with the Library Commission and Library Department to achieve the standards for library service stated in Table LU-4 and to locate future libraries and library services. In Future Growth Areas, new libraries should be located within activity centers.
Community and Institutional
As the largest city within Monterey County, Salinas contains a range of community and institutional facilities that serve both local, as well as regional needs. The following provides a description of some of the community and institutional facilities within Salinas.
City Governmental Facilities: The majority of the City public safety and administrative offices are located in the downtown area. The Police Department, along with other city offices, is located in a civic center complex on Lincoln Avenue. Fire department offices, as well as additional city offices, are located on West Alisal Street. There is a need

	to expand the existing City administrative facilities, along with the City’s Municipal Service Yard (located on Work Street), to ease overcrowding. Recreational Facilities: The City owns and operates a range of park and recreational facilities within the community. These are discussed in detail in the Conservation/Open Space Element. Recreation facilities designed for meetings, lessons, exhibits, or other events include the Community Center at Sherwood Park and the Downtown Recreation Center. Additionally, El Dorado, Central, and Closter Parks and the Breadbox Recreation Center all have recreation buildings. There are also several private recreational facilities serving Salinas including: the Salinas Golf and Country Club; Salinas Community YMCA; and Rodeo Association/Sports Complex. There is a need for a large, multi-use recreational center/gymnasium to serve the residents of Salinas. County Governmental Facilities: With many of the County offices located within Salinas, the County of Monterey is Salinas’ second largest employer. Many of the County offices are located in the downtown area, though over the last 10 years, the County has moved many facilities and office workers from the downtown area to South Main Street, the Airport Business Park, the Natividad Road area, and the former Fort Ord. While moving many employees from the downtown area, the County has also expanded facilities to an existing office building at one comer of Church and Gabilan Streets and is planning to construct additional courtrooms on another comer of Church and Gabilan Streets. Post Office Facilities: There are four Post Offices within Salinas. The Main Post Office, on Post Drive at North Davis Road, is the central processing and distribution center for Salinas and the County of Monterey. The Post Office locations are shown on Figure LU-9. Health Care Facilities: There are two hospitals serving Salinas: Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital and Natividad Medical Center (shown of Figure LU-9). Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital is a privately owned institution with a broad range of acute care services to serve the entire Salinas Valley community. The 232-bed hospital provides a range of services and programs from a regional heart center to a single-room maternity care program. The Natividad Medical Center is a county owned, 163-bed, full-serve, acute care, teaching hospital affiliated with

the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine. As with Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital, Natividad provides a range of medical services to the community. Both hospitals have expanded significantly in recent years.
Cultural Facilities and Activities: Salinas is home to the National Steinbeck Center and the Steinbeck House. In addition to these cultural facilities, there are several annual events occurring within Salinas, including: the California Rodeo, California International Airshow, and the Steinbeck Festival.
The City of Salinas will continue to support cultural and institutional facilities within	the
community, working with local community groups to identify the need for facilities and services within the
community. As appropriate, additional funds may be budgeted and new funding sources identified to help fund expanded and improved City facilities. As new areas are annexed into the City, future expansion of institutional and cultural facilities will be planned to meet the need generated by the development, as discussed earlier in this element. Salinas Municipal Airport
The Salinas Municipal Airport is located in the southeastern portion of the City. The Airport is a general aviation airport serving single and twin engine aircraft and helicopters. The Airport provides support to the surrounding agricultural industry by allowing the operation of agriculture-related equipment, such as helicopters, and the corporate aircraft owned by some agricultural operations. A Master Plan has been adopted for the airport, as well as the Monterey County Airport Land Use Plan. The City will continue to support the operation of the airport, as well as its expansion in accordance to the most recent Salinas Municipal Airport Master Plan and Monterey County Airport Land Use Plan. Funding has been approved to update the Salinas Municipal Airport Master Plan in 2002-2003. The update should contain the following: address minimum distance for Eastern bypass south of the

Introduction
GENERAL PLAN
Purpose of the Community Design Element
Scope and Content of the Community Design Element
Related Plans And Programs
The Community Design Element addresses the conservation and enhancement of the visual quality of the Salinas environment. New development and redevelopment create pressure on the natural and historic resources in Salinas that form the community’s unique character. The Community Design Element helps to preserve and improve quality of life in Salinas by addressing: 1) the protection of the community’s image and identity; 2) the preservation and enhancement of distinct neighborhoods and older areas in the community; and 3) the implementation of community livability principles.
The Community Design Element is not a State-mandated element, but is an important component of the Salinas General Plan. The Element comprises four sections: 1) this Introduction; 2) Issues, Goals, and Policies; 3) the Community Design Plan; and 4) Implementation Program. In the Issues, Goals, and Policies section, major issues related to the preservation and enhancement of the character of the community are identified and related goals and policies are established to address these issues. The goals, which are general statements of the community’s desires, comprise broad statements of purpose and direction. The policies serve as guides for preserving the unique character of Salinas. The Plan explains how the goals and policies will be achieved and implemented, while the Implementation Program identifies the specific implementation programs for this Element.
A number of existing plans and programs administered by State and local agencies direcdy relate to the goals of the Community Design Element. These plans and programs are described below.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and Guidelines
The California Environmental Quality Act was adopted by the State legislature in response to a public mandate for thorough environmental analysis of projects that might affect the environment. The provisions of the law and environmental review procedures are described in the CEQA Statutes and the CEQA Guidelines. Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines specifically includes sample questions related to a variety of environmental topics, including aesthetics, to help determine potential aesthetics impacts of new development. Implementation of CEQA
September 2002
City of Salinas
General Plan
CD-I
Community Design Element
ensures that during the decision making stage of development, City officials and the general public will be able to assess the environmental impacts associated with public and private development projects.
City of Salinas Zoning Code
The Zoning Code contains development standards for all zoning districts within the City. The Code addresses design related issues such as site plan review requirements and landscaping and sign standards for certain projects and certain districts within the community through both administrative and discretionary land use permit processes. The Zoning Code will be comprehensively updated to reflect the policies and land uses of the General Plan update.
Street Tree Plan
Per Chapter 35 — Trees and Shrubs of the City Municipal Code, the City implements a Street Tree Program. This program, which is implemented by the Public Works Department, provides for the planting, maintenance, and improvement of street trees within the community. New development is charged a City Street Tree Fee or is required to plant trees as part of the building permit process.
Central City Redevelopment Project Area
The City Redevelopment Agency implements the Central City Redevelopment Project Area. The following activities, programs, and services related to community design apply to properties located within the Project Area (Figure LU-8 of the Land Use Element): 1) Facade Improvement Program; 2) Design Review Board; and 3) Salinas Train Station enhancement.

Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
Sunset Avenue/Buena Vista Redevelopment Project Area
The City Redevelopment Agency implements the Sunset Avenue/Buena Vista Redevelopment Project Area. The following programs and services related to community design apply to properties located within the Project Area ( depicted on Figure LU-8 of the Land Use Element): 1) Fagade Improvement Program; 2) Salinas Mural Program (provides funds for local organizations/artists to design and paint murals); 3) Jazz-Up Program (no cost minor repair and exterior painting for properties within the Sunset Avenue/Buena Vista Redevelopment Project area); and 4) Streetscape Program.
Boronda Neighborhood Improvement Plan
The County of Monterey Redevelopment Agency Boronda Neighborhood Improvement Plan encompasses approximately 400 acres of land located just outside the Salinas City limits. The area is bounded on the west by Boronda Road, on the south by the Union Pacific Railroad tracks, on the east by the Salinas City limits, and on the north by a line extending from Boronda and Brooks Roads to Highway 101. The plan provides for the preservation and revitalization of residential areas as well as enhanced community image for this part of the community. Community design related programs and services implemented through this plan include landscaping, tree planting, rehabilitation loans, and neighborhood improvement activities such as litter removal, vehicle abatement, home repair, paint, and weatherization.
While the Community Design Element is not a State-mandated element, state planning law does require the element be consistent with other General Plan elements. Each of the elements forms an independent portion of the General Plan, yet all of the elements are interrelated to a degree. This overlap between elements ensures that the community’s goals are achieved through the policies and implementation programs contained in each of the elements. The Community Design Element is closely related to the Land Use, Conservation/Open Space , and Housing Elements.
The Land Use Element and Community Design Element work together to mold the physical appearance of the community. The Land Use Element establishes the general type, location, and amount of each land use within the City, while the Community Design Element guides the visual appearance of the development allowed under the Land Use Element. The Land Use and Conservation/Open Space Elements also

include policies to balance future development with the preservation of agriculture and large areas of open space, in order to maintain the rural and natural visual character of the community. The Conservation/Open Space Element also identifies important historic and architectural resources to be protected.
The Community Design Element and Housing Element are also interrelated in that design criteria contained in the Community Design Element impose design standards in residential areas to maintain and enhance the visual character of the neighborhoods. Additionally, rehabilitation and property maintenance programs implemented through the Housing Element contribute to the beautification of residential neighborhoods throughout the community.

GENERAL PLAN
Issues, Goals and Policies
The visual character of Salinas with its compact urban form and urban/agricultural edges, distinguishes it from surrounding areas. This distinctive character is further enhanced through the architectural styles and historic features found in the community.
Three major community design issues are addressed in the goals, policies, and implementing actions of this Element. These major issues are related to: 1) maintaining and improving the image and identity of the community; 2) preserving, enhancing and revitalizing the community’s neighborhoods and older areas; and 3) implementing community livability principles to enhance the quality of life in the community. Each issue and its related goals, policies, and implementing actions are identified and discussed in the following section.
Image and Surrounded by agricultural lands, Salinas has a distinct identity as an Identity urban island in a rural setting. The City has a number of “gateways” or entrances from Highway 101 and other major roadways that could be substantially enhanced by additional landscaping, street right-of-way improvements, signing and attention to design. Additional landscaping and signing in public areas could be used to identify entry into specific neighborhoods or areas. In addition, several of the gateways are examples of the distinct urban-rural edges, which, in turn, are part of the image of the City. The following goal and policies focus on the creation and preservation of a positive image and identity for the
community and support traditional neighborhood development.
Goal CD-I:	Create and preserve a positive community
image and identity.
Policy CD-1.1 : Create entrances to the city that announce arrival and establish a positive impression.
Policy CD-1.2 :	Maintain Salinas as a city with sharply defined
edges between urban use and surrounding agricultural activities.

Policy CD-1.3:	Maintain the distinction of the City’s urban/rural
interface by using roadway segments and/or natural features and tree plantings to form the boundary between urban development and open space or agriculture.
Policy CD-1.4:	Use landscaping, design schemes and signing to
improve the image and distinct identity of the city, its neighborhoods and its major gateways.
Policy CD-1.5 :	Create a “park-like” atmosphere for the city with
greenways, landscaped streets and medians and parks distributed through the community at convenient locations.
Policy CD-1.6:	Locate and design water retention areas and
preserve important urban wildlife habitat areas to contribute to the visual quality of the city’s open space system.
Policy CD-1.7:	Design city-owned land and Highway 101 right-of-
way landscaping to make Salinas interesting and attractive as seen from the highway.
Policy CD-1.8:	Apply high-quality design standards to projects
visible from Highway 101.
Policy CD-1.9:	Imp rove the appearance of land designated as
Arterial Frontage.
Policy CD-1.10: Require a balance of housing types and designs to avoid both monotony and visual chaos.
Salinas has an excellent climate and beautiful natural setting. Many of its neighborhoods, both newer and older, are very attractive. Yet other areas need revitalization to improve livability and sustain the community’s overall quality of life. Well-planned growth, public improvements and private reinvestment in existing neighborhoods; a range of housing types; natural environment protection; more transportation choices; and expansion of economic opportunities can enhance the community. The following goal and policies are designed to create a community that provides an attractive and pedestrian-friendly environment.

Goal CD-2:	Encourage the design, maintenance, and revitalization of neighborhoods that enhance quality of life.
Policy CD-2.1:	Maximize a strong sense of neighborhood identity and harmony by implementing architectural design and community layout techniques, such as building location and spacing, landscaping features, and lighting that create distinct neighborhoods, encourage interactions among residents, and facilitate safe street life.
Policy CD-2.2:	Minimize potential light and sound impacts of new development on surrounding areas.
Policy CD-2.3:	Require infill development to be consistent with the scale and character of existing neighborhoods.
Policy CD-2.4:	Use developer incentives, enforcement of property maintenance and building codes, public-private partnerships and City-sponsored programs to encourage the continued maintenance and rehabilitation of residential, commercial, public, and industrial properties.
Policy CD-2.5:	Encourage the use of design features to create an environment that maximizes the number of “eyes on the street” and reduces potential criminal activities.
Policy CD-2.6:	Preserve architecturally important historic buildings that are capable of being adapted for viable use.
Policy CD-2.7:	Minimize the use and visual effect of sound attenuation walls.
Policy CD-2.8:	Avoid large un-landscaped parking areas and blank building walls facing streets or adjoining properties.
Policy CD-2.9:	Coordinate public/private efforts to remove old and dilapidated signs and billboards.

Policy CD-2.10: Improve the Soledad Street neighborhood by adding and rehabilitating high-density residential and allowing compatible neighborhood-serving commercial and general commercial/light-industrial uses.
Community	To enhance livability and a pedestrian-friendly environment,
Livability	neighborhoods should be designed to address the needs of all residents
and improve quality of life. Increased densities in appropriate areas, mixed use development, infill and clustering encourage key activity centers and a pedestrian friendly environment. Selectively locating higher densities and mixed use development within walking distance of areas with frequent transit service, such as the Intermodal Transportation Center downtown, increases travel choices and encourages alternative modes of transportation. Connecting these high activity areas by transit and safe and convenient bicycle and pedestrian access can also promote active village centers and “walkable” neighborhoods. The following goal and policies are designed to create a walkable community that provides a livable environment for all of its
residents.
Goal 3:	Create a community that promotes a pedestrian-
friendly, livable environment.
Policy CD-3.1 :	Create and preserve distinct, identifiable
neighborhoods that have traditional neighborhood development (TND) characteristics. Specifically, each neighborhood should have the following characteristics:
An approximately 5-minute walk from perimeter to center;
Housing densities should increase from perimeter to center (i.e., neighborhoods should be more densely populated at the center);
The neighborhood center should be the location of retail space, office space, and upper story residential above commercial and office space;
A civic or public space such as a plaza or park should be at the neighborhood center;

Small parks should be distributed throughout the neighborhood;
Schools should lie within the neighborhood and be easily accessible and within walking distance;
When not adjacent to agricultural operations, which may require a variety of buffering techniques, the neighborhood edge should be bordered by either a natural corridor or the edge of an adjacent neighborhood across a pedestrian-friendly boulevard; and
Front yard setbacks should decrease from neighborhood edge to neighborhood center.
Establish and maintain the Central City (i.e., downtown area) as the business, government, dining, lodging, cultural, and entertainment center of Salinas.
Maintain a compact Central City core that minimizes distances between most residential units, offices, stores and restaurants.
Actively encourage mixed-use development in order to provide a greater spectrum of housing near businesses, alternative modes of transportation and other activity areas.
Promote high-density residential development and mixed-use (commercial, office, and residential together) in the Central City to the extent consistent with the area’s architectural and historical character.
Provide and maintain a pedestrian-friendly atmosphere by encouraging “pedestrian zones” with increased land-scaping, use of traffic-calming techniques on local streets, adequate separation from automobile traffic and the inclusion of amenities such as lighted crosswalks and increased lighting along sidewalks.

GENERAL PLAN
The community of Salinas is fortunate to contain many natural, historic, and architectural features that form the City’s unique character. By addressing these features in the General Plan, the community has the unique opportunity to conserve and develop a series of interrelated environments and neighborhoods that enhance quality of life. The Community Design Plan develops a design framework to guide future development and redevelopment to ensure the maintenance and enhancement of the community’s image and identity.
Image and The Community Design Plan helps to protect and enhance the image Identity and identity of the community by addressing: 1) the visual improvement of the major entrances to the community; 2) the maintenance of sharply defined urban/agricultural edges; and 3) the
preservation and enhancement of view corridors from Highway 101.
Entrances
Salinas has several points of entry that set a tone for the part of the City they introduce. The most important points of arrival, or “gateways” into the community are identified on Figure CD-I and include: 1) the South Main/Blanco Gateway; 2) the West Market/Davis Gateway; 3) the 101/Boronda Gateway; 4) the North 101/Main Gateway; and S) the Sanborn/101 Gateway.
As depicted in Figure CD-I, these gateway areas are zoned Gateway Overlay District and are subject to the land use regulations and development standards of the Gateway Overlay District. The specific purposes of the Gateway Overlay District are to:
(a)	Coordinate public/private partnerships to create entrances that announce arrival and set a tone for the part of the City they introduce;
(b)	Establish attractive and inviting entrances to the City in order to form the basis for positive impressions and perceptions of the community;
(c)	Avoid inappropriate development that would result in incompatible uses or design; and
(d)	Encourage site planning and design that is sensitive to the unique gateway district.

A primary goal of the Community Design Element is maintaining Salinas’ sharply defined edges, exemplified in such areas as the lettuce fields between Blanco Road and the Salinas River in the southern perimeter of the City and the agricultural fields west of Davis Road and north of Boronda Road. Approaching from the south and the west, the transition from agricultural to urban landscape is more apparent than from the north. Traveling toward the City from the southeast on Highway 68 and from the west
on Highway 183/Highway 1, the urban edge is very well-defined.
Salinas works to preserve these edges by using roadway segments to form distinct boundaries between urban development and agricultural uses. Additionally, the City implements several programs to preserve the prime agricultural land that provides these distinct boundaries to the City. These programs, which are described in detail in the Conservation/Open Space Element, include: implementing the Boronda Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the County of Monterey; supporting and implementing the City-Centered Growth Principles to maintain compact form and conserve agricultural land in the southern and western portions of the planning area; and providing necessary infrastructure that supports these agricultural uses.
Views from Highway 101
A visitor’s first impression of Salinas is likely to be from Highway 101. Highway 101 provides several view corridors of the community. Primary views available from Highway 101 include: agricultural views in the northern portion of the planning area; views of the Northridge Shopping Center area, the Auto Center, and Westridge Center; long vistas into Carr Lake; and views of potential office and commercial development in the central portion of the City as depicted in Figure CD-2. Several of these view corridors that are visible when traveling south on the 101 require improvement.

Division 1S of the Zoning Ordinance contains special requirements that apply to the 101 gateway areas identified on Figure CD-I. These requirements include special screening such as landscaping or landscaped walls and fences and amend the types of uses generally permitted in the underlying district(s) of these areas. The design and sign guidelines in these areas must be strictly adhered to and any proposed project must undergo design review by City staff.
Community Preservation and Enhancement
Salinas promotes the development of distinctive attractive communities with a strong sense of place. Neighborhoods should provide an emotional connection to the local natural environment, the community’s built environment, the historical and cultural roots of the place, and neighbors. Architectural criteria and community layout, including the location of public building and spaces, and the provision of identifiable entry points should be used to encourage the interaction among residents, facilitate street life, and maximize a strong sense of neighborhood identity and harmony.’(Figure CD-3)

	Additionally, several areas of the City need revitalization and enhancement to improve livability and sustain the community’s quality of life. The following programs promote the preservation and enhancement of neighborhoods within the community. Neighborhood Maintenance Several residential neighborhoods in the community have older homes that require rehabilitation due to substandard property maintenance and inadequate infrastructure (e.g., street lighting, roadways, sidewalks). The maintenance and revitalization of these areas enhances the quality of life and distinctive character of these important residential neighbor-hoods. Residential Design Guidelines The Zoning Code includes low density, medium density and high density residential design guidelines. New development and major rehabilitation projects are required to comply with these guidelines. Enforcement of these regulations through the development and redevelopment process helps to ensure new residential land uses are compatible with the existing uses in the neighborhood. Property Maintenance The City works with the County of Monterey Health Department to abate property maintenance issues related to the accumulation of garbage, trash, junk, and debris, including vehicle parts and equipment. Additionally, California Vehicle Code section 22669(d), prohibits a vehicle from being parked on the street or other public property with a major component missing. Major components include the engine, radiator, wheel(s), tire(s), window(s), door(s), etc. If reported to the Salinas Police Department, these vehicles are towed. Salinas City Code also prohibits inoperable vehicles from being parked or stored on private property. A vehicle is considered inoperable if it is missing any major component, partially dismanded, or even if it is not registered. The City Code Enforcement Office is responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Salinas City Code. The City provides information on its website to inform residents how to report property maintenance problems like those listed above.
City of Salinas General Plan	September 2002 CD-16
Community Design Element
	Weed Abatement Overgrown weeds and vegetation can create a fire hazard, provide a breeding ground and harbor for rodents, and can detract from the neighborhood’s appearance.	Regular maintenance of existing landscaping, and the removal and/or trimming of dry and/or overgrown weeds and vegetation helps to enrich the character of the City’s neighborhoods. The City Weed Abatement Program addresses monitoring and abatement of weed problems. The City provides information on its website to inform residents how to report weed problems. Infrastructure The City targets Community Development Block Grant funds and redevelopment funds to improve infrastructure in low and moderate income neighborhoods in the community. The Capital Improvement program identifies infrastructure improvements (e.g., sidewalk repair, street maintenance, street lighting) budgeted for the next year. These improvements are generally implemented through the Public Works Department. Housing Services Program Housing Services Program (HSP) is a home repair and improvement program serving property owners within the Salinas city limits. Through the HSP, the City provides technical and financial assistance, allowing property owners to correct deficiencies and improve the livability of their residential property. Eligible improvements and repairs include: roofs, plumbing, windows, foundations, floors, electrical systems, bathrooms and kitchens, etc. Low interest loans in amounts up to $45,000 are available to eligible property owners to make repairs to their residential property. When a room addition is included, the maximum loan amount increases to $56,000. For more detailed information regarding home improvement programs, please refer the Plan Section of the Housing Element. Revitalization of Older Areas Several older areas in the community offer revitalization opportunities that could enhance the image of the City and provide economic development opportunities. Areas in particular need of revitalization
City of Salinas General Plan	September 2002 CD-17
Community Design Element
include:	1) the Central City and Sunset Avenue/Buena Vista
Redevelopment Project areas identified on Figure LU-8 in the Land Use Element; 2) the unincorporated 400-acre Boronda Neighborhood encompassed on the west by Boronda Road, on the east by the City limits, on the south by the Union Pacific Railroad tracks, and on the north by a line extending from Boronda and Brooks Road to Highway 101; and 3) the commercial strips in East Salinas that line Alisal and Market Streets and Williams and Sanborn Roads.
All departments within the City support public-private partnerships to revitalize older areas of the community. Methods the City supports for revitalizing older areas of the community include:	1)
reuse/redevelopment of blighted areas; 2) the creation and preservation of identifiable neighborhoods through distinct entrances such as those depicted in Figure CD-2; 3) enhancing arterial street segments and rights-of-way that are clearly visible from major roadways through street tree planting (Street Tree Plan) and landscaping (Figure CD-2); 4) investing in infrastructure provision and replacement when necessary; S) strengthening code enforcement activities and rehabilitation efforts; and 6) using design features to create an environment that reduces crime as described in detail in the Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) sections of the Safety Element.
The City of Salinas Redevelopment Agency implements the Central City and Sunset Avenue Redevelopment Project Areas. Activities, incentives, and programs to maintain and revitalize properties in these areas include:
Facade Improvement Program — This program offers matching grants to property owners and businesses in the Central City and Sunset Avenue/Buena Vista Redevelopment Project Areas (RPAs) to improve the appearance of property and store fronts by providing technical architectural services and grants for a portion of the costs of eligible improvements. Eligible exterior improvements include: painting; signs; awnings; storefront fagade restoration; parking lot landscaping along street frontage; and related exterior improvements.
> Salinas Mural Program — This program, which is implemented in accordance with the Zoning Ordinance and the mural guidelines established by the Redevelopment Agency, offers community groups and local artists an opportunity to design

and paint murals, funded in part by the Agency. This program is designed to encourage youth participation in the beautification efforts of the Agency by depicting the rich diversity of the Salinas Valley using various art forms. Current eligibility requirements: Local community organizations/artists are required to submit a proposal outlining the concept design, budget, and how it benefits the community.
Economic Incentive Zone — The revitalization of the downtown area is one of the highest priorities for the City. In order to revitalize the Central City Redevelopment Project Area, the City implements a host of economic incentives in a limited core of the downtown , known as the Economic Incentive Zone (EIZ). Policies for this area offer “fast-track” application processing, the potential for intensified development, and encouraging the reuse of existing buildings. The Agency pays for City traffic, sanitary sewer, and storm drain impact fees for development projects in the EIZ.
Design Review Board — Projects located in the Central City Redevelopment Project Area and consisting of new construction or substantial modification to building exteriors require review by the Salinas Design Review Board. The nine-member Board meets on an as-needed basis, usually within two or three weeks of an application submittal to the Redevelopment Agency staff.
Streetscape Program — This beautification program addresses the construction of a streetscape theme that includes landscaping, lighting and the undergrounding of utility lines to create an attractive, safe, and efficient commercial environment in the retail and commercial areas in the East Salinas Redevelopment Project Area.
>	Jazz-Up Program — This program offers minor repair and exterior painting services at no cost for labor to commercial and residential properties that qualify in the Sunset Avenue Redevelopment Project area.
>	Future Plans for the 100 Block of Main Street — There is considerable property in the 100 block of Main Street that agency staff is actively seeking developers for projects such as a downtown hotel, entertainment venues, and a parking structure.

y Street Tree Plan - The City has a Street Tree Program, which is implemented by the Public Works Department. The program provides for the planting, maintenance, and improvement of street trees within the community. Development is charged a City Street Tree Fee or is required to plant required trees as part of the building permit process.
Architectural Heritage
The City’s architectural heritage is an essential component of the City’s distinctive character. The Central City has hundreds of buildings that link Salinas to its past. The Cultural Resources section of the Conservation/Open Space Element identifies architecturally and historically significant buildings in the community. Salinas encourages the preservation of these resources through the application of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Discretionary development proposals are evaluated under CEQA to assess their impacts to sensitive cultural resources. If significant impacts to an architecturally significant building will occur as a result of a proposed project, mitigation will be required to reduce or avoid the impact.
City policy also calls for the preservation of architecturally important historic buildings that are capable of being adapted for current use. Whenever a historic or architecturally significant building is present at a site, the rehabilitation and reuse of the structure should be a component of the new project design. The review process for discretionary projects allows City staff to require that renovations and new buildings in areas that include concentrations of important historic buildings be architecturally compatible with surrounding buildings and the architectural character of the neighborhood.
A livable community provides safety, comfort, convenience, affordability, community cohesion, and increased opportunities for social and economic development. Community livability direcdy benefits people who live in, work in, or visit the community, increases property values and business activity, and it can improve public health and safety. Livable communities contain a compact mix of residential, commercial, and civic uses that fosters: pedestrian and bicycle activity, public safety, long —term investment, efficient use of infrastructure, and efficient provision of public services. General community livability principles that relate directly to community design include:

y Providing access to public transit in activity centers and areas with higher density and mixed use development
The Community Design Element encourages the general principles of community livability through the following specific programs:
Mixed Use Development
A fundamental component of community livability is providing a full array of land uses and structures that work together to create a vibrant, “walkable” community. According to the New Community Design (NCD) guidelines, the mix of land uses should at a minimum include housing, office space with significant employment opportunities, schools, retail shopping, outdoor recreation areas, and a combination of civic and public spaces and buildings. Figure CD-4 provides an example of a mixed use neighborhood.
The critical characteristic of true mixed use communities is that residents provide a market and employees for businesses, and, in turn, businesses provide desired amenities and employment opportunities for residents. This synergistic relationship encourages long-term economic vitality in the community and can help create 24-hour neighborhoods where workers support retail and restaurants during the day and residents can support businesses at night and on weekends.2
The City supports mixed use development through its Mixed Use land use category. As described in detail in the Land Use Element, the Mixed Use designation allows for development including a mixture of retail, office and residential uses in the same building, on the same parcel or in the same area. The intent of this designation is to create activity centers with pedestrian-oriented uses in certain portions of the City. Further, many of the areas in the City that have an existing highly mixed land use pattern are designated for Arterial Frontage uses and future development in these areas are best determined by detailed

study. Appropriate uses in this zone include residential, commercial and small-scale compatible industry.

General Plan
CD-22
Community Design Element
The General Plan designates 231 acres outside the Central City area and 62 acres within the Central City area for Mixed Use development. Fifty-six acres of land within the planning area are designated Arterial Frontage, a majority of which is located along Market and Main Streets. The implementation of these designations allows for the creation of vibrant and compact mixed use areas that are in proximity to existing parks, high density residential, retail, and publiq/civic spaces.
The General Plan also encourages mixed development in the Retail and Office land use categories by allowing a maximum of 10 dwelling units per acre in Retail areas Citywide and 18 dwelling units per acre in Retail areas in the Central City area. The Office category allows for a maximum of 10 dwelling units per acre citywide, 22 dwelling units per acre in the Central City area and 10 dwelling units per acre in the East Romie Lane portion of the community.
The current Salinas Zoning Code allows consideration of residential uses in its commercial zones, with the exception of the Commercial Thoroughfare (CT) district and General Commercial/Light Industrial (CG) district. The Mixed Office/Residential (CO/R), Commercial Office (CO), Commercial Retail (CR), Downtown Commercial (CD), and Arterial Frontage (CAF) districts provide for a mix of office, retail, entertainment, recreational, and residential uses. Single-family homes are permitted by right and multi-family developments are permitted subject to Site Plan Review in the CO/R district. Single-family and multi-family homes are permitted with a conditional use permit in the remaining four districts. The Zoning Code will be comprehensively updated to be consistent with the updated General Plan.
Pedestrian-Friendly Environment
Walkable, close-knit neighborhoods create a sense of place, support economic development, encourage activity on the streets, improve health and safety, and reduce traffic congestion. Ten key characteristics that encourage a walkable community include3:
A compact, lively town center
Many linkages to neighborhoods, including walkways, trails, and roadways
Low speed streets (20-25 miles per hour on downtown and neighborhood streets)

Community Design Element
	Neighborhood schools and parks Public places packed with children, teenagers, older adults, and people with disabilities Convenient, safe, and easy street crossings Inspiring and well-maintained public streets > Land use and transportation mutually beneficial Celebrated public space and public life Many people walking Pedestrian-friendly design employs mixed uses, key amenities within walkable distances, and narrower streets with sidewalks to promote safe walking for residents and workers. Figure CD-3 provides an example of a pedestrian-friendly environment.	Essential street design components for a pedestrian friendly environment include: adequate sidewalks; well-marked and lit cross-walks; adequate street lighting; and significant shade trees. Cul-de-sacs should be avoided unless natural conditions demand them.	Neighborhood streets should, when possible, be narrower and lined with trees to not only help slow down cars, but also create comfortable conditions for walkers and cyclists. The Circulation Element describes street network characteristics that encourage traditional neighborhood developments and a pedestrian-friendly environment. The City encourages streets, pedestrian paths, and bike paths that provide a system of fully-connected and interesting routes to all destinations. Their design should encourage bicycle and pedestrian use by being small and spatially defined by buildings, trees and lighting, and by discouraging high-speed traffic. Figure C-5 in the Circulation Element illustrates the bicycle/pedestrian path network in the community. This network provides links to major recreational, retail, and activity centers in the community, and also provides direct access to many transit nodes. The City continues to cooperate with the Transportation Agency of Monterey County (TAMC) and the Monterey Bay Unified Air District to extend and maintain this system of bicycle and pedestrian trails through the community. Alternative Modes of Transportation An essential component of community livability is providing for a variety of transportation choices and increasing the use of alternative modes of transportation.	Advantages of alternative modes of
City of Salinas General Plan	September 2002 CD-24

transportation include: reduced traffic; improved air quality; and increased recreational opportunities.
For public transit to be competitive with cars, it must be high quality, accessible, and competitive in time, convenience, and flexibility. The Circulation Element of this Plan explains in detail the City’s public transportation system, which includes the City’s Intermodal Transit Center, bus service, and bicycle/pedestrian paths. As explained in the Circulation Element, the City works with several agencies to ensure the provision, maintenance, and improvement of public transit facilities and services.
Public Areas and Open Space
Access to public areas and open space enhances the quality of life for workers and residents within the
community. Community livability principles that address the community’s need for public areas and open space include:
The community should have a center focus that combines commercial, civic, cultural, and recreational uses;
The community should contain an ample supply of specialized open space in the form of squares, greens, and parks whose frequent use is encouraged through placement and design; and
Mixed residential and commercial activity centers should be designed to facilitate the use of public transit and encourage the attention and presence of people at all hours of the day and night.

Community Design Element
As described in detail in the Community and Institutional sections of the Land Use Element and the Parks and Recreational Facilities sections of the Conservation/Open Space Element, Salinas offers a range of recreational and cultural facilities and activities. Many of these facilities are easily accessible though the bicycle pedestrian network and are within easy walking distance of transit stops. Many of these facilities are located in portions of the community (e.g., the Central City) that contain a mix of commercial, civic, and residential land uses that encourages the presence of workers and tourists in the daytime and residents in the nighttime and on weekends.
Additionally, the Redevelopment Agency is actively seeking developers for projects on several properties in the 100 block of Main Street. The development/redevelopment of a mix of uses in this area surrounding the Steinbeck Center will provide a central focus within the community that provides a mix of commercial, civic, cultural, and recreational uses.
As described in the Conservation/Open Space Element, an additional 7S7 acres of parkland on 28 sites are planned in the community. The provision of these facilities will provide for additional park and recreational activities ranging from passive and active open space on 440 acres of Carr Lake to smaller vest pocket parks and tot lots, neighborhood parks, and community parks. The addition of these park areas, particularly in the northern and eastern portion of the community will provide open space and recreational opportunities within easy walking distance of many planned residential and mixed use neighborhoods. At the time the park sites are developed, they should be connected to the bicycle/pedestrian path network.
Development in Future Growth Areas
Development in Future Growth Areas will be based on the principles of New Urbanism. This Element provides the following essential guidance for preparing Specific Plans for these areas:
■	Charrettes are strongly encouraged in the early part of the process in drafting a Specific Plan to ensure effective public participation in the planning process and to insure that New Urbanism principles are properly employed. Charrettes will be the responsibility of the project proponent.
■	New development within each future growth area shall be made up of one or more “neighborhoods.” Each neighborhood shall

	transition from an urban neighborhood center to the edge of a collector roadway. ■	Each neighborhood or group of neighborhoods within each future growth area shall provide for a mix of housing, workplaces, retail, commercial services and publiq/semi-public uses including schools, and shall include land designated for public parks/recreation. ■	In order to preserve agricultural land, and to achieve the other benefits of compact urban design, new neighborhoods shall be required to achieve a minimum average density of 9 units per net residential developable acre, exclusive of open space, parks, schools, streets and other non-developable areas. ■	New residential developments shall not achieve the required average density of 9 units per net residential developable acre through an exclusive mix of low-density and high-density units. From 3596-45% of the housing units in new residential developments shall be of housing types that fall within the range of 7-14 units per net residential developable acre. ■	Residential developers shall be encouraged to design new residential developments with as many discreet lot sizes and housing types as is feasible, in the interest of offering a greater number of choices access the broad range of housing prices. Several lot sizes and housing types within each block shall be encouraged, to provide variety and texture within the block, as well as throughout each neighborhood. Clustering a large group of any single housing type in several large blocks shall be avoided. ■	The street network within each Future Growth Area shall have the following characteristics: a.	Traffic shall be channeled from major arterials around groups of neighborhoods on collector roadways. b.	Collector roadways may be used to channel traffic from major arterials and collector roadways to, but not through, neighborhood commercial centers. The front setbacks shall progressively decrease as residential areas approach the neighborhood center.
City of Salinas General Plan	September 2002 CD-27
Community Design Element
c.	Each neighborhood shall be connected in as many locations as possible to collector roadways to disburse and calm the traffic as it leaves and enters the residential neighborhood.
d.	Open spaces, schools and parks shall be fronted by streets or public spaces, and shall not be privatized behind backyards.
e.	“Gated” single-family home communities shall not be permitted.
f.	Individual blocks should generally average less than 600 feet in length and less than 1,800 feet in perimeter, measured at the right-of-way line.
g.	Cul-de-sacs shall be avoided unless natural terrain demands them.
h.	The street network shall be thoroughly interconnected.
i.	Streets in the neighborhood commercial center shall have parking on both sides. Head in and angle parking is preferred in the commercial center.
j.	In order to slow traffic, standard residential streets shall be no more than 34 feet wide with parking on both sides.
k.	Rear alleys will be considered. Rear alleys must be paved and landscaped and must be maintained by a landscape and lighting district, or comparable, permanent financing mechanism.

Housing Element
Introduction
GENERAL PLAN
The Housing Element provides an indication of the need for housing in the community, particularly the availability, affordability, and adequacy of housing. The Element serves as a strategy to address housing needs across the economic and social spectrum.
Purpose of fhe Housing Element
Scope and Content of the Housing
Element
The Housing Element is designed to achieve the following objectives set forth in State law:
1)	Identify adequate sites for a range of housing opportunities;
2)	Assist in the development of adequate and affordable housing;
3)	Address constraints to meeting the City’s housing needs;
4)	Conserve and improve the condition of housing; and
5)	Promote housing opportunities for all persons.
The City’s 2002-2007 Housing Element contains appropriate policies and programs to achieve these goals.
The Salinas Housing Element is a mandated component of the General Plan and has been designed to satisfy the requirements of State law. Section 6SS83 of the California Government Code establishes the required components for a Housing Element. The Housing Element consists of four sections: (1) Introduction; (2) Housing Context; (3) Issues, Goals and Policies; and (4) the Housing Implementation Plan.
The Housing Element analyzes the City’s housing needs based on a review of population and housing stock characteristics. A key component of this analysis is the “fair share” of housing need assigned to the City by the Regional Housing Needs Plan prepared by the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG). Having documented the extent of housing needs, the Housing Element sets forth goals, policies, and programs to address identified housing needs.
Technical Appendix This Housing Element summarizes findings gathered from the Housing Element Technical Appendix. The Technical Appendix provides in-depth discussion of the following topics: a housing needs assessment, analysis of potential housing constraints, analysis of housing resources to address the City’s housing needs, and an evaluation of accomplishments since the last housing element was adopted in 1991.

Public Participation	Section 65583(c)(5) of the Government Code states that local governments “shall make a diligent effort to achieve public participation of all economic segments of the community in the development of the housing element and the program shall describe this effort.” Public participation played an important role in the formulation of Salinas’ housing goals and policies as described below. As described in the Introduction to the General Plan, this Housing Element was prepared as part of a comprehensive update to the City’s General Plan. As part of that effort, the City’s public participation component involved the following facets: 1)	Citywide survey to determine priority issues (bilingual); 2)	Citizen Advisory Committee meetings; 3)	Solicitation of input from housing advocacy groups; 4)	Visioning Workshops as part of the General Plan (bilingual); 5)	Topic Workshops (bilingual); 6)	Website publications and notices; 7)	Joint meetings of City Council and Planning Commission; and 8)	Public hearings at the Planning Commission and City Council. Public input received from this process was incorporated into the Housing Element and was instrumental in formulating the goals, policies, and programs for the present 2002-2007 planning period. The City made available the draft Housing Element to seniors, persons with disabilities, homeless advocates, farmworker organizations, the Chamber of Commerce, and other interested parties. Copies were also made available at City Hall and the local libraries for public review. All visioning meetings, Council District meetings and Topic Group meetings (total of 12) included bilingual notices and presentations. One Council District meeting was presented in Spanish with English translation. Verbal Spanish translation was also available at all meetings. The General Plan newsletter, including survey, telephone interview, and presentations made to parents groups at seven schools was bilingual. For Planning Commission and City Council hearings, public notices included a prominent note in Spanish advising of the meeting, and verbal translation of the discussion was available at each meeting. After receipt of comments by the State Department of Housing and Community Development, the public and interested parties will again have opportunity to review and comment on the Housing Element. Duly noticed public hearings before the Planning Commission and City Council will be held and verbal bilingual translation will.be available.

Housing Context
Since the late 1990s, Salinas has experienced extensive demand for housing due to employment and population growth, with the population growing 32% to 143,727 persons. For instance, as vacancy rates have declined in recent years, housing prices have risen 38% from 1997-2001, nearly triple the rate of inflation. Like any other jurisdiction, Salinas also has housing issues of overpayment and overcrowding that are in addition to growth-induced housing demand.
The following section summarizes the key housing needs in Salinas. The Technical Appendix to the Housing Element contains a comprehensive need assessment from which this summary is drawn. The summary of housing needs is organized under housing availability, housing affordability and adequacy, special needs, and future housing needs. Table H-l summarizes these needs.

Housing Element
	Housing Availability Salinas’ housing stock consists of 39,175 units, of which 61% are single-family houses, 35% in multiple-family structures, and 4% are mobile homes. Over the past decade, the number of housing units has increased 15% primarily due to subdivision development in Northeast Salinas. Moreover, homeownership rates have increased from 46% to 50% concurrent with this development. Based on available land designated for residential development and the 2000 Census person per household figure, the Salinas General Plan projects that Salinas’ population is expected to grow to approximately 212,000. Therefore, planning for the housing needs of new and existing residents will remain important issues to be addressed in the community. In the latter half of the 1990s, Salinas experienced increased demand for housing, as reflected in housing vacancy rates. Currently, Salinas has an overall 3.8% rental vacancy rate, with for-rent vacancies substantially lower in North and South Salinas. Vacancy rates for ownership units are significantly lower at 1%. Industry standards assume that a vacancy rate of 1.5% to 2.0% for ownership units and 5% to 6% for rental units allows for adequate mobility, provides sufficient incentive to maintain housing, and avoids price escalation due to scarcity of units. Thus, Salinas’ low vacancy rates indicate a strong demand for housing. High demand for housing has resulted in increasing home prices. Over the past four years, the sales prices for single-family houses have increased 40% versus a 13% increase in the consumer price index. During 2001, the median sales price of a single-family house was $232,000. Median house prices also ranged significantly by location, from a low of $173,000 in East Salinas to $208,000 in North Salinas, to $298,500 in South Salinas. Condominiums are generally more affordable and sold for median prices of $117,000, $127,000 and $123,000 in each of these subareas, respectively. Over the past few years, rents have also increased, but not as much as sales prices for single-family houses. In 2001, the median apartment rent in Salinas was $800 per month. The median apartment rent ranged from a low of $700 for a one-bedroom unit to $830 for a two-bedroom unit to slightly over $1,000 for a three-bedroom unit. In similar locations, single family houses and condominiums typically command higher rents than similarly sized apartments.
City of Salinas General Plan	September 2002 H-4
Housing Element
	Housing Affordability Housing is typically considered to be “affordable” when a household pays no more than 3096 of gross income toward housing costs. Housing Elements are required by state law to analyze housing affordability for four different income categories — very low-, low, moderate-, and above-moderate-income. Very low-income refers to household income up to 50% of the median household income for the county. Low-income refers to income which falls between 51% and 80% of the county median. Moderate-income refers to income between 81% and 120% of the county median. Above moderate-income refers to income above 120% of the county median. Very low-income households The City has an estimated 9,192 very low-income households in 2000. In 2001, very low-income households generally earned up to $26,300 annually for a four-person family. With their limited income, very low-income households are limited to the rental market. However, because very low-income households can only afford $500 a month in rent, they typically cannot afford to rent even a one-bedroom apartment. Low-income households The City has an estimated 7,660 low-income households in 2000. In 2001, low-income households earned up to $42,100 annually for a family of four. With their limited income, low-income families can only afford a maximum house price of $98,000 and therefore are limited to the rental market. Low-income households can afford up to $925 in rent per month and can generally afford an adequately sized unit. Moderate-income households The City has an estimated 9,191 moderate-income households in 2000. In 2001, moderate-income households in Salinas earned up to $63,100 annually for a family of four and can afford a house up to $180,000. However, because the median price of a single-family house is $232,000, the majority of houses are not affordable to moderate-income households.	In addition, moderate-income households typically are ineligible for most funding programs. However, moderate-income households could afford to purchase condominiums or rent an adequately sized house or apartment.

Housing Element
Housing Adequacy
Housing adequacy refers to the extent of overpayment, overcrowding, and dilapidation among the City’s housing stock. As mentioned earlier, overpayment is defined as paying more than 30% of income toward housing costs. Overcrowding occurs when the number of persons in a household exceeds the number of habitable rooms in a unit. Housing dilapidation refers to units in substantial need of rehabilitation.
According to the U.S. Census, Salinas has a set of housing issues associated with overpayment. With respect to overpaying, 28% of owners and 43% of renters pay too much for housing. The incidence of overpayment varies little by area of Salinas. However, overpayment is most concentrated among low-income households and seniors, of which over 60% of these households overpay for housing.
Some households cope with overpayment by living in overcrowded conditions. According to the 1990 Census, 11% of homeowners and 29% of renters live in overcrowded units. East Salinas experienced the highest incidence of overcrowding; 57% of renters and 31% of owners lived in overcrowded conditions. Regardless of location or income, however, 66% of all larger families experience overcrowding.
Third, maintaining the quality of housing is an important goal, since it has a direct impact upon neighboring property values as well as quality of life. Salinas’ housing stock averages 30 years of age and has the following age distribution: 56% of the homes are less than 30 years old; 29% of the homes are between 30 to 50 years old; and 15% are older than 50 years old. The latter category generally requires the highest level of maintenance and rehabilitation to maintain housing quality.
The Census Bureau provides limited estimates of substandard housing. The 1990 Census indicates that there were 212 units without complete kitchen facilities, and 251 units with incomplete plumbing. In addition, 12 units were boarded up. The number of substandard housing units is assumed to be much higher. Building officials indicate that substandard housing is disproportionately concentrated in small rental properties, mobile homes, and illegal garage conversions.

Special Needs
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to one’s employment and income, family characteristics, disability, or household characteristics, for example. The following special needs groups reside in Salinas.
Senior Citizens. Senior citizens are considered a special needs group, because limited income, health costs, need for access to transportation, and disabilities can make it more difficult to find and retain adequate and affordable housing. As of 2000, 16% of all households were seniors. According to the 1990 Census, seniors have the following needs: 30% have mobility or self care limitations and 60% earn lower income. For senior renters, 65% overpay for housing. To help meet senior renter needs, the City assists in the development of affordable senior housing and permits licensed care facilities in the community.
Disabled Persons. Disabled persons have special housing needs because of their fixed income, lack of accessible housing, and higher health care costs. Salinas is home to people with disabilities that prevent them from working, restrict their mobility, or make it difficult to care for themselves. In 2000, Salinas was home to 29,239 disabled persons or 23% of residents. To address their needs, the County of Monterey allocates over one-third of Section 8 vouchers held by Salinas residents to disabled persons. For those requiring a semi-independent housing setting, however, the City has permitted 58 licensed community care facilities serving approximately 900 persons in Salinas.
Large Households. Over the past decade, the number of large households increased more than 50% to 11,101 households in 2000. Statistics on the housing status of large households have not been released by the 2000 Census Bureau. According to the 1990 Census, however, 71% of the renters and 34% of owners were low-income households. In 1990, Salinas had a shortage of large family units: 2,107 large units with four or more bedrooms were available to accommodate the City’s 2,809 large owner households. Only 405 apartments with three or more bedrooms were available to accommodate 4,265 large renter families. The shortage of affordable family housing was evident in overpayment and overcrowding rates among large family homeowners (33% and 49%, respectively). Among renters, 41% overpaid and 77% lived in overcrowded conditions.

Single Parents. Single parents often require special consideration or assistance as a result of income typically less than two-parent households and the high cost of child care. According to the 1990 Census, 4,905 single parents with dependent children under age 18 lived in Salinas. An additional 1,378 single parents with children lived with another family to help share living expenses and presumably child care expenses. Female-headed families are particularly vulnerable because women typically earn less income than men. Single parents also spend approximately 12% to 25% of their annual income on childcare. As a result, approximately 42% of female-headed families with dependent children lived in poverty according to the 1990 Census.1
Homeless Persons. In 1999, the Monterey County Homeless Census and Needs Assessment Survey indicated that 2,960 homeless persons lived in the County on any given night. The report estimated that 266 homeless persons were actually counted in Salinas. The survey also indicated that homeless people experience the following needs: substance abuse recovery, treatment of medical conditions and mental illness, employment training and placement, as well as affordable housing. The City works with Monterey County to provide a “continuum of care” approach to addressing the needs of the homeless.
Farmworkers. Salinas is known as the “Salad Bowl of the World” and has a thriving agricultural industry and large supporting workforce. Estimates of the workforce vary due to differences in the definition of a “farmworker,” the seasonality of the workforce, and underreporting. The Employment Development Department reports that 19,100 agricultural jobs were reported in zip codes that include Salinas. However, only 2,967 farming jobs were actually located in incorporated Salinas and the remainder was located in unincorporated areas. The 2000 Census noted that 8,178 farmworkers lived in Salinas. According to the “Farmworker Housing and Health Needs Assessment of the Salinas and Pajaro Valleys (2001),” farmworkers have the lowest income of all occupations, experience a disproportionate level of overpayment and overcrowding, and generally live in more substandard housing conditions. An in-depth description of farmworkers and their housing needs is provided in the Technical Appendix to this Element.
1 According to the 1990 Census, households are classified below the poverty level when the total 1989 income of the family is below the appropriate poverty threshold. The poverty thresholds depend on three criteria: size of family, number of children, and age of the family householder, or unrelated individual for one and two person households.

	Future Housing Needs Over the past decade, population growth within Salinas and other communities throughout California has resulted in a growing housing demand. Accommodating regional and statewide growth has long-term implications affecting the ability to provide affordable housing, adequate infrastructure and services, and a high quality of life. The State Legislature has therefore mandated that jurisdictions throughout the State of California prepare five year housing plans to accommodate population growth and ensure that housing needs are addressed. Every five years, the State Legislature has authorized the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to determine statewide housing need resulting from population growth and then distribute the housing need by region of the state. State Housing Element law requires regional council of governments, such as the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG), to develop a process for distributing its regional housing needs allocated by HCD. AMBAG prepares a Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP) every five years that allocates a portion of the region’s need to each community within the three county region (i.e., Monterey, Santa Cruz, and San Benito counties). When determining the regional distribution of housing need among the region, AMBAG considers various planning issues related to the availability and adequacy of infrastructure and services, land, and market demand for housing. According to the draft RHNP, Salinas has been allocated a total production goal of 1,349 units for the period of 2000-2007. State law requires cities to facilitate housing rehabilitation, preservation, and production commensurate with the goals. The draft RHNP is currently under appeal. The RHNP process is anticipated to conclude in late 2002, at which time Salinas may need to revise this Housing Element to reflect changes to the production goal. Options for Compliance. State housing element law requires jurisdictions in the AMBAG region to demonstrate that “adequate sites” will be made available from 2000 through 2007 to accommodate housing production commensurate with a share of the region’s housing need. Jurisdictions must also demonstrate that appropriate zoning, development standards, services, and public facilities will be in place to accommodate housing commensurate with their share of the region’s housing needs (Government Code, Section 65583(c)(1)).
City of Salinas General Plan	September 2002 H-9
Housing Element
In addressing this requirement, the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) allows jurisdictions to count four types of credits toward their housing allocation. These methods include 1) actual housing production since January 1, 2000 as well as other housing projects in the pipeline that will be built; 2) rehabilitation of substandard units that would otherwise be demolished; 3) preservation of affordable units that would otherwise revert to market rents but are preserved through committed assistance; and 4) potential housing capacity based on available land and zoning.
Based upon the aforementioned analysis, the City will address its share of regional housing need as follows: (1) housing production underway since January 1, 2000; (2) housing production potential on vacant and underutilized land; (3) application of its inclusionary program; and (4) continued City assistance in the development of affordable housing.
Housing Production. State Law allows housing production to be counted as adequate sites toward the RHNP. Jurisdictions may count toward their RHNP the number of units, by affordability category, which have been built and occupied since January 1, 2000. In addition, jurisdictions may count units that have received building permits, planning approvals, and other discretionary approvals that will be constructed and occupied during the 2000-2007 planning period.
Table H-2 inventories all projects issued certificate of occupancies, building permits, or planning approvals since January 1, 2000. The affordability of the market units is based upon a survey described in Chapter 2 of the Housing Technical Appendix which showed that apartments are generally affordable to moderate-income households and single-family units are generally affordable only to above moderate-income households. The affordability of units receiving governmental assistance is determined based on City records of agreements.

Availability of Sites. Residential growth in Salinas could occur on residential and commercial acreage throughout the community. To evaluate potential land resources for residential development, a parcel-specific site analysis was performed in 2000 using a GIS system. The vacant land survey was conducted by reviewing individual parcels, the current development and density on those parcels, and potential units based on maximum density. Table H-3 summarizes the results.
Table H-3 shows the potential development capacity by multiplying the average permitted density in a zone by the number of acres. Sites shown below are suitable for housing development and have zoning in place that either allows for or allows consideration of residential development. The vacant sites also have adequate infrastructure and public services in place that can support new residential development. In addition, no known environmental constraints are present which would preclude residential development on these sites.
To ensure that the highest and best use is built on a site, the General Plan policies specify a minimum density for each general plan designation and zone. As discussed above, the minimum density is 16 units per acre for RH 2.3, 9 units an acre for RM3.6 and RM 4.0 districts, and 6 units per acre for the RL 6.5 zone. To determine the likely number of units to be built, the median density of each zone was multiplied by the number of vacant acres. As shown above in Table 4.3, a total of 264 units can be built on available vacant sites.

	Commercial Land As vacant land has become scarce in Salinas, the use of underutilized commercial land has become a more attractive alternative for residential units. The City’s General Plan Land Use Element directs future housing and commercial growth into eight focused growth areas. The largest of these areas, the Downtown Core, encompasses 7 89 parcels of land (250 acres) and is within the Redevelopment Project Area. City staff estimate that 384 high density residential units could be built in the Downtown Core. The City was recently awarded a Downtown Rebound Grant from HCD to facilitate residential development. To help facilitate redevelopment and recycling of properties in the Downtown, the City has adopted a new Mixed Use designation, described as a mixture of retail, office, and residential uses in the same building, on the same parcel, or in the same area to promote pedestrian oriented uses and activity centers. The City will refine its site-by site inventory of all parcels in the central City, develop mixed use regulations (e.g., to include items such as permitted uses, height, bulk, density, intensity, and setbacks, appearance and relationship of buildings to one another and to the street), and provide a maximum density of 80 units per acre. The work is expected to be completed by June 2003. Future Growth Areas The City has approved annexations necessary to provide housing for its growing population. In 1984, the City annexed the 510-acre Creekbridge area, providing for 2,598 new housing units. Later that year, the City annexed the 466-acre Williams Ranch area, providing 2,070 new housing units. In 1989, the 488-acre Harden Ranch area was annexed, providing for 2,561 units. Prior to annexing land, each of these areas was required to prepare a Precise Plan. As part of the Land Use Element update, the City set forth focused growth areas for new housing which are adjacent to Salinas. A total of 3,525 acres are available as follows: 1,042 acres designated low density residential (maximum 6,771 units); 515 acres designated medium density residential (maximum 6,052 units); and 160 acres designated high density (2,680 units). The City supports the annexation of land needed for housing and has already approved a Precise Plan and certified an EIR for an 853-unit project. The City anticipated annexing 10% of the growth areas plus the pre-approved project.

	Affordability of New Units The affordability of new residential units that could be built on vacant residential and commercial land depends on the type of development allowed. Generally, apartments will be affordable to moderate-income households and single-family homes would be affordable to upper income households. However, the affordability distribution also depends on the application of the City’s inclusionary requirements, as well as availability of federal and state funding. The following text summarizes the affordability of units credited toward the RHNP. ■	Existing Units. As shown in Table H-2, 2,140 housing units are credited toward the City’s regional housing needs allocation. Of this total, 12% are affordable to very low income households, 11% are affordable to low income households, 10% are affordable to moderate-income households, and the remaining 57% are affordable to upper income households. ■	Vacant Residential Land. Based on historical development and inclusionary policies, housing on vacant high density residential land (RH-2.3) will be moderate income housing, with 12% set-aside for lower income units. On low density residential sites (RM 3.6, RM 4.0, and RL 6.5), 12% of the units are anticipated to be affordable to low-income households and the remainder would be upper income. ■	Underutilized Commercial Land. Pursuant to the City’s Downtown Rebound Program, 384 high density residential units could be built in the downtown. Assuming average densities and redevelopment inclusionary requirements, approximately 15% of the units would be affordable to lower income households. This is very a conservative estimate given recent Salinas Redevelopment Agency involvement in projects. ■	Future Annexations. Based upon the history mentioned above, the City will likely annex 10% of its future growth areas and the 853 unit project. Except for the 853 unit project, the affordability distribution of new units can be estimated based upon development history since January 1, 2000. If historical trends continue, the following affordability distribution can be expected: 12% affordable to very low income households, 21% affordable to low income households, 10% moderate-income, and 57% affordable to above moderate income households.

Federally Mandated Planning Activity
Salinas is required to prepare several plans as a condition of receiving certain federal funds. Salinas prepares a “Consolidated Plan” every five years which identifies Salinas’ housing and community development needs, and outlines a strategy for addressing those needs. The current Consolidated Plan covers the years 2000 through 2005. Every five years, the City also prepares an “Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice” to ensure that appropriate policies and programs are in place to further fair housing. The 2002-2007 Housing Element builds upon these efforts, and the housing goals, policies, and programs are consistent with the City’s federal housing plans.

Housing Element
Consistency with Other Elements	Regional Housing Needs Plan State Housing Element law requires regional councils of governments, such as the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG), to develop a plan to allocate regional housing needs. As part of this effort, AMBAG prepares a Regional Housing Needs Plan that distributes regional housing needs to jurisdictions. To meet that requirement, State law requires cities and counties to ensure that adequate sites, public services, and facilities are available to facilitate housing provision commensurate with their housing need targets. The Housing Element sets forth a strategy for Salinas to meet those needs. Redevelopment Implementation Plan Salinas has two Redevelopment Project Areas established to eliminate blight within designated areas. The Salinas Redevelopment Agency (SRA) plays an active role in the maintenance, improvement, and development of affordable housing. The SRA has prepared a 1999-2004 Redevelopment Implementation Plan for the Central City and for the Sunset Avenue/Buena Vista Redevelopment Project Areas. These plans set forth how “housing set-aside funds” generated from redevelopment project areas will be spent to support housing programs. The 2002-2007 Housing Element builds upon these efforts and is consistent with the City’s Redevelopment Implementation Plan. The 2002-07 Housing Element is one of seven elements of the City’s General Plan. The other elements are: Land Else Element, Community Design Element, Conservation/Open Space Element, Circulation Element, Safety Element, and the Noise Element. The Housing Element was developed as part of an overall update to the General Plan and therefore is consistent with the goals, policies, and implementing programs set forth in the other elements. The City will ensure consistency between the Housing Element and other General Plan Elements so that policies introduced in one element are consistent with policies in other elements. At this time, the Housing Element does not propose significant change to any element of the City’s General Plan. However, if it becomes apparent over time that policy or program changes to any element are needed for internal consistency, such changes will be proposed for consideration by the Planning Commission and City Council.

Issues, Goals and Policies
This section of the Housing Element contains the City’s goals and policies to address housing issues within the community. Discussion of these issues is arranged as follows: (1) housing production, diversity, and opportunities; (2) maintenance and preservation of housing and neighborhoods; and (3) housing assistance.
Housing Production,	Maintaining a diversity of housing opportunities is an important goal for
Diversity, and	Salinas. Persons and households of different ages, types, income levels,
Opportunities and lifestyles have different housing needs and preferences that change over time. Maintaining diversity in types and ranges of housing allows all persons, regardless of family type or income, to have the opportunity to find housing that is suitable to their needs. The following goal and policies are designed to make adequate provision for the housing needs
of the community.
GoalH-1:	Provide a range of housing opportunities to
adequately address existing and projected needs of Salinas.
Policy H-1.1: Encourage a variety of housing types, designs, and prices throughout the city to maintain housing choice and enable households of all types and income levels the opportunity to find suitable ownership or rental housing.
Policy H-1.2: New residential developments shall be adequately served by services and facilities, including park and recreation areas, libraries, sanitary and storm sewers, transportation, public safety and other services. Ensure impact fees are adequate to provide these services and facilities to residential development.
Policy H-1.3: Identify adequate sites to facilitate and encourage housing production for the existing and projected housing needs of the City.

Policy H-l.4:	Support the concept of “aging in place” by providing a range of housing types and tenure that allows people to remain in the community as their housing needs change.
Policy H-l.5:	Encourage the geographic dispersal of units affordable to very-low, low- and moderate-income households throughout the City.
Policy H-l.6:	Ensure that new residential development and reuse/revitalization projects are compatible with surrounding neighborhoods.
Policy H-l.7:	Reduce municipal constraints to the production, maintenance, and development of decent, safe housing.
Policy H-l.8:	Encourage the development of higher density apartments, townhouses and condominiums served by major transit corridors or other non-automotive transport.
Policy H-l.9:	Promote collaborative regional efforts to address housing issues such as the proximity of commercial development to employee housing and the tax framework that favors other developments over housing.
Policy H-l.10: Promote the development of neighborhoods, or sub-
Policy H-l. 11:	communities, designed to encourage pedestrian and mass transit by offering employment or services for the daily needs of residents, while reducing the need for autos. In Future Growth Areas, ensure that each Specific Plan includes a range of housing types by requiring new residential developments of over 1,000 units to include a mix of low-density, medium density, and high density units. From 1596-2 596 of the housing units in such developments shall fall within the density range of 16-24 units per net residential development acre, and 3596-45% of the housing

units shall fall within the density range of 7-14 units per net residential developable acre.
Policy H-1.12: In Future Growth Areas, promote mixed use development to increase housing opportunities by requiring commercial and professional office development to incorporate housing opportunities on site. The City Council may make a finding that it would be inappropriate to require on-site housing in a proposed new commercial or professional office development, and in that case shall require equivalent housing to be constructed at an off-site location. Existing commercial and professional office development shall be encouraged to redevelop and reconfigure uses to incorporate new housing opportunities.
Housing and neighborhood condition is an important contributor to the quality of life for our community. The needs of particular neighborhoods vary. As are many cities throughout California, Salinas is confronted with issues of deteriorating housing, public improvements and community facilities. The quality of housing and neighborhoods needs to be maintained in some areas and improved in others. Multifaceted strategies are needed to address issues relevant to different areas of Salinas. The following goal and policies are designed to encourage reinvestment in housing, where appropriate, and foster neighborhood stability to improve and maintain the quality of life.
Goal H-2:	Maintain and improve existing neighborhoods and
housing stock.
Policy H-2.1 : Maintain the quality of owner-occupied and rental housing through adoption and enforcement of housing and property maintenance standards.
Policy H-2.2: Promote the repair, improvement and rehabilitation of housing to enhance the quality of life in neighborhoods and promote community identity and
Policy H-2.3:	Encourage the preservation and restoration of
residential resources that possess historic or architectural value.

Policy H-2.4: Through public-private partnerships and collaborative efforts, rehabilitate substandard housing where feasible.
Policy H-2.5: Continue to provide units for very-low and low-income households through the City’s inclusionary requirements and other programs.
Policy H-2.6: Encourage the retention, rehabilitation and new construction of high-density, well-designed housing in the Central City and other targeted areas, as discussed in the Land Use and Community Design Elements.
Policy H-2.7: Ensure new residential developments are compatible (i.e., scale, size, design and appearance) with surrounding uses.
Policy H-2.8: Support public education programs that promote property maintenance and energy conservation.
Policy H-2.9: Encourage and support the redevelopment and reuse of existing developed portions of the City that are presently underutilized, without sacrificing history or quality of life.
Certain segments of the population may have more difficulty finding decent, affordable housing due to special circumstances. These segments include lower income households, the elderly, disabled persons, large families, single-parent households, agricultural workers, and the homeless. To address the housing needs of these groups, the City should continue to further fair housing choices by promoting housing opportunities and removing impediments to fair housing.
The following goal and policies are designed to assist special needs population to secure decent, affordable, and appropriate housing.
Goal H-3:	Use public-private partnerships and collaborative
efforts to ensure that all segments of the community have access to safe and decent housing that meets their diverse needs.

GENERAL PLAN
Housing Plan/lmplementation Program
Salinas has various housing needs set forth in the Housing Context portion of the Housing Element. This section describes the approach that will be taken to meet the housing needs of the community. The Plan addresses each housing issue identified in the prior section of the Housing Element and provides a method to achieve the City’s housing goals and policies.
Housing Programs
The goals and policies contained in the Housing Element address Salinas’ identified housing needs and are implemented through a series of programs. Housing programs define the specific actions the City will undertake to achieve specific goals and policies.
Salinas’ overall housing program strategy for addressing its housing needs has been defined according to the following three issue areas:
1)	Housing production, diversity, and opportunities;
2)	Maintenance and preservation of housing and neighborhoods; and
3)	Housing assistance and special needs.
Housing programs include both current City efforts, and new programs which address the City’s unmet housing needs. This section provides a description of each housing program. The Housing Implementation Table H-6 outlines the future actions for each program, while identifying the program funding source, responsible agency, and time frame for implementation.

Housing Element
Housing Production, Diversity, and Opportunities	Persons and households of different ages, types, income levels, and lifestyles have different housing needs and preferences that change over time. Maintaining a diversity of housing type, size, and location allows all persons, regardless of family situation or income, to have the opportunity to find suitable housing. The following programs make adequate provision for the housing needs of the community. Program 1. Land Use Element Provision of adequate sites for residential development is important to encourage the production of housing that is affordable to all economic groups in Salinas. Adequate sites are those that will be made available along with appropriate zoning and development standards, infrastructure, public services and facilities. The City currently permits a variety of housing types in residential and commercial districts. Since January 1, 2000, the City has produced the vast majority of its regional housing needs share by income and affordability category. Salinas will continue to support the use of land for residential developments to meet the growing housing needs of its population. This will be accomplished by supporting mixed use developments in the Central Downtown, permitting residential developments on remaining vacant land, and annexing Specific Plan developments in Future Growth Areas. Five-Year Objective: Ensure adequate sites will be made available to accommodate the City’s share of regional housing needs. Maintain a map indicating land within the City designatedfor residential development. Program 2. Provision of Future Sites Although the City has adequate sites for addressing its 2000-2007 regional housing needs, population growth will eventually require the annexation of land.	In 1986, the City signed the Boronda Memorandum of Understanding with the County to direct growth to the northeast and away from existing agricultural areas. This policy was later embodied in the 1988 General Plan. The City will continue to work with the Monterey County Local Agency Formation Commission, Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments, and regional service providers to ensure that sufficient land for residential development is available, agricultural land is preserved, and appropriate infrastructure and services are available to meet the City’s future housing needs.
City of Salinas General Plan	September 2002 H-24
Housing Element
	The City has an excellent track record for approving annexations that are necessary to provide housing for its growing population. In 1984, the City annexed the 510-acre Creekbridge area, providing for a total of 2,598 new housing units. Later that year, the City annexed the 466-acre Williams Ranch area, providing a total of 2,070 new housing units. In 1989, the 488-acre Harden Ranch area was annexed, providing for 2,561 new housing units. Taken together, the City has provided 7,229 new homes through annexations since 1984. Prior to annexing land, each of these areas was required to prepare a Precise Plan. Five-Year Objective: Continue to work with the Local Agency Formation Commission and other regional service providers to ensure that sufficient land, infrastructure, and services are available to support new residential development. Continue to support annexations needed to provide housing. Program 3. Mixed Residential-Commercial Use The City’s General Plan sets forth goals for preserving agricultural land, improving the livability of neighborhoods, and ensuring that adequate infrastructure is in place to support new residential development. In concert with the region’s city-centered growth policies (developed jointly by Monterey County and the Salinas Valley cities) and livable community principles envisioned as part of the 2002 General Plan, Salinas will be examining ways to encourage infill high-density housing development on commercial land in several focused growth areas. To implement this goal, Salinas applied for and was awarded a $150,000 Downtown Rebound Planning Grant to be administered by HCD. The grant will be used to: 1) develop a site inventory of underutilized sites within the 250-acre downtown core; and 2) develop Mixed-Use regulations for housing. The inventory, conducted with the City’s GIS and field verification, will provide a detailed site-by-site assessment of underutilized properties for review by the public and Planning Commission. In tandem, the City will adopt Mixed-Use regulations to address permitted uses, height, bulk, density, intensity, and setbacks. Incentives will be developed and are anticipated to include a change to allow residential development by right. The area designated for Mixed Use within the Central City area allows a maximum residential density of 80 units per acre if developed as part of a Mixed Use project.
City of Salinas General Plan	September 2002 H-25
Housing Element
Five-Year Objective: Establish a mixed residential-commercial land use designation that allows higher density housing by right in appropriate zones. Review development standards and consider incentives to facilitate mixed-use projects. Conduct underutilized site analysis in the downtown.
Program 4. Density Bonus Program
The City’s density bonus program is designed to facilitate and encourage affordable housing in the community consistent with State Law. For detail regarding the City’s density bonus program, please refer to Section 37-50.060 Density Bonus of the City’s Zoning Ordinance
Five-Year Objective:	Continue implementation of the density bonus
program. Publicize density bonus opportunities through contact with property owners and developers in early stages of development application process. Explore options for increasing City incentives available to developers for participating in the program. Annually provide iiformation to local builder’s groups and real estate boards concerning opportunities for increasing project densities in exchange for
providing affordable housing.
Program 5. Inclusionaiy Housing
Salinas adopted an Inclusionary Housing Program in 1992 to encourage the production of affordable housing in proportion with the overall increase in residential units in the City. This program mandates that 12% of all new development, single-family and multi-family residential (containing 10 units or more), be affordable to low- and moderate-income households. In addition to an affordability requirement, 20% of those units must have three bedrooms and 10% of the units must have four or more bedrooms to help provide housing opportunities for larger households. The Inclusionary Program remains an integral part of the City’s overall strategy to provide affordable housing to the community. The City also intends to review the existing program.

Five-Year Objective: Continue implementation of the inclusionary program in Salinas. The City also intends to review the existing ordinance for potential modifications to enhance the program, including examining the time requirement set by the program, extending the period of affordability, and increasing the percentage and including a percentage for moderate-income households. The City will undertake a study, as soon as possible after adoption of the General Plan, to determine the legality andfeasibility of Inclusionary percentagesfrom 15% to 40%.
Maintenance and Preservation of Housing and
Neighborhoods
Housing and neighborhood condition is an important contributor to the quality of life for our community. As an older community, Salinas is confronted with issues of deteriorating housing, public improvements and community facilities. The existing quality of housing and neighborhoods needs to be maintained in some cases and improved in others. Multi-faceted strategies are needed to address issues relevant to different areas of Salinas. The following programs are designed to encourage reinvestment in housing, where appropriate and foster neighborhood stability to improve and maintain the quality of life. Program 6. Code Enforcement
Code enforcement is an important means to ensure that the character and quality of neighborhoods and housing is maintained. To that end, the City’s Code Enforcement staff enforces state and local regulations governing building and property maintenance. Building, zoning, and housing code enforcement functions are consolidated in the City’s Permit Center. Staff works with the community to remedy code violations, referring property owners to rehabilitation loan programs when appropriate and referring for court action where appropriate. Five-Year Objective:	Continue implementation of code enforcement activities.
Program 7. Housing Services Program
The Housing Services Program (HSP) is a home repair and improvement program serving lower-income property owners. Through the HSP, the City provides technical and financial assistance, allowing property owners to correct deficiencies and improve their property. Low interest loans up to $45,000 are available to eligible property owners to make repairs to their residential property. The Housing Services Program has been used to encourage the rehabilitation of

Housing Element
housing for farmworkers, since a significant number of recipients are households in which one or more member is a farm worker.
Loan amounts can be increased when overcrowding justifies expansion to provide additional bedroom space. The City provides deferred payment loans to seniors and grants up to $7,500 to make units more accessible to disabled persons. Loans are also available to owners of multi-family rental projects comprised of over 50% low-income tenants. Rental property owners can make qualified repairs, provided that the units remain affordable to low-income households.
Five-Year Objective: Issue 10 loans annually for single family units, at least one loan for multi family units, and seven grants to disabled/senior households. The City will advertise this program through brochures, bilingual public service announcements on radio, inclusion in service directories, and the posting of notices at the City Libraries and Permit Center.
Program 8. Redevelopment Project Areas
The City has adopted two (2) Redevelopment Project Areas: the Central City and the Sunset Avenue/Buena Vista Area. Goals, policies, and strategies have been designed to eliminate blight, revitalize the commercial and industrial base; facilitate the construction and rehabilitation of housing; and improve and stabilize neighborhoods. In particular, the 1999-2004 Redevelopment Implementation Plan calls for expenditures for improving, retaining, and developing affordable housing with tax increment revenue generated from the Project Areas. The City will continue to implement and monitor the programs set forth in the Redevelopment Implementation Plan.
Five-Year Objective: Continue to implement redevelopment plans for each project area and allocate housing set-aside funds as required by law. An update of the Implementation Plan is required by 2004.
Program 9. Alisal Revitalization Strategy Area
The Alisal Homeownership and Neighborhood Revitalization Strategy Area covers 2.5 square miles or 12% of the City. As a former unincorporated area, development standards were not as rigorous as

	those within the City and the public infrastructure was also inadequate. To address needs within the area, the City has pursued the following: (1) first-time homebuyer assistance (a larger down payment is loaned within the Alisal Area); (2) redevelopment agency facade and affordable housing loan and grant assistance; (3) financial assistance to the area’s Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDO); and (4) the implementation of an innovative “Weed and Seed” program through the U.S. Department of Justice. Five-Year Objective: Continue implementation of comprehensive housing rehabilitation, neighborhood revitalization, and public safety initiatives in the Alisal Area. The City will advertise this program through brochures, bilingual public service announcements on radio, inclusion in service directories, and the posting of notices at the Qity Libraries and Permit Center. Program 10. Preservation of At-Risk Housing Salinas has over 80 affordable projects that were developed pursuant to local programs (e.g., density bonus and inclusionary program), various state financing (e.g., tax credits and mortgage revenue bonds), and with subsidized federal subsidized loans. None of the affordable inclusionary units or density bonus projects is at-risk of conversion to market rate rents over the next ten years. However, several other projects are at-risk of converting to market rents over the 2002-2012 planning period. Seven projects encompassing several hundred units which are owned by for-profit entities are the most likely to be converted. Five-Year Objective: Encourage property owners and nonprof t organizations to develop strategies to maintain affordability controls on government-assisted projects. The City will notify the owners off at-risk projects well in advance off mortgage prepayment or termination of rent subsidies or restrictions to determine their intentions to convert to market rate housing. The City will also contact qualified entities with the managerial and financial capacities to acquire and rehabilitate these properties once a notice off intent to opt out has been fled. The City will also work with tenants to ensure that they are informed off their rights and housing options.
City of Salinas General Plan	September 2002 H-29

Housing Assistance	Persons of very low-, low-, and moderate-incomes typically have greater difficulty securing decent, safe, and affordable housing. Moreover, the City also has a large population of special needs groups, including seniors, the disabled, farmworkers, single-parent families, homeless persons, and other persons in need of housing assistance. The following programs are designed to provide housing assistance to these groups to improve their access to housing opportunities. Program 11. Homeownership Programs The First Time Homebuyer Program provides eligible low-income families and individuals with a low-interest, deferred payment loan for the purchase of their first home. The household must have sufficient income and credit worthiness to obtain mortgage financing, make a minimum 5% down payment of purchase price, and pay closing costs. The minimum down payment may be reduced to 3% of the purchase price if a fixed rate mortgage is obtained. Other qualifications include residency or employment in the Salinas for the prior two years. This program has been averaging 20 loans annually. Five-Year Objective: Continue implementation and issue up to 20 loans annually. Publicize the program through newspaper advertisements, distribution of brochures, public service announcements for local media, inclusion on the City’s web page, and networking with housing advocacy organizations and lending institutions. Program 12. Section 8 Rental Assistance The Section 8 program is an important program in providing for the needs of very low income residents in Salinas. The Section 8 program extends rental subsidies to very low-income households who cannot afford the costs of rental housing. The Section 8 program offers a voucher that pays the difference between the current fair market rent as established by HUD and what a tenant can afford to pay (i.e., 30% of household income). The voucher allows a tenant to choose housing with rents above the payment standard, providing the tenant pays the additional cost. Currendy, more than 2,000 Salinas households receive Section 8 assistance through the Housing Authority of the County of Monterey. The City of Salinas continues to support and encourage provision of rent subsidies through the Section 8 program.
City of Salinas General Plan	September 2002 H-30
Housing Element
	Five-Year Objective: Continue to support the Section 8 rental assistance program and encourage property owners to rent units through the program. Advocate with the Housing Authority jor higher payment standards in response to changes in the housing market. Program 13. Farmworker Housing The City has been actively involved in facilitating farmworker housing, both through its land use, zoning, permit processing, and funding. With respect to land use, the City permits labor camps pursuant to a CUP in the A, RH2.3, RH-1.9, CO/R, CO, CR, CD, and CAF zones. The City also permits labor camps serving six or fewer persons in high density multi-family residential zones by right. Because many farmworkers live and find year round work in Salinas, the City requires housing projects to include a portion of units with 3 and 4 bedrooms. The City’s permitting process has effectively facilitated and encouraged the development of migrant farm worker housing. For instance, the City acquired land for the Sun Street project and gave it to the Housing Authority. Hartnell College built modular and stick-built group units. The City also granted concessions on development standards, parking spaces, and open space requirements. Permanent farm worker housing is treated like all other multi-family or single-family housing, subject to appropriate inclusionary and bedroom size requirements. Housing service programs are also extended to homes occupied by farmworkers. The City of Salinas also has an impressive track record in working with nonprofit organizations and providing grants, loans, financial assistance, and land to facilitate construction of farmworker housing. To that end, the City has coordinated the following resources: $1 million of local funds, $500,000 in County funds, $500,000 from HCD, and $1 million in grants from the United States Department of Agriculture to develop a model farmworker family homeownership project. The City remains actively involved with various groups providing affordable farmworker housing (e.g., CHISPA, USDA, and Monterey County) Five-Year Objective: The City will continue to implement the Farmworker Family Homeownership Initiative (FFHI) and other housing projects totaling not less than 50 units. The City will work cooperatively with County, State, and federal government to address farmworker needs.

Program 14. Senior Housing
The City’s Density Bonus provisions include an added incentive for seniors. This further allows the minimum lot area per unit to be reduced by up to 50% for multi-family projects designating at least 50% of the units for seniors. Moreover, the City has and continues to cooperate with developers to provide new senior projects with Section 202 funds. In the prior planning period, the City helped facilitate the construction of the 192-unit Regency Court senior project and the Salinas Seniors Apartments on Boronda Road.
Five-Year Objective:	The City will provide jinancial and regulatory assistance
to support senior projects such as Los Abuelitos.
Program 15. Special Needs Housing
Salinas is home to people who experience disabling mental illness, homelessness, and other disabilities which require special assistance. The City is actively involved in developing special needs housing. In the prior planning period, the City amended its Zoning Code to allow for a range of special needs housing in residential and commercial zones. Moreover, the City has assisted in the development of Mariposa Apartments (20 units for chronically mentally ill persons), Interim’s short-term crisis facility, the California House providing transitional housing for eight individuals, and rehabilitation of the Plaza House (26 SRO units of transitional housing). The City also provided land and funds to assist in the development of the Dorothy’s Hospitality Center, a comprehensive service center for the homeless. The City also permits emergency shelters and transition housing via a conditional use permit.
Five-Year Objective: The City will continue to work with service providers, such as the Coalition of Homeless Service Providers, Interim, and the Central Coast Center for Independent Living to support planning and educational efforts. In addition, the City will consider continued funding of special needs housing with federal and state grant monies. Housing set-aside funds were provided for the development of a 91 -unit SRO on East Market Street.

	Program 16. Fair Housing The City provides a fair housing program through contract with the Mediation Center of Monterey County to provide landlord/tenant education, mediation services, and other community mediation activity. Over the past several years, Salinas has also funded other non-profit agencies that provide fair housing activities, such as the Housing Advisory Council and the Central Coast Center for Independent Living. The City’s fair housing program extends to the production of housing and provision of City financial assistance. Whenever housing units are created as a result of City regulatory action (e.g., inclusionaiy units) or whenever the City provides financial assistance to support housing activities (whether for new housing or for housing services), the restrictive covenants or the terms of the assistance will require a requirement of compliance with equal housing opportunity regulations. Progress in improving fair housing is achieved by preparing the City’s Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing. This document analyzes the City’s land use regulations, administrative procedures, housing service policies, disposition and resolution of fair housing complaints, transit accessibility, equalization of municipal services, as well as the status of fair housing in lending and the financial industry. The City last prepared its Analysis of Impediments in the late 1990s. With the passage of SBS20, the Housing Element should analyze potential and actual government constraints on the development of housing for persons with disabilities and demonstrate the City’s efforts to remove such constraints. The City has conducted such analysis and found that certain use classifications — Residential Care Facilities, Residential Service Facilities, and Interim Housing — should be refined to eliminate overlap and make such categories consistent with State law. Five-Year Objective: Continue to implement and publicize fair housing programs. Prepare an update of the Analysis of Impediments. To ensure consistency with SB520, the City will also rfine the land use categories — Interim Housing, Residential Care Facilities, and Residential Service Facilities for consistency with State law. The City will also continue to conduct such analysis, and, f additional constraints are found, initiate actions to remove such constraints to further housing opportunity.

Introduction
Purpose of the Conservation/
Open Space Element
Scope and Content of the Conservation/ Open Space
Element
Some of the most valuable assets of Salinas include it’s agricultural land, creeks, parks, historical and architectural resources, and Carr Lake. The Conservation/Open Space Element focuses on the protection and enhancement of open space and natural and historic resources to ensure a high quality living environment in Salinas.
The Salinas Conservation/Open Space Element meets the state requirements for Conservation and Open Space Elements as defined in Sections 65302(d) and 65301(e) of the Government Code. According to these requirements, the Conservation element must contain goals and policies to protect and maintain natural resources such as water, soils, wildlife, and minerals, and prevent wasteful resource exploitation, degradation, and destruction. The Open Space Element must contain goals and policies to manage open space areas, including undeveloped lands and outdoor recreation areas. Specifically, the Open Space Element must address several open space categories such as those used for the preservation of natural resources and managed production of resources, as well as open space maintained for public health and safety reasons. This last category of open space is addressed in the Safety Element. Additionally, while air quality is not a state-mandated element, air quality is included in the Open Space/Conservation Element to address reducing pollutant levels through stationary source, mobile source, transportation and land use control, and energy conservation measures. Because the subjects required to be addressed under the Conservation Element and Open Space Element overlap substantially, the two elements have been combined for this Plan.
The Conservation/Open Space Element expresses community goals to protect environmental and historic resources and open space. Resources addressed in this element include: a) water resources; b) agricultural resources; c) cultural resources; d) ecological and biological resources; e) mineral resources; and f) parks and recreational facilities. Because everyday activities in Salinas affect air quality outside City boundaries and regional activities affect air quality within Salinas, regional air quality issues are also addressed in this element.
The Conservation/Open Space Element is comprised of four sections: 1) this Introduction; 2) Issues, Goals, and Policies; 3) the Conservation/Open Space Plan and 4) Implementation Program. In
City of Salinas
General Plan
September 2002

Conservation/Open Space Element
the Issues, Goals, and Policies section, community open space needs and resource management issues are identified and corresponding goals and policies are established. The goals, which are overall statements of the City desires, are comprised of broad statements of purpose and direction. The policies serve as guidelines for planning and maintaining recreational facilities, enhancing the natural amenities of Salinas and minimizing the environmental effects of planned development. The Plan explains how the goals and policies will be achieved and implemented, while the Implementation Program identifies the specific implementation programs for this Element.
Related Plans and Programs
Federal Endangered Species Act
The Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA), administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, applies to federally listed species and habitat occupied by federally listed species. Federally listed species are most likely to occur within riparian habitat areas in the City’s floodplains.
Federal “special status”1 species with the potential to occur in the planning area include:
Steelhead
California red-legged frog Tricolored blackbird Long-legged myotis Santa Cruz clover Kellog’s horkelia
California tiger salamander Burrowing owl Long-eared myotis Contra Costa goldlfields Hutchinson’s larkspur
ESA Section 9 forbids specified acts that directly or indirectly harm listed species. Section 9 also prohibits “taking” any species of wildlife or fish listed as endangered. These restrictions apply to all federal agencies and all persons subject to United States jurisdiction.
1 “Special status” plant species include those listed by either the Federal or State resource agencies as well as those identified as rare by the California Native Plant Society (CNPS). Special status wildlife species are those that are listed as threatened or endangered by state or federal agencies, those proposed for listing, candidates for listing, as well as those species listed as Species of Special Concern by State and Federal agencies due to declining numbers and/or habitat.

	U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and California Department of Fish and Game Regulations Both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and California Department of Fish and Game have regulations to protect wildlife resources. Special permits are required for the alteration, dredging, or any activity in a lake or stream, as well as other activities that may affect fish and game habitat. Both agencies also regulate impacts to sensitive plant and animal species. Future development in Salinas that has the potential to affect wildlife habitat will be subject to the regulations of both of these federal and state agencies. California Environmental Quality Act The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted by the state legislature in response to a public mandate for thorough environmental analysis of projects impacting the environment. The provisions of the law and environmental review procedures are described in the CEQA Statutes and CEQA Guidelines. CEQA will continue to be instrumental in ensuring that the environmental impacts associated with local development projects are appropriately assessed and mitigated. California Endangered Species Act The California Endangered Species Act (CESA) (Fish & Game Code §§2050, et. seq.) generally parallels the main provisions of the Federal Endangered Species Act and is administered by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). CESA prohibits the “taking” of listed species except as otherwise provided in State law. State special status species (including those listed as “rare” by the California Native Plant Society (CNPS)) with the potential to occur in the planning area include: Steelhead	California Tiger Salamander California red-legged frog	Burrowing owl White tailed kite	A' Northern harrier Copper’s hawk	Merlin Yellow warblers	Yellow-breasted chat Tricolored blackbird	Pallid bat Townsend’s western big-eared bat	Yuma myotis

	San Francisco dusky-foot woodrat	Congdon’t tarplant Contra Costa goldfields	Pinnacles buckwheat Alkali milk-vetch	Santa Cruz clover Hutchinson’s larkspur	Kellog’s horkelia Any future development or redevelopment in Salinas that has the potential to affect wildlife will be subject to the restrictions contained in the CESA. Williamson Act The Williamson Act, passed by the State Legislature in 1965 seeks to preserve agricultural uses by offering tax relief to large landowners if the owners agree not to change the use of their open space or agricultural lands for a contract period of ten years. The contracts automatically renew each year, thus extending the term, unless the owner files a notice of non-renewal to cancel the contract. Thus, contract expiration is always nine years from the date of filing the notice of non-renewal. No property in the City is currently under a Williamson Act contract; however, Williamson Act lands are within the vicinity of the City. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Linder the NPDES storm water permit issued to the City of Salinas, all development and significant redevelopment must be implemented with runoff pollution control measures known as Best Management Practices (BMPs). Proposed development projects (both public and private) within Salinas must incorporate structural and non-structural BMPs to preclude significant water quality impact from non-point source pollutants. California Regional Water Quality Control Board — Central Coast - Region 3 (RWQCB) Storm Water Program Construction activities, industrial activities, and Caltrans activities in the County of Monterey are covered under three separate permits issued by the (RWQCB). Issued to the City in 1999, the City of Salinas holds the only individual municipal storm water NPDES permit in the Central Coast region. The municipal permit implements the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), which regulates the discharge
City of Salinas General Plan	September 2002 COS-4
Conservation/Open Space Element
	of storm water from the City. The NPDES permit defines the current and future activities of the Wastewater Division by providing the maintenance requirements and best management practices that will protect local waterways from pollutants. The primary goals of the NPDES program are: Maintain the storm drainage system in a safe and sanitary condition. Assure the City is safe from flooding through routine cleaning and repairs of the storm drain system. X Assure the free flow of storm water runoff by maintaining City owned open drainage channels. X Develop a water quality monitoring and maintenance program consistent with federally mandated NPDES requirements. The City’s NPDES Permit requires industrial storm water inspections be performed, documented, and reported in the Annual NPDES Report to the RWQCB. The inspections are to eliminate, to the maximum extent practical, the potential for storm water pollution. California Water Code Sections 10910-10915 Sections 10910-10915 of the California Water Code identify consultation, noticing, and water assessment and provision requirements for proposed projects meeting the specific criteria identified in Sections 10910 and 10913 of the Code. The City must consult with local and regional water agencies to assess whether the water demand associated with the project is included in the agency’s most recent Urban Water Management Plan and whether existing supplies can meet the project’s demand for water. Based on the entire record, the City shall determine within an EIR whether projected water supplies available during normal, single-dry, and multiple-dry water years will be sufficient to satisfy the demands of the proposed project, in addition to existing and planned future uses. Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District Air Quality Management Plan The Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) for the Monterey Bay Region includes transportation control measures that are either implemented by transportation planning agencies through the regional transportation planning process or by cities and counties on a voluntary

Conservation/Qpen Space Element
basis. These include a variety of transportation system management, transportation demand management, and New Urbanism/ sustainable development measures in which the City participates.
Mills Act
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Mills Act is a state law allowing cities to enter into agreements with the owners of historic structures to encourage preservation of historic resources. Such agreements involve the City entering into a contract with a property owner to change how the County Assessor calculates taxes on their property in exchange for the continued preservation of the property by the property owner. The adjusted property taxes are recalculated using a formula in the Mills Act and Revenue and Taxation Code.
The Conservation/Open Space Element must be consistent with the other General Plan elements and all elements of the General Plan are interrelated to a degree. Certain goals and policies of one element may also address issues that are the primary subjects of other elements. Table COS-i located in the following section identifies related goals and policies by General Plan element. The integration of overlapping issues throughout the General Plan elements provides a strong basis for the implementation of plans and programs and achievement of community goals. The Conservation/Open Space Element most closely relates to the Land Use and Safety Elements.
The Land Use Element provides a planned land use pattern with the following general land use designation categories: Open Space, Residential, Commercial/Office, Industrial/Light Industrial, Public/Semipublic, and Other land use designations. The more specific Open Space, Parks, and Agriculture designations are applied to public and private land that is intended for conservation, open space, and recreational uses. These designations apply to areas that have an abundance of natural resources, visual resources, recreational value, and/or public safety concerns.
The Safety Element relates to the Conservation/Open Space Element in that it identifies hazard-prone areas such as floodplains, potentially unstable hillside areas and seismic hazard areas that should be conserved as open space.

Issues, Goals and Policies
Salinas possesses valuable assets in the form of its agricultural land, historic resources, parkland, and open space. Conservation and enhancement of these assets can be accomplished by addressing certain issues affecting the City. Nine major issues are addressed by the goals, policies, and plan in the Conservation/Open Space Element. These major issues include: 1) water supply and quality; 2) water conservation; 3) agricultural resources; 4) cultural resources; 5) ecological and biological resources; 6) air quality; 7) mineral resources; 8) parks and recreational facilities; and 9) energy conservation. Each issue and the related goals and policies are included in this section of the Conservation/Open Space Element.

Salinas has historically been an agricultural community, with its rich valley soils. While most of the land used for agriculture within the City limits has been developed into urban use, there are remaining parcels that continue in agricultural production, and agricultural uses surround the City. These agricultural areas help to preserve the traditional rural character of the community, maintain visual open space, and provide substantial economic benefit to the community. However, as growth continues to occur, the expansion of urban uses into portions of the interior and surrounding agricultural areas will be necessary in part to provide adequate housing to meet the existing demand for housing for

agriculture and agriculture-related workers and their families. The following goal and policies are designed to ensure that important agricultural resources are protected and preserved for the future.
Goal COS-3:	Identify, preserve and protect the significant
agricultural resources within and surrounding Salinas, while minimizing conflicts between agricultural and urban uses.
Policy COS-3.1 : Maintain a compact urban form, locating growth areas to minimize the loss of important agricultural resources while allowing for the reasonable expansion of the City to address projected population growth.
Policy COS-3.2: Participate in programs that protect important agricultural resources and prevent the conversion of agricultural land to other uses.
Policy COS-3.3 :	Discourage the conversion of lands designated on
the Land Use Map as Agriculture to non-agricultural uses.
Policy COS-3.4 : Minimize conflicts between agricultural and urban uses through the use of buffer zones, roads and other physical boundaries.
Policy COS-3.5: Support public relations/education sessions between the agricultural industry and non-agricultural businesses, developers, and residents.
Salinas’ rich historic past has been incorporated into the fabric of the City and provides a link to the community’s heritage and history. The many sites and structures of architectural and/or historic significance create focal points within the community and provide a sense of place. Areas within the City having historic resources and buildings should be protected and enhanced. In addition, while few archaeological resources remain due to the impacts of agricultural and urban activities, those that are encountered should be protected. The following goal and policies are designed to address the protection and enhancement of cultural resources within the community.

Despite urbanization and the agricultural history of Salinas, the City’s planning area includes natural resources that should be conserved. In particular, Salinas River, Carr Lake and the tributaries to Carr Lake and the sloughs and reclamation ditch provide riparian habitat for a variety of species. These important resources need to be protected to preserve the quality of life in the community. The following goal and policies help to ensure that these resources remain for future enjoyment.
Goal COS-5:	Protect and enhance the remaining
identified and significant ecological and biological resources within and surrounding the community.
Policy COS-5.1 :	Protect and enhance creek corridors, river
corridors, the reclamation ditch, sloughs, wetlands, hillsides and other potentially significant biological resources for their value in providing visual amenity, flood protection, habitat for wildlife and recreational opportunities.
Policy COS-5.2: Explore with Monterey County the potential for creation of a Gabilan Creek Regional Park extending along the creek from the urban edge to

the headwaters in the Gabilan Mountains.
Air Quality Air quality in Salinas, which is within the North Central Coast Air Basin, is generally very good. However, the air basin does not presently meet state standards for ozone or for particulate matter ten microns or less in size (PM 10). According to the 2000 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) for the Monterey Bay Region, exceedances of State ozone standards in the air basin are largely the result of transport from the Bay Area. Cooperation among all agencies in the basin is necessary to achieve desired improvements to air quality. Salinas can participate and contribute its share in those efforts by proper planning for land use, transportation, and energy use. However, because variable meteorological conditions and transport of air pollution into the basin from the Bay area cannot be addressed by the AQMP, some areas of the basin may still exceed standards especially under adverse meteorological conditions. The following goal and policies address the need to improve air quality for the community and the region.
Goal COS-6:	Improve air quality through proper planning
for land use, transportation and energy use.
Policy COS-6.1: Cooperate with the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District to implement the Air Quality Plan.
Policy COS-6.2: Implement measures to protect air quality that may be required to mitigate the effects of population growth.
Policy COS-6.3: Encourage development design that maintains air quality and reduces direct and indirect emissions of air contaminates.
Policy COS-6.4: Support alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking and public transit, and develop bike- and pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods to reduce emissions associated with automobile use.
Mineral Resources Although quarrying operations have occurred within the City’s planning area, most of the historic mineral extraction sites are no longer considered significant resources. However, an area (a dolomite quarry)

to the northeast, but outside of the planning area has been designated by the State Division of Mines and Geology as an Aggregate Resource Area. Because the City does not propose any development in or adjacent to this area, nor does it have jurisdiction in this area, no goal or policy is identified to address mineral resources.
To meet the recreational needs of a growing and diverse population, the City needs to ensure that a variety of parks and recreational facilities exists. The City presendy has a parkland to population ratio of 1.52 acres of parkland per 1,000 people. Improvements need to be made to existing park facilities and the parkland per person ratio needs to be increased in future growth areas to overcome the existing deficiencies and meet the needs of the growing population, respectively. The following goal and policies address the existing deficiency of parkland and future community needs for parks and recreational facilities.
Goal COS-7:	Provide, develop, and maintain ample park
and recreational facilities that offer a variety of recreational activities.
Policy COS-7.1: Develop a high-quality public park system that provides adequate space and facilities for a variety of recreational opportunities conveniently accessible to all Salinas residents.
Policy COS-7.2 :	Maximize the use of built and natural features to
develop a citywide network of parks and open spaces with Carr Lake, Gabilan Creek and the Sherwood Park/Rodeo Grounds complex as essential elements of the open space network.

GENERAL PLAN
Conservation/Open Space Plan
The physical setting, agricultural lands, and historic character of Salinas provide a unique identity for the community. The Conservation/Open Space Plan establishes an approach to protect and enhance these assets. The Plan addresses the issues and related goals and policies identified in the previous section. The goals and policies, serving as the basis for the Plan, are supported by several approaches to protect and enhance these valuable resources. The Conservation/Open Space Implementation Program contained in Appendix A of this General Plan is an extension of this plan and contains specific programs to achieve the goal of protection and enhancement of these resources.
Water Supply Water for urban use is pumped from wells owned and operated by And Quality California Water Service (Cal Water) and Alco Water Service (Alco).
Agricultural users generally own and operate their own wells. Located in the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin, much of the groundwater supply in the planning area is generated through recharge of the basin via the Salinas River. The high dependence on ground water and the growth in water demand by urban and agricultural users has put a strain on ground water resources of the Salinas Valley. Despite efforts to maintain a balance in the Valley, increased pumping during the irrigation season has resulted in seasonal as well as long-term declines in ground water levels in some parts of the Valley. The overdrafting of groundwater is not only an issue of supply, but also leads to contamination of the water supply by seawater intrusion, and exacerbates the degradation of the water supply by nitrate
contamination.
Seawater intrusion in the Salinas Valley was first documented in 1946. Declining ground water levels have caused a lowering, and even reversing, of the hydraulic gradient of the ground water system, resulting in seawater intrusion. The average annual seawater intrusion has continued to increase over time, resulting in contamination of the ground water supply and closure of some public water system wells. In 1999, seawater intrusion was about two miles away from the City of Salinas, and is fast approaching. A project must be identified and implemented to stop the inward movement of seawater. If a project is not identified and implemented to curtail the inward movement of seawater, the State Water Resources Control Board will adjudicate the basin. Thus, cooperating with other State, regional, and local agencies

Conservation/Open Space Element
to stop seawater intrusion is essential in assuring and improving water quality and supply in the basin.
Nitrate contamination of the groundwater supply is also an issue of concern in the Salinas Valley. The average ground water quality in several areas of the Salinas Valley exceeds the drinking water standard for nitrate, and some municipal wells have been closed due to excessive nitrate contamination as a result of non-point source pollution. Nitrate can also be a point source pollutant via “Fer-ta-gation” (a system where fertilizer is injected into the irrigation system) In extreme cases, nitrate contamination can also impact agricultural production of numerous crops, including grapes and cauliflower. A project must be identified to alleviate further nitrate contamination of the groundwater.
Salinas Valley Water Project (SVWP)
Of primary importance is the availability of a safe and adequate water supply within the Salinas Valley. In order to address the existing and future needs of agricultural users in the Valley, the Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA), in cooperation with the Army Corps of Engineers, State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), and the Regional Water Quality Control Board, has developed the SVWP. The SVWP was developed to address three critical water supply, water distribution, and water quality issues in the Salinas Valley:
Stopping seawater intrusion;
Providing adequate water supplies to meet current and future (Year 2030) agricultural needs; and
Hydrologically balancing the groundwater basin in Salinas Valley.
In order to address these three issues, the SVWP proposes:
Modifying the spillway at Nacimiento Dam and reoperating Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs;
Utilizing the Salinas River for conveying water to the northern portion of the Salinas Valley;
Storing flows from the Monterey County Water Recycling Project and utilizing the stored recycled water to help meet summer irrigation needs;
Diverting the Salinas River; and
Treating and distributing water to agricultural users in the northern Salinas Valley.

General Plan
September 2002
COS-17
Conservation/Open Space Element
If built, the SVWP will provide the facilities necessary to maximize water supply benefits to farmlands within the existing Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project (CSIP) area in northern Salinas Valley.
The City is a participant in the MCWRA Cost Allocation Committee, the mission of which is to develop an assessment structure for the MCWRA Maintenance and Operation budget for the two reservoirs upstream, as well as determining the benefits of the SVWP and who shall pay the costs associated with those benefits.
Regional Water Quality Control Board Central Coast Region Watershed Management Initiative
Located within Regional Water Quality Control Board Central Coast (Region 3) (RWQCB), is the Watershed Management Initiative in which the City is a partner. The Watershed Management program, which is updated annually, identifies activities to improve implementation of non-point source pollution management. The initiative applies to three Watershed Management Areas — the North, Central and South Watershed Management Areas. Salinas is located within the Central Area — which includes the largest targeted watershed — the Salinas River Watershed. The Salinas River Watershed covers approximately 4,600 square miles and lies within San Luis Obispo and Monterey Counties.
The primary pollutants of concern targeted in the Salinas River Watershed include: nitrate and minerals in groundwater; nitrates in surface water, pesticides; heavy metals; erosion; and sedimentation. The primary water quality problems addressed include: agricultural activities; urban development and runoff; seawater intrusion; past mineral mining; and gravel mining.
Primary activities to address these issues include: providing public education and technical assistance programs; performing non-point source pollution inspections and monitoring; enforcing regulatory programs and activities such as the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and the Clean Water Act 401 water quality certification activities; and developing and implementing total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for the region’s watersheds.

Cooperating with the RWQCB and other local and regional agencies to implement the Watershed Initiative will help to protect and improve surface and ground water quality in the planning area.
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
The City is a permittee in the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program, which is designed to reduce pollutants in runoff. According to the NPDES permit, all new development projects and substantial rehabilitation projects are required to incorporate Best Management Practices (BMPs). Implementation of BMPs will enhance surface and ground water quality in the planning area.
The supply of safe and adequate ground water is limited and conservation efforts are needed to ensure adequate supplies are available for existing and future needs. Water conservation is encouraged in the City by:
Implementing the Salinas Urban Water Conservation Plan, the purpose of which is to reduce pumping of water from the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin for urban uses to the maximum extent feasible and to reduce overall pumping from the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin by fifteen percent from the pumping that occurred in 1987;
X Regulating development with the City’s Landscaping and Irrigation Ordinance, which requires developments to apply xeriscape principles including such techniques and materials as native or low water use plants and low precipitation sprinkler heads, bubblers, drip irrigation systems and timing devices;
Supporting the production of reclaimed water and developing new use for reclaimed water; and
Applying water conservation techniques to achieve a significant reduction over historic use for the proposed type of development by the incorporation of water conservation devices, such as low-flow toilets, flow restriction devices and water conserving appliances in new public and private development and rehabilitation projects.

Agricultural Resources
Situated in the Salinas Valley, with its rich, fertile soils, Salinas has historically been an agricultural community. Surrounded by prime farmlands as depicted in Figure COS-1, agriculture is a major employer in the Salinas Valley and Monterey County in general. According to the 2000 Monterey County Crop Report, agriculture employed approximately 35,200 employees in the County in 2000, totaling 21 percent of the County’s employment, and generating $2.9 billion for the region.
In 2000, the County ranked first in the State for vegetable production, with the following major crops:
X Lettuce Broccoli Strawberries Grapes
Nursery Products Cauliflower
> Celery X Artichokes
Although surrounded by land designated as Prime Farmland and Farmland of Statewide Importance, farming activities within the city limits are currently focused within three areas: Carr Lake; an area surrounding the Salinas Municipal Airport; and an area located near the sewer treatment plant near Davis Road between West Blanco and Hitchcock Roads (Figure COS-2). Although these areas are currently under agricultural production, economic pressures, gradual loss of productivity, and urban growth pressures suggest some of these areas may convert to urban uses during the next 20 years. As identified on the Land Use Map, land within Carr Lake is designated as Park. Land surrounding the Salinas Municipal Airport is planned for Municipal Airport, Public/Semipublic, Industrial, Open Space, and Agricultural. The land currently in agricultural production near Davis Road is planned for Public/Semipublic uses associated with the sewer treatment plant.
No land within the City or Future Growth Area is presently preserved for agricultural use under a Williamson Act contract.

Agricultural Preservation
The City recognizes the many inherent benefits of maintaining agricultural land uses. Agriculture provides a variety of job opportunities, helps to preserve rural character, and maintains visual open space. Although some agricultural land within the City limits is anticipated to convert to urban uses, the City is working to preserve important agricultural lands located to the south and west of the City and within the planning area.
Preservation of prime agricultural land has long been a tenet of planning policy in the Salinas Valley. In 1986, the City entered into the Boronda Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the County of Monterey to preserve certain agricultural land and to provide certain areas for future urban growth. As part of the MOU, the City entered into a Master Tax Transfer Agreement to encourage the direction of growth toward the northeast between San Juan Grade Road to the north and Williams Road to the south. Areas specifically addressed by the MOU include: the Rancho San Juan Area; the Boronda Redevelopment Area; and the Salinas Auto Center. Infrastructure considerations include: the extension of Rossi Street, east of Davis Road; the western bypass and other transportation improvements; and public improvements such as water distribution and sewer collection systems.
The City is also encouraging the preservation of these important farmlands by supporting and implementing City-Centered Growth Principles. City-Centered Growth Principles support: locating new urban development adjacent to existing City boundaries; directing economic development to cities; using existing urbanized land more efficiently through infill, higher density development, and revitalization of existing urban areas; and creating workable infrastructure to accommodate the planned growth of the City. Additional policies that support these City-Centered Growth Principles include: avoiding leap frog development through well-planned land uses; minimizing growth inducing impacts of new roadways and infrastructure in agricultural areas; and minimizing agricultural and urban use conflicts.

Salinas also supports the preservation of agricultural land by providing necessary support infrastructure including:
Housing for agricultural workers;
Educational facilities for agricultural workers and their families; and Industrial land for food processing associated with agricultural production.
Cultural Resources
Compatibility with Urban Uses
Agricultural activity in proximity to residential and other urban uses may result in conflicts between the uses. Agricultural activity can cause nuisances related to air quality and noise that may disturb surrounding development. Urban activities may also negatively affect nearby agricultural uses as increased vandalism often occurs, and the introduction of domestic animals may disturb certain agricultural activities. The City helps to minimize conflicts between agricultural and urban uses by supporting the provision and maintenance of buffer zones, roads, and other physical boundaries to separate urban and agricultural uses. The City also supports public relations/education sessions between the agricultural industry and urban users to encourage dialogue and innovative solutions to common concerns of the agricultural industry and residents.
Salinas includes a great number of historic resources. Small tribes of Native Americans first made their home in the Salinas Valley many centuries before the first European explorers came to California to build a presidio in Monterey and missions in Carmel, Soledad, San Juan Bautista, and the San Antonio Valley.

During the time of Spanish rule, settlements developed around the missions on the Central Coast, but the Salinas area remained largely undeveloped until after Mexico gained its independence and began granting lands in Alta California to its people. Sausal and Nacional were among some of the first ranchos granted by the Mexican government after Mexico seceded from Spain in 1822. On adjoining parts of these ranchos, "Salinas City" was born. "Salinas", which is Spanish for 'salt marsh,' refers to a large slough that once ran through the area.
In 1872, "Salinas City" became the seat of Monterey County. Two years later the name was changed to the "City of Salinas" and the community incorporated. Early in the gold rush years James Bryant Hill bought Rancho Nacional and became a pioneer in the agricultural industry by farming wheat; the valley had primarily been used for cattle and other livestock from the time of some of its earliest settlers until the 1920s.
After World War I, the agricultural industry began to change from hides and tallows to products like grains, beans, and sugar beets. The "green gold" of lettuce, broccoli and artichokes, also helped to make Salinas one of the wealthiest cities per capita in the U.S. at that time.
In Salinas today, the Spanish heritage is reflected in the names of the streets, lakes, shopping centers, recreation areas, and school districts. Salinas is a multi-cultural city with contributions being made by many different groups.2
Historic and Architectural Resources
As depicted on Figure COS-3, a concentration of historic buildings is found in the City’s downtown and surrounding neighborhoods, reflecting several generations of the City’s growth and history. Three areas within the community also have a concentration of historic resources: 1) the Eastend historic area, the City’s first residential neighborhood, centered mostly on Soledad Street, between John and Gabilan Streets; 2) the Steinbeck historic area, named after author John Steinbeck, includes Steinbeck’s childhood neighborhood on Central Avenue and the 100 and 200 blocks of Main Street, where the first commercial buildings in Salinas were located; and 3) the Maple Park historic area, which features a very stylish and distinctive residential subdivision built in the 1930s and 1940s.

The City is also considering implementing a historiq/architectural preservation program and ordinance, which may include measures such as transfer of development rights (TDR) and a Mills Act program.
Archaeological Resources
Little archaeological investigation has occurred in Salinas or in Monterey County in general, and no prehistoric archaeological site has been recorded in the planning area. Generally, in accordance with settlement patterns in the Salinas Valley, areas with a history of available water supplies are most likely to contain archaeological sites. The Carr Lake/Natividad Creek corridor is the only area within the City limits that has a potential for high sensitivity (potential for archaeological resources). In the northwest portion of the planning area, a wide band on either side of Highway 101 is also identified as having high sensitivity.
County policies require archaeological field inspections prior to all proposed development in high sensitivity zones and for major projects in moderate sensitivity zones.

Ecological and Biological Resources
Due to the high level of urbanization and agricultural activities in Salinas, few areas of native vegetation and sensitive resources exist. However, Salinas recognizes the importance of protecting and enhancing the few remaining areas of high biological value.
Sensitive Resources
Figure COS-4 depicts the vegetation communities in the planning area. As depicted, much of the planning area consists of previously disturbed and/or developed areas. These areas generally support non-native landscape, trees, row crop agricultural lands, orchards, and barren areas. However sensitive habitats exist in the planning area. The major water courses (Gabilan Creek, Natividad Creek and the Salinas River) support riparian woodland vegetation. This habitat may be used by a variety of wildlife species for food, water, escape cover, nesting, migration and dispersal corridors, and thermal cover.
In-stream wedands and seasonal wetlands also occur within the planning area, primarily along the bottom of channelized watercourses, such as the lower portions of Gabilan Creek and portions of the Alisal Slough. These wedand habitats provide important foraging and breeding areas for a variety of wildlife species.

As depicted in Figure COS-4, grasslands are scattered throughout the planning area, primarily occurring along the upper banks and terraces of the seasonal drainage ditches. Although not a sensitive resource in itself, grasslands provide an important foraging resource for a variety of sensitive wildlife species, such as the California tiger salamander, western burrowing owl, and northern harrier. Several raptors may also forage over the grasslands, including the white-tailed kite.
Figure COS-4 shows that the only oak woodland habitat in the planning area is limited to a grove along Williams Road. This remnant oak woodland area is surrounded by agricultural land and/or rural residential uses.
The City preserves important biological resource areas by designating a large portion of the sensitive habitat areas along Gabilan, Santa Rita, Alisal and Natividad Creeks, at Espinosa Lake, and within the Carr Lake area, as Park or Open Space. These areas in particular offer valuable recreation and flood control opportunities. Additionally, the City assesses discretionary development proposals for potential impacts to sensitive resources pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and requires preservation of important resources and mitigation of any impacts to sensitive species and habitat.
Air Quality Air quality in Salinas is generally good. However, there are several actions the City can take to improve local and regional air quality.
Regional Air Quality
Salinas is located within the North Central Coast Air Basin (Figure COS-5), which is comprised of more than 5,100 square miles, and includes Monterey, Santa Cruz, and San Benito Counties. The air basin is a non-attainment area for the State Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and inhalable particulate matter (PM 10). Because the basin has not violated the State ozone standard more than three times at any monitoring location within the district during calendar year 2000, the district is designated “nonattainment-transitional” for ozone. The Air Resources Board does not recognize the “nonattainment-transitional” designation until it has validated the data.
The Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District, which implements the Clean Air Act for the North Central Coast Air Basin, operates ten monitoring stations in the basin, including one station in

Motor Vehicle Emissions
Mineral Resources
Motor vehicles are the major source of regional emissions throughout the air basin and within Salinas. The City works with the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District (the District), Caltrans, the Transportation Agency of Monterey County (TAMC), and Monterey-Salinas Transit (MST) to improve the regional transportation system and regional air quality. Measures identified in the most recent Air Quality Management Plan to address regional motor vehicle emissions include: 1) transportation control measures, such as improved public transit; 2) transportation demand management, such as ridesharing programs, bicycle education programs, and vanpooling; 3) traffic improvements such as signal synchronization and new and improved bike facilities; 4) alternative fuels; 5) Livable Communities concepts and land uses; and 6) intelligent transportation systems. The City has used and will continue to use DMV Motor Vehicle Emissions Reduction Grant Program (AB27 66) funds to help implement the above measures to reduce regional motor vehicle emissions.
Energy Conservation to Reduce Air Emissions
Energy conservation is another strategy for improving air quality. Pollutants are generated by the combustion of fossil fuels to produce electricity, and by the combustion of natural gas. Reducing energy usage decreases the amount of pollutants generated. For a discussion of measures to address energy conservation, please refer to the Energy Conservation section of this Plan, which is located near the end of this Element.
An area to the northeast, but outside of the planning area has been designated by the State Division of Mines and Geology as an Aggregate Resource Area. Dolomite has been mined from this deposit for years. Mining activities are ongoing at this facility, and are anticipated to continue for at least fifty years. The Surface Mining and Reclamation Act (SMARA) requires that reclamation of the site must be to a condition consistent with the identified end use of the property. This area is just outside of the Growth Area Boundary and no City land use designation is applied to the site.

Existing Parks and Recreational Facilities
The Salinas parks and recreation system exists within the context of the City’s existing development pattern. The existing and planned parks and recreational system consists of a variety of park types as identified in Table COS-2.
Table COS-3 identifies the existing public and private parks and recreational facilities in Salinas. Figure COS-6 depicts existing public parks and other recreation facilities in the community3. As identified in Table COS-3, many of the existing parks in Salinas do not meet the national park standards identified in Table COS-2. Additionally, insufficient resources has led to a lack of adequate maintenance at all of the park sites. Many of the neighborhood parks, in particular, require infrastructure repairs, including the replacement of sidewalks, athletic courts, restroom facilities, and playground equipment. The increased maintenance of these facilities is essential to providing adequate and safe recreational opportunities in the community.

Joint-Use of City and School District Facilities
Joint-use agreements with local school districts supplement the City’s recreation facilities. Both parties make use of the facility rental process in order to provide programs to the community. The City currently conducts adult and youth sports aquatic programs, as well as basketball, softball, football and swim. Most of the schools in Salinas are involved in some or all of these programs. However, even the joint use of these facilities has not resolved the great need for additional recreational space. Unmet demand is especially high for additional gymnasiums, basketball courts, and field space for softball and baseball. Although the Salinas Sports Complex has helped to alleviate some of this demand, additional gymnasium, basketball courts, and sports fields are needed in the community. With sufficient funding, opportunities exist for these facilities at the Rodeo Complex and Natividad Creek Park.
Regional Parks and Recreational Facilities
The County parks closest to the community are: to the south — Toro Park (4,789 acres) and Jack’s Peak (52S) acres; and to the north — Manzanita Park (404 acres) and Royal Oak’s Park (122 acres). Fremont State Park (244 acres), located to the northeast of the planning area provides opportunities for camping and picnicking. Laguna Seca, to the south, offers 180 campsites, fishing, sharp shooting and off-highway vehicle tracks. The Raceway of Laguna Seca is home to many special events, races, and festivals. Additionally, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has received 7,500 acres of the former Fort Ord for a nature preserve. The BLM will receive another 8,000 acres after it has been cleared of unexploded ordnance.
Parkland Standard
To ensure sufficient parks and recreational opportunities to meet the community’s needs, the City’s goal is to provide three acres of developed public parkland per 1,000 residents. This standard is useful in determining existing parkland deficiencies and predicting the demand from future population growth.

Future Park Needs
Figure COS-7 and Table COS-4 identify future parkland opportunities within the community. Table COS-5 summarizes the parkland requirements for the existing population and the anticipated population from development of planned land uses as established by the Land Use Policy Map. Based on the parkland standard of three acres of parkland per 1,000 residents, there is an existing deficit of approximately 71 acres of parkland in the community. Additionally, most of the existing facilities require improvement and maintenance to provide adequate and safe facilities for the population. As indicated in Table COS-5, the existing and planned parkland is expected to exceed the parkland standard requirement by approximately 479 acres. If Carr Lake cannot be acquired for parkland, the surplus will be exceeded by approximately 40 acres.
Development within Future Growth Areas shall be conditioned to provide all the land and improvements required to achieve the parkland standard of three acres of developed parkland per 1,000 residents to meet park acreage needs, as referenced in Table COS-5. All new parks constructed within the City shall meet, at a minimum, the park standards established in Table COS-2.

Trails Network
The City has an extensive and integrated pedestrian and bicycle trails network, which links to major activity centers, parks and recreational facilities, and transit nodes within the City (Figure C-S in the Circulation Element). This network encourages the use of bicycles and walking for commute, recreational, and other trips. The City seeks to maintain and improve the biking and walking environment by providing safe and attractive sidewalks, walkways, cut-throughs in residential neighborhoods, and bike lanes and paths for both recreational and commuting purposes.
The pedestrian and bicycle classification system and requirements are discussed in more detail in the Circulation Element of this Plan. The City Parks and Recreation Department and Public Works Department continue to use AB 2766 DMV Motor Vehicle Emissions Reduction Grant Program funds to expand and maintain the Class I, II, and III bicycle paths in the community. The City also works to increase the availability of bicycle facilities, such as bike racks and lockers to promote bicycling in the community. The expansion and maintenance of these facilities in accordance with the Metropolitan Transportation Improvement Program and Metropolitan Transportation Plan, provides links to the regional trail system, increases recreational opportunities, and provides an alternative mode of travel.

Energy Conservation
Energy requirements and pollutants associated with the generation of energy can be reduced through innovative architectural design, building construction, structural orientation, and landscaping. The City recommends the following methods be used to help create sustainable buildings that consume less fossil fuel:
Optimize building siting and orientation to take advantage of shading provided by natural vegetation, reduce summer heat gain, provide shelter from winter winds, and capture summer breezes.
Design buildings to optimize natural lighting, provide for task lighting, and specify high-efficiency electric lighting.
Encourage private and public projects to exceed Title 24 standards.
The relationship between project design and future energy requirements should be considered when reviewing proposals for new development. The City promotes energy conservation by implementing State Title 24 energy performance requirements through building codes. Utility company incentive programs to retrofit existing developments with energy efficient lighting, air conditioning and heating systems are also used in the City. Energy is conserved in public buildings, and electric vehicle charging areas will be encouraged in new public and private developments.

Circulation Element
GENERAL PLAN
Introduction
The City of Salinas provides a regional transportation hub for the Monterey Bay area. Regional vehicuar transportation is provided by Highways 101, 68, and 183, which traverse the community. Regional rail and air transportation is available through the Union Pacific railroad and the Salinas Municipal Airport. Established public transit services, provided through the Monterey-Salinas Transit agency, provide alternative transportation opportunities for commuters and residents of the community. An extensive bicycle and pedestrian system also provides an alternative option for travel within the City.
The Circulation Element guides the continued development and improvement of the circulation system to support existing and planned development, while the Land Use Element identifies the City’s planned development pattern. The development of additional land in the future will increase the demand for local and regional roadway improvements and construction. The Circulation Element establishes acceptable roadway service levels and identifies improvements required to maintain the service levels. The use of other modes of transportation such as transit, walking, and bicycling is promoted to reduce the demand for transportation system improvements and to improve air quality. The transit, pedestrian, and bicycling systems will also be used to connect the various activities centers identified in the Land Use Element and promote a transit-friendly community.
Purpose of the	The purpose of the Circulation Element is to provide a safe, efficient,
Circulation Element	and adequate circulation system for the City. State planning law
requires:
“... .a circulation element consisting of the general location for proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated with the land use element plan.”
To meet this purpose, the Circulation Element addresses the circulation improvements needed to provide adequate capacity for future land uses. The Element establishes a hierarchy of transportation routes with typical development standards described for each roadway category.

Circulation Element
Scope and Content of the Circulation Element	The state General Plan Guidelines recommend that the circulation policies and plans should: Coordinate the transportation and circulation system with planned land uses; Promote the safe and efficient transport of goods and the safe and effective movement of all segments of the population; y Make efficient use of existing transportation facilities; and > Protect environmental quality and promote the wise and equitable use of economic and natural resources. The Guidelines indicate that the Circulation Element should address all facets of circulation including streets and highways, transportation corridors, public transit, railroads, bicycle and pedestrian facilities, and commercial, general, and military airports. The Salinas Circulation Element fulfills state requirements with a plan to provide effective circulation facilities supporting desired community development. Along with circulation, public utilities must be addressed in the General Plan. Instead of addressing utilities within the Circulation Element, the Salinas General Plan contains a public services and facilities section in the Land Use Element that discusses the provision of utilities and public services/facilities. This element contains goals, policies, and implementation programs to improve overall circulation in Salinas. For vehicular transportation, a hierarchical roadway network is established with designated roadway types and design standards. The roadway type is linked to anticipated traffic levels, and acceptable levels of service are established to determine when capacity improvements are necessary. Because local circulation is linked with the regional system, the element also focuses on participation in regional programs to alleviate traffic congestion and construct capacity improvements. Alternative transportation modes are also emphasized in this element to reduce dependency on the automobile and thereby improve environmental quality. The Circulation Element consists of four sections: 1) Introduction; 2) Issues, Goals, and Policies; 3) the Circulation Plan; and 4) Implementation Programs. In the Issues, Goals, and Policies section, major issues pertaining to the transportation system are identified, and
City of Salinas General Plan	September 2002 C-2
Circulation Element
related goals and policies are established. The goals are overall statements of the City desires and include broad statements of purpose and direction. The policies serve as guides for planning circulation improvements to accommodate anticipated population growth, maintain acceptable service levels while development occurs, coordinate with local and regional jurisdictions to phase regional transportation facilities, and promote alternative transportation modes. The Circulation Plan explains how the goals and policies will be achieved and implemented. Specific implementation programs are included in the Implementation Programs section.
Related Plans and Several transportation plans prepared by the City and other county and Programs regional agencies focus on the local and regional transportation system.
Strategies to handle anticipated traffic levels from future development are discussed. Other plans have also been prepared to locate future routes for bicycle facilities and airport operations. Plans and programs related to the Circulation Element include the following:
Salinas Bikeways Plan
The Salinas Bikeways Plan includes goals and actions along with maps identifying the City’s existing and proposed bikeways, bike parking facilities, bike support facilities, routes for buses with bike racks, and the design requirements for those facilities. The proposed bicycle network will provide nearly 85 miles of routes at buildout, and when completed in 2010, will connect every neighborhood to the downtown, and to employment, shopping, cultural, educational, and recreational facilities. While drafting this plan, the General Bikeways Plan for Monterey County, and the California Department of Transportation Bikeway Planning and Design guidelines were consulted.

Regional Transportation Plan (RTP)
The Transportation Agency for Monterey County (TAMC) is responsible for the preparation of the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) for Monterey County. The RTP’s purpose is to provide policy guidance, plans, and programs for the next twenty years to attain a balanced comprehensive, multimodal transportation system; propose solutions to transportation issues; consider all modes of travel; and identify anticipated funding for projects and programs. The RTP addresses special factors affecting the transportation system, such as air quality, land use, special transportation needs and multimodal integration. The Circulation Plan for Salinas has been designed to meld in to this regional transportation system.
Congestion Management Plan (CMP)
TAMC is also responsible for the preparation of the County Congestion Management Plan (CMP), as required by state law. The CMP represents an effort to manage traffic congestion by coordinating transportation, land use, and air quality in Monterey County. An important aspect of the CMP is the monitoring that measures traffic on county roadways and develops plans to relieve congestion. The CMP encourages each city and the County to address the regional transportation issues related to land use decisions with the goal to mitigate the traffic impacts associated with proposed development. This Circulation Element works to foster a regional cooperation to address issues related to traffic and congestion.
Monterey Bay Air Quality Management Plan
The Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District, through its Air Quality Management Plan, includes transportation control measures that are either implemented by transportation planning agencies through the regional transportation planning process or by cities and counties on a voluntary basis. The Circulation Element supports the implementation of the Transportation Control Measures contained in the plan.
Salmas Municipal Airport Master Plan
The Salinas Municipal Airport is subject to the Salinas Municipal Airport Master Plan 1990-2010. This plan addresses the need for

The master plan is updated periodically and the General Plan reviewed for consistency with the revised Salinas Municipal Airport Master Plan. Funding has been approved to update the Salinas Municipal Airport Master Plan in 2002/2003. Monterey-Salinas Transit Short Range Transit Plan (SRTP) The Monterey-Salinas Transit Short. Range Transit Plan (SRTP) is Monterey-Salinas Transit’s primary planning document for public transit. The plan describes public transit’s role in the community, including its achievements, services operated, solution strategies, and financial plans. The Circulation Element supports the transit agency’s transit goals within the plan. Monterey-Salinas Transit Designing for Transit The Designing for Transit manual was created to help policy makers, city administrators, planners, engineers, and developers understand how to design projects which support transit use. The manual is being updated in conjunction with the Salinas General Plan. According to State planning law, the Circulation Element must be independent, but consistent with the other General Plan elements. All elements of the General Plan are interrelated to a degree, and certain goals and policies of one element may also address issues that are the primary subjects of other elements. The integration of overlapping issues throughout the General Plan elements provides a strong basis for implementation of plans and programs, and achievement of community goals. The Circulation Element relates most closely to the Land Use and Conservation/Open Space Elements. The Land Use and Circulation Elements are inextricably linked. The planned development identified in the Land Use Element is the basis for determining future roadway improvements. The circulation policies and plans ensure that existing transportation facilities will be improved and new facilities will be constructed to adequately serve traffic generated by planned development. An efficient circulation system is a critical factor for diversifying and expanding local economic activities. In addition, the Circulation Element promotes alternative

transportation modes to minimize the impacts of planned local development on regional facilities.
The Circulation Element provides for a system that accommodates bicycles and pedestrians. Trails for these uses will connect with recreational areas and support the City recreational goals identified in the Conservation/Open Space Element. In addition, by promoting public transit, the Circulation Plan will help achieve the air quality goals contained in the Conservation/Open Space Element.

GENERALPLAN
Issues, Goals and Policies
Salinas has a circulation system that includes vehicular, public transit, bicycle, and pedestrian components. A comprehensive system is created by the connection of this local system with a larger regional circulation system. Safe and convenient circulation system operation is needed to support a variety of land uses in the community.
Five major issues are addressed by the goals, policies, and plans of the Circulation Element. These major issues include: 1) providing a suitable system of city roadways; 2) supporting regional transportation facilities; 3) providing an advanced public transportation network; 4) ensuring an extensive public bicycle network; as well as 5) ensuring an extensive and safe pedestrian system.
Roadway System	Safe and convenient access to activities in the community can be
Circulation	provided by a well-designed local roadway system. As new
development occurs within the City, the existing roadway system will become more congested, negatively impacting the community. To allow new development to occur without negatively affecting the existing community, roadway system improvements will be required, including provision of new roadways and improvement of existing roadways. Other programs to reduce the amount of vehicle traffic, such as car-pooling, will also help to reduce congestion, while allowing people to travel in cars. The following goals and policies are designed
to ensure that an adequate transportation system is provided.
GoalC-1:	Provide and maintain a circulation system that
meets the current and future needs of the community.
Policy C-1.1: Create and preserve distinct, identifiable neighborhoods that have traditional neighborhood development (TND) characteristics and corresponding circulation systems. Specifically, the street network should have the following characteristics:
Individual blocks should average less than 600 feet in length and less the 1,800 feet in perimeter;
September 2002

Circulation Element
Regional Transportation	Policy C-l.8: Whenever possible, in reuse/revitalization projects, reduce the number of existing driveways on arterial streets to improve traffic flow. Policy C-l.9: Use traffic calming methods within residential areas where necessary to create a pedestrian-friendly circulation system. Policy C-l. 10: Encourage car-pooling, at government offices, business, schools, and other facilities, to reduce the number of vehicles using the roadway system. Policy C-1.11: Continue to enforce traffic laws, including those addressing bicycle and pedestrian traffic, to ensure a circulation system that is safe for motorized, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic. Traffic congestion in Salinas is directly influenced by an overall transportation network for the region, as traffic generated outside the City passes through the community on Highway 101 and other major roads and highways. In addition, a healthy economy depends on the ability of businesses to move their goods from one location to another. To support the continued success of local businesses, the circulation system must provide adequate local and regional access. Planning for the needs of the community includes recognition of related transportation needs and planning efforts of the neighboring cities, the county, region, and state. With this recognition is the need for the City to actively work with other public agencies responsible for transportation and development in surrounding areas. The following goal and policies address this need to coordinate with other agencies to create a regional circulation system. Goal C-2:	Work with other local and regional agencies to develop regional transit and transportation systems. Policy C-2.1: Urge a countywide approach to Transportation Demand Management (TDM) and Transportation Systems Management (TSM) as the best way to reduce peak-hour vehicle trips and congestion at major employment centers.

Public Transportation Needs
Policy C-2.2: Cooperate with Caltrans in making improvements to Highway 101 and support construction of Prunedale freeway improvements by Caltrans to serve through trips, and trips to and from Salinas.
Policy C-2.3: Continue efforts to reduce adverse impacts of truck traffic and parking in non-industrial areas of Salinas while recognizing and accepting the community’s economic dependence on trucking.
Policy C-2.4: Continue development of the Salinas Municipal Airport in accordance with the Salinas Municipal Airport Master Plan.
Policy C-2.5: Work with Caltrain and Amtrak to provide commuter rail service to the Silicon Valley and other major destinations to provide alternatives to automobile use.
Policy C-2.6: Promote a regional jobs-housing balance to reduce vehicle miles traveled and congestion on the regional circulation system.
Policy C-2.7: Support continued maintenance and expanded use of the City’s Intermodal Transportation Center.
Policy C-2.8: Pursue a variety of funding sources to implement circulation system improvements.
Public transit (trains, buses, shuttles, etc.) is an important component of a comprehensive transportation system. It offers an alternative to the use of automobiles and helps reduce air pollution and road congestion. To promote increased usage of these modes of transportation, adequate services must be provided, as well as adequate demand for public transit, as provided by residential and employment centers. The following goal and policies work to promote the improvement and utilization of the public transportation system.
Goal C-3:	Promote an efficient public transportation
network.

Bicycle Access
Policy C-3.1: Support Monterey-Salinas Transit initiatives to provide adequate and improved (i.e. more frequent availability and use of Intelligent Transportation System measures where appropriate) public transportation service.
Policy C-3.2: Design development and reuse/revitalization projects to be transit-oriented to promote the use of alternative modes of transit and support higher levels of transit service.
Policy C-3.3: Support the extension of commuter rail to Salinas to allow for alternatives to automobile use.
Policy C-3.4: Support public transportation that is “bike” friendly, such as buses with bicycle racks and reduced fares for bicycle riders and provision of bicycle racks at public transportation stations.
Non-motorized modes of transportation, including bicycling, offer alternatives to driving, providing recreational and commute alternatives for the community. Encouraging bicycling as a means of transportation also helps those who choose to drive automobiles, as every person who chooses to ride a bicycle rather than drive causes fewer motorized vehicles on the road. To promote bicycling, a safe bicycle system should be developed and maintained that connects to key activity centers within the community, and to the regional bicycle route and path system. The following goal and policies are designed to provide a bicycle system to serve all of Salinas.
Goal C-4:	Provide an extensive, safe public bicycle
network that provides on-street as well as off-street facilities.
Policy C-4.1: Continue to develop a network of on- and off-street bicycle routes to encourage and facilitate the use of bicycles for commute, recreational, and other trips. Eliminate gaps and provide connections between existing bicycle routes.

Circulation Plan
The City is supported by a diverse circulation system with vehicular, air, transit, pedestrian, and bicycle linkages. The local system connects with the larger regional system and operation of the two systems is interdependent. This section of the element establishes the Circulation Plan. The Plan summarizes the approach to ensure safe and convenient operation of the circulation system and identifies improvements required to accommodate traffic from planned development.
Vehicular transportation (automobiles and trucks) is presendy the primary mode of travel and a Circulation Master Plan is established with hierarchical roadway designations, physical design standards for the roadway designations, and service standards. The Circulation Master Plan includes regional roadways and anticipated regional traffic levels. The use of alternative modes of transportation is promoted to reduce the dependency on vehicular transportation.
New Urbanism principles are incorporated into the Circulation Plan. Transit, pedestrian, and bicycle routes will be expanded to provide connections between the activity centers identified in the Land Use Element. In addition, roadway segments are designed to promote pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods.
The Plan is based on issues, goals, and policies identified in the previous section. The Circulation Element Implementation Program, contained in the following section of this Element, is an extension of the Circulation Plan and contains specific programs to coordinate planned development with vehicular and non-vehicular circulation improvements.
Roadway System Roadway Classifications Circulation
The roadway system in Salinas is defined using a hierarchical classification system. The roadway categories are differentiated by size, function, and capacity, and vary depending if they are within the Future Growth Areas, or within more traditionally developed areas. There are four basic categories in the hierarchy, ranging from an expressway with the highest capacity, to a local roadway with the lowest capacity. In

contained in this General Plan. Future Growth Area roadway design is preferred, and traditional roadway design will be used only when necessary, as determined by the City.1
Expressway: Typically constructed within a right-of-way of 130 feet with a curb-to-curb pavement width of 110 feet (Figure C-l). This six lane, divided roadway has a maximum capacity of 74,000 average daily trips (ADT) and a peak hour capacity of 7,400 trips.
Arterial: There is a range of arterial type and size, with the Major Arterial Type I corresponding to the expressway described above. Major Arterial Type II is typically constructed within a right-of-way of 106 feet and a curb-to-curb pavement width of 86 feet, including a bike lane (Figure C-l). The Major Arterial Type III is typically constructed within a right-of-way of 100 feet and a curb-to-curb pavement width of 80 feet, including a bike lane (Figure C-l). These smaller major four lane, divided roadways have a maximum capacity of 36,000 ADT and a peak hour capacity of 3,600 trips.
Minor arterials are typically constructed within a right-of-way of 90 feet and a curb-to-curb pavement width of 70 feet, including parking and bike lane. This two lane, divided roadway has a maximum capacity of 18,000 ADT and a peak hour capacity of 1,800 trips.
The maximum capacities and peak hour capacities identified for the roadway types are based on Level of Service (LOS) E to F. As a result, if a roadway was to reach its maximum capacity it would not meet the City’s roadway performance standard, as discussed later in this Element.

Expressway: The Expressway Type I/Major Arterial Type I is typically constructed within a right-of-way of 130 feet with a curb-to-curb pavement width of 110 feet, including a bike lane (Figure C-3). The Expressway Type II/Major Arterial Type II is typically constructed within a right-of-way of 110 feet with a curb-to-curb pavement width of 90 feet, without a bike lane (Figure C-3). These six lane, divided roadways have a maximum capacity of 74,000 average daily trips (ADT) and a peak hour capacity of 7,400 trips.
Arterial: There is a range of arterial type and size, with the Major Arterial Type I and II corresponding to the expressway described above. The Major Arterial Type III is typically constructed within a right-of-way of 106 feet and a curb-to-curb pavement width of 86 feet, including a median and parking (Figure C-3). The Minor Arterial is typically constructed within a right-of-way of 84 feet and a curb-to-curb pavement width of 64 feet, including parking (Figure C-3). These smaller four lane, divided or undivided roadways have a maximum capacity of 27,000 to 36,000 ADT and a peak hour capacity of 2,700 to 3,600 trips.

Collector: A Collector - Residential Type I, Commercial (C+L), and Industrial (C+L) is typically constructed within a right-of-way of 64 feet and a curb-to-curb pavement width of 44 feet, with parking (Figure C-4). A Collector - Residential Type II or Local is typically constructed within a right-of-way of 60 feet and a curb-to-curb pavement width of 40 feet, with parking (Figure C-4). These two lane, undivided roadways have a maximum capacity of 12,000 ADT and a peak hour capacity of 1,200 trips.
Local: A Local Standard Residential roadway is typically constructed within a right-of-way of 60 feet and a curb-to-curb pavement width of 36 feet (Figure C-4). A Local Cul-de-Sac roadway is typically constructed within a right-of-way of 56 feet and a curb-to-curb pavement width of 36 feet (Figure C-4). These two lane, undivided roadways have a maximum capacity of 2,000 ADT and a peak hour capacity of 200 trips.
Figures C-l, C-2, C-3, and C-4 show schematic cross sections of each category of roadway, for both the Future Growth Area and traditional roadway design. These sections represent desirable standards, but variation in right-of-way width and specific road improvements will occur in certain cases due to physical constraints and/or right-of-way limitations.
Existing roadways within the City were constructed using prior roadway standards. As a result, when future roadways are constructed, adjustments may need to be made to the cross-sections to ensure that new roadways transition smoothly into the existing system. For example, Boronda Road was originally constructed as a large thoroughfare with landscaped medians. The extension of this roadway will need to be designed to provide a safe and efficient transition between the two roadway styles.

Performance Criteria
Evaluating the ability of the circulation system to serve the desired future land uses requires establishing suitable performance criteria. These are the means by which future traffic volumes are compared to future circulation system capacity, and the adequacy of that circulation system assessed.
Performance criteria have a policy component that establishes a desired level of service (LOS) and a technical component that specifies how traffic forecast data can be used to measure the achievement of the criteria. The performance criteria used for evaluating volumes and capacities on the City street system are based on daily threshold volumes for long-range planning purposes summarized in Table C-2 and peak hour intersection thresholds summarized in Table C-3.

1	Non-directional peak hour traffic volumes are assumed to be 10% of the daily traffic volume. Directional split is assumed 60/40. All volumes are approximate and assume ideal roadway characteristics. Actual threshold volumes for each level of service listed above may vary depending on a number of factors including curvature and grade, intersection or interchange spacing, percentage of trucks and other heavy vehicles, lane widths, signal timing, on-street parking, amount of cross traffic and pedestrians, driveway spacing, etc. 2	The capacity limitation is related to neighborhood quality-of-life rather than the physical capacity of the road. This assumes a standard suburban neighborhood, 40-foot roadway width, and 25 mile per hour speed limit with normal speed violation rates. 3	Capacities given for each service level assume the same level of service for the adjoining merging roadway as well as level of service being determined by volume-to-capacity ratio, not attainable vehicle speed. Level of service will be controlled by freeway level of service if worse than ramp.

	The City will strive to maintain a traffic Level of Service (LOS) D or better for all intersections and roadways. Intersection LOS will be determined by the vehicle delay calculations in accordance with the latest version of the Highway Capacity Manual, Transportation Research Board. Table C-3 describes traffic flow quality for different levels of service. Such criteria are applied consistently for evaluating land use and circulation system changes and impacts. Relationship to Land Use Future traffic volumes and highway capacity needs are directly related to future land use. As the population and number of businesses increase with the implementation of this General Plan and growth in the region, additional traffic will be generated. It is estimated that the existing (2000) number of vehicle miles traveled in Salinas is approximately 1,663,300 miles. By buildout, planned land uses will generate approximately 2,403,500 vehicle miles traveled, an increase of 45 percent. The proposed Circulation Master Plan presented in the next section is designed to accommodate the traffic from planned development. General Plan Circulation System The circulation goals and policies emphasize the need for a circulation system capable of serving both existing and future traffic. The location, design, and constituent modes of the circulation system have major impacts on air quality, noise, community appearance, and other environmental resources. The Salinas Circulation Master Plan depicted in Figure C-5 delineates the planned circulation system including roadway segments with the Freeway, Expressway, Arterial, and Collector designations. Local streets are not shown since their location and design are determined on a project-by-project basis. The Plan accommodates anticipated traffic levels and the hierarchical roadway classification system is implemented to support projected travel demand. In addition, Table C-4 depicts the long-range roadway improvements that are needed to reduce roadway and intersection impacts in the planning area. These roadway improvements will be funded and implemented through the developer paid improvements, traffic fee program, and traffic capital improvement program.

Additional regional roadway modifications that that may affect the Salinas circulation system during the next 20 years are identified in Table C-5. The City will continue to monitor the planning process for these regional circulation improvements to analyze how they would impact the Salinas circulation system. If necessaiy, the General Plan circulation system will be revised to address the impact from these modifications.
Development of the Westside Bypass is inhibited by several factors including: the existence of prime agricultural land; impact to the Markley Swamp wetland; the need to cross railroad and reclamation facilities; and the uncertainty of funding for this regional roadway. For these reasons, the City will actively pursue alternatives to the Western Bypass. If development of this roadway proves to be infeasible, the impact of deleting this facility from the Circulation Element roadway network will be identified and the network will be modified to address such impacts.
Development of the future roadways crossing Carr Lake is also inhibited by several factors including the cost of acquiring right-of-way, the existence of the floodplain and flood control/water reclamation facilities, and possible future development of the area as a wildlife habitat and/or community recreation site. If development of these roadways from the Circulation Element roadway network will be identified and the network will be modified to address such impacts.
To help reduce the need for additional roadway improvements due to increased traffic, the City will also encourage major employers to provide incentives to employees to utilize car-pooling and other alternative means of transportation. There are existing programs in place. AMBAG has a team that works on commuting issues and ridesharing. The City has a vanpool program for South County and expects to initiate a North County/Santa Cruz vanpool program by summer 2002. Monterey County also has a vanpool from the Monterey Peninsula. Thus, vanpool programs exist as do ridesharing opportunities. Guaranteed ride home programs are in place.
Circulation Alternatives
In addition to the circulation system depicted in Figure C-S, there are two other circulation alternatives that were analyzed as part of the General Plan adoption in the General Plan Program EIR. These

include the proposed Prunedale Bypass to the north of the City and an Eastern Bypass expressway in place of the identified arterial Eastern Bypass adjacent to the Salinas Municipal Airport. Both of these alternatives were analyzed since they have been proposed by regional transportation agencies and may be implemented if appropriate. If regional agencies decide to proceed with either or both of these alternatives and are able to secure adequate funding, the Circulation system will be revised accordingly to reflect an alternative circulation system, as analyzed in the Program EIR.

	Truck Routes An efficient and effective goods movement system is essential to the economic livelihood of urban areas. Trucking dominates goods movement within and through regions. Since Salinas is an agriculture processing and shipping center located on Highway 101, truck traffic is an essential factor when evaluating the Salinas transportation system. Due to existing industrial uses, the City experiences above-average truck traffic through the south and central portions of the City. The existing city-designated truck routes are shown in Figure C-6. The designated truck routes currently form a ring around the City, with the exception of Laurel Drive, which bisects the City. Generally, Highway 101 and the city-designated truck routes serve the primary industrial areas of the community, except for smaller pockets of light and general industrial development, such as the western end of West Market Street. The City’s current truck routes avoid the primary residential areas, and minimize the potential for conflicts associated with heavy truck traffic moving through the City. Many of the existing US 101 overpasses do not have adequate vertical clearance to accommodate taller/higher truck loads. Thus, they are routed around the City via City and County roads to avoid conflicts. One of the main challenges with trucks serving the agricultural industry in Salinas is the lack of truck facilities in South Salinas to serve industry needs, and minimal coordination to drop off and pick-up product and/or goods. Truck facilities have been developed at the Terven-Vertin intersection, Sanbom-Terven intersection, and a third at the Work-Sanborn intersection. These facilities provide services for truckers (restrooms, showers, food service, phones, and parking), which have provided some improvement. However, the anticipated 200 truck parking stalls are not sufficient to meet the demand generated by the estimated 3,000 trucks per day in Salinas. The City will continue to work with the trucking industry to designate appropriate truck routes, locate additional truck facilities within the planning area, and work with other governmental agencies to develop a freight logistic center in Salinas.

Neighborhood Traffic Safety
One component of the Circulation Element is to encourage the use of non-vehicular modes of transportation, such as walking and bicycling. With an increase in the number of people using non-automobile means of transportation, there has to be a safe transportation network in place. This network should include crosswalks, grade separations (bridges), and walkways that ensure the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists. Currently, consultants are developing a Salinas Traffic Calming Policy to provide potential tools for addressing residential street traffic impacts and neighborhood livability.
The City will continue to ensure that sufficient right-of-way widths are provided along new roadways, incorporating features that buffer pedestrians and bicyclists from vehicular traffic. In developed areas, the City will identify deficiencies, such as lack of sidewalks, which create additional risks to pedestrians and bicyclists and will also create a funding plan to address these deficiencies. Further, all new development will be required to install public sidewalks along all street frontages to accommodate pedestrian use.

Circulation Element
Regional Salinas and the Monterey County region have experienced great success Transportation during the last century providing agricultural products to the rest of the nation and parts of the world. This would not have been possible without an efficient regional transportation system. The system must link localities with outside commerce centers and regional transportation hubs. In addition, the regional circulation system must
meet the needs of local residents.
Highway 101 bisects Salinas and provides the major access route to other regional freeways throughout California. The Union Pacific railroad extends through the City and is served by the newly expanded Intermodal Transportation Center in the downtown. Air transportation is available at the Salinas Municipal Airport, located at the southern end of the City.
Since many of the local roadways, such as Highway 101, are used by regional traffic traveling through the City, the community is interested in reducing the negative impacts to local residents from vehicles traveling on US 101. To address this issue, the City will continue to support the Prunedale freeway improvement proposal to provide an alternative route for through-traffic traveling along Highway 101.
Ensuring adequate circulation for residents and businesses will require coordination with regional and state transportation planning efforts. Construction of the Prunedale freeway improvements and improvements to Highway 101 through Salinas will be monitored to ensure adequate capacity and consistency with planned circulation improvements in the planning area. The City will also continue to work with the Transportation Agency for Monterey County to help implement the County Regional Transportation Plan and Congestion Management Plan. In addition, the City will continue to coordinate with the Monterey County Airport Land Use Commission, Union Pacific, and Caltrain on projects affecting the airport and railroad.

Circulation Element
Public Transportation Needs	Transportation System and Demand Management The efficiency of the circulation system will be maximized with transportation control measures (TCM), including transportation system management (TSM) and transportation demand management (TDM) strategies. TSM involves physical improvements to the circulation infrastructure to expand capacity and increase traffic flow while TDM involves reducing the demand for vehicular transportation. AMBAG’s Commute Alternatives program and Monterey-Salinas transit are both examples of TDM. In addition to enhancing the operation of the circulation system, TSM and TDM strategies provide relief from increasing demands for more improvements to transportation facilities. Traffic signal coordination and intersection capacity improvements will be implemented as needed to improve traffic flow. Traffic fees for traffic impacts of new development will be collected by the City according to a revised fee schedule. The City will support the implementation of the TCM provisions of the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District Air Quality Management Plan and participate in regional efforts to implement TCM requirements. Programs to increase transit ridership and use of non-vehicular transportation, such as walking and bicycling, will be actively pursued. Transportation Financing Implementing circulation improvements to accommodate planned growth will require financing.	Funding for transportation improvements is available from local, state, and federal sources. The City will identify available funding sources and establish a financing plan to guide construction and funding of transportation system improvements. Circulation improvements to accommodate new development projects will be constructed and/or funded in whole or in part by project proponents. Fees will be collected for traffic impacts of new development in accordance of a revised fee program. One of the key components of the Circulation Plan is to promote the use of alternative modes of transportation such as transit, bicycling, and walking. Increasing the use of alternative transportation modes will produce a number of community benefits including reduced traffic, less

need for costly roadway improvement projects, and improved air quality. Facilities for biking and walking provide recreational opportunities as well, and are discussed in the following section.
Bus Service
Local and intercity public transit is provided by Monterey-Salinas Transit (MST), which essentially services all of Monterey County. According to the 1997 MST Operational Analysis, MST operates a total of eight lines through Salinas, as depicted in Figure C-7. Much of the community is located within a quarter mile radius of a busline. MST considers frequency increases in Salinas its “highest priority” as resources become available.
The City will continue to work with MST to improve bus service within Salinas. In addition, new development and redevelopment/ revitalization projects will be required to be transit-oriented, as discussed in the Land Use Element, and provide transit facilities, as necessary, including providing for bus stops within the residential and non-residential portions of the activity centers. As additional growth occurs in the Future Growth Area, the City will work with MST to extend bus service into the newly developed areas, with the goal to provide adequate transit coverage so that all new development is within
a quarter mile radius of a busline.
set aside $20 million in the State
While bus service remains the predominate form of public transportation in Salinas, efforts are currently underway to extend Caltrain’s commuter rail service from Gilroy to Salinas and Monterey County. In August 2000, the Governor transportation budget for this
purpose. This capital set-aside represents a significant portion of the necessary funding. Due to the strong potential for new intercity and commuter rail service to and through Salinas in the future, the City developed an Intermodal Transportation Center (ITC) at the existing Amtrak station. The City will continue to compete for additional funding sources in order to provide more amenities at the ITC.

Pedestrian Access
A comprehensive bicycle system is an important factor in creating a pedestrian friendly community, as discussed in the Community Design Element. The existing bicycle network in Salinas consists of over 55 miles of Class I, II, or III bikeways, which cover significant portions of North, South, and East Salinas. Once future improvements are completed in accordance with the Bikeways Plan, there will be a total of approximately 85 miles of bikeways. Figure C-8 depicts existing and planned bikeways in Salinas. Once completed, the bikeway network will connect every neighborhood to the downtown, as well as to employment, shopping, cultural, educational, and recreational facilities. The City will work to identify additional funding to implement the Bikeway Plan.
Sidewalks will be located throughout the City to provide pedestrian access. The City will continue to require new development and redevelopment/revitalization projects to provide pedestrian facilities within the project, such as sidewalks. Pedestrian walkway connections will be required to provide access to major destinations within the project, as well as to other locations within the community, such as recreational and community facilities. The City will also continue to identify those areas within the existing community that would benefit from improved pedestrian facilities, as well as identifying funding to provide needed facilities.

Safety Element
GENERAL PLAN
Introduction
The quality of life in Salinas is directly impacted by the sense of security of its residents and businesses. In order to provide a safe and enjoyable environment for residents, it is important to address the issues of crime, violence, and other human caused hazards, and to prepare a response to uncontrollable natural hazards. The Safety Element establishes goals, policies, and a plan to ensure that there is an adequate, coordinated, and expedient response to public safety concerns.
Purpose of the The purpose of the Safety Element is to identify and address those Safety Element features or characteristics existing in or near Salinas that represent a potential hazard to the community’s citizens, sites, structures, public facilities, and infrastructure. The Safety Element establishes policies to minimize the danger to residents, workers, and visitors, while identifying actions needed to manage crisis situations such as earthquakes, fires, and floods. The Element also focuses on preventing criminal activity and violence before they occur. Additionally, the Safety Element contains specific policies and programs to regulate existing and proposed development in hazard-prone areas. Continuing education of City officials and citizens about emergency preparedness is
also addressed.
Scope and Content	The Safety Element satisfies the requirements of state planning law and
of the Safety Element	is a mandated component of the General Plan. Government Code
section 65302(g) sets forth a list of hazards that the Element must
cover, if they pertain to conditions in the City. These hazards are:
Seismically induced conditions including ground shaking, surface rupture, ground failure, tsunami, and seiche;
Slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides;
Subsidence and other geologic hazards;
Flooding;
Wildland and urban fires; and

Related Plans And Programs	X Evacuation routes. State law also permits communities to add safety issues to this list. Additional safety issues that are included in this element are: Criminal activities and violence; Air pollution; Hazardous materials; and Ground and air transportation. The Safety Element contains four sections: 1) Introduction; 2) Issues, Goals, and Policies; 3) the Safety Plan; and 4) Implementation Program. In the Issues, Goals, and Policies section, major issues pertaining to hazardous conditions and safety are identified, and related goals and policies established. The goals are overall statements of the City’s desires and consist of broad statements of purpose and direction. The policies serve as guidelines for reducing the risk associated with humans, including criminal activity and natural hazards. The policies also serve to direct and maximize community emergency preparedness. The Plan explains how the goals and policies will be achieved and implemented. Specific action programs for the Safety Element are contained in the Safety Implementation Program. There are a number of existing plans and programs that direcdy relate to the goals of the Safety Element. These plans and programs have been enacted through state and local legislation and are administered by agencies with powers to enforce state and local law. Multihazard Emergency Plan The City has adopted a Multihazard Emergency Plan to address its planned response to extraordinary emergency situations, associated with natural disasters, technological incidents, and war-related operations, to reduce the threat to life and property. The plan does not apply to normal day-to-day emergencies and well-established and routine procedures used in coping with such emergencies. Rather, the operational concepts reflected in this plan focus on potential large-scale

disasters that can generate unique situations requiring unusual responses.
Salinas Municipal Airport Master Plan
The Salinas Municipal Airport is subject to the Salinas Municipal Airport Master Plan 1990-2010. This plan identifies future improvements for the airport to meet future aviation needs. The plan also addresses land use surrounding the airport. The type of development occurring in the airport environs impacts the safety of aircraft operation, as well as impacting the number of people exposed to aircraft hazards, such as airplane crashes. An update to the master plan has been funded. Once the update is completed, the General Plan will be reviewed, and modified if necessary, to ensure compatibility.
Monterey County Airport Land Use Plan
The County of Monterey has adopted a County Airport Land Use Plan. The plan identifies areas impacted by aircraft operations and includes policies to allow for the continued operation of county airports, while protecting the public safety. The General Plan incorporates these policies. As the Land Use Plan is updated on a periodic basis, such as to reflect the California Department of Transportation’s California Airport Land Use Planning Handbook, the City will review its General Plan to ensure consistency.
Salinas Codes
The City has adopted the Uniform Building Code, Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Fire Code, and the National Electrical Code that contain structural requirements for existing and new buildings. The codes are designed to ensure structural integrity during seismic and

other hazardous events and prevent personal injury, loss of life, and substantial property damage. To protect public safety, planned development in Salinas is subject to these structural codes. The Salinas Zoning Code also includes Flood Overlay District regulations that minimize the potential impacts to and from new development in areas subject to flooding. The City Building Code contains the Flood Damage Prevention section that specifies flood design specifications/requirements.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and Guidelines
The California Environmental Quality Act was adopted by the state legislature in response to a public mandate for a thorough environmental analysis of projects that might adversely affect the environment. The provisions of the law, required procedure, and any subsequent analysis are described in the CEQA Statutes and Guidelines. Safety hazards are recognized as environmental impacts under CEQA. Continued implementation of CEQA will ensure that City officials and the general public have information describing assessment and mitigation of potentially significant safety impacts associated with discretionary private and public development projects.
Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
Pursuant to the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act, the state Geologist compiles maps identifying seismic hazard zones. Development in seismic hazard areas is subject to policies and criteria established by the State Mining and Geology Board. Additionally, approval of development on a site within a seismic hazard area requires the preparation of a geotechnical report and local agency consideration of the policies and criteria set forth by the State Mining and Geology Board (Public Resources Code Section 2690 et. seq).

	Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act requires the state Geologist to identify earthquake fault zones along traces of both recently and potentially active major faults. Cities and counties that contain such zones must inform the public regarding the location of these zones, which are usually one-quarter mile or less in width. Proposed development plans within these earthquake fault zones must be accompanied by a geotechnical report prepared by a qualified geologist describing the likelihood of surface rupture. Cobey-Alquist Floodplain Management Act The Cobey-Alquist Floodplain Management Act encourages local governments to plan, adopt, and enforce land use regulations for floodplain management, in order to protect people and property from flooding hazards.	This act also identifies requirements which jurisdictions must meet in order to receive state financial assistance for flood control. National Flood Insurance Administration Program (NFIP) Salinas participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The NFIP program provides federal flood insurance and federally financed loans for property owners in flood prone areas. To qualify for federal flood insurance, the City must identify flood hazards areas and implement a system of protective controls. The Safety Element, the Flood Overlay Zoning District Regulations, and Chapter 9, Article VI of the Municipal Code fulfill these requirements. County of Monterey General Plan Environmental Constraints Element The County of Monterey General Plan Environmental Constraints Element contains a comprehensive inventory of hazards impacting persons and property in the unincorporated portion of the City’s planning area. The element guides and directs local government decisions regarding safety matters and coordinates regional, state, and federal policies and programs. The unincorporated portion of the Salinas planning area is subject to the County Environmental Constraints Element.

County Hazardous Waste Management Plan
The Monterey County Hazardous Waste Management Plan was adopted in the late 1980’s. The Plan provides basic overall policy direction to address current and future hazardous waste management issues. The Safety Element addresses hazardous materials and emergency
The Safety Element must be consistent with the other General Plan elements. All elements of the General Plan are interrelated to a degree, and certain goals and policies of one element may also address issues that are the primary subjects of other elements. The integration of overlapping issues throughout the General Plan elements provides a strong basis for implementation plans and programs, and achievement of community goals. The Safety Element relates most closely to the Land Use and Circulation Elements.
Policies and plans in the Safety Element are designed to protect existing and planned land uses identified in the Land Use Element from public safety hazards. Potential hazards are identified in the Safety Element, and action programs are established to avoid or mitigate public safety impacts from planned development. Concurrently, the distribution of residential and other sensitive land uses on the Land Use Policy Map contained in the Land Use Element is designed to avoid areas where hazardous conditions have been identified, such as aircraft hazard areas. Evacuation routes that include the circulation system in Salinas are also referenced in the Safety Element. The provision of viable evacuation routes within the City is inextricably linked to the existing and planned circulation system within the Circulation System.

GENERAL PLAN
Issues, Goals and Policies

Certain human activities and natural conditions in Salinas create risks to individuals and properties within the community. Excessive risk from such hazards can be reduced or avoided through implementation of the Safety Element.
Five major issues are addressed by the goals, policies, and plan of the Safety Element. These major issues include: 1) reducing the risk related to criminal activities through prevention programs; 2) reducing criminal activity through design of development; 3) reducing risks from hazards associated with human activities, such as air and ground transportation, hazardous materials, and air pollution; 4) reducing risk from natural hazardous conditions; and 5) preparing for emergency situations. Each issue and related goals and policies are included in this section of the Element.
Community Conflict Resolution and
Crime Prevention
Creating and maintaining a safe environment requires not only traditional policing activities, but also programs that address the source of criminal activity. Recognizing this, the City of Salinas is actively involved in implementing strategies for violence prevention as described in the strategic framework Cultivating Peace in Salinas. The objective is to avoid personal conflict and criminal activities before they occur. To achieve this, these programs teach people to resolve problems through peaceful means without resorting to violence.
GoalS-1:	Continue to play a central role in the creation

Salinas is subject to many human-related hazardous conditions. Certain human activities such as flying, use of cars and other gasoline driven vehicles, water storage, use of pesticides and other hazardous or toxic materials, and use of combustibles expose the population to risk. A particular hazard within Salinas is the increase in polluted runoff from Carr Lake and surrounding agricultural fields that occurs during and after heavy rains. The risk of exposure to these hazards can be reduced to acceptable levels through proper planning and regulation of human

Policy S-3.9: Plan for future airport operations, considering possible expansion of airport operations, services, and the proximity of adjacent land uses. Policy S-3.10:Encourage development in the vicinity of the Salinas Municipal Airport that would not cause land use conflicts, hazards to aviation, or hazards to the public and that is in compliance with the California Airport Land Use Planning Handbook. Policy S-3.11:Ensure that sensitive land uses are not negatively impacted by toxic air contaminant sources, including areas with concentrated diesel exhaust. Due to its geographic location in a seismically active region and the location of flood plains and hillsides within the City’s planning area, Salinas is subject to several types of natural hazards such as earthquakes, liquefaction, flooding, landslides, and erosion. This risk of exposure can be reduced through appropriate planning, land use designations, development engineering, and building construction practices. Existing structures, including older mobile homes that are not securely attached to their footings, may require retrofitting to be able to withstand seismic hazards or flooding. The following goal and policies are designed to help protect the public from these natural hazards. Goal S-4:	Reduce the risk to the community from seismic activity, geologic conditions, flooding, and other natural hazards. Policy S-4.1: During the review of development proposals, investigate and mitigate geologic and seismic hazards, or require that development be located away from such hazards, in order to preserve life and protect property.

GENERAL PLAN
Safety Plan
As in all communities, human activities and natural conditions occur in Salinas that have an effect on the quality of life of its residents. Providing an environment where businesses and residents can operate and feel safe, as well as being prepared for emergency situations, is essential for creating an attractive and healthy environment for residents and businesses within the City. The City can minimize hazards and protect public health and private property through proper prevention and emergency preparedness planning.
This section of the Safety Element identifies the City’s approach for reducing potential hazards from human activities and natural conditions. Human activity hazards include criminal activity, air pollution, the use and transport of hazardous materials, ground and air transportation, and structural fires. Geologic conditions, seismic activity, flooding, and fires are considered natural hazards. The Plan is based on goals and policies identified in the previous section of this element. The Safety Element Implementation Program contained in the last section of this Element is an extension of the Safety Plan and contains specific actions that the City will take to protect the welfare of the community.
Community Conflict Resolution and Crime Prevention
While traditional methods of policing are important to implement within the community to combat crime as it occurs, the residents of Salinas also place great importance on the implementation of programs that strive to prevent criminal activities and violence from occurring in the first place. The City is actively involved with the implementation of a non-traditional strategy to address this issue. The “Cultivating Peace in Salinas” framework for violence prevention is the first step to begin a community dialogue and partnership addressing violence in the community. The City will continue to play a key role in the coordination of the strategy outlined in the “Cultivating Peace in Salinas” framework, helping to identify and implement new programs that help to prevent crime and violence, and encourage people to resolve problems in a non-violent manner.
The Salinas Police Department also plays an important role in the implementation community conflict resolution and crime protection

Crime Prevention through Environmental Design	programs. The Police Department is responsible for protecting residents and businesses from criminal activity, as well as helping to educate the public about methods to reduce criminal activity. The City supports the Police Department and its activities through a variety of actions such as: Funding police staffing levels that correspond to the population and geography of the community (as discussed in the Land Use Element), with emphasis placed on staff and programs for crime prevention and conflict resolution; Ensuring that mutual aid agreements between the Salinas Police Department and the surrounding jurisdictions are in place for emergency situations; Coordinating with the Salinas Police Department and other service providers to increase public awareness about criminal activity and crime prevention activities. Maximize the use of after school programs, volunteer programs, and the Neighborhood Watch programs throughout the City; and Coordinating with the Salinas Police Department and the various school districts to provide school crime prevention programs in local schools, such as the Weed and Seed Program and the School Resource Officer Program. The design of development has the ability to create an environment that minimizes criminal activity, or if poorly designed, result in an environment where criminal activity is able to occur. Reduced crime levels benefit not only those living in the development, but also benefits the community as a whole by contributing to the overall community quality of life. Recognizing the importance of project design, there is a movement in the nation to prevent crime by implementing Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) strategies. CPTED strategies focus on project design that eliminates or reduces criminal behavior, while encouraging people to “keep an eye out” for each other. CPTED approaches the problem of creating a defensible environment by addressing both the physical, as well as the psychological aspects of design. Security concerns are addressed during the design stage of a project and not added as a second thought once the development is
City of Salinas General Plan	September 2002 S-14
Safety Element
constructed. CPTED incorporates several strategies to create a defensible space, such as: 1
>	Surveillance: Surveillance is the principal weapon in the protection of defensible space by keeping intruders easily observable (the concept of keeping the “eyes on the street”). The ease of surveillance is promoted by features that maximize visibility of people, parking areas, and building entrances. These features may include: doors and windows that look out on to streets and parking areas; pedestrian-friendly sidewalks and streets; front porches; and adequate nighttime lighting. In addition, expanding social networks within the community creates a vision of shared goals and norms that helps bring about a sense of cohesion where residents look out for one another.
Territoriality: Fostering a sense of territoriality is important to support defensible space since it encourages individuals to take control of their environment and defend it against attack. Potential offenders recognize this sense of territory and are discouraged from engaging in criminal activities within the area. Territoriality is promoted by incorporation of design features that define property lines and distinguish private spaces from public spaces using landscape plantings, pavement designs, gateway treatments, and fences.
>	Natural Access Control: By clearly demarcating public areas and routes from private areas, access to potential targets is reduced and the perception of risk to potential offenders is increased as a deterrent. Natural access control can be achieved by designing streets, sidewalks, building entrances, and neighborhood gateways to clearly indicate public routes, as well as discouraging access to private areas using structural or design elements.
Physical Security: The CPTED goal of increasing physical security of areas is not to create a impenetrable fortress, but rather to make it more difficult and time consuming to enter a location. Some simple features that can be used include window locks, dead bolts
The information on CPTED strategies is summarized from an article by Robert A. Gardener, CPP “Crime Prevention through Environmental Design” (copyright 1981 and 1995) and Dorinda R. Howe, FCPP’s Crime Prevention through Environmental Design website (www.cpted-watch.com).

The incorporation of landscaping features is another way to deter intruders and increase security around the home. The City of Salinas will review new development and redevelopment proposals to require developers to incorporate CPTED features. To assist developers with the application of CPTED principles, design guidelines will be recreated that provide direction for the implementation of CPTED concepts. The zoning regulations will need to be reviewed to ensure that they allow and promote the use of CPTED concepts. The Police Department will review of proposals to provide their expertise in the prevention of crime through project design. Other human activities addressed in the Safety Plan include air pollution, hazardous materials, and ground and air transportation. Air Pollution As discussed in the Conservation/Open Space Element, Salinas is located within the North Central Coast Air Basin. Due to its marine influence, with northwesterly to westerly winds, Salinas air quality is generally good. The Salinas air quality monitoring site shows that federal and state standards are met with the exception of the State standard for particulate matter less than ten microns in diameter (PM 10), which was not met several times during the period of 1987 to 1998. This is mainly due to the prevalence of agriculture surrounding the City, which increases the dust within the environment. The basin is considered a nonattainment basin since it does not meet state standards for ozone and PM 10. Agriculture and motor vehicles are the major sources of regional emissions throughout the air basin and within Salinas. According to the 2000 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) Jor the Monterey Bay Region, exceedances of State ozone standards in the air basin are largely the result of transport from the Bay Area. Cooperation among all agencies in the basin is necessary to achieve desired improvements to air quality. The City will continue to work with the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District to improve the regional transportation system and regional air quality through transportation control

	measures, as discussed in the Circulation Element. Programs include increasing transit ridership and use of non-vehicle transportation. Hazardous Materials Hazardous materials are used in Salinas for a variety of purposes including manufacturing, agriculture, medical clinics, service industries, small businesses, schools, and households. Many chemicals used in household cleaning, construction, dry cleaning, film processing, landscaping, agriculture, and automotive maintenance and repair are considered hazardous. Accidents can occur in the production, use, transport, and disposal of hazardous materials. In order to effectively manage hazardous materials and waste, the City implements applicable portions of the Monterey County Hazardous Waste Management Plan and works with the Salinas Valley Solid Waste Authority to implement its Household and Small Business Hazardous Waste Programs. The use of pesticides in agricultural operations is a large source of hazardous materials within the planning area since the City is surrounded by agricultural operations, and there are agricultural activities in Carr Lake. There is an increase in the number of organic farming operations in the area, which will help to reduce the total amount of pesticides used. The City does not have direct authority over the use of pesticides. The County Agricultural Commission and the California Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Pesticide Regulation are the major enforcement agencies responsible for controlling and monitoring pesticide use. The City will continue to monitor regulations governing the use of pesticides and work with the County Agricultural Commission to promote the responsible use of pesticides in the planning area. Hazardous materials also pass through the City in route to other destinations via the freeway, rail, and surface street system. The major transportation routes through the City are Highway 101 and the Union Pacific railroad. However, the City has no direct authority to regulate the transport of hazardous materials on State highways and rail lines. Transportation of hazardous materials by truck and rail is regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). DOT regulations establish criteria for safe handling procedures. Federal Safety standards are also included in the California Administrative Code. The California Health Services Department also regulates the haulers of hazardous waste, but does not regulate all hazardous materials.
City of Salinas General Plan	September 2002 S-17
Safety Element
The City will work to minimize the accident and health risk from hazardous materials with the following approaches:
Cooperate with federal, state, and county agencies to effectively regulate the management of hazardous materials and hazardous waste;
Cooperate with the County of Monterey to implement the applicable portions of the County Hazardous Waste Management Plan;
> Identify roadway transportation routes for conveyance of hazardous materials (the City does not exercise jurisdiction over transportation of freight along railroad right-of-way or State highways);
Implement the Multihazard Emergency Plan for accidents involving hazardous materials; and
X Cooperate with the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) for Salinas (the County of Monterey, Environmental Health Division) and the Salinas Fire Department to administer risk management plans for businesses within the City.
Ground and Air Transportation
Salinas is traversed by a variety of transportation systems, including Highway 101, the Union Pacific Railroad, major arterials and roadways, and the municipal airport. Monterey-Salinas Transit (MST) provides bus service. An extension of Caltrain through Salinas is also being proposed. While the availability of ground and air transportation systems is an asset to local economic development, it poses several potential hazards including automobile, rail, pedestrian and bicycle, and airplane accidents. The risk of accidents can be reduced by properly maintaining the transportation system infrastructure and correcting deficiencies. The City will continue to use its police department and work with the California Highway Patrol to monitor the ground transportation system for hazardous conditions. When safety problems are identified, the City will request the appropriate agency, (i.e. Caltrans, MST, Union Pacific Railroad, Police Department, or Public Works Department) to take corrective measures.

Natural Hazards	The City will also continue to coordinate with the Monterey County Airport Land Use Commission and the Salinas Airport Commission to ensure that development occurring in the area subject to aircraft hazards is compatible. The Salinas Municipal Airport Master Plan, the Monterey County Airport Land Use Plan, and the California Airport Land Use Planning Handbook provide guidance as to appropriate land uses in the area surrounding the airport. Development controls include limiting development within areas subject to high noise levels and limiting the intensity and height of development within aircraft hazard zones. The City will continue to review, and update when necessary, the Salinas Municipal Airport Master Plan to ensure that adequate protection is provided for airport operations and surrounding development. Funding has been approved to update the Salinas Municipal Airport Master Plan. The update should contain the following: address minimum distance for Eastern bypass south of airport, define how the Eastern bypass can best be integrated with instrument landing system (ILS) approach, and determine limitations on surrounding land uses to allow continuation of the California International Airshow. Upon any update of the Airport Master Plan, the Monterey County Airport Land Use Plan or the California Airport Land Use Planning Handbook, the Salinas General Plan will be reviewed and revised, as necessary. Natural hazards addressed in the Safety Plan include geologic conditions, seismic activity, flooding, and fires. Geologic Hazards The relatively flat topography and geologic setting of Salinas offer few geologic hazards, other than those related to seismic activity. A map prepared by the Monterey County Planning Department, based on 1980 U.S. Geological Survey mapping, depicts all the incorporated, urbanized area and most of the surrounding planning area as being located within the area of “least landslide and erosion susceptibility.” An area east of Frank Paul School is shown as a “previously mapped landslide.” Most of the City has slopes of one to 10 percent, although a few areas have slopes from 10 to 30 percent. To the east of the City, slopes increase toward the Gabilan Mountains; northeast of the City, slopes from 10 to 30 percent become common. Generally, areas of low and
City of Salinas General Plan	September 2002 S-l 9
Safety Element
	moderate slopes reflect few soil constraints for residential development and road and street construction. Some localized soils constraints related to clay and steeper slopes may occur within the planning area. In the event that there are geologic hazards in an area proposed for development, the City will require soil and geologic surveys completed to analyze potential geologic hazards. The developers are required to incorporated design features into their developments to minimize hazardous conditions. Seismic Hazards Salinas lies within a region with active seismic faults, and is therefore subject to risk of hazards associated with earthquakes. Seismic activity poses two types of hazards: primary and secondary. Primary hazards include ground rupture, ground shaking, ground displacement, and subsidence and uplift from earth movement. Primary hazards can induce secondary hazards including ground failure (lurch cracking, lateral spreading, and slope failure), liquefaction, water waves (tsunamis and seiches), movement on nearby faults (sympathetic fault movement), dam failure, and fires. No known active faults are located in the City and no Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning has been established by the State for the planning area. Consequently, the potential for ground rupture is low. Although the potentially active King City and Gabilan Creek Faults (active within the last three million years, though not the last 11,000 years) are located within the planning area, they are not expected to generate seismic activity. The greatest seismic threat is related to the San Andreas and Calaveras Faults. Damage from earthquakes is often the result of liquefaction. Fiquefaction occurs primarily in areas of recently deposited sands and silts and in areas of high groundwater levels. Especially susceptible areas include sloughs and marshes that have been filled in and covered with development. Salinas has several former wetland areas that have been “reclaimed” (drained and filled) and developed. In addition, Salinas rests on almost 1,800 feet of alluvium. The City is protected from sea waves due to its inland location. However, the City’s tanks, reservoirs, seasonal lakes, and swimming pools are enclosed bodies of water that are subject to potentially damaging oscillation, or seiches, during earthquakes. The hazard is
City of Salinas General Plan	September 2002 S-20
Safety Element
	dependent upon specific earthquake parameters, and the degree of damage due to seiches is likely to be minor. All of Salinas is in Seismic Risk Zone IV, the highest potential risk category due to the frequency and magnitude of earthquake activity nationwide as determined in the most recently adopted Uniform Building Code. Seismic hazard zones are a further-refined measurement, based largely on the type of ground material, but also reflect other geologic factors. Figure S-1 shows the designated seismic hazard zones in Salinas. Most loss of life and injuries that occur during an earthquake are related to the collapse of buildings and structures. The downtown area is located in the zone of greatest seismic hazard. The downtown is also the area damage to structures is likely to be greatest in the event of an earthquake since there is a high number of masonry buildings. The City adopted an Unreinforced Masonry ordinance to address the risk posed by unreinforced masonry buildings as a result of seismic activity. The time period to comply with this ordinance expired in 2000. Under this program, most of the 5 5 unreinforced masonry buildings in Salinas were reinforced. Of the 15 unreinforced structures that remain, only nine are occupied and the other six must remain unoccupied unless and until retrofitted or demolished. The City will continue to enact programs to reduce geologic, seismic, and structural hazards in order to protect public safety. To minimize hazards from earthquakes and other geologic hazards, the City will implement the most recent geologic, seismic, and structural guidelines including the most recent Uniform Building Code and the American Water Works Association Standard for Design of Steel Water Tanks. The stability of residential structures, critical structures, and vital emergency facilities will be given special attention. Dining the review of discretionary development proposals involving grading, unstable soils, and other hazardous conditions, surveys of soils and geologic conditions will be required to be performed by a state licensed engineering geologist. Based on the results of the survey, design measures will be incorporated into projects to minimize geologic hazards. Open space easements to create buffers will also be considered to avoid geologic hazards.

Earthquake preparedness is one of the best methods to minimize personal injury and property damage, and accelerate recovery. The City will continue to promote earthquake preparedness in the community through its Multihazard Emergency Plan. The programs will be coordinated with emergency service providers and school districts to maximize public participation and effectiveness.
Flood Hazards
The Salinas area topography includes creeks and lakebeds that are dry during most of the year and	figure
prominently as open space within the City. Except for the Salinas River, planning
area creeks, streams, and lakes are seasonal. Four natural channels flow from the Gabilan Mountains into the Salinas area. These include Alisal, Natividad, Gabilan, and San Rita Creeks. The Galiban Creek channel has experienced siltation problems between Boronda Road and Laurel Drive, and within Carr Lake reducing the capacity of the creek. All of these creeks are tributary to the Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA) Reclamation Ditch 1665, although the Santa Rita Creek intersects the Reclamation Ditch 3.5 miles west of the city limits. This channel was engineered in 1917 and continues to serve as the primaiy drainageway for the City. The City of Salinas and the MCWRA should require new development above Boronda Road to include mitigation to reduce siltation problems along the creeks.
Figure S-2 depicts flood-prone areas in a wide band on either side of the creeks, in the vicinity of the airport, and a narrow strip along the Reclamation Ditch running northwest-southwest through the City. Floods in residential areas are considered hazardous due to the potential for injury and property damage. Business and commercial activities can be impeded by floods due to facility damage and access related problems. A series of lakebeds along the ditch are subject to flooding and are included in the floodway as established by the Federal

	Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). These historic lakebeds along the ditch are subject to flooding during more intense storm events and serve as retention basins. Thus, they hold water when the capacity of the Reclamation Ditch is reached and protect surrounding areas from flooding. MCWRA policy requires old lakebeds that are in private ownership be retained as undeveloped areas. The lakebed most centrally located within Salinas is Carr Lake. Gabilan, Natividad, and Alisal Creeks drain into Carr Lake, before flowing to the Reclamation Ditch, and eventually the ocean. Approximately 64,000 acres (100 square miles) of watershed drain through Carr Lake. Recognizing the importance of Carr Lake in regards to flood control within the community, the majority of Can-Lake is designated for open space park uses in the Land Use Element. The 1999 Zone 9 and Reclamation Ditch Drainage System Operations Study prepared for the MCWRA evaluates the operation of the Reclamation Ditch drainage system and makes recommendations for improving its function, as flooding and severe erosion are occurring at several locations along the system. The solution proposed by the study includes increasing channel capacity, improving tide gates, and adding pumping capacity. The MCWRA has formed an Advisory Committee consisting of representatives from various government agencies, commerce, agriculture, and the local community to assist in developing a final plan and funding alternatives, along with public support. The City will continue to participate in the process. The City has a Sewage and Drainage Master Plan that addresses the necessaiy flood control system needed to meet development capacity identified in the 1988 Salinas General Plan. No existing problem with storm drainpipes was identified. The City will continue to update and implement the master plan to ensure that adequate flood control is provided within the community. New development is required to provide stormwater retention and detention facilities to regulate runoff. Larger facilities have generally taken the form of ponds that have been designed to handle the difference between the 100-year post development stormwater discharge and the 10-year predevelopment discharge. In other smaller developments where land is limited, retention facilities have included oversizing on-site storm drain systems to store the additional runoff capacity underground and allowing a discharge to the 10-year

predevelopment runoff rate. Some smaller projects may only require improvements to the existing storm drain collection system. The City will continue to require new developments to provide adequate stormwater drainage systems to address runoff resulting from those developments.
Salinas also has the potential for inundation due to the failure of the Nacimiento and San Antonio Dams. According to the Multihazards Emergency Plan, in the event that one of these dams were to fail during a normal wet river flow, approximately two-thirds of Salinas would be flooded within 22 hours after failure. Salinas is required by Section 8589.5 of the California Government Code to have emergency procedures for the evacuation and control of populated areas within the limits of inundation below dams. In addition, real estate disclosure upon sale or transfer of property in the inundation area is required under Section 1103 of the Civil Code.
Salinas participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The NFIP program provides federal flood insurance and federally financed loans for property owners in flood prone areas. To qualify for federal flood insurance, the City must identify flood hazards areas and implement a system of protective controls.
The City also continues to control development in the floodplain and floodway through its Flood Overlay District. The district regulations help to protect the public and their property from flood hazards by limiting development within those areas subject to flooding and ensuring that allowed development occurs in a manner that does not increase the risk of flooding to the project, nor the community as a whole.

Fires
Since Salinas is an urbanized community surrounded by agricultural lands, the greatest fire risk in Salinas is urban fires. Structural and automobile fires are the most common fire risks for residents of Salinas. A risk of wildland fires is associated with the rangelands on the hillsides surrounding the community. As development extends out closer to these areas, the risk of wildland fires will increase.
The City will reduce the potential for dangerous fires by providing funding for the Fire Department so that it continues to provide adequate levels of fire protection and fire hazard education. The current Uniform Fire Code will also be used to reduce structural fire hazards, as will the City’s fire sprinkler and weed abatement requirements. In addition, the City will work the various water purveyors to ensure that water pressure is adequate for fire fighting purposes.
Hazards Response
Recognizing that the City has the responsibility to save lives, limit injuries, and minimize damage to property, the City has adopted a Multihazard Emergency Plan. Local emergency preparedness plans serve as extensions of the California Emergency Plan and the Emergency Resource Management Plan. The purpose of the Multihazard Emergency Plan is to respond to emergency situations with a coordinated system of emergency service providers and facilities. The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in City Hall serves as the center of the City emergency operations.
September 2002
City of Salinas
General Plan
S-27
Safety Element
The Multihazard Emergency Plan addresses the City’s planned response to extraordinary emergency situations associated with natural disasters, technological incidents, terrorist activities, and war-related operations. The Plan is designed to include the City as part of a Statewide emergency management system. The plan also addresses evacuation and movement of people in the event of an emergency.
Salinas will maintain its emergency preparedness plan. The plan identifies resources available for emergency response and addresses emergency response to emergencies such as: earthquakes, floods, fires, hazardous spills or leaks, major industrial or transportation accidents, major storms, airplane crashes, environmental responses, and civil unrest.
To support the Multihazard Emergency Plan, the City will promote a high level of multi-jurisdictional cooperation and communication for emergency planning and response management. Effective emergency response also requires vital facilities such as hospitals, fire stations, and communications centers to be functional during disasters.
Educating residents and businesses about potential disasters and the Multihazard Emergency Plan can increase the effectiveness of response efforts. An educated public will know how to prevent injury and property damage during and after emergency episodes and also know how to find and offer help to their neighbors. The City will work to educate residents and businesses about appropriate actions to safeguard life and property during and after emergencies. Education about emergency preparedness can occur through the distribution of brochures, presentations to civic groups and homeowners associations, and instruction in local schools.

Noise Element
Introduction
GENERALPLAN
Noise levels within the community of Salinas affect the quality of life of people living and working in the City. The most significant noise levels within the community are associated with roadways, the airport, and the railroad. High noise levels associated with these and other activities can create stress and irritation. The Noise Element addresses the physiological, psychological and economic effects of noise by providing effective strategies to reduce excessive noise and limit community exposure to loud noise sources.
Purpose of the Noise Element
The purpose of the Noise Element is to identify and appraise existing noise problems in the community, and to provide guidance to avoid noise and land use incompatibility problems in the future. This Element addresses existing and projected noise sources in the community and identifies ways to reduce existing and potential noise impacts. In particular, the Noise Element contains policies and programs to achieve and maintain noise levels compatible with various types of land uses. These policies and programs emphasize the need to control noise through land use regulation, as well as enforcement of other City ordinances
Scope and Content of the Noise Element
The State of California recognizes the relationship between noise and noise sensitive uses and has adopted State Guidelines for Noise Elements. This Noise Element satisfies the requirements of State planning law and is a mandated component of the General Plan. Government Code Section 65302(f) establishes the required components of the Noise Element. The Element also complies with California Health and Safety Code Section 56050.1 guidelines for Noise Elements.
Future noise conditions from short- and long-term growth are quantified and identified as noise exposure contours. This noise information serves as the basis for: developing guidelines for identifying compatible land uses; identifying the proper distribution of land uses on the General Plan Land Use Policy Map; and establishing proper development standards.
The Noise Element comprises four sections: 1) this Introduction; 2) Issues, Goals, and Policies; 3) the Noise Plan and 4) the Implementation Program. In the Issues, Goals, and Policies section, major issues pertaining to noise sources are identified and related goals

Related Plans And Programs
and policies are established. The goals are statements of the City’s desires and comprise broad statements of purpose and direction. The policies serve as guides for reducing or avoiding adverse noise impacts on the population. The Plan explains how the goals and policies will be achieved and implemented. Specific implementation programs for the Noise Element are contained in the Implementation Program section of this Element.
There are a number of existing plans and programs that direcdy relate to the goals of the Noise Element. These plans and programs have been enacted through state and local legislation and are administered by agencies with powers to enforce state and local laws.
California Environmental Quality Act Guidelines
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was adopted by the state legislature in response to a public mandate for thorough environmental analysis of projects that might affect the environment. Excessive noise is considered an environmental impact under CEQA. The provisions of the law and environmental review procedures are described in the CEQA Statutes and the CEQA Guidelines. Implementation of CEQA ensures that during the decision making stage of development, City officials and the general public will be able to assess the noise impacts associated with public and private development projects.
California Noise Insulation Standards (Title 24)
The California Commission of Housing and Community Development officially adopted noise standards in 1974. In 1988, the Building Standards Commission approved revisions to the standards (Tide 24, Part 2, California Code of Regulations). As revised, Tide 24 establishes an interior noise standard of 45 dBA for residential space (CNEL or Ldn). Acoustical studies must be prepared for residential structures that are to be located within noise contours of 60 dBA or greater from freeways, major streets, thoroughfares, rail lines, rapid transit lines or industrial noise sources. The studies must demonstrate that the building is designed to reduce interior noise to 45 dBA or lower.

City of Salinas Zoning Ordinance
The City’s Zoning Ordinance provides controls for excessive and annoying noise from stationary sources such as air conditioning and refrigeration units, industrial development and commercial activities, and other potentially nuisance-related noise sources. The Zoning Ordinance establishes allowable exterior noise levels for agricultural, residential, commercial, industrial, and public and semipublic districts. Specific standards for daytime and nighttime hours are also provided. The Ordinance establishes guidelines for acoustic studies, noise measurement, and noise attenuation measures. The specific noise performance standards of the Zoning Ordinance are identified in the Plan section of this Element.
City of Salinas Noise Ordinance
Chapter 21A of the City Municipal Code defines various classes of noise (i.e., Class A, Class B, Class C or Class D) and identifies noise regulation standards based on those classes. Certain noise sources are prohibited and the ordinance establishes an enforcement process. Nuisance noise such as amplified sound, noise associated with residential living, equipment noise, and noise associated with sporting and recreational activities are specifically addressed by the Noise Ordinance. Specific Noise Ordinance requirements and standards are identified in the Plan section of this Element.
Salinas Municipal Airport Master Plan
The City adopted the 1990—2010 Salinas Airport Master Plan in 1993. This Plan is used by the City as a policy guide for development on or adjacent to the Salinas Municipal Airport. This Master Plan addresses aircraft noise, identifies specific locations within the City impacted by operations at the airport, and identifies specific noise/land use compatibility guidelines for development potentially affected by the Salinas Municipal Airport. These specific land use compatibility guidelines are highlighted in the Plan section of this Element.

Noise Element
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements	According to state planning law, the Noise Element must be consistent with the other General Plan elements. Each element is independent and all the elements together comprise the General Plan. All elements of the General Plan are interrelated to a degree, and certain goals and policies of one element may also address issues that are primary subjects of other elements. Table N-l provided in the following section identifies the policies by General Plan element that are related to Noise Element issues. This integration of overlapping issues and policies provides a strong basis for implementation of plans and programs and achievement of community goals. Policies and plans in the Noise Element are designed to protect existing and planned land uses from significant noise impacts. To do this, the Element identifies potential noise sources and establishes programs to avoid or mitigate noise impacts from community development. Concurrently, the Land Use Element contains policies to ensure that environmental conditions, including noise, are considered in all land use decisions. Planning for future residential and other sensitive land uses on the Land Use Policy Map is designed to avoid new noise sensitive development in areas (e.g., industrial areas, areas surrounding the Municipal Airport) where noise impacts cannot be reduced or mitigated to acceptable levels. The Noise Element is linked to the transportation policies in the Circulation Element. Transportation noise is largely responsible for excessive noise levels in certain locations within Salinas. The projected noise contours identified in this element directly correspond to the Circulation Plan and the projected traffic generated from the proposed land uses. Both the Noise and Circulation Elements contain policies and programs to minimize the effects of transportation noise on existing and planned land uses. Noise exposure is a key consideration when locating and designing new arterials. The Noise Element also relates to the Conservation/Open Space Element. Excessive noise can diminish enjoyment of parks and other designated open space. Because of this, noise levels are considered in the planning of new recreational and open space areas. Additionally, open space areas can be used to separate and buffer noise sensitive land uses from noise producers.

GENERAL PLAN
Issues, Goals and Policies
Human activities in the community create noise levels that can affect overall quality of life. The goals and policies of the Noise Element are designed to protect the community from excessive noise.
Three major issues related to noise are addressed in the Noise Element: 1) avoiding the negative impacts of noise through the use of land use planning and noise reduction measures; 2) minimizing the impact of transportation related noise; and 3) minimizing the impact of nontransportation related noise.
Noise and Land Certain areas within Salinas are subject to high noise levels. Lise Planning Consideration of the sources and recipients of noise early in the land use planning and development process can be an effective method of minimizing the impact of noise on the community. Consideration may be given to both reducing noise in areas already severely impacted by noise through rehabilitative improvements and avoiding potential noise impacts through proper land use planning. The following goal and policies address the need to evaluate potential noise impacts when
developing and redeveloping areas within the community.
GoalN-1:	Minimize the adverse effects of noise
through proper land use planning.
Policy N-1.1:	Ensure that new development can be made
compatible with the noise environment by using noise/land use compatibility standards and the Noise Contours Map as a guide for future planning and development decisions.
Policy N-1.2:	Require the inclusion of noise-reducing design
features in development and reuse/revitalization projects to address the impact of noise on residential development.
Policy N-1.3:	Locate only urban development within the Salinas
Municipal Airport “area of influence” that is compatible with the airport noise environment and meets the guidelines of the Caltrans handbook.

Policy N-l.4:	Ensure proposed development meets Title 24
Noise Insulation Standards for construction.
The primary source of noise impacting Salinas is transportation-related noise. Highway 101 and other major roadways, the airport and the railroad create high levels of noise that affect the overall quality of life in the community. Reduction in transportation-related noise is necessary to deal with the detrimental effects attributable to excessive noise. The following goal and policies are designed to create a community that is not negatively impacted by vehicular noise.
Goal N-2:	Minimize	transportation-related noise
impacts.
Policy N-2.1:	Ensure noise impacts generated by vehicular
sources are minimized through the use of noise control measures (e.g., earthen berms, landscaped walls, lowered streets).
Policy N-2.2:	Control truck traffic routing to reduce
transportation-related noise impacts on sensitive land uses.
Policy N-2.3:	Ensure new development within the vicinity of the
airport does not result in a land use/noise compatibility conflict or hazard.
Noise sources that are not directly related to transportation include construction noise, manufacturing, agricultural or business operations noise, recreational activities, and property maintenance activities. Such noise sources should be controlled to minimize exposure to excessive noise levels. The following goal and policies address the noise created by non-transportation related sources.
Goal N-3:	Minimize non-transportation related noise
impacts.
Policy N-3.1:	Enforce the City of Salinas Noise Ordinance to
ensure stationary noise sources and noise emanating from construction activities, private developments/residences and special events are minimized.

Noise Element
Noise Plan
GENERAL PLAN
Salinas, like most urbanized areas, is experiencing increased noise levels associated with transportation and other sources of noise. As the noise level in various parts of the community rises, the City must seek ways to safeguard its population from excessive noise levels. The goals and policies identified in the previous section establish an agenda to reduce overall noise levels within the City. This Noise Plan defines the City’s approach to achieve the agenda and generally outlines the action programs. The Noise Element Implementation Program contained in Appendix A of this General Plan is an extension of the Noise Plan and contains specific programs that the City undertakes to protect community well-being.
Noise and Land Use Noise in the community is the cumulative effect of noise from Planning transportation activities and stationary sources. Transportation noise refers to noise from automobile use, trucking, airport operations, and rail operations. Non-transportation noise typically refers to noise from stationary sources such as commercial establishments, machinery, air conditioning systems, compressors, residential and recreational uses,
and landscape maintenance equipment.
Regardless of the type of noise, the noise levels are highest near the source and decrease with distance. Noise is problematic when noise sensitive land uses are affected. Noise sensitive land uses (i.e., activities that are interrupted by noise) include residences, schools, hospitals, religious meetings, and recreation areas. Most noise impacts can be avoided when noise sources, sensitive land uses, and information about the future noise environment are considered in land use planning and development decisions.
Noise Standards and Land Use Compatibility
To ensure that noise producers do not adversely affect sensitive receptors, the City uses land use compatibility standards when planning and making development decisions. Table N-2 summarizes the City noise standards for various types of land uses. The standards represent the maximum acceptable noise level as measured at the property boundary, which is used to determine noise impacts.

Designation/District of Property Receiving Noise	Maximum Noise Level, Ldn or CNEL, dBA
Agricultural	70
Residential	60
Commercial	65
Industrial	70
Public and Semipublic	60
These noise standards are the basis for development of the land use compatibility guidelines presented in Table N-3. If the noise level of a project falls within Zone A or Zone B, the project is considered compatible with the noise environment. Zone A implies that no mitigation will be needed. Zone B implies that minor mitigation may be required to meet the City’s and Title 24 noise standards. All development project proponents are required to demonstrate that the noise standards will be met prior to human occupation of a building.
If the noise level falls within Zone C, substantial mitigation is likely needed to meet City noise standards. Substantial mitigation may involve construction of noise barriers and substantial building sound insulation. Projects in Zone C can be successfully mitigated; however, project proponents with a project in Zone C must demonstrate that the noise standards can be met prior to issuance of a building permit.
If noise levels fall outside of Zones A, B and C, projects are considered clearly incompatible with the noise environment and should not be approved.
The Director of Community Development acts as the noise control coordinator. This designation of responsibility allows consistent and continued enforcement of the established noise standards.

Notes:
(1)	Where the community determines that residential or school uses must be allowed, measures to achieve outdoor to indoor Noise Level Reduction (NLR) of at least 25 dBA and 30 dBA should be incorporated into building codes and be considered in individual approvals. Normal residential construction can be expected to provide a NLR of 20 dBA, thus, the reduction requirements are often stated as 5, 10 or 15 dBA over standard construction and normally assume mechanical ventilation and closed windows year round. However, the use of NLR criteria will not eliminate outdoor noise problems.
(2)	Measures to achieve NLR of 25 dBA must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas, or where the normal noise level is low.
(3)	Measures to achieve NLR of 30 dBA must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas, or where the normal noise level is low.
(4)	Measures to achieve NLR of 35 dBA must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas, or where the normal noise level is low.
(5)	Land use compatible provided special sound reinforcement systems are installed.

Noise Element
	Noise Contours and Noise Impact Areas The noise environment for the community can be described with noise contours based on the major noise sources. Noise contours define areas of equal noise exposure. Future noise contours have been estimated with information about existing and projected land use development and transportation activity. These contours have been prepared to assist in setting policies for proper distribution of land uses and the establishment of development standards. Figure N-l shows the projected noise contours and associated Noise Impact Areas. The noise contours are used as a guide for land use and development decisions. Contours of 60 dBA or greater define noise impacted areas. When noise sensitive land uses are proposed within these contours, an acoustical analysis must be prepared. For the project to be approved, the analysis must demonstrate that the project is designed to attenuate the noise to meet the City noise standards identified in Table N-2. If the project is not designed to meet the noise standards, mitigation measures should be recommended in the analysis. If the analysis demonstrates that the noise standards can be met with implementation of mitigation measures, the project can be approved with the mitigation measures, which shall be required as conditions of project approval. In addition to the general community-wide noise contours depicted in Figure N-1, which are primarily associated with planned land uses and associated automobile traffic, Figure N-2 identifies the estimated CNEL noise contours associated with operation of the Salinas Municipal Airport. This figure should be used in concert with Table N-4 as amended pursuant to the update of the Caltrans handbook to determine land use compatibility and potential noise mitigation requirements for projects that fall within a noise contour area associated with the airport. Construction Standards The provisions of the State Noise Insulation Standards (Tide 24, Part 2, California Code of Regulations) are enforced in Salinas. Tide 24 specifies that combined indoor noise for multi-family living spaces shall not exceed 45 dBA CNEL. This standard must be implemented when the outdoor noise level exceeds 60 dBA CNEL. Tide 24 requires that the same standard be applied to all new hotels, motels, apartments and

multi-family projects. The City also applies the same standard to new single-family development.
Transportation Related Noise
Noise from transportation activity is the primary source of noise in Salinas. The four major sources of transportation related noise in Salinas are:
Traffic on Highways 101, 68 and 183;
Traffic on major arterial roadways within the City;
Train movement on the Union Pacific Railroad line; and Flight activity at the Salinas Municipal Airport.
Noise Control at Reception Sites
The most efficient and effective means of controlling noise from transportation systems is to reduce noise at the source. However, the City has little direct control over noise produced by transportation sources because State noise regulations preempt local regulations. Because the City cannot control noise at the source, City noise programs focus on reducing the impact of transportation noise reception sites.
During the planning stages of the development process, potential impacts from transportation noise will be identified and mitigation measures will be required as needed to meet City noise standards.
Site planning, landscaping, topography and the design and construction of noise barriers are the most common method of alleviating vehicular traffic and train noise impacts. Setbacks and buffers can also be used to achieve noise reduction.
Noise attenuating barriers are commonly incorporated into projects and can be extremely effective in reducing noise levels. The effectiveness of the barrier depends on: 1) the relative height and materials of the barrier; 2) the noise source; 3) the affected area; and 4) the horizontal distance between the barrier and the affected area.
Noise barriers should be included in the design of freeway, roadway and rail improvements. The City supports efforts by Caltrans, the County of Monterey and other transportation providers to provide acoustical protection for noise sensitive uses. In addition, the City will request
City of Salinas
General Plan
September 2002
N-16
Noise Element
Non-Transportation Related Noise	that barriers are constructed as part of future highway, roadway and rail projects in order to mitigate significant noise impacts. Although noise barriers can be extremely effective, the aesthetic effect of barriers on neighborhoods must be considered during the preliminary stages of the development process. Potentially significant aesthetics impacts associated with noise barriers must be addressed and mitigated through landscaping or other project design measures in all new public and private projects. Noise Control at the Source The California Vehicle Code contains noise regulations pertaining to the operation of all vehicles on public roads. These noise standards for cars, trucks and motorcycles are enforced through coordination with the California Highway Patrol and the Salinas Police Department. The City also regulates traffic flow and coordinates with the California Highway Patrol to enforce speed limits to reduce traffic noise. Sensitive receptors must also be protected from excessive noise generated by non-transportation sources, such as commercial and industrial centers, agricultural activities, restaurants and bars, religious institutions and civic centers. Other noise sources commonly referred to as nuisance noises also contribute to the overall noise environment. Application and enforcement of the City Noise Ordinance is the best means to control noise from existing noise sources; while noise generated by new development is effectively controlled through the site design review process, compliance with CEQA, and compliance with City noise standards contained in the Noise Element of the General Plan, the Zoning Ordinance, and the Noise Ordinance. During the preliminary stages of the development process, potential noise impact must be identified and mitigation measures identified. Noise Ordinance The City Noise Ordinance is designed to protect people from nontransportation related noise sources such as construction activity, agricultural operation, machinery and pumps and air conditioners. Enforcement of the ordinance ensures that adjacent properties are not exposed to excessive noise from stationary sources. Enforcing the ordinance includes requiring proposed development projects to demonstrate compliance with the ordinance and requiring construction

Noise Element
activity to comply with established work schedule limits. The ordinance is reviewed periodically for adequacy and amended as needed to address community needs and development patterns.
Business Activity Noise
When reviewing a proposed industrial, commercial, or public project, noise generation and potential impacts to surrounding development are considered in accordance with CEQA. An acoustical analysis is required for projects that will generate noise potentially affecting sensitive receptors. Where significant impacts are identified, mitigation measures are required. Common mitigation measures that could be applied when reviewing projects include acoustically treated and quiet-design: 1) furnaces; 2) fans; 3) motors; 4) compressors; and 5) valves and pumps. The City may also require limited delivery hours and hours of operation in order to minimize impacts to adjacent residential users or other sensitive receptors.
In addition, all City departments must comply with state and federal OSHA standards. Any new equipment or vehicle purchased by the City will comply with local, state and federal noise standards.
Nuisance Noise
Several noise sources can contribute to the overall noise environment in the community, including: barking dogs, loud audio equipment, defective or modified auto and motorcycle mufflers and activities at parks and civic, community or religious institutions. Existing nuisance noises can be addressed through strict enforcement of the Noise Ordinance, while potential noise impacts may be avoided or reduced through the site design review process, review of proposed developments per CEQA and mitigation of potential nuisance noise impacts.

Community Facilities District (CFD): Under the Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982 (Government Code Section 53311 et seq), a legislative body may create within its jurisdiction a special district that can issue tax-exempt bonds for the planning, design, acquisition, construction, and/or operation of public facilities, as well as provide public services to district residents. Special tax assessments levied by the district are used to repay the bonds.
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL): The average equivalent sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of five decibels to sound levels in the evening from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. and after addition of 10 decibels to sound levels in the night after 10 p.m. and before 7 a.m. See also "A-Weighted Decibel."
Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA): A local agency created under California Redevelopment Law, or a local legislative body which has elected to exercise the powers granted to such an agency, for the purpose of planning, developing, replanning, redesigning, clearing, reconstructing, and/or rehabilitating all or part of a specified area with residential, commercial, industrial, and/or public (including recreational) structures and facilities. The redevelopment agency's plans must be compatible with adopted community General Plans.
Compatibility: The characteristics of different uses or activities that permit them to be located near each other in harmony and without conflict. The designation of permitted and conditionally permitted uses in zoning districts is intended to achieve compatibility within the district. Some elements affecting compatibility include: intensity of occupancy as measured by dwelling units per acre; pedestrian or vehicular traffic generated; volume of goods handled; and such environmental effects as noise, vibration, glare, air pollution, or the presence of hazardous materials. On the other hand, many aspects of compatibility are based on personal preference and are much harder to measure quantitatively, at least for regulatory purposes.

I.	Introduction
The following Housing Element Technical Report provides detailed background information that was used to develop the policies and programs for the 2002-2007 Housing Element. This Technical Report consists of the following sections:
X Housing Needs Assessment (Section 2), which describes the City’s population characteristics, housing characteristics, and existing housing needs;
X Housing Constraints (Section 3), which assesses potential market, governmental, and environmental constraints to the development, maintenance, and improvement of housing;
Housing Resources (Section 4), which evaluates land, financial, and administrative resources to address housing needs in the community; and
Housing Accomplishments (Section 5), which reviews and analyzes progress made in achieving housing goals in the last Housing Element.
Various resources were used to prepare the Housing Element Technical Report. Data from the 2000 Census was used to the extent possible. Where necessary, data from the 1990 Census was incorporated into the report. Several additional data sources were also used to supplement the 1990 and 2000 Census data including the following:
Population and demographic data from the State Department of Finance; Employment data from the State Employment Development Department;
Housing market data from market surveys, property tax files, and advertisements; Special needs data from public and non-profit agencies; and
Lending patterns from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) database.

This section analyzes population and housing characteristics to identify the City’s specific housing needs. Programs to address these needs are contained the Housing Element.
A.	Population Characteristics
Population characteristics affect the type and amount of housing need. Population growth, age characteristics, race ethnicity, employment, household income, and other issues influence the type of housing needed and ability to afford housing. This section details the various population characteristics affecting housing needs.
1.	Population Trends
Over the past fifty years, the community of Salinas has undergone extensive change. Once a small agricultural community of 14,000 persons in 1950, Salinas has become the largest city and employment center in Monterey County, with a population of over 140,000 persons. The City’s rapid growth has largely occurred over the last thirty years with population more than doubling from 58,896 residents in 1970 to 143,920 in 2000. As shown in Figure 2-1, the City’s population is expected to continue to grow rapidly. Based on available land designated for residential use and the 2000 Census person per household, the Salinas General Plan projects that population will eventually increase to 212,000. Therefore, adequately planning for housing needs remains an important issue in the community.

2.	Age Characteristics
Among other demographic factors, Salinas housing needs are determined in part by the age composition of residents. As people age, each age group has distinct lifestyles, types of families, income, and resulting housing preferences. Evaluating age characteristics of the population and trends in Salinas thus provides a basis for addressing future housing needs.
In Salinas, younger adults comprise a significant portion of residents (Table 2-1). During the 1990s, adults ages 25-34 and 35-44 increased in number by 1796 and 43% respectively. However, young adults remained approximately the same proportion of the population in 2000 as was the case in 1990. Typically, younger adults (25-34) are entering the job market, and are looking for affordable apartments or smaller homes, while adults ages 35-44 are more setded and may seek move-up housing opportunities for their families.
Middle-aged adults between 45 and 64 are at the peak of their careers, earning higher wages and seeking to purchase higher end, larger single-family homes. From 1990 to 2000, this age group increased by approximately 46%. Adults ages 45 to 54 increased 71% over the decade, the largest percent of all age groups. As a percentage of the population, the 45-54 age bracket increased slightly, while decreased among adults between ages 55 and 64.
Over the 1990s, Salinas’ senior population showed a numerical increase. However, due to their relative size in comparison to other age groups, seniors declined as an overall proportion of the population. Seniors aged 7 5 and older generally need assistance with daily needs, transportation, health care, and accessible housing. Reduced incomes and increasing health care costs also make affordability a key component for senior housing.

3.	Race and Ethnicity
Over the 1990s, Salinas has experienced significant changes in race and ethnicity. Race-ethnic changes often have important implications for housing needs to the extent that different groups have household characteristics and income levels that affect housing needs. Thus, understanding changes in the race-ethnic composition of Salinas residents provides a basis for addressing housing needs.
Over the 1990s, the City’s population growth was largely attributable to a significant increase in Hispanics and decline in Whites. As shown in Table 2-2, Hispanics increased by about 38,700 persons, while Whites declined by 7,600. Asian and African Americans also showed increases, but to a smaller extent. As of 2000, Hispanics comprised the majority of residents, followed by Whites.
The race-ethnic composition of residents differs significantly throughout Salinas. In East Salinas, Hispanics comprise 88% of the population. In North Salinas, Hispanics also comprise the majority (54%), while Whites and Asians comprise large shares, at 29% and 10% respectively. In South Salinas, Whites comprised 46% of the population, followed by Hispanics (45%), and Asians (7%).
Race ethnic composition has an important impact upon the City’s housing need. As discussed later, in Salinas, Hispanics tend to have lower incomes than other race-ethnic groups and have greater household expenses due to a larger average family size. Thus, Hispanics will have more difficulty finding adequately sized and affordable housing and will be at greater risk of overpaying or overcrowding.

4.	Employment Market
The City of Salinas is the largest city and center for employment in Monterey County. With an estimated population of approximately 144,000 and 53,700 jobs (including self-employment), the City supports about one-third of all jobs in the County. Employment has an important impact upon housing needs in a community, because household income determines to a large extent the type and size of residence a household can afford.
Applied Development Economics (ADE) was retained to make employment estimates based on data from the California Employment Development Department (EDD). ADE made further adjustments to EDD data to separate agricultural workers actually employed in Salinas versus those hired by a farm labor contractor operating in Salinas but who work solely in unincorporated areas. Additional adjustments were made to count self-employed persons.
Table 2-3 illustrates the types of jobs in Salinas, by major industry. Business services comprise one-third of all jobs in Salinas. Business services include a large range of industries, including but not limited to: educational services, social services, professional services (engineering, management, accounting, health services legal services, and automotive repair. The wholesale/retail sector is the second largest group, comprising 26% of all jobs. The third sector includes all agricultural related jobs, including manufacturing, and comprises 16% of the City’s economy. ADE also estimated an additional 5,350 jobs in Salinas were held by self-employed persons which do not report to EDD. Taken together, the City’s employment base totaled 53,653 jobs in 2000.

ADE projects that Salinas will receive just over 25% of the countywide employment growth over the next twenty years. This projection is lower than the City’s current share of the County’s job base (33%). The lower projections are a result of significant employment growth projected at Fort Ord, as well as in cities south of Salinas. Under these projections, Salinas would gain 7,500 to 10,700 jobs over the next twenty years. The mix of new jobs would remain similar to today’s mix, with retail/wholesale and manufacturing growing.

Occupations by Income
Although the number of total jobs located in Salinas impacts housing demand, so does the types of occupations held by residents. Occupations have different income levels, which impact the ability of households to afford suitable housing. This section details the types of occupations and average wages associated with each occupation. Later sections of this report detail how household income affects one’s ability to afford housing.
Table 2-4 describes the types of occupations held by residents as well as the likely wages associated with each occupation. The number of occupations includes those working in and outside of Salinas, and thus does match the number of jobs in Salinas shown in Table 2-3. As of 1990, the three largest occupational categories for Salinas residents were ‘administrative support,’ ‘operators/fabricators/labor,’ and ‘farming, fishing and forestry’ (the vast majority of which are agricultural-related occupations). Together, these occupations comprised approximately 46% of all employed residents.
On a periodic basis, the Federal Government surveys various metropolitan areas, including the Salinas metropolitan area, for the average annual earnings of typical occupations. The last survey conducted for the Salinas area, in 2001, showed that the highest paid occupations were managerial and professional, with both earning over $53,000. Technical occupations and skilled production/craft/repair occupations comprised the second tier, exceeding $40,000. Service related jobs and administrative support positions earned $30,000. Lower paying occupations, such as ‘operators/fabricators/laborers,’ earned $20,000 annually. According to a survey of Salinas Valley farm workers, farmworkers earned $12,000.

5.	Household Type and Characteristics
In addition to population characteristics, household characteristics affect the type and quantity of housing needed in Salinas. For instance, different families (e.g., according to type, age, and size) require different types of housing to meet their needs, while a household’s income and assets determine the type of housing that can be afforded.
According to the 2000 Census 38,298, households resided in Salinas, with an average household size of 3.7 persons. As shown in Figure 2-2, families comprised the majority of households, with those divided among families with children (36%) and those without children (21%). Other families comprised 21% and include single-parents with children and other related family members living together. Nonfamily households comprised 22% of households.
Figure 2-2 Household Type
Non	Married
21%
As displayed below in Table 2-5, the City’s
household composition remains largely the same as in 1990, with each household type comprising about the same proportion of total households. However, several notable changes occurred. The number of families, with and without children increased numerically over the decade. As a result, the City showed a significant increase in the average household size.

Household Characteristics
As a large growing community, Salinas has a diversity of household types. Understanding the City’s diversity in households is important because housing needs vary by household type. For example, different sizes, race-ethnicity, and age of a household oftentimes impact the type of housing that can be afforded, the size of the unit, and other housing characteristics.
To provide insight into how housing needs differ among households, Salinas developed a Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) from data in the 1990 Census. As defined in the General Plan Glossary, the CHAS documents the following four groups of households — elderly, small families, large families, and all other families.
Family types were more prevalent among certain race-ethnic groups. For instance, elderly households were disproportionately represented among Whites. According to the 1990 Census, approximately 26% of all White householders were older than 62 years old, a percentage twice as high as other race and ethnic groups. Elderly persons typically have lower incomes and pay a higher share of income toward housing costs.
Hispanics and Asians had the largest average household size (4.4 persons). As a result, 40% of Hispanic and 2 8% of Asian families had five or more members. Larger families also tend to have a higher prevalence of overcrowding and overpayment due to the shortage of adequately sized, affordable housing units. According to the 2000 Census, there are over 11,000 households, approximately 29% of all households, with five or more persons. Table 2-6 below describes the household characteristics of different groups in 1990.

6.	Household Income
Along with housing costs, household income is the most important variable that affects housing opportunity in a community. It determines a family’s ability to balance housing costs with other important living expenses. This section analyzes household income levels by tenure, household type, and race-ethnicity.

In 1990, Salinas households received a median income of $31,271 versus $33,520 for Monterey County as a whole. Salinas was fourth highest among the ten cities. By 2000, Table 2-7, Salinas residents had a median household income of $43,720 compared to a countywide average of $48,305. In comparison with other jurisdictions,
Salinas still had the fourth highest median household income in Monterey County.
The Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG) classifies households into an income distribution based upon income and household size. The income range is determined as a percentage of County median family income
(MFI) for a particular size of household. The four income categories are very low-, low-, moderate-, and above-moderate income. Table 2-8 estimates the number of Salinas households within each income categoiy. AMBAG uses the City’s income distribution as of 1990 to calculate the expected number of households falling in each income group in 2000.

Income Group	Percent of County MFI	Income Range	Percentage of Households	Total Households

Income by Household Type
Although aggregate data on household income is useful for comparing communities, household income can significandy vary by household type, size, and race-ethnicity. Documenting these differences is important because lower income households have a higher prevalence of overcrowding, overpayment, and unmet housing needs. This section uses 1990 Census data since income distribution data is not yet available from the 2000 Census.
Household income varies by the age and size of the household. As shown in Table 2-9, 60% of senior households had low income levels, largely due to the fact that most retired individuals live on fixed income. Approximately 56% of large households fall into low income levels, with 29% of these large families falling within the very low income category. Approximately 40% of small families and all other households also had lower-incomes.
As shown in Table 2-10, the proportion of very low and low income households in Salinas also varies by race and ethicity. A significandy higher proportion of Hispanic (62%) households are lower income compared to other race-ethnic groups. As a result, Hispanics may be more likely to have greater difficulty finding and retaining affordable housing or be at risk of overcrowding and overpaying.

Median household income also varies for different subareas within Salinas. Figure 2-3 illustrates concentrations of lower-income households, defined as areas containing a majority of lower-income households. As illustrated on the following page, the majority of East Salinas is a lower-income concentration area, with areas extending upward to Natividad Road in North Salinas. Portions of South Salinas also contain lower income concentrations, particularly along the southerly side of West Market Street. Figure 2-4 depicts the areas of the City within each City subarea, which is determined by Zip Code Area.

B.	Housing Stock Characteristics
This section of the Housing Element addresses various housing characteristics and conditions that affect the well being of Salinas residents. Factors evaluated in this section include the following: housing stock characteristics, tenure and vacancy rates, housing age and condition, housing costs and affordability among others.
1.	Housing Stock
According to the Census, Salinas’ housing stock increased by 13% over the past decade, from 34,577 units in 1990 to 39,659 units on April 1, 2000. As shown in Table 2-11, single-family homes were responsible for the majority of housing production, increasing by 22%. Multifamily units increased by 7% with much of the construction occurring among multi-family units of five or more units. The number and proportion of all other units (includes mobile homes, vans, trailers, etc.) declined over the 1990s.

The housing stock differs by subarea of Salinas. As shown in Figure 2-5, North and South Salinas have the highest proportions of single-family units (58% and 63% respectively) and almost identical proportions of multi-family units (36% and 35%). East Salinas has the lowest proportion of single-family homes (52%) and highest proportion of multi-family units (43%). Though not a large number, mobile homes and other units are more concentrated in North and East Salinas than in South Salinas.

2.	Housing Tenure and Vacancy
Housing tenure and vacancy rates are important indicators of the supply and cost of housing. Housing tenure refers to whether a unit is owned or rented. Vacancies are also an important housing market indicator in that the vacancy rate influences the cost of housing and reflects the match between housing demand and availability.
Table 2-12 illustrates homeownership and vacancy rates for housing in Salinas. The homeownership rate increased from 46% in 1990 to 50% in 2000. The increase in homeownership is largely attributable to the large subdivisions of single-family homes in the 1990s and the result of prior General Plan policies calling for 65% single-family development in these areas. This trend is clearly reflected in rising homeownership rates in North and East Salinas. Meanwhile homeownership rates remained relatively stable in South Salinas.
Table 2-13 summarizes vacancies by subarea of Salinas. Vacancy rates have fallen among homeowners, dropping from 2.0% in 1990 to only 1.0% in 2000. All areas of Salinas showed the same trend. Meanwhile, rental vacancy rates have had mixed trends. In North and South Salinas, vacancy rates have also fallen. The only exception is East Salinas, were the rental vacancy rate doubled. The increase could have been due to the recent completion of a large apartment complex which temporarily skewed the results.

Source: U.S. Census 1990-2000.
A certain number of vacant units are
needed to moderate the cost of housing, allow sufficient choice for residents, and provide an incentive for unit upkeep and repair. A vacancy rate of 5 to 6% for rental housing and 1.5% to 2% for ownership housing is considered to balance the demand and supply for housing. Over the past decade, the vacancy rate has continued to decline to below optimal levels, suggesting pent up demand for housing as well as price escalation among available units.

3.	Housing Age and Condition
Maintaining the quality of housing in a community is an important goal for Salinas. Like any other asset, housing is subject to a gradual deterioration over time. If not repaired or maintained, housing deterioration can depress neighboring property values, discourage reinvestment, and eventually impact the quality of life of a neighborhood. Therefore, maintaining and improving the quality of housing stock is an important goal for the Salinas.
As a result of rapid housing growth in recent years, Salinas’ housing stock is relatively newer. The median age is only 30 years. As indicated in Table 2-14, Salinas’s housing stock has the following age distribution: 56% of the homes are generally newer and less than 30 years old; 29% of the homes are between 30 to SO years old; and 15% are older than 50 years old. The latter category generally requires the highest level of maintenance and rehabilitation to maintain the usefulness and quality of the home.
Although housing age does not necessarily determine whether a home is in need of rehabilitation, most of the dilapidated housing will also be older. As shown in Table 2-15, East and South Salinas have the largest number of units older than 50 years. The Census Bureau provides limited estimates of substandard housing, such as incomplete plumbing and kitchen, no sewage or heating. East Salinas appears to have the most units with indicators of substandard housing.

The City of Salinas has a code enforcement program that, upon complaint, addresses substandard housing conditions in the community. For properties found in substandard condition, the City’s Housing Services Program offers low-interest loans or grants to low-income property owners and landlords renting to low income tenants, as a means to help bring dilapidated properties up to current local housing codes.

4.	Housing Prices and Affordability
Over the past decade, with its strategic location, Salinas has emerged as a housing market for Silicon Valley and Santa Cruz County. This has resulted in lower vacancy rates in the community, increased demand for housing, and additional construction of new housing. Housing construction has generally not kept pace with demand, resulting in price escalation. Figure 2-6 displays housing sales prices and rents in different subareas of Salinas.
Home Prices
Over the past several years, the Salinas Valley has experienced a significant escalation in housing prices, both in sales and rents. Updated information from the California Association of Realtors (CAR) shows that the median sales price of a home was $232,000 in 2001, representing a 38% increase from the median sales price of $167,500 in 1997. CAR does not track similar data for rental housing, although a significant increase was also evident.
Table 2-16 shows the range in median home prices sold in Salinas during the year of 2001. The median sales price ranges by subarea depending upon the number of bedrooms and quality of amenities. The median price of a single-family home ranges from $173,000 in East Salinas to $208,000 in North Salinas, to $298,500 in South Salinas. In contrast, the median price of condominiums showed less variation, ranging from $115,500 to $128,000.

Rental Prices
According to rental information documented in the 1991 Salinas Housing Element, advertised apartment rents ranged in average of $417 for studio units to $705 for a three-bedroom apartment. The price for an apartment also ranged considerably by region, with rental prices generally lower in east Salinas ($525 for a two bedroom unit), followed by $582 for a similar apartment unit in north Salinas, and highest at $613 in South Salinas.
During November 2001, an updated rental survey of advertised apartment rents was compiled over a two-week period from internet and newspaper sources (Table 2-17). As shown below, median apartment rents in North Salinas ranged from $714 for a one-bedroom unit to $900 for a three-bedroom unit. However, a number of newer high end apartments have been recently constructed, resulting in the higher range of rents. In East Salinas, rents ranged from $630 to $987 for similarly sized units. In South Salinas, rents ranged from $675 to $1,100 for a one and three-bedroom unit, respectively. In similar locations, single-family houses and condominiums generally command higher rents.

Although a number of apartment buildings have been constructed in recent years, the rental vacancy rate is still well below the optimum rate of 5% to 6% considered necessary to avoid price escalation. Moreover, given the increasing price of new housing, new homebuyers will be more likely to be priced out of the market, placing increasing competition for existing rental units. Therefore, additional rent increases are foreseen.

5.	Housing Affordability
Housing affordability can be determined by comparing the sales prices and rents for housing in Salinas versus the amount of income available for households with different incomes. The Department of Housing and Urban Development conducts annual household income surveys for the Monterey County metropolitan area to determine the maximum amount that a household could pay for housing (using the 30% guideline). This information can show whether a household in a particular income group can afford to rent or own housing, those who would likely experience overcrowding or overpayment, and those eligible for assistance.
Table 2-18, Housing Affordability, depicts the maximum annual income for three household categories: very low, low and moderate-income. Assuming a standard of 30% of gross income as the amount any household should apply toward housing expenses, the table shows the highest monthly rent and the maximum purchase price for an individual or family at the top end of the three income categories. The illustration is further refined by including three household sizes within each income categoxy: 1 person, 3 person, and 5 person household. For renters, housing cost is defined as rent and utilities. For purchasers, housing cost includes mortgage, utilities, property tax, insurance, and homeowners association fees as applicable. It is important to note that this illustration is based on a household at the top of each income range (e.g., a moderate income small family could have an annual income as low as $38,000 but, the example is based on the same family with a $56,800 income). Therefore, it would be inaccurate to infer that any household within the range could afford to pay what the table shows for a similarly sized household at the top of the income range.
Based on the table, the following discusses purchase prices and rents and the affordability of the two housing options for very low, low, and moderate income households:
^Veiy Low Income Households Very low income households have incomes that do not exceed 50% of the area median income, as adjusted for family size. The maximum affordable home price for a very low income household ranges from $32,000 to $39,000, well below not only the median home price, but the price of any home on recent listings. During 2001, the average monthly apartment rent in Salinas was $550 for a studio, $625 to 725 for a one bedroom unit, $725 to 835 for a two bedroom, and considerably higher for a three bedroom. Therefore, in practical terms, a one person household could not afford to rent a studio and a small or large family (even at the top of the income range) could not afford an adequately sized apartment without some level of overpayment.
s"Low Income Households In Salinas, lower income households have incomes ranging from 51% to 80% of the area median income, as adjusted for family size. A single person household, for example, falls into this category if their annual income is between $18,400 and $29,450. The maximum purchase price, assuming a 10 percent downpayment, ranges from $74,000 for a one person household up to $ 104,000 for a five person family.

City of Salinas
General Plan
2-18
Appendix B: Housing Element Technical Appendix
Given current sales prices, low income households could not afford to buy a single family home. A few condominiums fall into the upper end of the range, but they may not be adequately sized for larger families. For rentals, a low income household could afford to pay rent from $686 up to $986 per month, depending upon household size. Thus, both a single person household and small family could afford an adequately-sized apartment. A large family could also afford an apartment, but would have difficulty finding one given the relative shortage of larger units. Consequently a large family may resort to renting a single family house and this option might exceed the 30% ratio as houses may cost more than apartments.
^Moderate Income Households Moderate income households have incomes equivalent to 80% up to 120% of median area income. The table shows that the maximum affordable house price for a moderate income first time homebuyer household ranges from $129,000 to $190,000. (The illustration does not apply to those with equity from an existing house, or with a sizable amount of other assets). Because the median price of an existing single family dwelling ranged from $173,000 to $298,500, the moderate income household could likely afford a limited number of single family houses. Condominiums, therefore, are a more affordable option. The moderate income household could also afford the full range of rental products in Salinas. As is the case with each of the three income categories depicted in Table 2-17, a moderate income household that is closer to the lower end of the range ($48,000 for a family of five, for example) has more limited housing options.

6.	Housing Problems
A continuing priority of many communities is enhancing or maintaining their quality of life. A key measure of quality of life in a community is the extent of “housing problems”. These include housing overcrowding (defined as more than one person per habitable room) and overpayment (defined as paying more than 30% of income toward housing costs). This section describes and Figure 2-7 illustrates housing problems in Salinas.
Overcrowding
Figure 2-8 compares overcrowding rates for Salinas and Monterey County by tenure. As displayed, overcrowding affected 29% of all renter households in Salinas compared to 11% of owner households. Overcrowding rates in Salinas were higher in comparison to Monterey County as a whole, where 21% of renters and 8% of owners lived overcrowded housing conditions.
Figure 2-8: Overcrowding Rate
in
In Salinas, overcrowding tends to be more concentrated among minorities, lower income
households, and renter households. For instance, overcrowding was highest in East Salinas, affecting 57% of renters and 31% of owners. Meanwhile, renter overcrowding in North and South Salinas was 16%, while owner overcrowding ranged from 10% to 5% respectively. Overcrowding rates also varied by income, type, and size of household. As shown in Table 2-19, lower income households had the highest overcrowding at 31%. Renter overcrowding was also high — almost twice that of owners due to their comparatively lower incomes. Regardless of income level or tenure, overcrowding was concentrated in large families; almost 80% of renters and 20% of homeowners lived in overcrowded conditions.

Overpayment
As in other communities in California, housing overpayment is not uncommon in Salinas. Housing overpayment is generally defined as paying more than 30% of income toward housing expenses. However, to the extent that overpayment is disproportionately concentrated among the most vulnerable members of Salinas, maintaining a reasonable level of housing cost burden is an important contributor to quality of life.
Figure 2-9 compares the prevalence of housing overpayment in Salinas to Monterey County as a whole. Similar to overcrowding, the rate of overpayment varied among tenure. Among Salinas renter households 43% were paying more than they could afford for housing, compared to 27% of owners. The overpayment rates for the City were similar to those in Monterey County, where 39% of renters and 29% of owners also overpaid for housing.
Figure 2-9: Overpayment Rate
Housing overpayment rates for owner and
renter housing in Salinas were fairly consistent throughout all subareas in Salinas. Housing overpayment for owners ranged from 26% to 28%, with little to no differentiation between North, South and East Salinas. However, renter overpayment was higher in East Salinas at 51%, compared to renter overpayment in North (40%) and South Salinas (45%). As displayed in Table 2-20, housing overpayment was particularly prevalent among lower income households. A total of 60% of lower income households were overpaying for housing. Overpayment among homeowners was 28% versus 43% for renters. Due to their limited income levels and higher associated health care costs, senior renter households were the most impacted by housing costs, with 66% of elderly renters overpaying for housing.

C.	Special Needs Groups
Certain groups in Salinas have greater difficulty finding decent, affordable housing due to special circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to one’s age, family characteristics, disability, or employment among others. Thus, certain segments of Salinas’ population may experience a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, or other housing problem.
State Housing Element law defines the following groups as having special housing needs: senior households, disabled persons, larger households, single parent families with children, homeless people, and farmworkers. In recognition that people in different walks of life have different housing needs, State and federal housing laws are designed to encourage the provision of a full continuum of housing so that no group is excluded from living in Salinas because of their special need status.
Table 2-21 summarizes the type and magnitude of special needs groups residing in the City. Where available, data from the 1990 and 2000 II.S. Census is used. However, in other cases, estimates were derived from other governmental agencies or reliable survey sources. This section also contains a detailed discussion of the housing needs facing each particular group as well as city programs and services available to address their housing needs.

Senior Citizens
Despite high levels of homeownership, senior citizens are considered a special needs group, because limited income, health care costs, and disabilities may make suitable housing more difficult to afford. The City of Salinas was home to 10,673 seniors or 5,973 households as of the 2000 Census. Of that total, 4,208 of senior households own homes, and 1,765 rent.
Seniors are considered to have special housing needs due to the following:
>	Disabilities. A significant portion of seniors (30%) have a self-care or mobility limitations, defined as a condition lasting over six months which makes it difficult to go outside the home alone or take care of one’s personal needs.
>	Limited Income. Because of their retired status and fixed income, about 60% of senior households earn lower income — placing a significant limitation on their ability to purchase other necessities of life, in particular medical care.
>	Overpayment. Because of the limited supply of affordable housing, about 30% of senior households overpay for housing. The prevalence of overpayment varies greatly according to tenure: 7% of homeowners and 65% of renters overpay for housing.
Various programs can assist seniors with their housing needs, including: congregate care, shared housing, rental subsidies, and housing rehabilitation assistance. For the frail elderly, or those with disabilities, housing with architectural features that accommodate disabilities can help ensure continued independent living. Elderly with disabilities also benefit from transportation alternatives or assisted housing with supportive services.
To help meet the housing needs of senior households, the City of Salinas Recreation and Parks Department offers a variety of programs and supportive services, including recreation classes, information programs, health and legal counseling, and a food bag program. For property owners that require financial assistance in removing architectural barriers and improving accessibility within their home, the City offers Housing Accessibility Assistance Grants that provide up to $7,500 for qualifying lower-income households.
According to the State Department of Social Services, 25 licensed care facilities for seniors are located in Salinas. Larger facilities include Villa Serra (225 beds), Alterra Wynwood of Harden Ranch (83 beds), and Colonial Manor (40 beds). For senior residents living independently, Parkside Manor provides 80 units for senior residents. Regency Court Senior Apartments and the recently completed Salinas Senior Apartments in the Williams Ranch provide an additional 250 units of subsidized, affordable housing. Steinback Commons is a senior housing complex that offers rental assistance through HUD’s Section 8 program.

Disabled Persons
The American with Disabilities Act defines a disabled person as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Disabled persons have special needs in that many earn very low incomes, have higher health care costs, and are often dependent on supportive services. As a result, disabled persons are considered to be a special needs group in Salinas. According to the 2000 Census, the City has an estimated 29,239 persons living with a range of disabilities.
Living arrangements for disabled persons depend on the severity of the disability. Many disabled persons live at home in an independent fashion or with family members. To maintain independent living, disabled persons may need housing assistance or supportive services. Services can include modifying housing design features, providing income support for those not able to work, and in-home services for persons with medical conditions. Services can be provided by public or private agencies.
Salinas assists many disabled residents to live in independent settings. Of the 2,005 Salinas households that receive Section 8 vouchers, the County assists 773 households with a disabled member. For persons unable to live in an independent or semi-independent setting, Salinas complies with the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act by allowing licensed community care facilities by right in all residential zones. Salinas has a total of 58 licensed community care facilities serving almost 900 persons (Table 2-22).

Large Households
The Federal Government defines large households as those having five or more members. Large households are considered a special needs group in most communities because of the lack of affordable housing that can adequately accommodate large families. For lower-income large families, the housing shortage can be particularly acute and result in a greater prevalence and severity of overcrowding and overpayment.
The 1990 Census reported that Salinas had 7,276 large households, almost 22% of all households in the City. The total number of large households increased to over 11,000 in 2000, comprising approximately 29% of the total households. In the absence of complete 2000 Census data, 1990 Census indicate the housing needs of large families.
>	Limited Income. Approximately 56% of large families in Salinas had low incomes as of the 1990 Census. Of the 7,276 large family households in Salinas according to the 1990 Census, approximately 71% of large family renters and 34% of large family homeowners were considered low income.
>	Housing Shortage. The 1990 Census reported that Salinas had 2,107 large single-family homes with four or more bedrooms that could accommodate the City’s 2,809 large owner households. However, only 405 large rentals with three or more bedrooms were available to accommodate 4,265 large renter families.
>	Housing Problems. Because of a shortage of affordable ownership housing that is suitable for large families, 33% of large family homeowners overpaid for housing and 49% lived in overcrowded conditions in 1990. Among large renter households, 41% overpaid and 77% lived in overcrowded housing.
As shown earlier in Section A, subsection 6, the race and ethnic background of households is correlated with family size. For instance, the proportion of large families is greatest among Hispanics and Asians. Approximately 40% of all Hispanic households have five or more members, while approximately 28% of all Asian households have five or more members. Among Whites and Blacks, approximately 8% and 17% of their households are large families.
To address the issue of a lack of affordable housing, the Salinas Zoning Code requires 12% of all units in complexes larger than 9 units to be affordable to lower-income households. In addition to an affordability requirement, 20% of those units must have three bedrooms and 10% of the units must have four or more bedrooms. For those requiring rental assistance, the County also allocates a portion of Section 8 vouchers to very low income large families.

Single Parents
Single parents often require special consideration or assistance as a result of their lower income, high costs of childcare, need for supportive services and affordable housing. As a result, many single-parent families are faced with limited housing choices. In addition, single-parent families also tend to experience a higher level of discrimination in the rental housing market. Thus single parent families are considered to be a special need group.
Over the past decade, the number of single parents with dependent children under age 18 increased from 4,563 households in 1990 to 4,905 households in 2000. Among these single-parent households, 3,686 or 7596 of these households were headed by females. Single parents with children typically face the following issues:
>	Limited Income. Single parents with children, in particular female-headed families, earn significantly lower incomes. According to the 1990 Census, the federally defined poverty rate was 41% for female-headed families with children under age 18 versus only 3% for all other families.
>	Childcare Costs. According to the Census Bureau, single working parents with children pay approximately 12% of their income on preschool childcare; those earning less than $15,000 spend up to 25% of their income. Thus, additional income derived from work must be out for child care.
>	Housing Shortage. There is a significant shortage of adequately sized affordable housing. Although useful and reliable statistics from the 2000 Census are not available at this time, it is reasonable to assume that single parents pay a larger share of their income for housing.
Another group of single-parents with children not often “counted” as such is subfamilies. A subfamily is a married couple or a single-parent, either with or without children, who live with another family and are related to the householder or spouse of that family. According to the 1990 Census, Salinas had 1,478 single-parent subfamilies with children. No comparable data has yet been provided by the 2000 Census. Nonetheless, subfamilies are also considered to be in nearly the same position as single-parent households.
Salinas supports single-parent families by facilitating the provision of affordable childcare and housing. To help meet this need, the Childcare Capacity Building Collaborative, consisting of 28 agencies including the City of Salinas Community Development Department, was successful in creating over 900 new licensed family and center-based spaces in East Salinas. In 2000, the City provided financial assistance for the development of Del Monte Place, an affordable infill project with on-site childcare. The City also assisted Children’s Services International in acquiring the Mountain Valley Family and Child Development Center site.

Homelessness
An accurate assessment of the homeless population is difficult because of the transient nature of the population, and because many individuals are not visibly homeless but move around in temporary living conditions. In 1999, the Monterey County Homeless Census and Needs Assessment Survey was conducted to document the needs of County’s homeless population. The study indicated that there were 2,960 homeless men, women, and children within the County on any given night, of which 266 were counted as living in Salinas.
To ascertain the needs of the homeless population, more quantitative information was obtained through survey and interviews of homeless individuals. The study interviewed over 500 homeless individuals throughout the County and of these, approximately 150 individuals were located in Salinas. Results confirmed the following:
>	More shelter use occurred in Salinas; 3 8% of respondents used shelter in Salinas compared to 996 of homeless on the Peninsula.
>	Approximately 6696 of Salinas' respondents relied on mission/shelter/church assistance compared to 4796 of Peninsula respondents.
>	More long-term homeless persons (homeless for two to ten years) lived on the Peninsula (3 596) compared to 2596 of respondents in Salinas.
There are generally three types of facilities that provide shelter for homeless individuals and families: emergency shelters, transitional housing, and permanent housing. All three types of facilities are described below and currently available in Salinas, as illustrated in Table 2-23.
>	Emergency Shelter: provides overnight shelter and fulfills a client’s basic needs (i.e. food, clothing, medical care) either on-site or through off-site services.
>	Transitional Housing: a residence that provides housing for up to two years. Residents of transitional housing are usually connected to rehabilitative services.
>	Permanent Housing: refers to housing that is affordable, service-enriched, and allows formerly homeless clients to live at the facility on an indefinite basis.
In addition to providing shelter, Salinas works with non-profit agencies and provides financial assistance from CDBG, HOME, Redevelopment Set-aside, and other resources. The SRA provided land acquisition services and funds to assist in the development of Dorothy’s Hospitality Center, a comprehensive center that provides health services and job placement to the homeless. The City also works through the formed Local Homeless Assistance Committee (LHAC). Table 2-22 lists homeless assistance providers in Salinas.

Farm Labor
Monterey County is known for some of the most fertile soils and favorable microclimate throughout the world. This has resulted in a booming agricultural industry. According to the Monterey County Agricultural Commissioner, total crop production was valued at $2.9 billion in 2000. In recent years, Monterey County has experienced an increase in organic farming and vineyards that have brought additional acreage into farmland production. The size of the agricultural industry to Monterey County is reflected in a sizable farm labor force.
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farm laborers work in the fields, processing plants, or support activities on a year-round basis. When workloads increase during harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal labor, often supplied by a labor contractor. For some crops, farms may hire migrant workers, defined as those whose travel prevents them from returning to their primary residence every evening.
In addressing the housing needs of farm workers, it is important to determine the size of the workforce as well as their characteristics (e.g., income, household characteristics, mobility, education etc). However, governmental agencies who estimate employment characteristics for the agricultural sector often use different definitions for terms and conditions:
>	Farm labor (e.g., field work, processing plants, transportation, etc.)
>	Seasonality of agricultural work (e.g., permanent, seasonal and migrant workers)
>	Place of work (e.g., location of the business versus the actual field)
>	Significant under-reported employment, particularly among illegal immigrants
>	Multiple locations of employment throughout the County
These differences in methodologies result in significantly disparate estimates of the number of farm workers. According to the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, 68,800 seasonal and migrant farmworkers worked in Monterey County.1 In contrast, mid-range estimates provided by other governmental agencies include 35,500 jobs (Employment Development Department2) and 32,300 workers (1997 Census of Agriculture3).
Within Salinas, however, the 1990 Census4 reported that only 7,429 residents of Salinas were employed in farming, fishing and forestry occupations. By 2000, the number of residents employed in those occupations had increased slightly to 8,178. On the higher end, the Employment Development Department estimated 19,100 agricultural jobs were

reported in zip codes that include Salinas. However, Applied Development Economics5 found that only a small portion (2,967 jobs) of the agricultural jobs reported by EDD were located within incorporated Salinas. Therefore, it appears that Salinas may have more farmworkers living within the community than actually working in the City.
Although there is little consensus on the number of farmworkers working or living in Salinas, farmworkers are considered a special need group due to the following6:
>	Limited Income. Farmworkers surveyed earned a combined $12,825 annually, which is the lowest family income of any occupation.
>	Housing Problems. Approximately 35% of Salinas Valley farmworkers severely overpaid for housing and 68% lived in severely overcrowded conditions.
>	Substandard Conditions. A significant portion of farmworkers lived in housing with multiple indicators of substandard living conditions.
Another component that affects the housing needs of farmworkers is the nature of work. For instance, farmworkers employed year round or on a seasonal basis often need permanent affordable housing much like other persons who are employed in low paying occupations. However, the large size of farm worker households means that the housing must be adequately sized. Migrant labor presents different issues, because they work on a temporary basis in various locations throughout the County. Migrant farm laborers typically require affordable group housing settings where they can stay on a seasonal or temporary basis.
The City has an aggressive program to address the housing needs of permanent and migrant farm workers in both ownership and rental housing products. The following programs are examples of how Salinas assists in meeting the needs of farmworkers:
>	The Zoning Code and General Plan require that a minimum percentage of affordable units in residential developments have 3 and 4 bedrooms to serve large families.
>	The City has assisted in developing of affordable housing for farm worker housing through grants, loans, donation of land, downpayment assistance, and other means. Examples include the development of 42-bed migrant facility on Sun Street.
>	The City permits labor camps serving six or fewer persons in multi-family residential zones by right; and permits labor camps pursuant to a CUP in the following designated zones: A, RH2.3, RH-3.6, RH 1.9, CO/R, CO, CR, CD, and CAF.
>	Active involvement with various groups providing affordable farmworker housing (e.g., CHISPA, USDA, and Monterey County Housing Authority).

D.	Preservation of At-Risk Rental Housing
Housing units developed with public subsidies are an important source of affordable housing to lower income households. Preserving the long-term affordability of such housing units is usually the most cost-effective means to providing decent and affordable housing to the lower income households in a community. Recognizing this important resource, State housing element law requires that a jurisdiction examine the potential loss of publicly subsidized multi-family rental housing for lower income households due to expiration of deed restrictions, affordability covenants, and/or subsidy contracts.
This section evaluates the publicly assisted multi-family rental housing in Salinas that is at risk of converting to market-rate housing and the cost to preserve or replace the at-risk units. Resources and programs for preservation or replacement are discussed in later sections.
?. Assisted Housing Inventory
Salinas has a large inventory of publicly assisted multi-family rental housing. Table 2-24 provides a summary of the inventory by type and ownership. Appendix A to this Housing Element Technical Appendix contains a detailed listing of the individual projects.

2. Potential Loss of Assisted Housing Units
Over time, rent-restricted units can lose their affordability controls and revert to non-low-income uses. For instance, projects are typically considered at risk due to: 1) the prepayment of HUD- or FHA-insured mortgage loans and opting out of affordability controls; 2) expiration of Section 8 or other subsidy contracts; and 3) expiration of deed-restrictions placed on inclusionary units or mortgage revenue bonds. The City must evaluate the potential loss of assisted rental housing over a ten-year planning period, from July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2012. Table 2-25 lists the housing projects that may be at risk of converting to market-rate housing or losing their subsidies within this planning period.

Among the 2,488 assisted housing units in the City, the 629 units in 23 developments owned and operated by the Housing Authority of the County of Monterey are at no to low risk of converting to non-low income uses. The Housing Authority’s mandate is to provide permanent affordable housing to very low-income households. The long-term affordability of these units is assured.
Five farmworker housing projects in the City provide affordable housing opportunities to 182 farmworker households. All five developments are recent projects, not eligible for conversion to non-low income uses in the near future. In addition, most farmworker housing programs have strict prepayment/conversion requirements and require the owner prove that the affordable housing provided by the project is not needed. Discussions with Farmworker Housing Administration/Rural Housing Services representatives indicate that few farmworker housing projects in the nation have ever been able to document that affordable farmworker housing is no longer needed. Also, additional incentives are often offered to owners to encourage the continued affordability of these units. Thus, the five farmworker housing developments in Salinas are not considered at risk of conversion.
Twenty projects provide affordable housing opportunities to lower income families, ten such projects are at risk of converting to non-low income uses or losing their subsidies for a variety of reasons. Three of the four senior housing projects were developed with low income housing tax credits, requiring long-term affordability controls. These projects are not at risk of converting to market rate housing in the near future. The other senior project was financed with a mortgage revenue bond and is owned by a nonprofit organization. Expiration of mortgage restriction in 2005 will not affect the low-income use of the project.
Five housing projects provide affordable housing opportunities to 79 households with disabled members. Three projects were built with special funding sources that require long term affordability. Casentini Apartments, a nonprofit-owned Section 811 project has a Section 8 contract set to expire within the planning period. The other project is Catalyst Apartments, a 17-unit project serving very low income persons with disabilities. Built under HUD’s Section 202 program, it is a joint project between a nonprofit and the Housing Authority. The Catalyst Section 8 contract with HUD is due to expire in January 2009.

3. Preservation and Replacement Options
Preservation or replacement of at-risk units in Salinas can be achieved in several ways:
Transfer of ownership to nonprofit organizations Provision of rental assistance Replacement or development of new units Purchase of affordability covenants Refinance of mortgage revenue bonds
Transfer of Ownership
Transferring ownership of at-risk projects to nonprofit organizations has several benefits: (1) affordability controls can be secured indefinitely and (2) the project would be eligible for a range of government assistance. This option is only applicable to the seven privately owned family housing projects. As shown in Table 2-26, the estimated market value for the 291 family units in for-profit housing is $19.6 million based on typical assumptions for average market rent and operating costs. These estimates are intended to demonstrate the magnitude of costs relative to other preservation and replacement options; actual market values will depend on the building and market conditions at the time of appraisal.

Rental Assistance
Should at-risk projects convert to market-rate housing or lose their Section 8 subsidies, rental assistance using other funding sources may help maintain unit affordability. The feasibility of this option depends on the willingness of property owners to accept rental assistance and the availability of funds for rental assistance. Nonprofit owners are most likely to be willing to accept rent subsidies, while for-profit owners will evaluate how comparable the rent subsidies are to market rents. Table 2-27 presents a simplified analysis of rent subsidies required.
Table 2-27
Estimated Rent Subsidies
Very Low Income 4-Person Household Income	$26,300
Monthly Affordable Housing Cost	$658
Monthly Affordable Housing Cost (less utilities)	$558
Fair Market Rent for 2-Bed Unit	$800
Per Unit Subsidy	$242
Total Number of At-Risk Units	502
Monthly Subsidies Required	$121,484
Annual Subsidies Required	$1,457,808
For certain Section 8-assisted projects, HUD offers the Mark-to-Market or Mark-up-to-Market program as a preservation option. If current contract rents exceed the FMR, HUD gives favorable tax treatment to property owners provided that the rents are marked down to comparable Fair Market Rents (FMR) and units are preserved as affordable housing for very low-income households (Mark-to-Market). For units renting below FMR, HUD encourages the for-profit owners to remain in the Section 8 program by allowing rents to be marked up to comparable market rents, not exceeding 150% of the FMR (Mark-up-to-Market). Lincmar is eligible to participate in the Mark-to-Market or Mark-up-to-Market program.
Purchase of Affordability Covenant
Another option to preserve the affordability of at-risk projects is to provide an incentive package to the owners eligible to opt out of affordability control to maintain the projects as low-income housing. This option is applicable only to the for-profit owned family housing projects identified in Table 2-24. Incentives could include writing down the interest rate on the remaining loan balance (refinancing), providing new loans or grants for rehabilitation works, and/or supplementing the Section 8 subsidy received to market levels. The feasibility of this option depends on whether the units require rehabilitation or are too highly leveraged. By providing lump-sum financial incentives, on-going subsidies in rents, or reduced mortgage interest rates, the City can ensure that some units remain affordable.

City of Salinas
General Plan
2-36
Appendix B: Housing Element Technical Appendix
Construction of Replacement Units
The construction of new low-income housing units is a means to replace at-risk units should they be converted to market rate housing. This option is applicable only to for-profit owned projects. The mission of most non-profit organizations is to maintain the units as affordable housing as funding permits; the most cost-effective mechanism is to preserve the non-profit owned units as affordable housing rather than to replace with new units.
The cost of developing housing depends upon density, size of the units, location, land costs, and type of construction. As later discussed in Section 3, Housing Constraints of this Technical Appendix, the cost to construct good quality multi-family housing is $80 per square foot and the land cost is between $11,000 and $15,000 per unit. Typically, construction cost makes up approximately 50 to 60% of the total development costs. Assuming an average unit size of 750 square feet, an average per-unit land cost of $13,000, and an additional 40% cost factor for predevelopment and soft costs (e.g. architectural and engineering fees), the development cost of a multi-family unit in Salinas is approximately $102,200. The cost to replace the 291 for-profit owned units is estimated at approximately $29.7 million.
Comparison of Options
Different housing projects have different preservation/replacement options. For non-profit owned projects not eligible to opt out of low-income use restrictions, continuing the rent subsidies is possibly the only option available and needed to maintain the affordability of the units.
For for-profit owned projects, transfer of ownership, purchase of affordability covenants, and construction of replacement units are all available options. Typically, preservation of existing units is less costly than building new units. An additional factor affecting feasibility is the relative availability of funding for the various options.

3.	Housing Constraints
The provision of decent, suitable, and affordable housing for all economic levels of residents is an important goal for Salinas. As demonstrated in Chapter 2, the City has a variety of housing needs related to the availability, affordability, and adequacy of housing. At the same time, various nongovernmental factors, governmental regulations, and environmental issues may hinder addressing housing needs. This section discusses these potential constraints.
A.	Nongovernmental Constraints
Nongovernmental constraints refer to market factors that impact the maintenance, development, and improvement of affordable housing. Although every community is impacted to varying degrees by market constraints, the City of Salinas has instituted policies and programs to offset the impact of market forces and conserve and expand the availability of safe, decent, and affordable housing opportunities.
1.	Market Demand
Salinas is located near scenic Monterey Bay and the Silicon Valley, which contributes to a high demand for housing. Although housing production has been active for the last five years, production has not kept pace with the effects of population and employment growth in the Salinas Valley, Silicon Valley, and Monterey Peninsula. As a result, this pent up demand continues to make the region one of the more expensive housing markets in California.
Salinas’ housing demand is evidenced, to some extent, by an overall low vacancy rate. The 2000 Census indicates that the vacancy rate in Salinas was 1.0% for homeowners and 3.8% for renters. These vacancy rates are below optimal industry standard vacancy rates (e.g., 1.5-2.0% for single-family homes and 5-6% for rentals) which are widely recognized as the optimal vacancy rates for moderating housing price and ensuring adequate mobility.
The City’s low vacancy rates and desirable living environment have contributed to escalating housing prices. According to the California Association of Realtors, the median price of a single-family home has increased nearly 40% since 1997 — nearly three times the rate of inflation. Rental rates for apartments have also increased in recent years, although at a slower rate. Housing prices have not stabilized and continue to increase.
To help alleviate potential market constraints, the City’s inclusionary housing program mandates that 12% of all new projects of 10 units or more be affordable to lower income households. In addition, the City offers financial and regulatory incentives to facilitate and encourage the development of affordable housing as described later in this section.

Appendix B: Housing Element Technical Appendix
2.	Development Costs and Financing
Development costs include the whole range of costs incurred in the construction, maintenance, and improvement of housing. This includes construction materials, land costs, and other associated costs. The cost and availability of financing also affects the financial feasibility of a project and the ability of homeowners to purchase or improve their housing. This section details the impact of development cost and financing upon housing.
Construction Costs
Construction costs vary widely according to the type of development, with multi-family housing being generally less expensive to construct per unit than single-family housing. However, within each type of development, construction costs vary significantly, depending on the size of the unit and the number and quality of amenities that are offered. Amenities include such items as fireplaces, swimming pools, tennis courts, grade of carpeting and tile used, types of appliances and light fixtures, and the quality of the cabinetry and woodwork.
In lieu of local estimates of construction costs, the International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) established the average cost of labor and materials for a typical Type V wood frame housing. In 2001, these cost estimates were based on “good” quality construction, providing materials and fixtures well above the minimum required by state and local building codes. The average per square foot cost for “good” quality housing was approximately $80 for multi-family housing and $90 for single-family homes.
Land Costs
The cost of raw land typically accounts for a large share of total housing production costs as well as the necessary improvements that must be made to a particular site. The diminishing supply of residential land combined with a fairly high demand for housing have kept land cost relatively high in Monterey County. Land costs for residential zoned properties typically range from $125,000 to $200,000 an acre in the Salinas area. Properties zoned for commercial uses range from $40,000 to $85,000 an acre, depending on location.
Land prices range widely due to the fact that some residential properties in the City’s recent growth areas (Harden Ranch, Creekbridge, and Williams Ranch) have been held by property owners for a long period of time, while other infill sites have recently transferred ownership, gaining higher prices. Multi-family land values range from $11,000 to $15,000 per unit. A recent example is the Nantucket Bay Apartment project. The developers paid $2,270,000 for the 10.8 net acre site, equating to $ 14,187 per unit or $4.83 per square foot.

Appendix B: Housing Element Technical Appendix
Construction Financing
Prior to the recession, and significant changes in lending practices following the savings and loan scandal of the late 1980s, developers could receive loans for 100% or more of a project’s estimated future value. Now, construction and permanent loans are almost never available for over 75% of the future project value for multi-family developments. This means that developers must usually put up at least 25% of the project value, and perhaps more if the total cost is more than 75% of the estimated future value of the project.
The financing of a residential project, particularly affordable housing is quite complex. No firm threshold determines an acceptable “return” on investment, nor the maximum equity contribution at which an otherwise feasible project becomes infeasible. Upfront cash commitment may not even be problematic for some developers as long as the project can generate an acceptable net cash flow to meet the acceptable returns. Although financing costs impact project feasibility, these problems are generally equal across jurisdictions and thus are not a unique constraint to housing production in Salinas.
Although nongovernmental factors are primarily market-driven and outside the control of a single jurisdiction, localities can significantly influence and offset any negative impact through responsive programs and policies. As described later, the city supports the production of affordable housing by granting density bonuses and other development incentives that increase the cash flow of a project to help finance the provision of affordable units. The City also writes down land costs, and provides loans and financial assistance for qualified projects to facilitate affordable projects for special needs groups.
3.	Availability of Financing
The availability and cost of financing is also critical in expanding and improving housing opportunity. The Community Reinvestment Act was enacted in 1977 to improve access to credit for all groups within a community to further allow the maintenance, improvement, and purchase of a home. Table 3-1 summarizes the findings of the analysis of the disposition of loan applications submitted for home purchases and improvements in Salinas.
The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act further allows jurisdictions to monitor the disposition of home loans to ensure that equal access to credit is maintained. Pursuant to federal law, financial institutions of a certain size are required to submit the disposition of loans made by the race/ethnicity, and income of the applicant. These financial institutions are also given rankings for their performance in furthering fair lending practices.
Home Purchase Loans. In 2000, 3,491 households applied for home purchase loans. Of that total, 93% applied for conventional loans while 8% of households
September 2002
City of Salinas
General Plan
3-3
Appendix B: Housing Element Technical Appendix
applied for government-assisted loans. Origination rates (defined as loans approved by a financial institution and accepted by the applicant) were slightly higher for government-assisted loans (70%) than market-rate loans (65%). For market-rate loans, the origination rate increased from 58% for low-income households to 68% for upper income households. Government-assisted loans followed the same pattern, increasing from 64% to 74% for low and moderate-income households respectively.
> Home Improvement Loans. In 2000, 519 households applied for home improvement loans. For conventional loans, 42% were originated, 36% were denied, and 22% were rejected or withdrawn by the applicant or closed due to incompleteness. For government-assisted loans, the size was too small to gain a reliable sample. Origination rates for market-rate home improvement loans rose from 24% for low income households to 56% for upper income households.

Source: Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data for 2000.
HMDA data shows that the bulk of loans made for Salinas residents are for home purchases, particularly for moderate and upper income households. However, because of the lack of affordable housing, lower-income households typically cannot afford market-rate loans to purchase homes. Thus, the City has instituted several loan programs to improve the availability of financing to low and moderate-income households. As noted later in this technical appendix and in the housing plan, the City is actively involved in providing downpayment assistance to help lower income households purchase a home in Salinas.

B.	Governmental Constraints
Local policies and regulations can impact the price of housing and, in particular, affordable housing. Local policies and regulations may include land use controls, site improvement requirements, fees and exactions, permit processing procedures, and other issues. This section discusses potential governmental constraints to the housing investment as well as measures to mitigate potential impacts.

These land use polices, coupled with zoning regulations, establish the amount and distribution of land to be allocated for different uses. Housing supply and costs are affected by the amount of land designated for residential use, the density at which residential development is permitted, and the standards that govern the character of development.
The General Plan provides for a variety of residential development, ranging from a density of 0.1 dwelling unit per acre in the agriculture land use designation, 8 units per acre in low density areas, 15 units per acre in medium density areas, to 24 units per acre in high density residential areas. Table 3-2 summarizes the land use designations and zoning districts that either allow or consider, via a Conditional Use Permit (CUP), residential development.
Table 3-2
Residential Land Use Controls
General Plan Land Use Designation	Zoning District(s)	Primary Residential Types
Agriculture	A	Very low density and farmworker housing.*

2.	Provisions for a Variety of Housing
Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made available through appropriate zoning and implement development standards to encourage and facilitate the development of housing for all economic segments of the community. This includes single-family homes, multifamily housing, manufactured housing, mobile homes, transitional housing, farmworker housing, and emergency shelters.
Salinas provides for a wide range of housing types and prices throughout the community. Table 3-3 summarizes the housing types permitted in each of the City’s primary agricultural, residential, and commercial
zones. Each residential use is designated by a letter denoting whether the use is permitted by right (P), with a Planned Unit Development Permit (PUD), a site plan review (SPR), conditionally permitted (CUP), or not permitted (NP).

Facilitating Special Needs Housing.
Salinas has instituted proactive policies to facilitate and encourage special needs housing throughout the community. These policies are designed to ensure that all persons have the opportunity to find suitable housing. The following details some of the more important provisions of the Zoning Code allowing for special needs housing.
>	Interim Housing. Interim housing is shared living quarters intended to meet short-term shelter and/or other immediate needs. Interim housing includes, but is not limited to: homeless shelters, fratemities/sororities, dormitories, labor camps, emergency shelters, boarding houses, and halfway houses. Interim housing is permitted with a conditional use permit in all residential and commercial zones, except the R-L-6.S, R-M-4.0, R-M-3.6, CT, and CG zones. Interim housing serving six or fewer persons is currently permitted by right in high density residential zones and commercial zones exclusive of the CT and CG zones.
>	Affordable Senior Housing. Salinas facilitates and encourages the production of affordable senior housing in proximity to transit, services and facilities. To facilitate the development of affordable senior housing units, the City allows multifamily dwelling projects that designate at least 50% of the units for senior housing to reduce the minimum lot area per senior unit by up to 50% with a conditional use permit. Further, the City requires only one parking space per senior housing unit.
>	Residential Care Facilities. “Residential care facilities” are single-family dwellings in which group care, supervision, and/or assistance are provided for persons under the age of eighteen years or for disabled persons. Examples include facilities serving the following: developmentally, mentally, or physically disabled; people in substance abuse recovery, wards of juvenile court, and dependent or neglected children. Facilities serving six or fewer persons are permitted by right in all residential zones and the CO/R zone and are conditionally permitted in the CR, CD, and CAF zones.
>	Residential Service Facilities. “Residential service facilities” are defined by the Salinas Zoning Code as residential facilities in a single-family dwelling in which group care, supervision, and/or assistance are provided to persons which do not meet the criteria for assistance in a residential care facility or in interim housing. Examples include, but are not limited to the following: correctional houses for adults, elderly group housing, and housing for victims of domestic violence. Such facilities are required to secure an approved conditional use permit before siting is allowed.

Programs to Achieve Housing Affordability
Salinas provides several tools in order to encourage production of affordable housing. These programs are an important means to achieve a diversity and balance of housing types that are affordable to all economic segments of the community. The primary tools Salinas uses to ensure affordable housing are the Affordable Housing Density Bonus Ordinance, Inclusionary Housing Program, and Redevelopment Assistance. These are described in detail below.
>	Density Bonus Ordinance. The City’s affordable housing density bonus applies to residential developments consisting of five or more dwelling units that provide at least 20% of the total units for lower income households, or 10% of the units for very low-income households, or 50% for disabled or elderly residents. Developments that meet these criteria are granted a density bonus of 25% plus an additional incentive. Additional concessions include a reduction in development standards, architectural design requirements, minimum square footage, setback, and parking requirements.
>	Inclusionaiy Housing Ordinance. Salinas adopted an Inclusionary Housing Program in 1993 to encourage the production of affordable housing in proportion with the overall increase in residential units in the City. This program mandates that 12% of all new development, single-family and multi-family residential, containing 10 units or more be affordable to lower income households.
>	Financial Incentive. Salinas Redevelopment Agency has an active program for facilitating and encouraging a range of housing types for very low, low and moderate income households. As discussed later in this report, the Agency provides land, grants, and other financial assistance to encourage the development of affordable housing. Over the 2000-2004 planning period, the SRA is facilitating the following:
— Las Casas II (2 5 units) — SRA donated land and grant — Forester Building — (10 units) SRA granted loan of $200,000 — Plaza Grande (91 units) — SRA donated land and $250,000 grant — Farmworker housing (91 units) — SRA donated land and downpayment assistance — Del Monte Townhomes (11 units) — SRA donated land and grant — Hebbron (6 units) — SRA provided $150,000 loan and downpayment assistance — Interim, Inc (24 units) — SRA construction grant for three projects
The aforementioned projects are a few notable examples of recent development projects. Chapter 4 further details projects that have been developed since January 2000 using the aforementioned density bonus provisions, inclusionary requirements, and financial incentives.

3.	Residential Development Standards
Salinas regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development primarily through the Zoning Code. Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of residents, implement the policies of the City’s General Plan, and preserve the character and integrity of neighborhoods. Table 3-4 below summarizes the most pertinent development standards of non-Precise Plan areas of Salinas.

Flexibility in Development Standards
Salinas provides several mechanisms which facilitate and encourage a range of special housing types for homeless or formerly homeless persons and persons with special housing needs by providing relief from development standards. Following is a brief description of these mechanisms.
>	Single-Room Occupancy. Following the 1989 Loma-Prieta Earthquake that resulted in the demolition of older hotels in the downtown (these provided the traditional source of single-room occupancy residences), the City embarked on the development of zoning incentives to regain housing for this segment of residents. This effort resulted in the development of zoning and development standards (Municipal Code Section 37-161.1) that provide development incentives by significantly reducing parking, open space, and lot area per unit requirements. The city’s regulations were modeled after those implemented in San Diego. During the planning period, two projects will be built: a 91 -unit project on East Market and a 20-unit project on East Alisal.
>	Overlay Districts. The City utilizes a combination of overlay districts to provide alternatives to typical residential development standards; and to facilitate and encourage the construction of more conventional style housing. Prior to the annexation of land into Salinas, the City requires developers to prepare a Precise Plan, which is essentially the same as a Specific Plan, and secure a Precise Plan overlay (PPO) zoning designation. Salinas has utilized the Precise Plan overlay process to facilitate and encourage recent annexations including Haden Ranch (2,281 units) and Williams Ranch (2,023 units). The Economic Incentive Zone Overlay district is another overlay district which is designated within a portion of the Central City. The district is designed to encourage the location of businesses and/or induce redevelopment to accommodate new commercial and residential uses. These processes are described in greater detail later in this chapter of the Housing Element Appendix.
>	Conditional Use Permit (CUP) Processes. Finally, where development standards are not specified by the Zoning Code, the City uses a CUP process to facilitate the development of interim housing, which includes emergency shelters, transitional housing, farmworker housing, and other special needs housing types. As described later, the City has used the CUP to provide reductions in parking space requirements for the Manzanita transitional facility for substance abuse recovery, as well as allow for the administrative approval of ramp access for the Door to Hope. Moreover, the City approved reductions in parking and open space requirements for the Sun Street migrant farmworker projects. Coupled with City assistance provided to these projects, the City actively facilitates and encourages interim housing.

4.	Development Permit Procedures
Salinas’ development approval process is designed to further housing development. Processing times vary with the complexity of the project but, even when Redevelopment Agency or City Council review is required, approval can be obtained in three months. Small projects, like single-family units and additions, may receive ministerial approval within two to three weeks. The City's permit procedures do not unduly constrain housing development. The following discussion describes in greater detail the City’s normal development process (such as site plan review) as well as discretionary review and approval processes.
>	Site Plan Review. Salinas requires all multi-family residential projects to undergo a ministerial site plan review. -The current site plan review process consists of staff (Community Development Department, Public Works, Development and Permit Services and Police Department) review during the building permit process. The site plans are reviewed for consistency with City design guidelines and development standards. There is no additional time or fees associated with this review, and this process does not serve as a constraint to housing production. The review of site plans typically takes within one or two month.
>	Conditional Use Permits. Conditional use permits (CUP) are required for certain land uses with unusual site development features or operating characteristics so that they may be designed, located, or operated in a compatible manner with uses on adjoining properties and in the surrounding area. A conditional use permit is granted when: 1) the proposed location of the use is in accord with the objectives of the district and General Plan; 2) the proposed use and the conditions under which it would be operated or maintained are consistent with the General Plan; 3) the proposed use would not be detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of persons in the adjacent neighborhood or detrimental to properties or improvements; and 4) the proposed use complies with the Zoning Code and any site-specific standards.
Several commercial zoning districts allow residential uses with a CUP. To mitigate the potential impact of the conditional use permit on new housing, the City has an efficient CUP process that typically allows the Planning Commission to approve conditional uses within three months. Moreover, the Zoning Code authorizes the Director of Community Development to administratively approve projects without a public hearing if the project has a statutory or legislative exemption from CEQA and no negative response is received from the public noticing. This allows, for example, the construction of housing infill projects of up to five acres and other residential projects which are exempt from CEQA review. Thus the CUP does not constrain the production of affordable housing.

City of Salinas
General Plan
3-11
Appendix B: Housing Element Technical Appendix
The conditional use permit process has been used to facilitate and encourage the development of special needs housing and interim housing. Because a CUP is required, site specific development standards can be allowed that are less restrictive than typical residential development standards. For instance, the City assisted in the development of the 42-bed Sun Street project for migrant farmworkers. Hartnell College extension built and moved modular units onto the property. The Salinas Redevelopment Agency then acquired the property for the Housing Authority’s nonprofit organization. As part of the CUP process, the City also granted significant reductions in open space, parking, and other development standards. The CUP process does not govern separate housing for non-migrant farmworkers, because the use is treated like all other multi-family housing. However, all multi-family housing is required to abide by the City’s inclusionary ordinance and provide three and four bedroom units.
The City’s CUP process also works to facilitate and encourage transitional housing and emergency shelters, defined as interim housing. Interim housing does not have specific development standards, because the classification covers a wide range of facilities from shelters to transitional housing to group quarters. Thus, the CUP process allows organizations that typically operate such facilities to propose building designs that are best fitted to the needs of their clients. One such example is the Manzanita facility, a 15-unit transitional home for substance abuse recovery. The City granted a reduction in parking by requiring only 18 spaces for residents, guests, and on-site staff. In another example, the City allowed the Door to Hope transitional facility to expand a ramp into the setback for disabled persons access, with administrative approval,
> Planned Unit Development (PUD) Permits. In certain cases, developers will propose projects which are superior in design, but require alternative development standards. In these cases, the City allows developers to apply for a PUD. The PUD is designed to: a) reduce or eliminate design rigidity; b) ensure orderly and thorough planning; c) encourage variety and allow greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access, light, open space, and other amenities; d) encourage the assembly of properties that might otherwise be developed in unrelated increments; and e) allow freedom of design equaling or surpassing the quality required by zoning regulations. In the PUD approval process, the Planning Commission is advisory to and makes a recommendation to the City Council.
The PUD process has been used to facilitate and encourage innovative designs in return for modification of development standards. For instance, the City Council approved a PUD for Miramonte Cottages, which allowed shared driveways instead of traditional parking arrangements and a reduction in private usable open space with the provision of common open space. The PUD is not deemed to be a constraint to
September 2002
City of Salinas
General Plan
3-12
Appendix B: Housing Element Technical Appendix
the development of housing, because it allows flexibility in development standards. Moreover, in most cases, the planned unit development project is processed in a timely manner within three to four months.
>	Precise Plan (PP) Overlay District. Prior to the annexation of land into Salinas, the City requires developers to prepare a Precise Plan, which is essentially the same as a Specific Plan and secure a Precise Plan Overlay (PPO) zoning designation. The City makes extensive use of the Precise Plan overlay to demonstrate consistency with General Plan policies and provide additional flexibility in residential development standards to recognize the unique characteristics of the neighborhood area. The PPO must be approved by the Planning Commission and City Council and the process can, at times, take up to two years, particularly if an environmental impact report is required.
Salinas has utilized the Precise Plan Overlay process to facilitate and encourage a range of housing types and prices. For instance, recent annexations and planned developments approved through this process include: Harden Ranch (2,281 residential units) and Williams Ranch (2,023 residential units). The City Council also recently approved a 200-acre portion of the Sconberg Ranch through the PP process, which would allow the annexation of the area and the development of 853 singlefamily units. The PPO is advantageous in that once it approved, development can generally be approved administratively, rather than undergo separate and lengthy reviews.
>	Economic Incentive Zone Overlay. The City has applied an economic overlay zone on some commercial and public/semipublic zoned properties to encourage the location of businesses and/or induce redevelopment to accommodate new commercial and residential uses. Within the EIZ district, the construction of mixed-use structures or expansion of residential uses in existing buildings requires ministerial site plan review. Base requirements for usable open space, parking for residential units, landscaping, and lot areas can be modified. The EIZ district applies to a portion of the Central City redevelopment project area. To ‘ facilitate development, all projects can be administratively approved within one month. The city has approved several projects in recent years, including residential units. For the present planning period, Program 3 will develop a more aggressive program for facilitating and encouraging mixed residential and commercial uses in Salinas.
In summary, Salinas has made extensive use of incentives to facilitate and encourage housing opportunities in single-family, multi-family, and commercial zones. These incentives can be used to mitigate any potential impact of residential development standards on the cost and affordability of housing. Coupled with financial incentives discussed later in this report, the City continues to maintain an active commitment to the provision of affordable housing.

5.	Fees and Exactions
Housing construction imposes certain short- and long-term costs upon local government, such as the cost of providing planning services and inspections, In addition, long-term costs related to the maintenance and improvement of the community’s infrastructure, facilities, parks, and streets are also imposed. Salinas charges various planning and development fees to recoup costs and ensure that essential services and infrastructure are available when needed.
Salinas collects a variety of planning and development fees and deposits to recover the costs of processing permits and performing inspections. Planning and development fees were originally set at an amount equivalent to the cost of providing the service. However, the City’s planning fees are far below actual costs as they have not been increased since their establishment in 1987. Table 3-5 summarizes fees collected from developers.

Development Impact Fees
Salinas also charges various development impact fees and taxes on certain types of new residential development. The development impact fees and taxes are designed to ensure that infrastructure, public services, and facilities are in place as well as ensure that these systems have adequate capacity to accommodate the demands placed upon them by new residential development. Table 3-6 summarizes the major development fees charge in Salinas.
Table 3-6
Typical Impact Fees Charged

HCD recendy completed a statewide fee survey of jurisdictions. Two scenarios were examined: a 2 5-unit single-family subdivision valued at $5.74 million and a 45-unit multifamily complex valued at $3.75 million. For the former, the City charged $145,246 in development fees and $233,408 in impact fees, while the school district charged $120,625. For multi-family projects, $75,726 was charged in development fees, $619,699 in impact fees, and $86,850 in school fees. The City’s fees charged for new housing were competitive with jurisdictions in the regions that participated in the survey. For instance, fees charged for single-family development average $19,971 per unit or 8.796 of total valuation. Fees for multifamily developments averaged $17,374 per unit or 20.996 of total valuation. Salinas current fees were well below averages of cities in the following six regions of the state: East Bay, North Bay, Peninsula Bay, South Bay, South Central Coast, and Monterey Bay.

6.	Building Codes and Enforcement
Building and safety codes, while adopted to preserve public health and safety and ensure the construction of safe and decent housing, have the potential to increase construction costs and impact the affordability of housing. These include the following building codes, accessibility standards, and other related ordinances.
>	Uniform Building Code (UBC). Salinas has adopted the most recent Uniform Building Code and requires inspections at various stages of construction to ensure code compliance. The UBC prescribes minimum insulation requirements to reduce noise and promote energy efficiency. Salinas has enacted additional building codes to address seismic hazards for unreinforced masonry construction (particularly in the downtown) and ensure that housing in the flood zone is protected.
>	Site Improvements. Salinas requires developers to make site improvements so that new residential development is adequately served by roads, sewers, water, and necessary public services. As a condition for approval of projects, developers are required to provide street improvements, all on-site utilities, dedications of rights-of-way and easements, fences or walls, site grading and erosion control, a proportionate share of necessary off-site public works-types facilities, and impact fees necessary to support new residential development.
>	National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. As the permit holder of a Municipal Storm Water Permit, the City must implement an Urban Runoff Management Program to reduce the discharge of pollutants into the storm sewer system. Prior to issuance of a building permit or any discretionary land use approval or permit, the applicant must submit a storm water mitigation plan and implement Best Management Practices in accordance with state and local regulations.
>	Code Enforcement. The City’s compliance/inspection staff is responsible for enforcing local and state property maintenance codes. The City seeks voluntary compliance through administrative processes. The City also inspects properties upon receiving a complaint. To facilitate the correction of code violations or deficiencies, Code Enforcement staff refers owners to the rehabilitation loan and grant programs offered through the Community Development Department.
The City's building and other codes are considered the minimum required to protect the public health, safety, and welfare. Although these codes increase housing costs and may impact the viability of rehabilitating older properties, the intent of the codes is to provide structurally sound, safe, and efficient housing. Because such codes are similar for nearby jurisdictions, these codes are not considered to be constraints to development.

7.	Disability Access
As of January 2002, the State Legislature amended Section 6S008 of the Government Code. As a result, housing element law now requires localities to include the following in the preparation and adoption of the housing element: 1) an analysis of potential and actual constraints upon housing for persons with disabilities; 2) demonstration of efforts to remove governmental constraints; and 3) inclusion of various programs or a means of reasonable accommodations for housing designed for persons with disabilities.
As part of the Housing Element process, the City analyzed its Land Use and Zoning Code, permitting process (conditional use permit process and variance), development standards, and building codes to identify potential constraints for the development of housing. Where impediments are found, the Program Section of the Housing Element proposes specific actions and implementation schedules to remove such impediments. The following section summarizes findings from the constraint analysis and proposed programs.
Zoning and Land Use
State and federal housing laws encourage an inclusive living environment, where persons of all walks of life have the opportunity to find housing suited to their needs. As discussed in Section B of this chapter, the Zoning Code facilitates a range of housing types and prices suitable to special needs groups. These include a broad range of facilities covered under the uses “Interim Housing,” “Residential Care Facilities,” and Residential Service Facilities.” Group homes serving six or fewer persons are allowed by right in all residential zones and larger facilities are permitted via a conditional use permit.
The City’s procedures do not constrain the production of housing for disabled persons. The conditional use permit process required of larger facilities is standard for all similar uses and is approved by the Planning Commission. Smaller facilities are treated like all other singlefamily homes. The Zoning Code does not have geographical spacing/siting requirements for residential care facilities. And, the Community Development Director can approve reductions of up to 20% of all parking on an administrative basis. Salinas’ success is evidenced in that 58 facilities serving almost 900 disabled residents are located in Salinas.
Several recommendations could improve housing opportunity for disabled persons. The City could review the definitions and permitting process for “interim housing,” “residential care facilities,” and “residential service facilities.” The Zoning Code could be revised to ensure that the nomenclature used is consistent with State law, that the use classifications allow for all types of housing permitted in State law, and that distinctions between the size of residential care facilities are provided for in the definition. Program 16 in the Housing Element addresses these recommendations.

Appendix B: Housing Element Technical Appendix
Building Codes and Development Standards
The City enforces Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations, which are regulations on access and adaptability of buildings to accommodate persons with disabilities. The American with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires new residential buildings consisting of three or more units to incorporate design features, including: 1) adaptive design features for the interior of the unit; 2) accessible public and common use portions; and 3) sufficiendy wider doors to allow wheelchair access. The City ensures that plans meet ADA accessibility standards.
Currendy, the City of Salinas uses the 1998 Edition of the Uniform Building Code. No unique restrictions are in place for disabled housing, such as minimum distances, special conditions for disabled housing, or other such regulations that could constrain the development, maintenance, improvement, or alteration of housing for disabled persons. Moreover, existing building regulations do not require universal design elements or visitability codes beyond that which is required by State and federal law.
In addition, the Zoning Code does not have occupancy limitations (preempted by State law) nor does it define a family in a way that would limit the number of persons per household or limit the relationship of the household members. The City’s Zoning Code does, however, allow for flexible development standards to encourage housing for persons with disabilities. Housing for persons with disabilities has less restrictive parking requirements, which can be furthered reduced 2096 administratively by the Community Development Director. Permitting Procedures
Finally, the City does not require special building codes or additional levels of review to build, improve, or convert housing for disabled persons. Requests for modifications to ensure housing access, such as ramps up to 30 inches in height), do not require a building permit and are processed over the counter The Zoning Code (Section 37-141) also allows for ramps to project into yards without requiring a permit or variance. Moreover, the City’s Housing Services Program provides grants up to $7,500 for accessibility improvements.
The City utilizes a standard conditional use permit process to ensure that facilities are sited and operated in a manner which is compatible with surrounding land uses. The Zoning Code does not indicate a unique performance standard for community care facilities nor other types of uses. The conditional use permit is approved by the Planning Commission. As noted earlier, the conditional use permit has not constrained the development of residential care facilities, of which 5 8 facilities serving 900 residents are currently located in Salinas.

C.	Environmental Constraints
Another factor adding to the cost of new construction is the provision of adequate infrastructure to support municipal services for new residential development. In many cases, these improvements are dedicated to the City, who is then responsible for their maintenance. The cost of these facilities is borne by developers, added to the cost of new housing units, and eventually passed in various degrees to the homebuyer or property owner.
>	Water Supply and Quality. Water for Salinas is pumped from the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin and distributed by Alco and Cal Water. Both water purveyors have a policy to serve new development as required within their service area boundaries. Both purveyors anticipate having capacity to serve future growth within the planning area. Water can be provided to new housing in growth areas, since new housing typically results in less water usage than existing agricultural uses. While Alco and CalWater anticipate being able to provide adequate water for future development, in recent years, urban and agricultural use has led to groundwater contamination as well as declines in groundwater levels in various subunits. The City will continue to work to reduce overall water usage through conservation and public education programs, as well as explore alternative water sources and programs to ensure that there is adequate, good quality water available.
>	Flood Control and Drainage. Salinas has creeks and lake beds that are dry during most of the year and figure prominently as open space in the city. Four natural channels flow from the Gabilan Mountains into the Salinas area, and include the Alisal, Natividad, Gabilan, and Santa Rita Creeks. These creeks are all tributaries which eventually drain into Carr Lake. Water is then transported to the Monterey County Water Resource Agency’s Reclamation Ditch 166S.
Flooding risks do exist in the community. Currently, a large portion of the community is in the 100-year and 500-year flood plain. Flooding has also occurred in unincorporated areas near the Salinas River. Salinas is a member of the FEMA Community Rating System and administers flood management over new development with the Flood Overlay District Regulations and the Municipal Code. These regulations ensure new structures are built above 100-year flood elevations.
>	Wastewater Disposal. Salinas collects approximately an average of 12 million gallons per day of dry water flow in its sanitary collection system. Wastewater is transported to the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency’s (MRWPCA) pump station near Davis and Blanco Roads for treatment in Marina. The plant is currently operating at approximately 21 million gallons per day and has a permitted capacity of 29 MGD according to the plant’s NPDES permit.
September 2002
City of Salinas
General Plan
3-19
Appendix B: Housing Element Technical Appendix
In 1997, MRWPCA prepared updated flow projections based on AMBAG’s population projections for the region through 2020. MRWPCA’s projections indicate that the existing regional plant has adequate treatment capacity to accommodate growth through Year 2020 without expansion. However, should any of the internal plants require expansion within the next twenty years, MRWPCA sewer fees charged to new development would cover the expansion costs.
> Seismic/Geotechnical Hazards. Salinas lies within a seismically active region and is in proximity to the San Andreas and Calaveras faults. These two faults are capable of producing earthquakes of five to seven in magnitude. However, there are no known active faults located in the Planning Area. Nonetheless, due primarily to the proximity to these larger faults, all of Salinas is in Seismic Risk Zone IV, the highest risk category due to the frequency and magnitude of earthquake activity.
The most common seismic hazard is associated with groundshaking, which can cause ground failure and damage to structures. The downtown area is subject to the greatest hazard. The City’s seismic retrofitting program requires all unreinforced masonry buildings to have retrofit construction completed by 2000. Additionally, the City’s enforcement of the most recent Uniform Building Code for new development will protect structures from potential seismic hazards.
In summary, the City has adequate infrastructure and public facilities to serve existing housing. Future development in the City will generally occur as infill, where adequate infrastructure, public services, and facilities are already in place. For existing Precise Plan areas and future growth areas, developers will be required to construct appropriate infrastructure, or pay pro-rata shares of such costs for infrastructure. These measures will ensure that adequate infrastructure is available to support new development.

4.	Housing Resources
This section analyzes the resources available for the development, rehabilitation, and preservation of housing in Salinas. This includes an evaluation of the availability of land, the City’s ability to satisfy its share of the region’s future housing needs, the financial resources available to support the provision of affordable housing, and the administrative resources available to assist in implementing the City’s housing programs.
A.	Future Housing Needs
State law requires communities to demonstrate that they encourage and facilitate housing production commensurate with their share of the region’s future growth from 2000-2007. The City's share assigned by AMBAG is included in the Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP). Therefore, an important component of the Housing Element is the identification of suitable sites to accommodate housing that is affordable in accordance with the RHNP.
?. Regional Housing Needs Determination
As shown in Table 4-1, the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments has assigned a portion of the region’s future need for housing to each community within the counties of Santa Cruz, Monterey and San Benito as part of the Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP). Salinas’ share of the region’s need is 1,211 housing units from January 1, 2000 to June 30, 2007. The RHNP appeal process is anticipated to conclude in late 2002, at which time Salinas may need to revise the Housing Element to reflect changes to the production goal. Table 4-1 summarizes the City’s regional housing needs allocation.
Table 4-1

2.	Options for Compliance
State housing element law requires jurisdictions in the AMBAG region, including Salinas, to demonstrate that “adequate sites” will be made available through 2007 to accommodate housing production to meet the jurisdiction’s share of the region’s housing need. Jurisdictions must also demonstrate that appropriate zoning, development standards, services, and public facilities will be in place to accommodate housing commensurate with their share of the region’s housing needs (Government Code, Section 65583(c)(1)).
The State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) allows jurisdictions four ways to meet their housing allocation. These methods are described below.
>	Actual Production. Salinas can count new units built from 2000 through 2007 toward their regional housing needs. New housing units include those built and issued a certificate of occupancy since January 1, 2000. Housing production credits must be reduced by units that will be demolished during the planning period.
>	Rehabilitation of Units. Salinas can meet up to 25% of its specified need by rehabilitating substandard units that would otherwise be demolished. However, the stringent nature of the regulations have, for practical purposes, made this option too cosdy for the majority of cities in the AMBAG region, including Salinas.
>	Preservation of Affordable Units. AB438 authorizes cities to count a portion of the affordable units that would otherwise revert to market rents but that are preserved through committed assistance from the jurisdiction. Although certain projects in Salinas are at-risk of conversion, the cost of preservation and the limited credit allowed by AB438 make this provision infeasible for Salinas.
>	Available Land for Development. HCD allows cities to count potential residential production on suitable sites. The Housing Element must inventory land suitable for residential development, including vacant and underutilized sites, and analyze the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to these sites. Current development and infill potential is to be analyzed.
Based upon the above discussion, the City will address its share of regional housing need as follows: (1) housing production underway since January 1, 2000; (2) housing production potential on vacant residential land; (3) potential housing production in the Downtown Core; 4) potential housing production in the future growth areas in Salinas, and 5) application the City’s inclusionaiy program and continued financial assistance.

3.	Housing Production
Jurisdictions may count toward their RHNP allocation the number of units, by affordability level, that have been built and occupied since January 1, 2000. In addition, jurisdictions may count units that have received building permits, planning approvals, and other discretionary approvals that will be constructed during the 2000-2007 planning period. Table 4-2 inventories the number of affordable and market rate since January 2000. The type of financial assistance received from public sources is also included.

4.	Availability of Sites
Residential growth in Salinas could occur on a variety of residential and commercial acreage throughout the community. To evaluate potential land resources for residential development, a parcel-specific site analysis was performed using the City’s Geographic Information System. The vacant land survey was conducted by reviewing individual parcels, the current development and density on those parcels, and potential units based on maximum density. Table 4-3 summarizes the results.
Vacant Residential Land
The chart shows the number of potential new units that may be developed in each zone. To calculate the development potential, the likely density of development in a zone was multiplied by the number of acres. All of the vacant sites in Table 4-3 are suitable for future residential development and have zoning in place that either allows for or allows consideration of residential development. The vacant sites also have adequate infrastructure and public services in place that can support new residential development. In addition, no known environmental constraints are present which would preclude residential development on these sites. Therefore, the sites are potentially suitable for residential development.
Table 4-3
Housing Development Potential on Vacant Land Within City Limits Existing in 2001
Land Use Designations	Zoning District(s)	Vacant Acres	Permitted Density (Units/Acre)	Likely Density (Units/Acre)	Realistic Potential New Units
Residential	RH 2.3	6.1	16 to 18.9	17.S	107
	RM 3.6	8.0	9.0 to 12.1	10.5	84
	RM4.0	0.4	9.0 to 12.1	10.5	4
	RL6.5	10.9	6.0 to 6.7	6.35	69
Total					264
Source: Salinas Community Development Department, 2001.
To ensure that the highest and best use is built on a site, the General Plan policies specify a minimum density for each general plan designation and zone. As discussed above, the minimum density is 16 units per acre for RH 2.3, 9 units an acre for RM3.6 and RM 4.0 districts, and 6 units per acre for the RL 6.5 zone. To determine the likely number of units to be built, the median density of each zone was multiplied by the number of vacant acres. As shown above in Table 4.3, a total of 264 units can be built on available vacant sites.

City of Salinas

Appendix B: Housing Element Technical Appendix
Commercial Land
As vacant land has become scarce in Salinas, the use of underutilized commercial land has become a more attractive alternative for residential units. The City’s General Plan Land Use Element directs future housing and commercial growth in to eight focused growth areas where additional growth and/or reuse/revitalization would be appropriate and provide benefits to the community. The largest of these areas, the Downtown Core, encompasses 789 parcels of land (2 SO acres) and is within the Central City Redevelopment Project Area.
To help facilitate reuse/revitalization and recycling of properties in the Downtown, the City has adopted a new Mixed Use designation, described as a mixture of retail, office, and residential uses in the same building, on the same parcel, or in the same area to promote pedestrian oriented uses and activity centers.” Upon adoption of the General Plan, City staff estimate that 384 high density residential units could be built in the Downtown Core. The majority of units would be built on mixed use designated parcels in the Downtown.
As part of the Downtown Rebound Project Grant awarded by HCD, the City will refine its site inventory of all parcels in the Central City, develop mixed use regulations for the Downtown core area (e.g., to include items such as permitted uses, height, bulk, density, intensity, and setbacks, appearance and relationship of buildings to one another and to the street), and provide for a maximum density of 80 units per acre. The work is to be completed by June of 2003.
Future Growth Areas
The City has an excellent track record for approving annexations that are necessary to provide housing for its growing population. In 1984, the City annexed the 510-acre Creekbridge area, providing for a total of 2,598 new housing units. Later that year, the City annexed the 466-acre Williams Ranch area, providing a total of 2,070 new housing units. In 1989, the 488-acre Harden Ranch area was annexed, providing for 2,561 new housing units. Taken together, the City has provided 7,229 new homes through annexations since 1984. Prior to annexing land, each of these areas was required to prepare a Precise Plan.
As part of the Land Use Element update, the City set forth focused growth areas for new residential development which are adjacent to Salinas. A total of 3,525 acres are available for annexation, of which the breakdown by acreage and maximum development capacity are as follows: 1,042 acres designated low density residential (maximum 6,771 units); 515 acres designated medium density residential (maximum 6,052 units); and 2,680 acres designated high density (2,680 units). The City supports the annexation of land needed for housing and has already approved a Precise Plan and certified an EIR for an 853-unit project. The City anticipates that approximately 1096-25% of the future growth areas will be annexed.

Appendix B: Housing Element Technical Appendix
Affordability of New Units
The affordability of new residential units that could be built on vacant residential and commercial land depends on the type of development allowed. Generally, apartments will be affordable to moderate-income households and single-family homes would be affordable to upper income households. However, the affordability distribution also depends on the application of the City’s inclusionaiy requirements, federal and state funding. The following text and Table 4-4 summarizes the affordability of units credited toward the RHNP.
* Existing Units. Table 4-2 detailed the number of housing units built, under construction, and planned since January 1, 2000. To date, approximately 2,140 housing units are credited toward the City’s regional housing needs allocation. Of this total, 12% are affordable to very low income households, 11% are affordable to low income households, 10% are affordable to moderate-income households, and the remaining 57% are affordable to upper income households.
■	Vacant Residential Land. The City’s current housing policies have been in place for several years, including its inclusionaiy ordinance. Based on historical development, housing on vacant high density residential land (RH-2.3) will be moderate income housing, with 12% set-aside for lower income units. On low density residential sites (RM3.6, 4.0, and RL 6.5), 12% of the units would be affordable to low-income households and the remainder would be upper income.
■	Underutilized Commercial Land. Pursuant to the City’s Downtown Rebound Program, 384 high density residential units could be built in the downtown core. Assuming average densities available and redevelopment inclusionaiy requirements, approximately 15% of the units would be affordable to lower income households. This is very a conservative estimate given recent RDA involvement in projects.
■	Future Annexations. Based upon the history mentioned above, the City will likely annex 10% of its future growth areas and the 853 unit project. Except for the 853 unit project, the affordability distribution of new units can be estimated based upon development history since January 1, 2000. If historical trends continue, the following affordability distribution can be expected: 12% affordable to very low income households, 21% affordable to low income households, 10% moderate-income, and 57% affordable to above moderate income households.

B.	Financial Resources
The City has access to a variety of local, state, federal, and private resources that can be used for affordable housing activities. The following section describes the most significant housing funding sources used in Salinas: Community Development Block Grant, redevelopment set-aside funds, and HOME funds. Table 4-6 summarizes these and additional funding sources available to support implementation of the housing programs.
1.	Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds
Through the CDBG program, HUD provides funds to local governments for a range of community development activities. The eligible activities include, but are not limited to: acquisition and/or disposition of real estate or property, public facilities and improvements, relocation, rehabilitation and construction (under certain limitations) of housing, home ownership assistance, and also clearance activities. In addition, these funds can be used to acquire or subsidize at-risk units. During FY 2000/01, the City of Salinas received approximately $2.S million from HUD.
2.	Redevelopment Set-Aside
State law requires redevelopment agencies to set-aside 20% of tax increment revenue generated from redevelopment projects for activities that increase, improve, or preserve the supply of affordable housing. Affordable housing developed with 20% tax-set-aside funds must remain affordable to the targeted income group for at least 55 years for rental housing and 45 years for ownership housing. According to the Redevelopment Implementation Plan, setaside funds available for housing activities include $570,000 from the Central City project area and $1,100,000 from the Sunset Avenue project area over the 2002-2007 planning period. These activities include housing rehabilitation, first time homebuyer assistance, farm labor housing, housing production, and homeless assistance.
3.	HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME)
Salinas receives an annual entitlement under the HOME program. HOME funds can be used to promote affordable rental housing and lower-income homeownership, including but not limited to: building acquisition, new construction, reconstruction, moderate or substantial rehabilitation, first-time homebuyer assistance, and tenant-based assistance. A federal priority for use of these funds is preservation of at-risk housing stock. A city must also secure matching contributions equivalent to 25% of HOME allocations. The City receives approximately $1,000,000 in HOME funds annually.

The most heavily funded programs are as follows: Rental Housing ($177 million), Community Amenities/Development Incentives ($110 million), Ownership Housing ($100 million), Farm Worker Housing ($43 million), Emergency Housing Assistance ($32 million), and Supportive Housing/Minors Leaving Foster Care ($25 million). However, State budgets fluctuate on an annual basis due to the condition of the economy. Therefore, funding for housing activities in future years is difficult to predict.

C.	Administrative Resources
Described below are public and non-profit agencies that can serve as resources in the implementation of housing activities in Salinas. These agencies play an important role in meeting the housing needs of the City. In particular, they are critical in the production of affordable housing and the preservation of at-risk housing units in Salinas. There are additional nonprofit agencies that are developing a local track record; these agencies may also assist in this area during the life of this Housing Element.
Salinas Redevelopment Agency (SRA) is responsible for planning and coordinating activities within the City’s two redevelopment project areas: the Central City Project Area (1974) and the Sunset Avenue/Buena Vista Project Area (1987). The SRA is active in the rehabilitation and production of low and moderate- income housing through a variety of programs and projects, including regulatory and financial assistance, first-time homebuyer program, farm labor housing, and homeless assistance.
Interim Inc. provides state licensed residential treatment, social rehabilitation and employment and education services, and low income housing for adults with psychiatric disabilities residing in Monterey County. Programs include a short term crisis program, short term and long term transitional programs, a community housing program, supported employment and education services programs, and client run social support groups. Interim currently has 145 treatment and housing beds operated out of 17 facilities in Monterey County.
Community Housing Improvement Systems and Planning Association, Inc. (CHISPA) is one of the largest private non-profit developers in Monterey County. CHISPA has produced over 1,000 units of very low, low, and moderate-income housing throughout Monterey County. Most of CHISPA's rental, homeownership, and cooperative projects serve large families and include three- and four-bedroom townhouse-style units as well as open, grassy areas and "tot lots" for children to play. Recently, CHISPA completed the Mountain View development project, consisting of 68 larger multi-family units in Williams Ranch. CHISPA has also developed 43 units of farm labor housing on North Roosevelt Street in Salinas.
Habitat for Humanity of Monterey County is a non-profit organization dedicated to building affordable housing and rehabilitating damaged homes for low-income families. Habitat builds and repairs homes for families with the help of volunteers and homeowner/partner families. Habitat homes are sold to partner families at no profit with affordable, no-interest loans. Volunteers, churches, businesses, and other groups provide most of the labor for the homes. Two homes affordable to very low-income Salinas families were constructed with assistance from the Salinas Redevelopment Agency. Both homes are located on Elm Street.

D.	Opportunities for Energy Conservation
In recent years, the State of California and various regions have experienced significant price escalation for energy use. In recognition, Tide 24 of the California Administrative Code sets forth mandatory energy standards and an “energy budget” that developers must prepare for new residential developments. The City has adopted energy conservation standards in new subdivisions, and local utilities also offer energy conservation programs for Salinas residents.
J. Building Standards
The City’s Zoning Ordinance requires that the designs for new subdivisions must provide, to the extent feasible, for future passive or natural heating or cooling opportunities. These codes are designed to improve the overall efficiency of new subdivisions, lower the life cycle costs of new construction, lower the energy costs of new housing, and improve the affordability of the home to the prospective homeowner.
Examples of passive or natural heating opportunities in subdivision design include the configuration of lots to permit orientation of structures in an east-west street alignment for southern exposure of major living areas. Examples of passive or natural cooling opportunities in subdivision design include design of lot size and configuration to permit orientation of a structure to take advantage of shade or prevailing breezes. In providing for future energy conservation, consideration shall be given to local climate, contour, configuration of the parcels, and other design and improvement requirements.
The City’s energy conservation requirements are designed to not unduly impede housing production and affordability. For instance, this provision shall not result in reducing allowable densities, or the percentage of a lot which may be occupied by a building or structure under applicable planning and zoning in force at the time the tentative or parcel map is accepted as complete. Moreover, “feasible" means capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, social, and technological factors.
2.	Energy Programs
Salinas residents receive electric and gas service through the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). PG&E offers a number of programs to financially assist lower income and special needs customers. These programs are oudined below.
> CARE (California Alternate Rates for Energy) provides discounted rates for low-income households and housing facilities by providing an ongoing 20 percent discount on monthly energy bills. The CARE program is available for single-family households, multi-family and mobile home park residents, group quarter facilities, and employee and farm worker housing.

>	REACH (Relief for Energy Assistance through Community Help) is a onetime energy assistance program sponsored by PG&E and administered through the Salvation Army. REACH helps low-income customers who have experienced severe, uncontrollable, or unplanned hardship and need assistance with their energy bills. In general recipients can receive REACH assistance only once per year, but exceptions are made for seniors, physically challenged and the terminally ill.
>	Energy Partners Program provides free assistance for home insulation and energy efficiency improvements for low-income individuals. Assistance sponsored by PG&E includes window weather stripping, insulation, and furnace improvements.
>	LIHEAP- Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program provides financial assistance for low-income individuals to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling residences and have dwellings weatherized to make them more energy efficient. The LIHEAP Block Grant fund is provided by the State Department of Health and Human Services. Assistance is provided through the following three programs: 1) free weatherization service assistance; 2) financial assistance for energy bills; and 3) payments for weather-related or energy —related emergencies.
PG&E also offers additional quantities of electricity at the lowest price to residential customers with certain severe medical conditions such as those requiring life support equipment, person with special heating needs, and those with life-threatening diseases.

5.	Program Eva I u a t i o n
An important step in developing a future housing strategy is to conduct an evaluation of the success of the current Housing Element in addressing identified housing needs. State law requires Housing Elements to be updated at least every five years. Jurisdictions are to report progress in meeting the goals, policies, and objectives set forth in the prior Housing Element. The Element must review the progress made in implementation of the adopted programs, and evaluate the effectiveness and continued appropriateness of these identified programs.
A. Review of Past Progress
1.	Housing Goals
State law requires jurisdictions to report on progress made in implementing housing programs since the last adopted Housing Element. For all jurisdictions in the Monterey Bay Area, the planning period for the prior Housing Element was 1991 through 1996. However, because State law eventually extended the planning period several times through 1999, this Housing Element reports on progress over a ten-year period, from 1991 through 2000.
Salinas last updated its Housing Element in 1991. At that time, the City set forth a number of overarching goals and principles. For purposes of presentation, these goals and principles have been consolidated into three broad topics. Table 5-1 displays these topics as follows: housing production, housing and neighborhood conservation, and housing assistance.
Table 5-1
Housing Goals from the 1991 Housing Element
Housing Production	Housing and Neighborhood Conservation	Housing Assistance
> Affordable Housing	> Residential Conservation	> Special Needs
> Housing Sites	> Neighborhood Conservation	> Access to Housing
> Governmental Constraints		
The chapter begins with an analysis of the City’s effectiveness in addressing each of these goals, follows with a discussion of the continued appropriateness of the City’s goals, policies, and programs for the 2000-2007 planning period, and concludes with a detailed summary of housing program accomplishments in Table 5-4.

2.	Housing Production
In 1991, AMBAG assigned Salinas 7,335 new housing units as the number of units that need to planned for as our portion of the regional housing needs. To address these housing needs, the City set forth guiding principles to facilitate housing production in Salinas. These principles were designed to provide adequate sites for new housing, ensure that an appropriate number of units would be available for all income groups, as well as ensure that such units would be appropriately distributed throughout the community.
To implement these guiding principles, the City proposed a series of programs described in detail at the end of this chapter. Notable programs implemented during the prior planning period included the following:
>	Development of an inclusionary housing program;
>	Use of City financial resources to facilitate affordable housing;
>	Cooperation with nonprofit organizations in Salinas to provide housing; and
>	Inter-jurisdictional efforts to address regional housing needs.
Salinas made substantial progress toward meeting its portion of regional housing needs, with total production of nearly 4,000 units (Table 5-2). The shortfall in housing production was largely a function of overly optimistic regional growth projections and a downturn in national economic trends. In fact, no jurisdiction in the AMBAG region could attain production goals set forth by the RHNP.
Table 5-2
Housing Production (1989-1999)
Income Level	RHNP Goals	Actual Production	Shortfall
Very Low	1,313	778	1,776
Low	1,241		
Moderate	1,839	3,086	1,696
Upper	2,942		
Total	7,335	3,864	3,471

Department of Finance, 2000.
Although production levels were below the City’s regional housing needs goals, the City of Salinas still satisfied state law requirements by ensuring that adequate sites were available. Ensuring the production of new housing is beyond the control of any single jurisdiction. The housing industry is influenced by employment growth, population growth, household income, and the economy among other factors.

3.	Residential and Neighborhood Conservation
As a rapidly growing and changing community, housing conservation and neighborhood stability is an important goal for Salinas. Certain areas of the community have experienced some disinvestment due to the advanced age of the housing stock, the high growth rate in the community, and the need for periodic improvements to infrastructure and public facilities. These include areas in East Salinas and several redevelopment project areas.
To that end, the 1991 Housing Element developed a series of programs designed around four guiding principles. These principles were as follows: (1) maintain Salinas’ housing stock in good condition; (2) rehabilitate substandard housing where feasible; (3) provide public services and improvements that enhance and create neighborhood stability; and (4) preserve and protect residential, historical, and architectural resources.
To implement these guiding principles, the City proposed various programs described in detail later in this chapter. Table 5-3 describes the City’s progress versus the quantified objectives in the 1991 Housing Element. Notable programs implemented during the prior planning period included the following:
■	Consolidation of housing and zoning code enforcement at the City’s Permit Center;
■	Adoption of design review guidelines;
■	Implementation of a housing rehabilitation loan program; and
■	Development of an ordinance for rehabilitating nonconforming structures.
Altogether, the City met its goals for housing rehabilitation and conversion. Approximately 272 units were rehabilitated versus a goal of 240 units. Multi-family units rehabilitated with City funds were required to be rented to lower income persons, thus helping to preserve the City’s existing supply of affordable housing.

4.	Housing Assistance and Special Needs
The 1992 Housing Element noted that a significant number of residents have special housing needs which make it more difficult to find affordable and adequately sized housing. These special need groups include farmworkers, seniors, large families, disabled persons, and various other identified need groups. These special needs groups are also discussed in the existing Housing Element and programs have been developed to address their needs.
Over the Housing Element planning period the City set forth five guiding principles to address special needs. These guiding principles are as follows: (1) encourage the development of large family units; (2) provide incentives to encourage the development of senior housing; (3) encourage the retention and rehabilitation of, and new construction of, high density housing; (4) encourage the provision of decent, safe, and attractive housing for farmworkers; and (5) encourage the provision of housing for homeless persons.
The City has made extensive progress toward meeting the aforementioned goals. A brief summary of progress is noted below.
>	Development of almost 100 units of farm worker housing;
>	Development of 36 units of single-room occupancy units;
>	Funding of a consolidated Homeless Service Center;
>	Amendment of zoning ordinance to further fair housing;
>	Assistance in the development of senior housing;
>	Development of requirement for large family housing; and
>	Provision of grants to homeowners for accessibility modifications.

Summary of Program Accomplishments
Implementation Program/ 1988 General Plan Policy	5 Year Goal	1991-2001 Accomplishments/Continued Appropriateness
1. Density Bonus (6.1.D)	Goal to develop 47 S units which include a Density Bonus	Salinas has approved residential projects containing approximately 700 units, which have also included density bonus units.
2. Site Specific Density Bonus (6.1.E)	Include site-specific density bonus provision in the zoning code by 1992. Provide at least 10 lower income affordable units annually through this Ordinance.	In 1993, the City added an Affordable Housing Density Bonus program, which provides an additional density bonus if both 20% low income and 10% very-low-income units are provided. No requests have been made to date.
3. Mortgage Revenue Bond Programs for Developers of Affordable Rental Housing (6.1.F))	Participate in a mortgage revenue bond program that provides tax-exempt financing to developers of projects providing a percentage of rental units for low-income households. Build three multi-family projects by 1996, resulting in 90 low-income units.	Salinas' most recent multifamily bond issue for new construction occurred in 1989. The Villa Sera senior housing project was sponsored by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey and Dominican Hospital of Santa Cruz. This 150-unit project set aside 30 units for lower income seniors.
4. Ease Qualification Requirements for	Mortgage Revenue Bonds in SMC (6. l.G)	Amend Section 10-81 of the Salinas Municipal Code to delete Part III.B, which sets additional criteria for rental projects receiving tax exempt financing above state and federal requirements. Amend Municipal Code by 1992.	The collapse of the savings and loan industry necessitated changes to the typical bond structures for this type of housing. It was determined that the code amendment was not needed.
S. Federal Tax Credit (6. l.H)	Encourage the Use of Federal Tax credits for the Production of low-income housing. Research Federal Tax Credits, prepare an informational summary, and inform prospective users.	Apartment projects have tended to look to a newer financing vehicle: federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits. Salinas has encouraged the use of this new approach, resulting in the development of ten projects between 1989 and 2001. Several projects are also under construction.
6. Mortgage Revenue Bond -1st Time Homebuyers (6.1.1)	City will participate as requested by Developers in mortgage revenue bond programs. Demand is market driven based on the cost of financing.	The City has not received applications to date.	The Inclusionary program has provided affordable single-family units. Focus of the program has thus shifted to multi-family projects.
7. Housing Trust Fund (6. I.J)	Establish a Housing Trust Fund to assist in the development and conservation of 240-320 units affordable to residents with lower-income households. Council will take action on Housing Trust Fund components by 1992.	An attempt was made to establish a Trust Fund; however, the economic downturn meant that funding sources could not be successfully developed.

Summary of Program Accomplishments
Implementation Program/ 1988 General Plan Policy	5 Year Goal	1991-2001 Accomplishments/Continued Appropriateness
8. Second Units (“granny units”) (6 . I K)	Allow second units in single-family residential zoning districts, subject to parking and design standards. Enact Ordinance by 1992.	In 1993, the City amended its Zoning Code to permit second units in the A and R districts pursuant to a CUP. In 2000, the owner occupancy requirement was eliminated provided that the resulting units were kept affordable.
9. Cooperate with Affordable Housing Developers (6.I.L)	1992- Prepare inventory of vacant land suitable for low-income residential use. 1996- Construct 400 additional units affordable to low-and-very low-income households.	The City’s land use inventory is updated on an annual basis.
10. Redevelopment Housing Set-aside Funds (6.1.M)	Prepare plan for use of Redevelopment housing set-aside funds to stimulate affordable housing development. Adopt housing policy guidelines by 1992.	In 1995, the Agency adopted a 5-year Implementation Plan for use of housing set-aside funds. The Plan was updated for 1999-2004.
11. Affordable Housing Development (6.1.N)	Amend the Zoning Ordinance by 1992 to require that developers meet inclusionary housing obligations on all residential developments.	Construct 150 units by 1996.	In 1992, the City adopted its inclusionary housing ordinance requiring 1296 of all units in projects of 10 or more units to be affordable to low and very-low income households. The City has many affordable inclusionary units built.
12. Preserve At Risk Units (6.1.0)	Endeavor to preserve the affordability of subsidized affordable housing units which are eligible for conversion to market rate housing. Prepare and adopt plan for the preservation of at risk units.	The City prepared an amendment to its Housing Element in 1992 to include a plan to preserve its existing and expiring affordable housing units.
13. Agricultural Worker Housing (6.1.P)	Encourage the County of Monterey, and other Salinas Valley cities to develop policy and programs to address the shortage of affordable housing for agricultural workers. Support creation of a task force of Salinas Valley cities to develop ways to increase the supply of agricultural worker housing. Lobby for increased state and federal funding for farmworker housing programs.	The City, County, and Valley cities engage in constant dialogue regarding affordable housing for farmworkers. City-centered growth polices direct urban growth toward cities rather than inappropriately in unincorporated areas. No formal task force has been developed; however, the City successfully lobbied County and State to commit to Farmworker Family Initiative as an Urban Demonstration Project.
14. Set Aside Funds (6. l.Q)	Use 2096 housing set-aside funds to increase, improve, and preserve the supply of lower and moderate income housing within the respective project. With an estimated $350,000 in available funds, provide 25 new affordable housing units by 1996.	Over the 10 year period, the Agency assisted in the production of 61 affordable units, rehabilitation of another 26 units using approximately $800,000 in set-aside funds.

Summary of Program Accomplishments
Implementation Program/ 1988 General Plan Policy	5 Year Goal	1991-2001 Accomplishments/Continued Appropriateness
IS. Affordable Housing Development for Large Families (6.2.F)	Adopt, by 1992, a provision requiring all multi-family	residential	projects exceeding 10 units (except senior housing and Central City projects) to provide 20% of their units as three bedroom units and 10% as four-bedroom units.	Pursuant to Ordinance 2300, the City adopted a policy requiring that each development provide a certain percentage of large three and for bedroom units. Since its implementation, 130 four-bedroom units and 270 three-bedroom units were developed.
16. Remove Constraints to Production of Larger Units (6.2.G)	Review development regulations and city fee schedule to assure that any disincentives to production of larger units are eliminated and revise regulations as needed.	Review development regulations and fees and revise as needed by 1992.	Development regulations were reviewed and, pursuant to Ordinance 2300, were revised in 1993. The City’s fee schedule has not been revised in recent years, as the City’s development fees overall do not begin to pay for the actual improvements required for a project.
17. Support Nonprofit Developers of Housing for the Elderly and Disabled (6.2.H)	By 1996, construct 50 units of housing for the elderly and disabled by nonprofit housing developers utilizing HUD Section 202 funds.	The City assisted in the development of affordable housing built by “Interim”, Regency Circle, Harden Ranch Senior Apartments, and William Ranch projects. Section 202 funding has been very limited during the last decade.
18. Senior Housing Development Standards (6.2.1)	Adopt special development standards for senior citizen projects.	These requirements would include reduced parking requirements and requirements for special design features.	Adopt ordinance by 1992.	Pursuant to Ordinance 2300, in 1993 the City adopted special zoning provisions for multifamily projects designating 50% of units for seniors. Special provisions allow for reduced parking standards and lot area per unit provided consistency is maintained with the General Plan.
19. Farmworker and Farmworker Family Housing (6.2.J)	Cooperate with local non-profit housing developers in locating suitable sites for the construction of 80 units of migrant farmworker housing by 1996.	The City continues to cooperate with local non-profit housing developers. Over the prior planning period, 50 units of lower-income family housing for farm workers were approved.
20. Single Male Farmworker Housing (6.2.K)	Work closely with labor contractors, agricultural employers, labor camp operators, and County and State officials to ensure the high utilization of existing labor camps spaces for housing single male farmworkers and reducing overcrowding in the community.	In partnership with the Bank of Salinas, Hartnell College, and the Housing Authority, the City developed a 44-bed (22 unit) farmworker housing project at 27 Sun Street (Las Casas del Sol), the site of a former labor camp.

21.	Single Room Occupancy Facilities (6.2. L)	Encourage the development of singleroom occupancy (SRO) facilities in the Central City. Develop 40 new or rehabilitated SRO units by 1996.	Over the planning period, the following SROs were developed: Plaza House (26 units), Forrester building (10 units above commercial), and the Redevelopment Agency purchased an additional site for a SRO (90 units).
22. Senior Housing Density Bonus (6.2.M)	Allow a density bonus larger than 25% in appropriate locations for projects with 50% or more units designated for seniors. Develop criteria under which increased density bonus would be allowed to adopt provisions by 1992.	In 1993, the City amended the Zoning Code to allow the minimum lot area per unit to be reduced by up to 50% for multifamily projects designating at least 50% of units for seniors.
23. Support Emergency Shelter (6.2.N)	Support the Downtown Social Service Board in their efforts to provide an emergency shelter for the homeless. The City will provide technical assistance through the construction phase of the proposed emergency shelter.	The City and SRA actively work with nonprofits agencies and provide financial assistance and land to facilitate projects. The SRA provided land and funds to assist in the development of Dorothy’s Hospitality Center, a comprehensive center for the homeless population.
24. Shelters for the Homeless and Transitional Housing (6.2.0)	Amend Zoning Ordinance regulations to provide clear guidance for the location and review of shelters for the homeless. Revise Zoning Ordinance by 1992	The City amended its Zoning Code in 1993 to allow emergency shelters, defined as interim housing, by right in higher density residential and commercial zones if six or fewer persons live there.
25. Provision of Sites (6.3.D)	Work with the Monterey County Local Agency Formation Commission to ensure that sufficient land for future residential development is made available through appropriate sphere of influence changes and annexations.	At the time of adoption of the Housing Element, there was sufficient land to provide for a greater number of units than the City’s need for that period.
26. Precise Plan Preparation (6.3.E)	Prepare and adopt Precise Plans for all Conditional Growth Areas prior to approval of any development. Provide 3,800 to 5,000 units to be included in Precise Plans.	Since the Housing Element was adopted, the City has approved Harden Ranch and Williams Ranch, which provide a total of 4,304 units of which 400 are affordable to low income households and 94 are affordable to very low income households.
27. Manufactured Housing (6.3. F)	Allow manufactured housing in all residential districts provided that it meets	the same standards as conventional housing and is place on permanent foundations.	In 1993, the City amended its Zoning Code to permit, by right, manufactured housing to be sited in all residential zones.

28. Zone “Unclassified" Districts (6.4.B)	Rezone existing “Unclassified” districts that have been developed to eliminate or reduce subsequent review time for proposed changes to that development. Consider creation of a “transitional” zoning district.	All “Unclassified” districts were rezoned in 1993 as part of the adoption of a new Zoning Ordinance. Review time was reduced significantly throughout the City as part of the new Code.
29. Reduced Development Fees (6.4. C)	Continue to provide for waiver of City development fees for directly assisted and affordable low-income, where a funding source other than a development fee is available.	Such fee waivers are still allowed.
30. Streamlined Development Review (6.4. D)	Continue efforts to streamline and improve the development review process. Adopt a zoning ordinance and implementation of development review procedures by 1992.	Adoption of the new Zoning Code in 1993 significantly improved and streamlined development review process. Additional improvements and streamlining were included later (Ordinance No. 2245).
31. Provision of Sewer Infrastructure (6.4.E)	The City shall work closely with MRWPCA, MBUAPCD, and AMBAG to ensure that a sufficient allocation of residential sewer hookups is provided to meet the City’s regional housing need.	A sufficient allocation of sewer hookups was provided to meet the City’s regional housing need.
32. Code Enforcement and Housing Codes (6.5.E)	Continue the enforcement of building and housing codes.	Building and housing code enforcement have been consolidated at City’s Permit Center. Additional staff has been added.
33. Property Maintenance Regulations (6.5.F)	Consider enactment of property maintenance regulations that promote the maintenance,	livability,	and appearance of residential	areas. Consider the adoption of property maintenance regulations by 1992.	Property maintenance regulations were considered as part of the adoption of new Zoning Code in 1993, however, design guidelines were adopted. Design review is now a component of consideration of approval for CUPs, PUD’s, and other discretionary permits.
34. Rehabilitation Assistance (6.5.G)	Offer low-interest loans and technical assistance for housing rehabilitation, and housing information and referral programs to eligible property owners. Rehabilitate 140 units by 1996.	Over the past ten years, the City has made loans to rehabilitate over 270 properties, well exceeding the quantified objectives for this program.
35. Amendment of N onconforming Regulations (6.5.H)	Amend zoning ordinance regulations concerning residential uses developed to nonconforming standards to allow rehabilitation and enlargement provided the extent of non-conformity is not increased. Amend ordinance by 1992.	Pursuant to Ordinance No. 2500, this occurred with adoption of a new Zoning Code in 1993.
