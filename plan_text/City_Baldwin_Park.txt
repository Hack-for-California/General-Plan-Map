The City of Baldwin Park (Lead Agency) proposes to adopt and implement a new element in the City’s General Plan: the
Baldwin Park Health and Sustainability Element. The Health and Sustainability Element is an integral component of the
General Plan, as it addresses future efforts to improve community health and sustainability. The goals, policies, and
actions contained in the Health and Sustainability Element will provide ongoing direction to decision-makers in the
annual budget process and will help the public understand the framework for improving local environmental conditions
and promoting healthy living practices for current and future residents. The approval of the new Health and Sustainability
Element constitute a project that is subject to review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) 1970 (Public
Resources Code, Section 21000 et seq.), and the State CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations, Section
15000 et. seq.).
This Initial Study has been prepared to assess the short-term, long-term, and cumulative environmental impacts that
could result from the proposed residential subdivision.
This report has been prepared to comply with Section 15063 of the State CEQA Guidelines, which sets forth the required
contents of an Initial Study. These include:
          A description of the project, including the location of the project (See Section 2);
          Identification of the environmental setting (See Section 2.10);
          Identification of environmental effects by use of a checklist, matrix, or other methods, provided that entries on
           the checklist or other form are briefly explained to indicate that there is some evidence to support the entries
           (See Section 4);
          Discussion of ways to mitigate significant effects identified, if any (See Section 4);
          Examination of whether the project is compatible with existing zoning, plans, and other applicable land use
           controls (See Section 4.10); and
          The name(s) of the person(s) who prepared or participated in the preparation of the Initial Study (See Section
           5).
1.1 – PURPOSE OF CEQA
The body of state law known as CEQA was originally enacted in 1970 and has been amended a number of times since
then. The legislative intent of these regulations is established in Section 21000 of the California Public Resources Code,
as follows:
The Legislature finds and declares as follows:
a) The maintenance of a quality environment for the people of this state now and in the future is a matter of statewide
      concern.
b) It is necessary to provide a high-quality environment that at all times is healthful and pleasing to the senses and
      intellect of man.
c) There is a need to understand the relationship between the maintenance of high-quality ecological systems and the
      general welfare of the people of the state, including their enjoyment of the natural resources of the state.
d) The capacity of the environment is limited, and it is the intent of the Legislature that the government of the State
      takes immediate steps to identify any critical thresholds for the health and safety of the people of the state and take
      all coordinated actions necessary to prevent such thresholds being reached.
e) Every citizen has a responsibility to contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the environment.
f) The interrelationship of policies and practices in the management of natural resources and waste disposal requires
      systematic and concerted efforts by public and private interests to enhance environmental quality and to control
      environmental pollution.
g) It is the intent of the Legislature that all agencies of the state government which regulate activities of private
      individuals, corporations, and public agencies which are found to affect the quality of the environment, shall
City of Baldwin Park Health and Sustainability Element                                                                      1

Introduction
      regulate such activities so that major consideration is given to preventing environmental damage, while providing a
      decent home and satisfying living environment for every Californian.
The Legislature further finds and declares that it is the policy of the State to:
h) Develop and maintain a high-quality environment now and in the future, and take all action necessary to protect,
      rehabilitate, and enhance the environmental quality of the state.
i)    Take all action necessary to provide the people of this state with clean air and water, enjoyment of aesthetic,
      natural, scenic, and historic environmental qualities, and freedom from excessive noise.
j)    Prevent the elimination of fish or wildlife species due to man's activities, ensure that fish and wildlife populations do
      not drop below self-perpetuating levels, and preserve for future generations representations of all plant and animal
      communities and examples of the major periods of California history.
k) Ensure that the long-term protection of the environment, consistent with the provision of a decent home and
      suitable living environment for every Californian, shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions.
l)    Create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony to fulfill the social and
      economic requirements of present and future generations.
m) Require governmental agencies at all levels to develop standards and procedures necessary to protect
      environmental quality.
n) Require governmental agencies at all levels to consider qualitative factors as well as economic and technical
      factors and long-term benefits and costs, in addition to short-term benefits and costs and to consider alternatives to
      proposed actions affecting the environment.
A concise statement of legislative policy, with respect to public agency consideration of projects for some form of
approval, is found in Section 21002 of the Public Resources Code, quoted below:
    The Legislature finds and declares that it is the policy of the state that public agencies should not approve projects as
    proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen
    the significant environmental effects of such projects, and that the procedures required by this division are intended
    to assist public agencies in systematically identifying both the significant effects of proposed projects and the feasible
    alternatives or feasible mitigation measures which will avoid or substantially lessen such significant effects. The
    Legislature further finds and declares that in the event specific economic, social, or other conditions make infeasible
    such project alternatives or such mitigation measures, individual projects may be approved in spite of one or more
    significant effects thereof.

2.7 – ZONING DISTRICT
All existing zone districts are subject to implementation of the Health and Sustainability Element.
2.8 – PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The City of Baldwin Park (Lead Agency) proposes to adopt and implement the Baldwin Park Health and Sustainability
Element. The Health and Sustainability Element is an integral component of the City’s General Plan as it addresses
future efforts to improve community health and sustainability through land use, mobility, parks and recreation, and other
policy directives. The Element will provide ongoing direction to decision-makers in the annual budget process and will
help the public understand the framework for improving local environmental conditions and promoting healthy living
practices for current and future residents.
The Baldwin Park Health and Sustainability Element is organized around the framework outlined below. Within this
framework (Table 2, Health and Sustainability Element Framework), Baldwin Park has identified goals, policies, and
implementation actions to move the community toward the City’s goal of providing a healthier community and local
environment. The City will annually review the performance measures (Table 3, Health and Sustainability Performance
Measures) to track progress towards increasing environmental sustainability, economic prosperity, and health outcomes
across the City.

3.2 – DETERMINATION
          I find that the proposed project COULD NOT have a significant effect on the environment, and a NEGATIVE
          DECLARATION will be prepared.
          I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment, there will not be a
          significant effect in this case because revisions in the project have been made by or agreed to by the project
          proponent. A MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared.
          I find that the proposed project MAY have a significant effect on the environment, and an ENVIRONMENTAL
          IMPACT REPORT is required.
          I find that the proposed project MAY have a ‘potentially significant impact’ or ‘potentially significant unless
          mitigated’ impact on the environment, but at least one effect 1) has been adequately analyzed in an earlier
          document pursuant to applicable legal standards, and 2) has been addressed by mitigation measures based
          on the earlier analysis as described on attached sheets. An ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT is required,
          but it must analyze only the effects that remain to be addressed.
          I find that although the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment, because all
          potentially significant effects (a) have been analyzed adequately in an earlier EIR or NEGATIVE
          DECLARATION pursuant to applicable standards, and (b) have been avoided or mitigated pursuant to that
          earlier EIR or NEGATIVE DECLARATION, including revisions or mitigation measures that are imposed upon
          the proposed project, nothing further is required.

                                                                                     Incorporation
   A)      Have a substantial adverse effect on a
           scenic vista?
   B)      Substantially damage scenic resources,
           including, but not limited to, trees, rock
           outcroppings, and historic buildings
           within view from a state scenic highway?
   C)      Substantially degrade the existing visual
           character or quality of the site and its
           surroundings?
   D)      Create a new source of substantial light
           or glare which would adversely affect
           day or nighttime views in the area?
A)      No Impact. A scenic vista is defined by a generally uninterrupted view of the horizon, creating an aesthetic
        viewpoint. Scenic vistas can be impacted by development in two ways. First, a structure may be constructed that
        blocks a vista. Second, the vista itself may be altered (i.e., development on a scenic hillside). There are no scenic
        vistas visible from anywhere in Baldwin Park. Therefore, implementation of the Health and Sustainability Element
        could not affect or otherwise directly disturb a scenic vista.1 No impact would occur.
B)      No Impact. No State or County designated scenic highways exist in Baldwin Park; therefore scenic resources as
        seen from such highways would not be impacted. Because the City is largely built out, the visual character of the
        City is suburbanized; therefore scenic resources such as rock outcropping or distinctive trees will not be impacted.
        The General Plan has identified several structures and buildings as locally significant throughout the City. The
        project does not include any development activity. Thus, no impact will result.
C)      No Impact. The project does not involve any development activity. Any improvements associated with Health and
        Sustainability Element policies will be limited to planting of trees, upgrade of park facilities, and installation of low-
        impact development (LID) infrastructure. The “greening” of the City will have a positive impact on community visual
        character. No adverse impact will result.
D)      Less Than Significant Impact. The project does not involve any development activity. Goal HS-5 promotes
        physical design to reduce crime and increase the number of people on streets. Policy 5.01 encourages the use of
        appropriate lighting to create safe environments. These goals and policies may result in small amounts of lighting
        added to public areas to influence human behavior. However, any lighting installed as a result of this goal is
        anticipated to be minimal and would be in compliance with City of Baldwin Park lighting standards. Therefore, this
        impact will be less than significant.

Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
4.2 – AGRICULTURE AND FOREST RESOURCES
  In determining whether impacts to agricultural resources are significant environmental effects, lead agencies may refer
  to the California Agricultural Land Evaluation and Site Assessment Model (1997) prepared by the California Dept. of
  Conservation as an optional model to use in assessing impacts on agriculture and farmland. In determining whether
  impacts to forest resources, including timberland, are significant environmental effects, lead agencies may refer to
  information compiled by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection regarding the state’s inventory of
  forest land, including the Forest and Range Assessment Project and the Forest Legacy Assessment project; and forest
  carbon measurement methodology provided in Forest Protocols adopted by the California Air Resources Board. Would

  A)      Convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or
          Farmland of Statewide Importance (Farmland),
          as shown on the maps prepared pursuant to the
          Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program of
          the California Resources Agency, to non-
          agricultural use?
  B)      Conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use,
          or a Williamson Act contract?
  C)      Conflict with existing zoning for, or cause
          rezoning of, forest land (as defined in Public
          Resources Code section 12220(g)), timberland
          (as defined by Public Resources Code section
          4526), or timberland zoned Timberland
          Production (as defined by Government Code
          section 51104 (g))?
  D)      Result in loss of forest land or conversion of
          forest land to non-forest use?
  E)      Involve other changes in the existing
          environment which, due to their location or
          nature, could result in conversion of Farmland to
          non-agricultural use or conversion of forest land
          to non-forest use?
A)       No Impact. Baldwin Park does not contain any land designated as Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or
         Farmland of Statewide Importance according to the California Department of Conservation, Division of Land
         Resource Protection. No impact will occur.2
B)       No Impact. Baldwin Park allows for agricultural and horticultural cultivation within the Open Space Zone. Baldwin
         Park does not contain any existing land under Williamson Act contracts. The proposed Health and Sustainability
         Element encourages healthy lifestyles by identifying areas for community gardens and processes for implementing
         community gardens. These policies would provide the opportunity to local residents to grow produce. Action HS-
         17.6 of Goal HS-17 states that revisions to the zoning standards will be made to permit small-scale agriculture for

                                  front-yard food gardens.
C)       No Impact. Baldwin Park does not contain any land designated or zoned as forest land (as defined in Public
         Resources Code section 12220(g)), timberland (as defined by Public Resources Code section 4526), or timberland
         zoned Timberland Production (as defined by Government Code section 51104 (g)). No impact will occur.
D)       No Impact. Due to the urban character of Baldwin Park, there is no forest land. Therefore, there will be no loss of
         forest land or conversion of forest land as a result of implementation of the proposed Health and Sustainability
         Element.
E)       No Impact. There are no agricultural operations or forest land within the City. No impact related to the conversion
         of agricultural or forest lands will occur.

 Where available, the significance criteria established by the applicable air quality management or air pollution control
 district may be relied upon to make the following determinations. Would the project:

                                                             Impact               Mitigation          Impact
                                                                                Incorporation
 A)     Conflict with or obstruct implementation of
        the applicable air quality plan?
 B)     Violate any air quality standard or contribute
        substantially to an existing or projected air
        quality violation?
 C)     Result in a cumulatively considerable net
        increase of any criteria pollutant for which
        the project region is non-attainment under
        an applicable federal or state ambient air
        quality standard (including releasing
        emissions which exceed quantitative
        thresholds for ozone precursors)?
 D)     Expose sensitive receptors to substantial
        pollutant concentrations?
 E)     Create objectionable odors affecting a
        substantial number of people?
A)    No Impact. The City of Baldwin Park is located within the South Coast Air Basin (basin) under the jurisdiction of
      the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). SCAQMD and the Southern California Association of
      Governments (SCAG) are responsible for formulating and implementing the Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP)
      for the basin. The AQMP is a series of plans adopted for the purpose of reaching short- and long-term goals for
      those pollutants the basin is designated as a “nonattainment” area because it does not meet federal and/or State
      Ambient Air Quality Standards (AAQS). To determine consistency between the project and the AQMP, the project
      must comply with all applicable SCAQMD rules and regulations, comply with all proposed or adopted control
      measures, and be consistent with the growth forecasts utilized in preparation of the Plan.
      A significant impact could occur if the proposed project conflicts with or obstructs implementation of the South
      Coast Air Basin 2012 AQMP. Conflicts and obstructions that hinder implementation of the AQMP can delay efforts
      to meet attainment deadlines for criteria pollutants and maintaining existing compliance with applicable air quality
      standards. Pursuant to the methodology provided in Chapter 12 of the 1993 SCAQMD CEQA Air Quality
      Handbook, consistency with the South Coast Air Basin 2012 AQMP is affirmed when a project: 1) does not
      increase the frequency or severity of an air quality standards violation or cause a new violation and 2) is consistent
      with the growth assumptions in the AQMP. Consistency review is presented below.
     1.      The project does not involve any development activity. Thus, no impacts will result from Health and
             Sustainability Element adoption and implementation.
     2.      The CEQA Air Quality Handbook indicates that consistency with AQMP growth assumptions must be
             analyzed for new or amended General Plan elements, Specific Plans, and “significant projects.” Significant
             projects include airports, electrical generating facilities, petroleum and gas refineries, designation of oil drilling
             districts, water ports, solid waste disposal sites, and off-shore drilling facilities. The project consists of a
18                                                                       City of Baldwin Park Health and Sustainability Element

                                                                                                   Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
             General Plan amendment to adopt the proposed Health and Sustainability Element; therefore consistency
             analysis is required.
     The Health and Sustainability Element identifies programs and strategies to encourage compact development within
     Downtown, create more pedestrian friendly, bicycle friendly, and less auto centric streets, and promote activities and
     opportunities for a healthier lifestyle for the local community, including the use of multi-modal and alternative
     transportation methods. The Health and Sustainability Element builds upon planning initiatives started by the City in
     2002 with adoption of the new General Plan. This proposed Element was crafted to take goals from the Land Use
     and Urban Design Element, Circulation Element, Open Space and Conservation Element, and Air Quality Elements
     further and identified concrete implementation actions to achieve the goals set forth in the Health and Sustainability
     Element. Thus, this project is in compliance with the goals and initiatives contained in the Baldwin Park 2020
     General Plan.
     SCAG provides population projection estimates in five-year increments from 2005 to 2035. According to the latest
     growth forecast (2012), SCAG estimates that the City will have a population of 82,200 and the County will have a
     population of 11,353,000 in 2035.4 SCAG growth projections are utilized as the basis for both the Regional
     Transportation Plan (RTP) and the AQMP. Build-out of the General Plan will accommodate a population of 85,291
     persons in 2020, slightly higher than projected by SCAG, and thus provides sufficient residential land uses to
     accommodate growth projections for the City. The project indicates that there will be efforts in revitalizing the
     Downtown area which will result in a higher-intensity of residential and commercial uses in the area but the project
     does not involve any development activity or uses that would increase the number of vehicle trips or miles traveled
     in the City. The proposed project will not conflict with the AQMP; therefore no impacts will occur.
B)    No Impact. Because the proposed Health and Sustainability Element does not authorize any development project
      or land altering activity that will involve construction of new or redevelopment projects, it will not result in any direct
      emissions that could contribute to an existing or potential violation of an air quality standard. The Health and
      Sustainability Element will have no effect on rules and procedures governing assessment or control of air pollutant
      emissions.
      The proposed Health and Sustainability Element will not directly result in construction of any development or
      infrastructure; however, future development as foreseen in the General Plan will be supported by the policies of the
      Health and Sustainability Element. This development will result in short-term criteria pollutant emissions. Short-term
      criteria pollutant emissions will occur during site preparation, grading, building construction, paving, and painting
      activities associated with new development. Emissions will occur from use of equipment, worker, vendor, and
      hauling trips, and disturbance of onsite soils (fugitive dust).
      However, the proposed Health and Sustainability Element does not propose any land use changes that were not
      foreseen in the General Plan; therefore, this development has been analyzed and accounted for in the General
      Plan. Additionally, pursuant to CEQA, short-term, project-specific construction-related emissions will be analyzed
      for consistency with the General Plan analysis on a project-level basis as development proposals are submitted.
      Mitigation will be applied, where necessary. Such mitigation typically includes requirements for use of low-VOC
      paints, installation of diesel particulate filters on older construction equipment, and limitations on hauling distances
      and/or daily trips.
      Any future proposed development project will also be subject to SCAQMD’s rules and regulations. The Baldwin
      Park General Plan Air Quality Element includes goals and policies that encourage mixed-use development and
      pedestrian-oriented design to reduce pollutant emissions. With application of SCAQMD rules and General Plan Air
      Quality goals and policies, no new or more significant impacts relative to air quality standards will result from
      implementation of the Health and Sustainability Element beyond those analyzed in the General Plan EIR. The

Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
        proposed Health and Sustainability Element is consistent with the AQMP (see Section 4.3.a) and future
        development projects supported by the Health and Sustainability Element will be subject to environmental review to
        ensure that daily criteria pollutant thresholds will not be exceeded. The project does not involve any development
        activity; therefore no impact will occur.
C)      No Impact. SCAQMD has prepared an Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) to set forth a comprehensive and
        integrated program that will lead the Basin into compliance with the federal 24-hour PM2.5 air quality standard, and
        to provide an update to the SCAQMD’s commitments toward meeting the federal 8-hour ozone standards. The
        Basin is currently in non-attainment for State and Federal criteria pollutants ozone, nitrogen dioxide and fine
        particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10).5
        The project does not authorize construction or development of any buildings or structures. New development
        facilitated by the Health and Sustainability Element will be subject to the City’s standard development review
        process and is required to comply with SCAQMD rules and regulations aimed at reducing construction-related
        pollutant emissions, including fugitive dust and other particulates, as well as reactive organic compounds and other
        ozone precursors found in paints and other coatings.6 Considering that the proposed Health and Sustainability
        Element is consistent with the development projections of the Baldwin Park General Plan and the breadth of
        existing standards and regulations, implementation of the proposed Health and Sustainability Element policies and
        implementation programs will not change or otherwise interfere with the regional pollutant control strategies of the
        AQMP. Because the project will not involve any construction or development activity, no impacts will occur.
D)      No Impact. Common sensitive receptors include children under age 14, the elderly over age 65, athletes, and
        people with cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases. The project promotes planning initiatives and
        programs that encourage healthy, active living for all ages such as local recreational programs, compact
        development for increase walkability, and pedestrian and bicycle friendly streets. These initiatives and programs
        will likely accommodate children and the elderly; however, the proposed Health and Sustainability Element does
        not authorize construction or redevelopment of any buildings or structures. Future development will be subject to
        the City’s standard development review process pursuant to State CEQA statutes and guidelines which will ensure
        that any future development projects developed will provide adequate protection for residents from any local air
        pollution sources. The project will have no impacts on sensitive receptors.
E)      No Impact. According to the CEQA Air Quality Handbook, land uses associated with odor complaints include
        agricultural operations, wastewater treatment plants, landfill, and certain industrial operations (such as
        manufacturing uses that produce chemicals, paper, etc). Odors are typically associated with industrial projects
        involving the use of chemicals, solvents, petroleum products, and other strong-smelling elements used in
        manufacturing processes, as well as sewage treatment facilities and landfills. Residential and commercial land
        uses constructed pursuant to the Health and Sustainability Element typically do not create objectionable odors. No
        new odor sources will result from adoption or implementation of the proposed Health and Sustainability Element
        because it does not authorize construction of any new projects, redevelopment of any existing property, or any
        particular infrastructure construction project. No impact will occur.

City of Baldwin Park Health and Sustainability Element                                                          21

Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
A)      Less Than Significant Impact. Baldwin Park is predominately suburban in nature, with limited to no natural habit
        for special status species.7 Implementation of the Health and Sustainability Element does not involve any
        development activity that has not been previously analyzed in the General Plan EIR. Therefore, it is unlikely the
        Health and Sustainability Element will not impact any species identified as candidate, sensitive, or special status
        species in local or regional plans, policies, or regulations, or by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife
        Service. This impact is less than significant.
B)      No Impact. Walnut Creek Wash and the Walnut Creek Nature Park are located in Baldwin Park.8 Implementation
        of the Health and Sustainability Element does not involve any development activity along Walnut Creek Wash or a
        Walnut Creek Nature Park. The Health and Sustainability Element does not involve any development activity that
        has not been previously analyzed in the General Plan EIR and will not have a substantial adverse effect on any
        riparian habitat or other sensitive natural community identified in local or regional plans, policies, regulations, or by
        the California Department of Fish and Game or US Fish and Wildlife Service.9 No impact will occur.
C)      No Impact. The National Wetlands inventory has no data for the City of Baldwin Park; thus, it does not identify any
        wetlands as defined by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act within the City boundaries.10 No impact to Section 404
        wetlands from the proposed Health and Sustainability Element will occur.
D)      No Impact. Biological resources in Baldwin Park are limited due to the suburban nature of the City and
        surrounding area.11 There are no migratory wildlife corridors or nature wildlife nursery sites within the City. The
        proposed Health and Sustainability Element does not involve any construction or development activity that has not
        been previously analyzed in the General Plan EIR and will not interfere with the movement of any native resident or
        migratory fish or wildlife species or with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors or impede the use
        of native wildlife nursery sites. There will be no impact.
E)      Less Than Significant Impact. City of Baldwin Park Ordinance 153.165.090 governs tree preservation and
        protection. City of Baldwin Park Ordinance 97.131 governs the removal of City trees in parkways by private
        individuals. These ordinances require a tree removal permit prior to any removal of trees in the City. The project
        does not involve any development activity. Any tree removal resulting from future development activities will be
        subject to the environmental review and compliance with the ordinance. Therefore, there will be no conflict with any
        local policies or ordinances protecting biological resources; therefore, this impact will be less than significant.
F)      No Impact. According to the Conservation Plans and Agreements Database, no Habitat Conservation Plans or
        Natural Community Conservation Plans apply within the planning area.12 No impact will occur.

  A)     Cause a substantial adverse change in the
         significance of a historical resource as
         defined in '15064.5?
  B)     Cause a substantial adverse change in the
         significance of an archaeological resource
         pursuant to '15064.5?
  C)     Directly or indirectly destroy a unique
         paleontological resource or site or unique
         geologic feature?
  D)     Disturb any human remains, including those
         interred outside of formal cemeteries?
A)      No Impact. A number of buildings with historic, cultural, architectural, community, and aesthetic value exist
        throughout Baldwin Park13 and the City recognizes these historic resources are an important part of the community.
        The Baldwin Park Zoning Code contains a Historic Resources Code that protects and encourages the preservation
        of City’s heritage. The General Plan also contains goals to promote historic preservation of culturally significant
        buildings. As the Health and Sustainability Element does not authorize construction or redevelopment of any
        buildings or structures, there will be no impacts.
        Goal 8.0       Promote the preservation of historic resources in Baldwin Park.
        Policy 8.1     Implement provisions contained in the City’s Historic Resources Code to protect historically significant
                       structures.
        Policy 8.2     Encourage restoration of historic structures.
B)      No Impact. Although the City of Baldwin Park is built out, the presence of significant subsurface archaeological
        resources is always a possibility in areas where only surface inspections have taken place. Implementation of the
        proposed Health and Sustainability Element will not involve development activity therefore ground-disturbing
        activities will not occur. No impact will occur.
C)      No Impact. The City of Baldwin Park is located on the San Gabriel Valley Groundwater Basin.14 Soils of the basin
        consist of unconsolidated to semi-consolidated alluvium deposited by streams flowing out of the San Gabriel
        Mountains. These alluvial deposits are too young geologically to contain scientifically significant fossils in their
        original, undisturbed location and therefore are not considered paleontologically sensitive. Thus, paleontological
        resources could not be uncovered. In addition, the project will not involve development activity. No impact could
        occur.
D)      No Impact. The proposed Health and Sustainability Element does not authorize any construction of new projects
        or redevelopment of existing sites, and therefore will not result in any direct impacts to human remains. Procedures

Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
A.i,ii) No Impact. According to the State of California Department of Conservation, no Alquist-Priolo Fault Hazard Zones
        are located within the City of Baldwin Park. No impacts related to fault rupture could occur.15
A.iii) No Impact. According to the Baldwin Park General Plan EIR, the southwest portion of the City is located in a
        liquefaction hazard zone.16 As noted above, the City of Baldwin Park is located within a seismically active region of
        Southern California. Liquefaction hazards occur in areas where groundwater exists near the ground surface.
        According to the General Plan EIR, the depth to groundwater is more than 50 feet, resulting in low potential for
        liquefaction. Future development could expose residents and structures to risks associated with liquefaction. The
        project does not involve construction or development activity. Any future development will be subject to the City’s
        standard development review process and will require investigation for liquefaction potential. Because the project
        does not authorize development, no impact will occur.
A.iv) No Impact. According to the General Plan EIR, the City of Baldwin Park is not susceptible to dangers from slope
        instability because the terrain is relatively flat. Therefore, the proposed Health and Sustainability Element will not
        involve development activity and will not expose people or structures to potential substantial adverse effects,
        including risk of loss, injury or death involving landslides. No impact will occur.
B)      Less than Significant Impact. Erosion is the condition in which the earth’s surface is worn away by the action of
        water and wind. The City of Baldwin Park is relatively flat and built out. Because the City is primarily built out and
        covered by urban landscaping or impermeable surfaces, the potential for soil erosion or loss of topsoil of topsoil is
        minimal. Future development is subject to standard development review process pursuant to City and CEQA
        regulations. Therefore, to the proposed Health and Sustainability Element policies will not result in the substantial
        loss of topsoil or substantial erosion. Impacts will be less than significant.
C)      Less than Significant Impact. Liquefaction and seismically induced settlement or ground failure are generally
        associated with strong seismic shaking in areas where ground water tables are at relatively shallow depths (within
        50 feet of the ground surface) and/or when the area is underlain by loose, cohesion less deposits. During a strong
        ground shaking event, saturated, cohesion less soils may acquire a degree of mobility to the extent that the
        overlying ground surface distorts. In extreme cases, saturated soils become suspended in groundwater and
        become fluid-like. Seismic settlement often occurs when loose to medium dense granular soils settle during ground
        shaking, and can cause structural damage to buildings when settlement is non-uniform. Such ground settlement
        hazards may be identified by on-site geologic investigations that are required of individual developments.
        According to the General Plan EIR, the depth to groundwater is more than 50 feet. Therefore, the potential for
        liquefaction hazard is low, even in areas that have been designated as being subject to liquefaction (see Section
        3.6.a.iii above). There are no known ongoing or planned large-scale extractions of groundwater, gas, oil, or
        geothermal energy that will cause subsidence within Baldwin Park. Therefore, impacts associated with subsidence
        will be less than significant.
        Lateral spreading is unlikely to occur within the City due to the lack of topography and unchannelized waterbodies.
        Topsoil, recent alluvium, and weathered bedrock are typically porous and may be subject to hydro-collapse;
        therefore, these materials can be considered unsuitable for the support of engineered fills and structures. General
        Plan Public Safety Element Policy 1.2 requires the implementation of Uniform Building Code seismic safety
        standards for the construction of new buildings. In addition, the California Building Code requires all new
        development to have a site specific geology report prepared by a registered geologist or soils expert and submitted
        to the City for review, which will ensure impacts related to expansive soils will be evaluated on a project-by-project
        basis. The project will not involve development activity. Any future development will be subject to compliance with

      Public Safety Policy 1.2 of the General Plan and the California Building Code to ensure potential impacts of
      liquefaction will be less than significant.
D)    Less than Significant Impact. Expansion and contraction of volume can occur when expansive soils undergo
      alternating cycles of wetting (swelling) and drying (shrinking). During these cycles, the volume of the soil changes
      markedly and can cause structural damage to building and infrastructure if the potentially expansive soils were not
      considered in project design and construction. Compaction of loose soils and poorly consolidated alluvium occur as
      a result of strong seismic shaking. The amount of compaction may vary from a few inches to several feet and may
      be significant in areas of thick soil cover. Topsoil, recent alluvium, and weathered bedrock are typically porous and
      may be subject to hydro-collapse; therefore, these materials can be unsuitable for the support of engineered fills
      and structures.
      Unconsolidated to semi-consolidated alluvium underlie Baldwin Park. Therefore, these soils are considered
      potentially expansive. The proposed Health and Sustainability Element does not involve construction or
      development activity and future developments are subject to the City’s standard development review process. The
      CBC requires that a soil and geological report be prepared for any development, including future development.
      Presence of expansive soils and identification of measures to eliminate this constraint (such as removal and
      replacement with suitable engineered materials) will be determined through site-specific geotechnical evaluations
      to be conducted as part of the City’s routine development review procedures. Such routine procedures will apply to
      all future development projects. As such, potential impacts associated with expansive soils will be less than
      significant.
E)    No Impact. The City of Baldwin Park is served by the Los Angeles Sanitation District with a network of sewer lines.
      Septic tanks are not used in the City. No impact will occur.

                                                                                       Incorporation
  A)     Generate greenhouse gas emissions, either
         directly or indirectly, that may have a significant
         impact on the environment?
  B)     Conflict with an applicable plan, policy or
         regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing
         the emissions of greenhouse gases?
A)     Less than Significant Impact. Climate change is the distinct change in measures of climate for a long period of
       time. Climate change is the result of numerous, cumulative sources of greenhouse gas emissions all over the
       world. Natural changes in climate can be caused by indirect processes such as changes in the Earth’s orbit around
       the Sun or direct changes within the climate system itself (i.e. changes in ocean circulation). Human activities can
       affect the atmosphere through emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) and changes to the planet’s surface. Human
       activities that produce GHGs are the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas for heating and electricity,
       gasoline and diesel for transportation); methane from landfill wastes and raising livestock, deforestation activities;
       and some agricultural practices.17
       Greenhouse gases differ from other emissions in that they contribute to the “greenhouse effect.” The greenhouse
       effect is a natural occurrence that helps regulate the temperature of the planet. The majority of radiation from the
       Sun hits the Earth’s surface and warms it. The surface in turn radiates heat back towards the atmosphere, known
       as infrared radiation. Gases and clouds in the atmosphere trap and prevent some of this heat from escaping back
       into space and re-radiate it in all directions. This process is essential to supporting life on Earth because it warms
       the planet by approximately 60° Fahrenheit. Emissions from human activities since the beginning of the industrial
       revolution (approximately 250 years ago) are adding to the natural greenhouse effect by increasing the gases in the
       atmosphere that trap heat, thereby contributing to an average increase in the Earth’s temperature. Greenhouse
       gases occur naturally and from human activities. Greenhouse gases produced by human activities include carbon
       dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and
       sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Since 1750, it is estimated that the concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and
       nitrous oxide in the atmosphere have increased over 36 percent, 148 percent, and 18 percent, respectively,
       primarily due to human activity. Emissions of greenhouse gases affect the atmosphere directly by changing its
       chemical composition while changes to the land surface indirectly affect the atmosphere by changing the way the
       Earth absorbs gases from the atmosphere.
       The proposed Health and Sustainability Element does not involve construction or development activity. The
       proposed Health and Sustainability Element does not propose any land use changes that were not foreseen in the
       General Plan; therefore, any GHG emissions resulting from this development have been analyzed and accounted
       for in the General Plan EIR. Any future development will be subject to the City’s standard development review
       process which includes measuring GHG emissions. GHG emissions for potential development can be quantified
       utilizing the California Emissions Estimator Model (CalEEMod) to determine if the project could have a cumulatively
       considerable impact related to greenhouse gas emissions. A numerical threshold for determining the significance of
       greenhouse gas emissions in the South Coast Air Basin has not officially been adopted by the SCAQMD. Individual
       projects may be required to have a greenhouse gas emissions inventory prepared to determine if individual projects
       exceed applicable screening or impact thresholds and will thus potentially contribute substantially to climate change

                                                                                                  Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
        and associated impacts. Adoption and implementation of the Health and Sustainability Element will not generate
        GHG emissions, either directly or indirectly, that may have a significant impact on the environment as the project
        does not authorize construction activity or new development. No impact will occur.
B)      Less than Significant Impact. Significant impacts will occur if the proposed project conflicted with or interfered
        with implementation of any existing GHG reduction plan that is projected to achieve greenhouse gas reduction
        targets. The two primary reduction plans are California Air Resources Board (CARB) Scoping Plan and SCAG’s
        Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy (RTP/SCS) as discussed below.
        California Air Resources Board Scoping Plan (AB32)
        The CARB Scoping Plan is the comprehensive plan to reach the GHG reduction targets stipulated in AB32. The
        key elements of the plan are to expand and strengthen energy efficiency programs, achieve a statewide renewable
        energy mix of 33 percent, develop a cap-and-trade program with other partners in the Western Climate Initiative
        (includes seven states in the United States and four territories in Canada), establish transportation-related targets,
        and establish fees.18 CARB estimates that implementation of these measures will reduce GHG emissions in the
        state by 136 MMTCO2E by 2020; therefore, implementation of the Scoping Plan will meet the 2020 reduction target
        of 80 MMTCO2E, which is a reduction of 27 percent compared to the projected business as usual 507 MMTCO2E.
        Many of the strategies identified in the Scoping Plan are not applicable at the General Plan or project level, such as
        long-term technological improvements to reduce emissions from vehicles. Some measures are applicable and
        supported by the project, such as provision of mixed-use developments. Finally, while some measures are not
        directly applicable, the project will not conflict with their implementation. The reduction measures are grouped into
        18 action categories. The reduction measures and their consistency with AB32 Scoping Plan are described, as
        follows:
        1. California Cap-and-Trade Program Linked to Western Climate Initiative Partner Jurisdictions.
              Implement a broad-based California cap-and-trade program to provide a firm limit on emissions. Link the
              California cap–and-trade program with other Western Climate Initiative Partner programs to create a regional
              market system to achieve greater environmental and economic benefits for California.19 Ensure California’s
              program meets all applicable AB 32 requirements for market-based mechanisms. These programs involve
              capping emissions from electricity generation, industrial facilities, and broad-scoped fuels. The project does
              not involve any such uses.
        2. California Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Standards. Implement adopted Pavley standards and
              planned second phase of the program. Align zero-emission vehicle, alternative and renewable fuel and vehicle
              technology programs with long-term climate change goals. This measure is not applicable as this is a
              statewide measure establishing vehicle emissions standards.
        3. Energy Efficiency. Maximize energy efficiency building and appliance standards, and pursue additional
              efficiency efforts including new technologies, and new policy and implementation mechanisms. Pursue
              comparable investment in energy efficiency from all retail providers of electricity in California (including both
              investor-owned and publicly owned utilities). The Health and Sustainability Element promotes energy-efficient
              building design, as well as implementation of existing building and other codes regulating minimum energy,
              water, and waste efficiency consistent with 2011 CALGREEN requirements and will thus be consistent and not
              interfere with this program.
        4. Renewables Portfolio Standards. Achieve 33 percent renewable energy mix statewide by 2020. This
              establishes the minimum statewide renewable energy mix and is not applicable at a City level or below for

Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
              implementation. The proposed Health and Sustainability Element will not interfere with the implementation of
              this program.
        5. Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Develop and adopt the Low Carbon Fuel Standard. This measure is not
              applicable to a City as this establishes reduced carbon intensity of transportation fuels.
        6. Regional Transportation-Related Greenhouse Gas Targets. Develop regional greenhouse gas emissions
              reduction targets for passenger vehicles. As is detailed below, the proposed Health and Sustainability Element
              will not conflict with and will support the implementation of SCAG’s RTP/SCS to achieve the required GHG
              reduction goals by 2020 and 2035 based on consistency with growth projections. The Health and Sustainability
              Element, as well as the Baldwin Park General Plan, includes policies to reduce vehicle miles traveled by
              encouraging mixed-use, infill, an improved jobs-housing balance, and alternative modes of transportation.
        7. Vehicle Efficiency Measures. Implement light-duty vehicle efficiency measures. This measure is not
              applicable to a city as this identifies measures such as minimum tire-fuel efficiency, lower friction oil, and
              reduction in air conditioning use.
        8. Goods Movement. Implement adopted regulations for the use of shore power for ships at berth. Improve
              efficiency in goods movement activities. Identifies measures to improve goods movement efficiencies such as
              advanced combustion strategies, friction reduction, waste heat recovery, and electrification of accessories.
              The proposed Health and Sustainability Element will not result in the development of uses that will involve the
              movement of goods and therefore will not interfere with eventual implementation.
        9. Million Solar Roofs Program. Install 3,000 megawatts of solar-electric capacity under California’s existing
              solar programs. Sets goal for use of solar systems throughout the state. The proposed Health and
              Sustainability Element will not interfere with but instead will directly support installation of alternative energy
              sources through City policies and programs.
        10. Medium- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles. Adopt medium-duty (MD) and heavy-duty (HD) vehicle efficiencies.
              Aerodynamic efficiency measures for HD trucks pulling trailers 53-feet or longer that include improvements in
              trailer aerodynamics and use of rolling resistance tires were adopted in 2008 and went into effect in 2010.20
              Future, yet to be determined improvements, includes hybridization of MD and HD trucks. The proposed Health
              and Sustainability Element will not result in development of industrial uses and therefore will not interfere with
              implementation of this program.
        11. Industrial Emissions. Require assessment of large industrial sources to determine whether individual
              sources within a facility can cost-effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide other pollution
              reduction co-benefits. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fugitive emissions from oil and gas extraction
              and gas transmission. Adopt and implement regulations to control fugitive methane emissions and reduce
              flaring at refineries. These measures are applicable to large industrial facilities (> 500,000 MTCO2E/YR) and
              other intensive uses such as refineries. The proposed Health and Sustainability Element will not result in the
              development of these facilities and therefore will not interfere with implementation.
        12. High Speed Rail. Support implementation of a high speed rail system. This is not applicable as the Health
              and Sustainability Element has no bearing on high speed rail facilities.
        13. Green Building Strategy. Expand the use of green building practices to reduce the carbon footprint of
              California’s new and existing inventory of buildings. The Baldwin Park Health and Sustainability Element
              promotes energy efficient building design as well as implementation of existing building and other codes

                                                                                       Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
           regulating minimum energy, water, and waste efficiency consistent with 2011 CALGREEN requirements and
           will thus be consistent and not interfere with this program.
      14. High Global Warming Potential Gases. Adopt measures to reduce high global warming potential gases.
           The proposed Health and Sustainability Element will not directly result in generation of high global warming
           potential gases, and will not interfere with implementation of any future changes in air conditioning, fire
           protection suppressant, or other emission requirements.
      15. Recycling and Waste. Reduce methane emissions at landfills. Increase waste diversion, composting and
           other beneficial uses of organic materials, and mandate commercial recycling to move toward zero-waste.
           The proposed Health and Sustainability Element is consistent with this program because the project includes
           programs to increase composting and recycling and reduce waste.
      16. Sustainable Forests. Preserve forest sequestration and encourage the use of forest biomass for sustainable
           energy generation. The 2020 target for carbon sequestration is 5 million MTCO2E/YR. This measure is not
           applicable as the City does not contain any areas defined as forest.
      17. Water. Continue efficiency programs and use cleaner energy sources to move and treat water. The proposed
           Health and Sustainability Element is consistent since development that could occur under it will include use of
           low-flow fixtures and water-efficient landscaping per State and local requirements.
      18. Agriculture. In the near-term, encourage investment in manure digesters and at the five-year Scoping Plan
           update determine if the program should be made mandatory by 2020. The proposed Health and Sustainability
           Element encourages development of community gardens, but does not involve any large-scale agricultural
           activity.
      As summarized above, the proposed Health and Sustainability Element will not conflict with Regional
      Transportation-Related GHG targets or any of the other provisions of the Scoping Plan. The proposed Health and
      Sustainability Element in fact supports four of the action categories through energy efficiency, green building,
      recycling/waste, and water conservation through these proposed and current policies.
      Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy (SB375)
      The 2012 Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy and the goals, policies, and programs
      included within it are projected to obtain and exceed applicable GHG reduction targets of eight percent by 2020
      and 13 percent by 2035. Projected reductions by the RTP/SCS are nine percent by 2020 and 16 percent by 2035.
      Ultimately, the RTP/SCS is keyed to implement the requirements of AB32 at the regional level. For a program-level
      analysis, if the proposed Health and Sustainability Element is consistent with the assumptions of the RTP/SCS,
      then long-term development within the planning area will meet regional reduction targets. Furthermore, long-term
      development will meet the broader statewide reduction goals of 1990 levels by 2020 and 80 percent beyond that by
      2050. The proposed Health and Sustainability Element will, therefore, not contribute substantially to climate change
      impacts if it is consistent with the regional and statewide climate change planning efforts.
      The Health and Sustainability Element includes sections discussing potential energy conservation opportunities,
      including increased densities within the Downtown area, programs to increase composting and recycling to reduce
      energy consumption and waste, and policies to encourage use of alternative energy sources. Implementation of the
      Health and Sustainability Element will promote healthier and more sustainable lifestyles for the City through its
      goals, policies, and program actions that are consistent with all applicable plans aimed at reducing GHG emissions.
      The project will not involve construction activity or new development. Impacts will be less than significant.

  A)   Create a significant hazard to the public or the
       environment through the routine transport,
       use, or disposal of hazardous materials?
  B)   Create a significant hazard to the public or the
       environment through reasonably foreseeable
       upset and accident conditions involving the
       release of hazardous materials into the
       environment?
  C)   Emit hazardous emissions or handle
       hazardous or acutely hazardous materials,
       substances, or waste within one-quarter mile
       of an existing or proposed school?
  D)   Be located on a site which is included on a list
       of hazardous materials sites compiled
       pursuant to Government Code Section
       65962.5 and, as a result, would it create a
       significant hazard to the public or the
       environment?
  E)   For a project located within an airport land use
       plan or, where such a plan has not been
       adopted, within two miles of a public airport or
       public use airport, would the project result in a
       safety hazard for people residing or working in
       the project area?
  F)   For a project within the vicinity of a private
       airstrip, would the project result in a safety
       hazard for people residing or working in the
       project area?
  G)   Impair implementation of or physically
       interfere with an adopted emergency

  H)   Expose people or structures to a significant
       risk of loss, injury or death involving wildland
       fires, including where wildlands are adjacent
       to urbanized areas or where residences are
       intermixed with wildlands?
A-B) No Impact. The Baldwin Park Health and Sustainability Element is a policy document intended to promote
     healthier and more sustainable lifestyles for the Baldwin Park community through various goals, policies, and
     program actions aimed at compact development in the Downtown area, complete streets, reduction of GHG
     emissions, more recreational activity for all ages, and so forth. The project will not involve development activity that
     were not foreseen in the General Plan and therefore, analyzed and accounted for in the General Plan EIR. The
     proposed Housing Element will not conflict with any hazardous materials regulations and will not exempt any future
32                                                                  City of Baldwin Park Health and Sustainability Element

                                                                                                    Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
        housing from the City’s programs to control and safely dispose of hazardous materials and wastes or to reduce the
        volume of wastes requiring landfill disposal. Thus, no impact will result.
C)      No Impact. The Health and Sustainability Element will not involve development activity and will not generate
        hazardous air emissions and will not involve the handling of any acutely hazardous substances or wastes. Thus,
        the project will not result in impacts related to the presence of any hazardous materials or emissions within one
        quarter mile of a school. No impact will occur.
D)      Less than Significant Impact. According to the databases maintained as the Cortese List, one site within the City
        boundaries is identified on the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) Hazardous Waste and Substances
        Site List or the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) list of cleanup sites.21 There is potential soil and/or
        groundwater contamination due to a leaking underground storage tank (LUST) at a site along Los Angeles Street.
        The LUST site is OSFA Enterprises located at 13623 Los Angeles Street. A site assessment was performed in
        September 1989, but no further action is noted.22 The project will not involve development activity. Any future
        development at potential building or community garden sites will be s subject to the City’s standard environmental
        review process that will include identification of any contaminated sites and implementation of appropriate cleanup
        and disposal procedures, if needed. Impacts will be less than significant.
E)      No Impact. The City of Baldwin Park is not located within an airport land use plan influence area. The El Monte
        Airport is located approximately 1.8 miles from the southwestern border of the city. The proposed Health and
        Sustainability Element will not involve development activity therefore no impact will occur.23
F)      No Impact. There are no private airstrips within the vicinity of the City of Baldwin Park. There will be no impact.24
G)      No Impact. The Baldwin Park General Plan establishes policies regarding adequate emergency response in the
        event of a disaster, including Public Safety Policy 1.3 that requires the implementation of emergency procedures
        contained in the City’s Multi-hazard Functional Plan and Supplemental Emergency Preparedness Plans. The
        Health and Sustainability Element will not change or interfere with the emergency response plans of the City and
        does not propose any alteration to vehicle circulation routes that could interfere with such plans. In accordance with
        City policies, the City will review all development proposals to determine the possible impacts of each development
        on emergency services. No impact will occur.
        Policy 1.3     Continue to implement emergency procedures contained in the City’s Multi-hazard Functional Plan and
                       Supplemental Emergency Preparedness Plans.
H)      No Impact. Baldwin Park is not located within a Fire Hazard Severity Zone, as documented on the latest maps
        prepared by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.25 Due to the urban character of Baldwin
        Park and the surrounding area, there are no wildland conditions in the City. No impact will occur.

 A)   Violate any water quality standards or waste
      discharge requirements?
 B)   Substantially deplete groundwater supplies or
      interfere substantially with groundwater
      recharge such that there would be a net deficit
      in aquifer volume or a lowering of the local
      groundwater table level (e.g., the production
      rate of pre-existing nearby wells would drop to
      a level which would not support existing land
      uses or planned uses for which permits have
      been granted)?
 C)   Substantially alter the existing drainage pattern
      of the site or area, including through the
      alteration of the course of a stream or river, in a
      manner which would result in substantial
      erosion or siltation on- or off-site?
 D)   Substantially alter the existing drainage pattern
      of the site or area, including through the
      alteration of the course of a stream or river, or
      substantially increase the rate or amount of
      surface runoff in a manner which would result
      in flooding on- or off-site?
 E)   Create or contribute runoff water which would
      exceed the capacity of existing or planned
      stormwater drainage systems or provide
      substantial additional sources of polluted
      runoff?
 F)   Otherwise substantially degrade water quality?
 G)   Place housing within a 100-year flood hazard
      area as mapped on a federal Flood Hazard
      Boundary or Flood Insurance Rate Map or
      other flood hazard delineation map?
 H)   Place within a 100-year flood hazard area
      structures which would impede or redirect flood
      flows?
 I)   Expose people or structures to a significant risk
      of loss, injury or death involving flooding,
      including flooding as a result of the failure of a
      levee or dam?
 J)   Inundation by seiche, tsunami, or mudflow?
34                                                                City of Baldwin Park Health and Sustainability Element

                                                                                                 Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
A)     Less than Significant Impact. The project is a policy document that facilitates the production of residential and
       commercial uses within the Downtown area and does not include any components that will change or conflict with
       water quality regulations or any waste discharge standards. All new development projects must comply with the
       City’s local procedures to control storm water runoff to prevent violations of regional water quality standards, in
       accordance with its co-permittee obligations under the countywide municipal storm water permit program, a
       component of the NPDES program of the federal Clean Water Act. New project proposals will be required to
       comply with Chapter 52 of the Municipal Code, which contains regulations to meet federal and State water quality
       requirements related to storm water runoff. General Plan Open Space and Conservation Policy 5.4 requires the
       continued enforcement of municipal NPDES Permit to protect and improve the quality of local and regional
       groundwater resources available to the City. Impacts will be less than significant.
       Policy 5.4       Continue enforcement of municipal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
                        Permit to protect water quality within the San Gabriel River watershed.
B)     Less than Significant Impact. Potable water in the City of Baldwin Park is provided by three water companies:
       Valley County Water District (VCWD), San Gabriel Valley Water Company, and Valley View Mutual Water
       Company (VMWC). VCWD is the largest water supplier in the City and serves approximately 55,000 people in parts
       of Baldwin Park and neighboring cities. Its main water source is wells beneath the district’s service area from the
       Upper San Gabriel Groundwater Basin, including four wells in Baldwin Park. The San Gabriel Valley Water
       Company supplies water exclusively from groundwater wells to customers in Baldwin Park and surrounding cities.
       Most of the wells are located in Baldwin Park and El Monte, and six of the company’s reservoirs serve Baldwin
       Park. VCWD supplies water to approximately eight percent of Baldwin Park’s population.
       VCWD has not reached its maximum capacity for water production from wells. Baldwin Park makes up
       approximately 48 percent of the VCWD. Total water use in 2010 was 8,313 acre feet per year (AFY) for the entire
       VCWD service area in 2010 and is projected to increase to 9,536 AFY in 2025. According to the 2010 Urban Water
       Management Plan, VCWD is capable of meeting all demand scenarios with its current supply including normal
       year, single dry year, and multiple dry year supply and demand conditions.26
       The Urban Water Management Plan indicated that sufficient water supplies are available to protect existing and
       future water needs within the VCWD service area. The existing water supply is sufficient to meet widespread
       demand without substantially lowering groundwater levels. The City has identified the protection and conservation
       of its existing and future water resources within the General Plan, Open Space and Conservation Element policies
       listed below.
       Goal 5.0       Conserve and protect groundwater supply and water resources.
       Policy 5.1    Encourage water conservation through education, use of drought tolerant landscapes, and water-
                     conserving technology.
       Policy 5.2    Promote the use of native plant material in landscapes and drought tolerant trees, especially in
                     landscapes of City properties.
       Policy 5.3     Encourage use and production of reclaimed water.
       In addition, Goal HS-8 of the Health and Sustainability Element also aims to protect and conserve groundwater
       levels through various means. Policies are listed below. As the project does not involve development activity that
       was not foreseen in the General Plan, any water usage resulting from this development has been analyzed and
       accounted for in the General Plan EIR. Therefore, impacts related to groundwater recharge and depletion will be
       less than significant.

Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
        Goal HS-8 Achieve a high level of water conservation, and continue to improve quality of local
                       groundwater.
        Policy 8.01 Promote drought-tolerant landscaping and water conservation technologies and techniques
        Policy 8.02 Protect and restore above and below ground water bodies from the negative impacts of stormwater
                       pollution.
C)      Less than Significant Impact. The City of Baldwin Park is largely developed. Wind and water both cause erosion
        that could be deposited in local or regional washes and other water bodies. Due to the urbanized nature of the City,
        future development will not substantially alter the drainage pattern of the area, and will not result in substantial
        erosion or siltation on or off site. The project will not involve development activity. Future development proposed
        pursuant to the Health and Sustainability Element will be required to implement standard on-site drainage controls
        and storm water conveyance devices to direct any drainage appropriately, during construction and operation of
        future projects. Impacts related to erosion and siltation will be less than significant.
D)      Less than Significant Impact. Due to the developed nature of the City, future development will not substantially
        alter the drainage pattern of the area, and will not substantially increase the rate of surface run-off that will cause
        flooding on or off site. The Health and Sustainability Element does not authorize construction of development and
        also includes policies and program actions that promote reduction of impervious surfaces in the City. Thus, impacts
        associated with on- or off-site flooding will be less than significant.
        Goal HS-8 Achieve a high level of water conservation, and continue to improve quality of local
                       groundwater.
        Policy 8.03 Reduce the amount of impervious surfaces in the City through selection of materials, site planning, and
                       street design.
E)      Less than Significant Impact. Residential and commercial development in a built-out area typically do not
        generate significant water pollutants through point discharges but do contribute to water quality impacts due to
        community-wide and regional urban runoff. The project does not authorize the construction or development of new
        structures. New development projects associated with the implementation of the proposed Health and
        Sustainability Element will be required to ensure project-specific and citywide drainage systems have adequate
        capacity to accommodate new development. The Zoning Code includes design and maintenance guidelines such
        as requiring parking lots to be designed in a manner that collects surface runoff consistent with the requirements of
        the NPDES permit. Compliance with the City’s Municipal Code Chapter 52: Storm Water and Urban Runoff
        Pollution Prevention and the Zoning Code design standards relating to drainage will ensure drainage system
        capacity impacts are less than significant.
F)      No Impact. The proposed Health and Sustainability Element does not authorize construction or redevelopment of
        any development and will not result in any new or more extensive sources of water pollutants. No other impacts to
        water quality will occur.
G)      No Impact. The City is not located within a 100-year flood hazard area and the National Flood Insurance Program
        rate maps classify all of Baldwin Park as Area C, with little chance of flooding. No impact will occur.27
H)      No Impact. The City is not located within a 100-year flood hazard area and the National Flood Insurance Program
        rate maps classify all of Baldwin Park as Area C, with little chance of flooding. The project does not involve

        development activity; future development will be reviewed at the individual project level to ensure that structures
        will not impede or redirect flood flows. Therefore, no impact will occur.28
I)      Less than Significant Impact. The City could be subject to inundation if the Santa Fe Dam were to fail. The Army
        Corps of Engineers flood emergency plan data indicate that failure of the Santa Fe Dam will result in the entire City
        of Baldwin Park being flooded. Water depths will range from 2 to 12 feet, with shallow depths located at a farther
        distance from the dam. According to the Baldwin Park General Plan, flooding as a result of the failure of this dam is
        considered unlikely due to the method of construction and the dam’s past performance during previous
        earthquakes. Thus, less than significant impacts are anticipated. The project will not authorize construction activity
        or new development. Future development will be subject to comply with the goals and policies of the General Plan
        that serve to reduce potential impacts related to flooding. Flooding risk is addressed in the City’s Multi-hazard
        Functional Plan and Supplemental Emergency Preparedness Plans. Compliance with the General Plan Public
        Safety Element goals and policies and the City’s Multi-hazard Functional Plan and Supplemental Emergency
        Preparedness Plans will reduce flood impacts to less than significant.
        Goal 2.0       Protect Baldwin Park residents, the work force, and visitors from flood hazards.
        Policy 2.1     Work in cooperation with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works to identify and construct
                       needed local and regional storm drain improvements to relieve localized flooding problems.
        Policy 2.2     Maintain the City’s Multi-hazard Functional Plan and Supplemental Emergency Preparedness Plans in
                       a current and continual state of readiness to respond to flooding, as well as other emergencies.
J)      No Impact. A tsunami is a large wave that generates in the ocean, generally from an earthquake, and builds
        intense strength and height before impacting a coast. Baldwin Park is not subject to impacts from a tsunami
        because it is not located near an ocean or sea. A seiche is the process by which water sloshes outside its
        containing boundaries, generally due to an earthquake. This generally occurs with uncovered, above-ground
        reservoirs. According to the General Plan, Baldwin Park is not exposed to seiche hazards because the project
        area is not located near a lake, reservoir, or other open body of water. Mudflows require a slope, water, and
        unconsolidated soil to occur. The project area is not subject to mudflows because the entire City does not contain
        steep slopes. No impacts will occur.

A)     No Impact. The proposed Health and Sustainability Element sets forth goals, policies, and program actions to
       encourage healthier and more sustainable lifestyles for Baldwin Park through compact development in the
       Downtown area, complete streets, and recreational activities for all ages and does not authorize the construction of
       new structures or development. Implementation of the Health and Sustainability Element will not provide for new
       infrastructure systems such as new roadways or flood control channels that will divide or disrupt established
       neighborhoods. No impact will occur.
B)     No Impact. The Baldwin Park Health and Sustainability Element sets forth policies to encourage healthier and
       more sustainable communities consistent with adopted policies established in the General Plan. The Health and
       Sustainability Element does not involve construction and development activity or include any goals, policies, or
       programs that will conflict with adopted General Plan goals and policies to mitigate environmental effects. The
       Health and Sustainability Element is consistent with and will complement and further the goals of the adopted City
       of Baldwin General Plan. No impact will occur.

  A)      Result in the loss of availability of a known
          mineral resource that would be of value to
          the region and the residents of the state?
  B)      Result in the loss of availability of a locally-
          important mineral resource recovery site
          delineated on a local general plan, specific
          plan or other land use plan?
A)      No Impact. State guidelines require that the City of Baldwin Park and other cities establish policies within their
        General Plans to manage identified mineral resource areas of statewide or regional significance. The location and
        level of importance of these mineral resource areas is determined by the California Department of Conservation,
        California Geological Survey. Since 1982, all of Baldwin Park has been designated by the State Geologist as a
        Mineral Resource Zone 2 (MRZ-2) where “adequate information indicates that significant mineral deposits are
        present or where it is judged that a high likelihood for their presence exists.” Given the MRZ-2 designation and the
        active extraction activities in surrounding areas, it is highly likely that mineral resources exist in Baldwin Park.
        However, the City is largely built out with urban uses that are incompatible with mineral extraction and/or surface
        mining activities. Thus, the Health and Sustainability Element and General Plan policies do not provide for mining
        activity to occur. In a regional context, potential resources in Baldwin Park are limited in extent and inaccessible
        due to urbanization; thus, impacts on aggregate resources are not considered significant.30
B)      No Impact. Neither the General Plan nor any other City planning documents identify any locally important mineral
        resource recovery sites within the City. No impact will occur.31

Fundamentals of Sound and Environmental Noise
Noise can be defined as unwanted sound. Because the City is fully urbanized, the primary noise source in the
community is traffic noise.
Sound (and therefore noise) consists of energy waves that people receive and interpret. Sound pressure levels are
described in logarithmic units of ratios of sound pressures to a reference pressure, squared. These units are called bels.
In order to provide a finer description of sound, a bel is subdivided into ten decibels, abbreviated dB. To account for the
range of sound that human hearing perceives, a modified scale is utilized known as the A-weighted decibel (dBA). Since
decibels are logarithmic units, sound pressure levels cannot be added or subtracted by ordinary arithmetic means For
example, if one automobile produces a sound pressure level of 70 dBA when it passes an observer, two cars passing
simultaneously would not produce 140 dB. In fact, they would combine to produce 73 dBA. This same principle can be
applied to other traffic quantities as well. In other words, doubling the traffic volume on a street or the speed of the traffic
will increase the traffic noise level by 3 dBA. Conversely, halving the traffic volume or speed will reduce the traffic noise
level by 3 dBA. A 3 dBA change in sound is the level where humans generally notice a barely perceptible change in
sound and a 5 dBA change is generally readily perceptible.32

Noise consists of pitch, loudness, and duration; therefore, a variety of methods for measuring noise has been developed.
According to the California General Plan Guidelines for Noise Elements, the following are common metrics for measuring
noise:33
        LEQ (Equivalent Energy Noise Level): The sound level corresponding to a steady-state sound level containing the
        same total energy as a time-varying signal over given sample periods. LEQ is typically computed over 1-, 8-, and
        24-hour sample periods.
        CNEL (Community Noise Equivalent Level): The average equivalent A-weighted sound level during a 24-hour
        day, obtained after addition of five decibels to sound levels in the evening from 7:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M. and after
        addition of ten decibels to sound levels in the night from 10:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M.
        LDN (Day-Night Average Level): The average equivalent A-weighted sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained
        after the addition of ten decibels to sound levels in the night after 10:00 P.M. and before 7:00 A.M.
CNEL and LDN are utilized for describing ambient noise levels because they account for all noise sources over an
extended period of time and account for the heightened sensitivity of people to noise during the night. LEQ is better
utilized for describing specific and consistent sources because of the shorter reference period.
Fundamentals of Environmental Groundborne Vibration
Vibration is sound radiated through the ground. The rumbling sound caused by the vibration of room surfaces is called
groundborne noise. The ground motion caused by vibration is measured as particle velocity in inches per second, and in
the U.S. is referenced as vibration decibels (VdB).
The background vibration velocity level in residential and educational areas is usually around 50 VdB. The vibration
velocity level threshold of perception for humans is approximately 65 VdB. A vibration velocity level of 75 VdB is the
approximately dividing line between barely perceptible and distinctly perceptible levels for many people. Sources within
buildings such as operation of mechanical equipment, movement of people, or the slamming of doors causes most
perceptible indoor vibration. Typical outdoor sources of perceptible groundborne vibration are construction equipment,
steel-wheeled trains, and traffic on rough roads. If a roadway is smooth, the groundborne vibration from traffic is rarely
perceptible. The range of interest is from approximately 50 VdB, which is the typical background vibration velocity level,
and 100 VdB, which is the general threshold where minor damage can occur in fragile buildings.
The general human response to different levels of groundborne vibration velocity levels is described in Table 4 (Human
Reaction to Vibration).
                                                                              Table 4
                                                             Human Reaction to Vibration

                                     65 VdB                               Approximate threshold of perception for many people.
                                                                          Approximate dividing line between barely perceptible and
                                     75 VdB                               distinctly perceptible. Many people find that transportation-

                                                                          Vibration acceptable only if there are an infrequent number of
                                     85 VdB

Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
A)    Less than Significant Impact. The primary contributor to ambient noise in the planning area is traffic, particularly
      from major roadways such as Interstate 10 (I-10) and Interstate 605 (I-605). The proposed Health and
      Sustainability Element does not authorize construction of new structures or development. Future development
      proposed pursuant to the Health and Sustainability Element has been analyzed and accounted for in the General
      Plan EIR. Additionally, this future development will be subject to the City’s standard development review process.
      To determine if future development will be exposed to ambient noise levels in excess of the noise level standards
      established in Baldwin Park, noise levels from future traffic volumes have been estimated and compared to the
      City’s noise level standards. The Baldwin Park General Plan identifies standards for residential land uses and noise
      compatibility, as summarized in Table 5 (City of Baldwin Park Noise Ordinance Standards).
                                                                    Table 5

      Future development will be subject to standard environmental review pursuant to CEQA and the City’s local
      implementation procedures. This typically includes preparation of a project-specific noise impact analysis to
      determine if the development will be exposed to excessive noise levels and identify appropriate mitigation. The
      most common type of exterior mitigation involves barriers that could include walls. Interior noise levels will be
      controlled through common building techniques, particularly in specifying window requirements with minimum
      standard transmission coefficient. Impacts related to exposure of persons to ambient noise levels in excess of
      identified standards will be less than significant with implementation of the noise policies in the Baldwin Park
      General Plan and Zoning Code.
      Future development pursuant to the proposed Health and Sustainability Element is subject to the policies of the
      existing General Plan designed to minimize noise impacts to residential properties. Noise policies will be
      implemented during the City’s standard environmental review process during the entitlement process for future
      developments. Impacts to new development related to noise levels in excess of established standards and
      permanent increase in ambient noise will be less than significant with implementation of General Plan policies,
      Zoning Code requirements, and State interior noise standards.
B)    Less than Significant Impact. Vibration can impact people, structures, and sensitive equipment. The primary
      concern related to vibration and people is the potential to annoy those working and residing in the area. Vibration
      with high enough amplitudes can damage structures (such as crack plaster or destroy windows). Groundborne
      vibration can also disrupt the use of sensitive medical and scientific instruments such as electron microscopes.
      Implementation of the proposed Health and Sustainability Element will not involve development activity and does
      not include uses that cause vibration. However, the General Plan EIR analyzed and accounted for future buildout of
      land uses in the City and included mitigation measures that the City would apply to development. Additionally, any
      future development will be subject to the City’s standard development review process.
      Groundborne vibration generated by construction projects is usually highest during pile driving, rock blasting, soil
      compacting, jack-hammering, and demolition-related activities. Next to pile driving, grading activity has the greatest
42                                                                           City of Baldwin Park Health and Sustainability Element

                                                                                           Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
      potential for vibration impacts if large bulldozers or large trucks are used. Future development, once constructed,
      do not utilize machinery that will generate substantial amounts of vibration. However, the construction of future
      potential developments could utilize machinery that will generate substantial amounts of ground vibration.
      Construction of future development is not likely to require rock blasting considering the built-out character of the
      area or pile driving because the area is not subject to liquefaction hazards; however, jack hammering will also likely
      be required for demolition activities.
      Table 6 (Common Construction Vibration) summarizes vibration levels from common construction equipment.
      Impacts to structures can occur from 0.08 PPV to 2.00 PPV depending on the duration of the vibration and the age
      of the structure. Similarly, human annoyance to vibration can occur from 0.01 PPV to 2.00 PPV depending on the
      duration.

      Vibration impacts are temporary and rare except in cases where large equipment is used near existing, occupied
      development. Construction noise and associated vibration will be controlled through the time restrictions currently
      established in the City’s Noise Control requirements. Section 130.37E of the Municipal Code requires that
      construction activity and equipment maintenance is limited to the hours between 7:00 A.M. to 7:00 P.M. These
      restrictions will minimize potential annoyance impacts to nearby residential development during sensitive evening
      and noise hours. Noise and vibration impacts will be evaluated on a project-by-project basis pursuant to CEQA and
      the City’s local implementation procedures. Vibration is difficult to control and the best methods for mitigation are
      avoidance. Typical vibration mitigation includes routing and placement of equipment to maximize distance to
      receptors and use of alternative equipment, such as use of drilled pile drivers as opposed to impact drivers.
      Subsurface dampeners can also be utilized to reduce groundborne vibration. As the project will not involve
      construction of new structures and any future development pursuant to the Health and Sustainability Element will
      be subject to comply with local environmental review procedures, impacts related to exposure to groundborne
      vibration will be less than significant.
C)    Less than Significant Impact. The project will create a significant noise impact if it causes an adopted noise
      standard to be exceeded for the project site or for adjacent receptors. The proposed Health and Sustainability
      Element does not involve construction of new development and will not increase residential densities and
      commercial intensities that were not foreseen in the General Plan. Therefore the project will not increase ambient
      noise from traffic or operational sources beyond those analyzed in the General Plan EIR. Impacts will be less than
      significant.
D)    Less than Significant Impact. The Health and Sustainability Element does not authorize development on any
      particular site but does include policies that could facilitate future development. Future development pursuant to the
      proposed Health and Sustainability Element will result in periodic noise outdoors associated with landscaping

Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
     activities, solid waste and recycling pick-up, and people talking outside on the common areas in commercial
     spaces. Typical periodic noise associated with housing is solid waste pick-up and deliveries at commercial portions
     of mixed-use developments. These are common noises in an urban setting.
     Temporary increase in local noise levels will be associated with construction activities to new development.
     Construction noise will be controlled through the time restrictions currently established in the City’s Noise Control
     requirements (Section 130.37E of the Municipal Code). Furthermore, future development will be subject to the
     City’s standard environmental review procedures to ensure that temporary and periodic noise is assessed and
     mitigated, if necessary. Continued enforcement of the City’s noise restrictions and environmental review
     procedures will ensure temporary and periodic noise impacts associated with new development will be less than
     significant.
E)   No Impact. The City of Baldwin Park is not located within an Airport Land Use Plan. No impact will occur.
F)   No Impact. There are no private airstrips in the vicinity of Baldwin Park. No impact will result.

                                                                             Incorporation
  A)    Induce substantial population growth in an
        area, either directly (for example, by
        proposing new homes and businesses) or
        indirectly (for example, through extension of
        roads or other infrastructure)?
  B)    Displace substantial numbers of existing
        housing, necessitating the construction of
        replacement housing elsewhere?
  C)    Displace substantial numbers of people,
        necessitating the construction of replacement
        housing elsewhere?
A)    Less than Significant Impact. Population growth is a complex interaction among immigration, emigration, birth,
      deaths, and economic factors. The proposed Health and Sustainability Element is designed to promote healthier
      and more sustainable lifestyles for the community through various goals, policies, and program actions but does
      not involve construction of new structures or development. The project intends to promote compact development
      within the Downtown area, increase the number of complete streets to facilitate walkability, bicycle and transit use,
      and more recreational activities. The goals and policies in the Health and Sustainability Element are consistent with
      other Elements in the Baldwin Park General Plan. As the Health and Sustainability Element is consistent with the
      other Elements in the General Plan, the increase in population from future development project resulting from
      Health and Sustainability Element policies is within the growth assumptions estimated by SCAG and analyzed by
      the General Plan EIR. Therefore, implementation of the Health and Sustainability Element will not induce growth
      beyond that already planned. Impacts will be less than significant.
B)    Less than Significant Impact. The proposed Health and Sustainability Element is designed to promote healthier
      and more sustainable lifestyles for the community through various goals, policies, and program actions. The City is
      urbanized and largely built out. The Health and Sustainability Element proposes to encourage revitalization of the
      Downtown area by promoting higher-intensity residential and commercial land uses to encourage compact
      development but does not authorize construction or development activity that would displace substantial numbers
      of existing housing, necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere. Thus, impact will be less
      than significant.
C)    Less than Significant Impact. The proposed Health and Sustainability Element will not directly displace any
      people because the project does not authorize the demolition or conversion of any residential development. The
      Health and Sustainability Element will encourage higher-intensity residential and commercial uses in the Downtown
      area. The Downtown area is already urbanized with residential and commercial uses and the project does not
      propose changes to any existing development or land. To accommodate higher-intensity residential and
      commercial uses, underutilized parcels may be developed with uses that promote the goals of the Health and
      Sustainability Element. However, any land use changes resulting in redevelopment has been analyzed and
      accounted for in the General Plan EIR. The proposed Health and Sustainability Element will not influence economic
      factors, such as the relocation of a large employment base to a different region that could require the construction
      of new housing. Impacts will be less than significant.

Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
4.14 – PUBLIC SERVICES
  Would the project result in substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or physically
  altered governmental facilities, need for new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of which
  could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or
  other performance objectives for any of the public services:
                                                                Potentially        Less Than           Less Than           No

                                                                  Impact           Mitigation             Impact
                                                                                 Incorporation
  A)         Fire protection?
  B)         Police protection?
  C)         Schools?
  D)         Parks?
  E)         Other public facilities?
A-E) Less than Significant Impact. The Baldwin Park Health and Sustainability Element sets forth goals, policies and
      program actions to encourage healthier and more sustainable lifestyles through compact development in the
      Downtown area, complete streets, programs for reduction of waste, water use, and GHG emissions, and additional
      recreational activities for the residents that are consistent with adopted General Plan polices. The project does not
      propose development activity that was not foreseen in the General Plan, and has been analyzed and accounted for
      in the General Plan EIR. Future development constructed pursuant to Health and Sustainability Element will
      incrementally increase the need for fire and police protection, schools, and parks. The General Plan EIR indicates
      that build-out of the land use plan will result in significant impacts to parks, schools, fire, police, and library services.
      Fire and Police Services
      The following Public Safety Element policies are designed to ensure adequate provision of public services in
      response to long-term growth. Property taxes and other special taxes paid by future property owners will also
      support the incremental expansion of public services as the population in the City grows. Impacts to fire and police
      services will be less than significant.
      Goal 5.0      Provide a safe environment for the community of Baldwin Park.
      Policy 5.1    Periodically evaluate levels of service to ensure Baldwin Park has appropriate levels of police service.
      Policy 5.2    Continue the City’s aggressive program of Community Based Policing to enhance public awareness
                    and participation in crime prevention.
      Policy 5.3    Continue to cooperate with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office, along with other nearby police
                    departments, to provide back-up police assistance in emergency situations.
      Policy 5.4    Promote the use of defensible space concepts (e.g. site and building lighting, visual observation of
                    open spaces, secured areas) in project design to enhance public safety.
      Schools
      Any impact on the provision of school services created by buildout of development resulting from the General Plan,
      including the Health and Sustainability Element is mitigated through the payment of development impact fees
      pursuant to the Leroy F. Green School Facilities Act. With payment of required fees, impact will be less than
      significant.
      Parks
      The provision of parks is guided by the policies of the General Plan Open Space and Conservation Element that
      promotes the long-term increase in parkland and recreational facilities implemented utilizing a number of financing
46                                                                      City of Baldwin Park Health and Sustainability Element

                                                                                        Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
      strategies (see below). The City requires dedication of land or payment of a fee in lieu thereof or a combination of
      both as a condition of approval for residential subdivisions. The purpose of the dedication and/or fee is to provide
      parks and recreation facilities. Dedication and/or payment of the fee will help to reduce potential impacts of future
      residential development on parks and recreational facilities. In addition, the General Plan policies and
      implementation measures will assist in reducing the impact on parks. Impacts will be less than significant.
      Goal 3.0      Ensure that parks are accessible and safe for their users and compatible with adjacent
                    residences and commercial uses.
      Policy 3.1    Ensure that all parks are adequately illuminated for safe use at night.
      Policy 3.2    Provide for the supervision of park activities, and promote enforcement of codes restricting illegal
                    activity.
      Policy 3.3    Continue coordination of park security between the Recreation and Community Services Department
                    and the Police Department to ensure that they are adequately patrolled.
      Policy 3.4    Restrict and control nighttime park use so that adjacent residences are not adversely affected.
      Goal 4.0      Ensure that the costs of park and recreation facilities and programs are borne by those who
                    benefit and contribute to additional demands.
      Policy 4.1    Require that developers contribute to provide parks and recreational facilities to offset additional
                    demands brought about by new development.
      Policy 4.2    Pursue the utilization of various state and county funding mechanisms to provide additional funding
                    resources.
      Policy 4.3    Establish a formal mechanism by which the City may accept gifts and dedications of parks and open
                    space.
      Policy 4.4    Encourage the development of recreation programs by non-City public and private sports
                    organizations to involve more children and adults in outdoor recreation activity. Use volunteers to
                    operate and maintain programs whenever possible.
      The Health and Sustainability Element promotes healthier and more sustainable lifestyles through various goals,
      policies, and actions including improving and providing more park space to provide additional opportunities for
      recreation and physical activities. Implementation of Goal HS-13 (listed in Section 4.15) of the Health and
      Sustainability Element will also reduce the impacts on parks to less than significant.
      Other Public Facilities – Libraries
      The City of Baldwin Park is served by one public library; Baldwin Park Library. The Baldwin Park Library, located at
      4181 Baldwin Park Boulevard, is part of the Los Angeles County library system. This allows for seamless borrowing
      within the County of Los Angeles. The 15,555-square foot library includes a meeting room, children’s area, teen
      space, book drop for 24-hour accessible returns, and a reading room. The library is currently under renovation and
      will reopen September 2, 2014. With the renovations, the library will adequately serve the City. Impacts will be less
      than significant.

   A)     Would the project increase the use of
          existing neighborhood and regional parks or
          other recreational facilities such that
          substantial physical deterioration of the
          facility would occur or be accelerated?
   B)     Does the project include recreational
          facilities or require the construction or
          expansion of recreational facilities which
          might have an adverse physical effect on the
          environment?
A)      Less than Significant Impact. The City of Baldwin Park maintains six City-owned parks totaling 26 acres. These
        include one community park, the 12 acre Morgan Park located in the Central Business District, and five
        neighborhood parks, Central Park West, Barnes Park, Roadside Park, Walnut Creek Nature Park, and Syhre Park.
        Residents also have access to approximately 169 acres of joint-use school playground facilities. In addition to the
        City parks, residents have access to County regional parks within and near the City. The National Recreation and
        Parks Association (NRPA) established a guideline of 2.5 acres of public park service and facilities.34 With a
        population of approximately 76,635 (2013 Census count), the City should have approximately 192 acres of parks.
        Based on the 27 acres of public park land, Baldwin Park has about 0.35 acres of park space per 1,000 residents,
        which is significantly less than NRPA recommendations. Therefore, the City has an existing deficiency.
        The proposed Health and Sustainability Element does not authorize the construction of new structures or
        development. Any development that would occur has been analyzed and accounted for in the General Plan EIR.
        Future development constructed pursuant to the project will be subject to local environmental and development
        review procedures. As a condition of approval for new development, the City requires dedication of land or payment
        of a fee in lieu or a combination of both. The purpose of the dedication and/or fee is to provide parks and recreation
        facilities. Dedication and/or payment of the fee help to reduce potential impacts of future development on parks and
        recreational facilities. Any future development will be required to pay development impact fees; thus, deterioration
        to existing parks and recreation facilities will be less than significant as a result of future development because
        parks and recreation facilities will be incrementally expanded or new facilities built to meet future demand. In
        addition, the following existing General Plan Open Space and Conservation policies require the preservation of
        existing park space, encourage diverse recreational programs, and require developers to contribute to parks and
        recreational facilities.
        Goal 1.0       Provide and maintain adequate parks and open space.
        Policy 1.1     Preserve all existing park space, and provide improvements to enhance utilization.
        Policy 1.2     Establish as a priority for funding the acquisition and development of parks and recreational facilities in
                       neighborhoods where there are a shortage of parks.
        Policy 1.3     Pursue acquisition of property through purchase or donation to create mini-parks where it is not
                       possible to acquire sufficient acreage for neighborhood parks.
        Policy 1.4     Continue to work cooperatively with the Baldwin Park Unified School District to maintain and expand
                       playground use.

      Goal 2.0     Provide a diversity of recreational programs to meet the needs of all individuals and groups in
                   Baldwin Park.
      Policy 2.1   Conduct ongoing needs assessment and evaluation of demands for recreational activities, and modify
                   programs where necessary to meet these demands.
      Policy 2.2   Notify City residents of the types of recreation and programs available, and encourage their
                   participation.
      Policy 2.3   Incorporate areas for both active and passive recreation in parks and facilities, and ensure that these
                   are accessible to all age groups, as practical.
      Goal 4.0     Ensure that the costs of park and recreation facilities and programs are borne by those who
                   benefit and contribute to additional demands.
      Policy 4.1   Require that developers contribute to provide parks and recreational facilities to offset additional
                   demands brought about by new development.
      Policy 4.2   Pursue the utilization of various state and county funding mechanisms to provide additional funding
                   resources.
      Policy 4.3   Establish a formal mechanism by which the City may accept gifts and dedications of parks and open
                   space.
      Policy 4.4   Encourage the development of recreation programs by non-City public and private sports
                   organizations to involve more children and adults in outdoor recreation activity. Use volunteers to
                   operate and maintain programs whenever possible.
      The Health and Sustainability Element promotes healthier and more sustainable lifestyles through various goals,
      policies, and actions including improving and providing more park space to provide additional opportunities for
      recreation and physical activities. Implementation of Goal HS-13 of the Health and Sustainability Element will also
      reduce the impacts on parks to less than significant.
      Goal HS-13             Provide residents of all ages with a range of safe and accessible opportunities for
                             recreation and physical activities.
      Policy 13.01           Prioritize the maintenance and expansion of existing parks, recreation facilities, and open
                             space amenities.
      Policy 13.02           Build new park spaces and recreational facilities that respond to the community’s changing
                             demographics.
      Policy 13.03           Facilitate pedestrian, bicycle, and transit connections to new and existing parks and
                             recreational facilities to enhance use and access.
B)    Less than Significant Impact. The Health and Sustainability Element does not authorize the development of
      parks and recreation facilities on any particular site but does include policies that could facilitate development of
      future public parks and recreation facilities. Future construction of recreation facilities pursuant to the
      implementation of the Health and Sustainability Element will be subject to the City’s standard environmental review
      process pursuant to CEQA. As mentioned in Section 4.14, the City also applies their parkland dedication/in lieu fee
      to ensure park facilities within the City do not substantially deteriorate from development within the City, including
      that which may come from the implementation of the Health and Sustainability Element. Impacts related to the
      potential construction of future parks and recreation facilities, as they relate to the Health and Sustainability
      Element, will be less than significant.

  A)   Conflict with an applicable plan, ordinance or
       policy establishing measures of effectiveness
       for the performance of the circulation system,
       taking into account all modes of transportation
       including mass transit and non-motorized
       travel and relevant components of the
       circulation system, including but not limited to
       intersections, streets, highways and freeways,
       pedestrian and bicycle paths, and mass
       transit?
  B)   Conflict with an applicable congestion
       management program, including, but not
       limited to level of service standards and travel
       demand measures, or other standards
       established by the county congestion
       management agency for designated roads or
       highways?
  C)   Result in a change in air traffic patterns,
       including either an increase in traffic levels or
       a change in location that results in substantial
       safety risks?
  D)   Substantially increase hazards due to a
       design feature (e.g., sharp curves or
       dangerous intersections) or incompatible uses
       (e.g., farm equipment)?
  E)   Result in inadequate emergency access?
  F)   Conflict with adopted policies, plans, or
       programs regarding public transit, bicycle, or
       pedestrian facilities, or otherwise decrease the
       performance or safety of such facilities?
A)   Less than Significant Impact. The Health and Sustainability Element does not propose any changes to General
     Plan land use policy. The General Plan estimates that 60 percent of the increase in traffic over time is expected to
     be generated by new development. Although the project does not propose any specific construction or
     development activity, development that may occur under the Health and Sustainability Element has been analyzed
     and accounted for in the General Plan EIR. Issues associated with ambient growth and traffic will be monitored by
     the City and mitigated on a project-by-project basis.. Future development will be subject to local environmental
     review procedures that include traffic assessments. Where traffic studies are required, they will identify project-
     specific traffic generation, traffic distribution, impacted intersections and roadways, project-specific fair-share
     improvement fees, and applicable regional transportation fees. General Plan Circulation Element policies maintain
     level of services standards and goals, as well as encourage land use and circulation planning to support the use of
50                                                                 City of Baldwin Park Health and Sustainability Element

      alternative transportation. Policies in the Health and Sustainability Element support the maintenance and reduction
      of level of service standards and goals by promoting compact development in the Downtown area, increasing
      number of complete streets in the City to encourage walkability, increase bicycle and transit use, and reduce
      dependence of automobiles. Impacts related to substantial traffic congestion will be less than significant with
      implementation of the following existing Circulation Element and proposed Health and Sustainability Element goals
      and policies.
      Circulation Element Goals and Policies

City of Baldwin Park Health and Sustainability Element                                                                    51

Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
B)      Less than Significant Impact. The Congestion Management Program (CMP) is administered by the Los Angeles
        County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro). The CMP establishes a service goal of LOS E or better on all
        CMP roadway segmenst. CMP facilities within Baldwin Park include I-10 and I-605. The proposed Health and
        Sustainability Element does not involve construction or development activity that has not been analyzed and
        accounted for in the General Plan EIR. Any future development will be required to prepare a traffic impact analysis
        to determine if it creates i a substantial change to the level of service. For purposes of the CMP, substantial
        changes for freeway segments are defined as an increase or decrease of 0.10 in demand to capacity (D/C) ratio
        and a corresponding change in LOS.35 The City will determine if a traffic impact analysis is required as part of the
        City’s standard project review process and determine potential future impacts to CMP facilities. Impacts related to
        level of service standards on CMP facilities will be less than significant.
C)      No Impact. The proposed Health and Sustainability Element is focused on achieving healthy and sustainable
        objectives and does not authorize any construction that will result in the need to redirect or otherwise alter air traffic
        patterns. Furthermore, the proposed Health and Sustainability Element will not result in substantial population
        growth that could significantly increase air traffic. Therefore, the project will have no air traffic impacts.
D)      No Impact. The project does not involve the construction of any roadway but will have an effect on the City’s street
        and site design standards. The Health and Sustainability Element encourages street design to increase the number
        of complete streets within the City of Baldwin Park by supporting traffic-calming improvements such as improved
        roadway design, clearly marked crosswalks and bike lanes, speed bumps, median islands, and other traffic-calming
        measures. Other potential programs include improvements to shading, lighting, and signage.36 These programs,
        however, will not substantially increase hazards due to design features or incompatible uses but will help reduce
        hazards and increase pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular safety. No impact will occur.
E)      Less than Significant Impact. The project does not involve any road construction or any development activity
        and thus will not obstruct or restrict emergency access to or through the City. Future development facilitated by
        implementation of the Health and Sustainability Element policies will be subject to local site plan review. In
        conjunction with the review and approval of building permits, the County Fire Department reviews all plans to
        ensure compliance with all applicable emergency access and safety requirements. With continued application of
        project review procedures, impacts involving emergency access will be less than significant.
F)      No Impact. The proposed Health and Sustainability Element policies and programs will not conflict with or have an
        effect on any local or regional policies involving support of alternative transportation. The Health and Sustainability
        Element does not conflict with General Plan transportation policies that support public transit and will not interfere
        with the current or future goals involving the local bus systems or Metrolink transit options. In addition, the project
        encourages walking, bicycling, and the use of public transit. The project will have no impact on alternative
        transportation plans.37

4.17 – UTILITIES AND SERVICE SYSTEMS
   Would the project:
                                                                Potentially           Less Than         Less Than        No

                                                                                    Incorporation
   A)    Exceed wastewater treatment requirements of
         the applicable Regional Water Quality Control
         Board?
   B)    Require or result in the construction of new
         water or wastewater treatment facilities or
         expansion of existing facilities, the
         construction of which could cause significant
         environmental effects?
   C)    Require or result in the construction of new
         storm water drainage facilities or expansion of
         existing facilities, the construction of which
         could cause significant environmental effects?
   D)    Have sufficient water supplies available to
         serve the project from existing entitlements
         and resources, or are new or expanded
         entitlements needed?
   E)    Result in a determination by the wastewater
         treatment provider which serves or may serve
         the project that it has adequate capacity to
         serve the project’s projected demand in
         addition to the provider’s existing
         commitments?
   F)    Be served by a landfill with sufficient permitted
         capacity to accommodate the project’s solid
         waste disposal needs?
   G)    Comply with federal, state, and local statutes
         and regulations related to solid waste?
A)     Less than Significant Impact. Wastewater treatment services for the City of Baldwin Park are provided by Los
       Angeles County Sanitation District (LACSD). Wastewater treatment requirements for the Los Angeles County
       Sanitation District treatment facilities are established by the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board
       (RWQCB).38 These treatment requirements establish pollutant limits for effluent discharges to receiving waters.
       The project will not result in construction of new structures or development that requires additional wastewater
       treatment services that was not accounted for and analyzed in the General Plan EIR. Future housing development
       pursuant to the proposed Health and Sustainability Element will result in typical residential wastewater discharges,
       and will not require new methods or equipment for treatment that are not currently permitted for the existing
       treatment plants. The project will not result in an increase in wastewater to such an extent that RWQCB treatment
       requirements cannot be met. Future development will not interfere with compliance with RWQCB wastewater
       treatment requirements; thus, no impacts will be less than significant.

City of Baldwin Park Health and Sustainability Element                                                                        53

Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
B)      Less than Significant Impact. The proposed Health and Sustainability Element will not involve construction or
        development activity. Future development pursuant to the project will incrementally increase water demand and
        wastewater discharges. Wastewater is treated at the San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Plant near the City of
        Whittier, where it is treated and reused as groundwater recharge and irrigation of parks, schools, and greenbelts.
        LACSD indicates that presently no deficiencies or significant treatment capacity limitations exist within their
        facilities. According to LACSD, the district has adequate capacity to accommodate development associated with
        implementation of the proposed project.39
        The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, Sewer Maintenance Division, and the Baldwin Park
        Engineering Division consider the sewer line system adequate to handle foreseeable future development. The City
        will identify the need for expansion of water and wastewater facilities, such as water and sewer mains, as needed,
        on a project-by-project basis during its standard environmental review process. Any environmental impacts related
        to the construction or expansion of water or wastewater facilities will be analyzed and mitigated for at the time of
        development. The City has adopted policies in the General Plan to reduce potential growth-related impacts
        associated with future development. With adherence to the policies identified in the existing General Plan Open
        Space and Conservation Element, impacts related to the expansion of water and wastewater facilities will be less
        than significant.
        Policy 1.1     Work closely with local water and sewer districts in determining and meeting community needs for
                       water and sewer service.
        Policy 1.2     Permit development densities and intensities no higher than the City’s ability to provide the necessary
                       public services, utilities, street capacities, and recreational opportunities required for the areas affected
                       by development.
C)      Less than Significant Impact. The proposed Health and Sustainability Element is focused on achieving local
        health and sustainability objectives and does not authorize any construction that will result in the need of new storm
        water drainage facilities or the expansion of existing facilities. Drainage improvements are constructed on a project-
        by-project basis. Construction of drainage devices will be subject to standard construction requirements for erosion
        control and water quality requirements. Future development built pursuant to the proposed Health and
        Sustainability Element and accounted for and analyzed in the General Plan EIR will comply with existing standards
        and regulations for conveyance of stormwater; thus, impacts to the environment from construction of storm drain
        infrastructure will be less than significant.
D)      Less than Significant Impact. Potable water in Baldwin Park is provided by three water companies: Valley
        County Water District (VCWD), San Gabriel Valley Water Company, and Valley View Mutual Water Company
        (VVMWD). VCWD is the largest water supplier and serves approximately 55,000 people. VCWD has the capacity
        to produce 15 million gallons of water per day (mgd). However, the average production is 7 to 8 mgd. Water
        supplied by VCWD is from wells at a depth of approximately 600 feet in the Upper San Gabriel Groundwater Basin.
        The proposed Health and Sustainability Element will not result in any population growth or additional demand on
        water supplies as it does not authorize the construction of new development. The Element will guide development
        to achieve healthier and more sustainable lifestyles through compact development, complete streets, programs to
        reduce GHG emissions, and increased opportunities for recreation and physical activities. Future development has
        been previously accounted for and analyzed in the General Plan EIR and will be subject to the City’s standard
        environmental review process pursuant to CEQA. Therefore, the proposed Health and Sustainability Element will
        not result in the need for new or expanded water supplies, and impact will be less than significant.40
E)      Less than Significant Impact. Wastewater treatment requirements are established by the Los Angeles RWQCB.
        The proposed Health and Sustainability Element is a policy-based document that encourages healthy and

                                                                                        Evaluation of Environmental Impacts
      sustainable objectives and does not authorize the construction of new structures or development. The City will
      review future development pursuant to the project as part of the standard environmental review process to
      determine adequate capacity to serve the discharge needs in comparison to treatment plant capacity. Impacts
      related to wastewater treatment capacity are anticipated to be less than significant.
F)    Less than Significant Impact. The El Sobrante Landfill in Corona, operated by the County Sanitation Districts of
      Los Angeles County, is the primary destination for solid waste collected in Baldwin Park. The current capacity for
      the landfill is approximately 16,054 tons per day of solid waste. The landfill is currently 12% filled with a remaining
      capacity of 145,530,000 tons from its maximum permitted capacity of 184,930,000 tons and anticipates a closing
      date of January 1, 2045. Other landfills are also available to serve the City. The Chiquita Canyon Sanitary Landfill,
      located in Castaic, has a permitted daily capacity of 6,000 tons per day and a total capacity of 63,900,00 cubic
      yards, with a remaining capacity of 29,300,000 cubic yards. The Chiquita Canyon Landfill is estimated to close in
      2019. Regional plans are underway to transport waste by rail to landfill sites in the desert areas to the east.
      Compliance with existing General Plan Open Space and Conservation policies (see below) and County waste
      reduction programs and policies will reduce the volume of solid waste entering landfills. The project does not
      involve construction or development activities not accounted for and analyzed in the General Plan EIR; therefore, it
      will not generate amounts of solid waste that will impact the landfills serving the City. Individual development
      projects within the City will be required to comply with applicable State and local regulations, thus reducing the
      amount of landfill waste by at least 50 percent. The Health and Sustainability Element also includes the section
      “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Compost” which aims to increase composting, recycling and source reduction
      citywide to meet and exceed the mandates of the AB 939 (California Recycling Laws). Implementation of the
      project will help reduce solid waste citywide. Impacts related to sufficient landfill capacity are anticipated to be less
      than significant.
      Open Space and Conservation Element Goals and Policies
      Goal 7.0       Reduce the amount of solid waste produced in Baldwin Park.
      Policy 7.1     Implement goals and policies contained in the City’s Household Hazardous Waste and Source
                     Reduction and Recycling Elements as mandated by AB939, as amended.
      Policy 7.2     Maximize public awareness of all source reduction and recycling programs.
      Policy 7.3     Encourage composting of organic materials and recycling in general as an alternative to waste
                     disposal.
      Policy 7.4     Encourage participation in local and County waste disposal programs for such household hazardous
                     waste items as automotive products, paints, chemicals, tires, and batteries.
      Health and Sustainability Element Goals and Policies
      Policy 6.01 Encourage residents and businesses to take an active role in reducing consumption and increase the
                     recycling, reuse, and composting of materials.
      Policy 6.02 Reduce consumption and increase recycling and reuse of materials in City operations.
G)    No Impact. Residential waste collection in Baldwin Park is disposed of in regional landfills, as described above.
      The proposed Health and Sustainability Element does not authorize the construction of new structures or
      development. All new development will be required to comply with State mandates and City regulations regarding
      reduction/recycling of household waste. None of the proposed policies inherent in the proposed Health and
      Sustainability Element will have any effect upon or result in any conflicts with solid waste disposal regulations. No
      impact will occur.

                                                                             Incorporation
 A)    Does the project have the potential to
       degrade the quality of the environment,
       substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or
       wildlife species, cause a fish or wildlife
       population to drop below self-sustaining
       levels, threaten to eliminate a plant or animal
       community, reduce the number or restrict the
       range of a rare or endangered plant or animal
       or eliminate important examples of the major
       periods of California history or prehistory?
 B)    Does the project have impacts that are
       individually limited, but cumulatively
       considerable?
 C)    Does the project have environmental effects
       which will cause substantial adverse effects
       on human beings, either directly or indirectly?
A)   Less than Significant Impact. The results of the preceding analysis indicate that the proposed project will have
     no effect upon sensitive biological, historical, or paleontological resources, and will not result in significant impacts
     to archaeological resources with mitigation incorporated. There will be no impact to scenic vistas and less than
     significant impacts to visual character and resources. The proposed Health and Sustainability Element is a policy-
     based document that encourages healthy and sustainable objectives. Because the project will not authorize any
     plan to develop new development or to redevelop existing sites and will not change existing City land use policy
     regarding locations or intensities of residential development, it will not result in any effects that will degrade the
     quality of the environment. The City hereby finds that impacts related to degradation of the environment will be less
     than significant, that no impacts to biological and cultural resources will occur.
B)   Less than Significant Impact. Cumulative effects resulting from full implementation of the City’s residential land
     use policies were evaluated in the General Plan EIR. The proposed Health and Sustainability Element does not
     involve construction or development activity and will not change any of these policies and does not propose any
     specific development or redevelopment project that could contribute to short-term or long-term cumulative impacts
     that were not addressed sufficiently in the General Plan EIR. The Health and Sustainability Element does not have
     any changes to land use designations; thus is consistent with the project analyzed in the General Plan EIR. The
     City thereby finds that the contribution of the proposed project to cumulative impacts will be less than significant.
C)   Less than Significant Impact. As supported by the preceding environmental evaluation, the project will not result
     in substantial adverse effects on human beings. Under each environmental consideration addressed in the
     preceding analysis, the proposed project is considered to have little or no adverse impacts on people and the
     environment. Based on the analysis in this Initial Study, the City finds that direct and indirect impacts to human
     beings will be less than significant.
