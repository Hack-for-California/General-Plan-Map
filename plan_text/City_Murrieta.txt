          Chapter 3:
Land Use Element
 
3.1         INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Element establishes the anticipated patterns of development activity and land
use that support, implement, and enhance the City’s future vision. The Land Use Element will
provide the primary guidance in the way Murrieta grows and changes over the next 25 years. It
will serve as the City’s primary policy guidance tool for land use decision-making and expresses
the type, intensity, and distribution of land uses.
A key component of the Land Use Element is the Land Use Policy Map, which depicts the
location of the permitted type and density/intensity of all land uses within the City. Other
components include a summary of existing land uses in the City, quantification of 2035 buildout,
discussion of focus areas, and the fundamental goals and policies that provide the framework
for land use planning and decision making in the City.
The following Community Priorities relate most directly to this Element:
        Pursue economic vitality and longevity by attracting higher education and growing a
        base of clean industry, while maintaining the current housing affordability.
        Protect and foster a strong sense of community and safety, as well as the “small town”
        feeling.
        Preserve elements of Murrieta’s rural heritage.
        Protect the natural beauty of the mountains, hills, and waterways.
        Provide abundant parks and facilities for recreational activities, and cultural amenities.
                                                 3-1

3.2          AUTHORITY FOR ELEMENT
California Government Code Section 65560 (a) requires that the General Plan address:
     “...a Land Use Element which designates the proposed general distribution and general
     location and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space
     including agriculture, natural resources, recreation and enjoyment of scenic beauty,
     education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities and
     other categories of public and private uses of land.”
3.3          SETTING THE CONTEXT:
             KEY ISSUES AND CHALLENGES
The Land Use Element is intended to enhance the community through the application of land
use policies that reflects the community’s current and envisioned needs. Murrieta recognizes
that the effective management of growth and change must address the key factors in order to
influence the successful implementation of the community’s priorities.
GROWTH AND CHANGE
The City of Murrieta’s General Plan includes both the incorporated City Limits and the Sphere of
Influence. The Planning Area is comprised of 26,852 acres (41.96 square miles) of which
21,511 acres (33.61 square miles) is located within the City Limits and 5,341 acres (8.34 square
miles) is located within the City’s Sphere of Influence. The County of Riverside is currently
responsible administration of land use decisions within the Sphere of Influence.
Table 3-1, Existing Land Use Summary, provides a breakdown of existing on the ground by use
type for the year 2009 and the percentage of area within the City. Table 3-2, 2006 General Plan
Land Use Summary, lists each general plan designation, the acreage of that use in the City, and
the percentage of that use in the City.
SPECIFIC PLANS
Prior to the incorporation of the City, the County of Riverside utilized Specific Plans to guide
growth for large tracts of land in Murrieta. Subsequent to the City’s incorporation, Specific Plans
continued to be a useful tool in guiding development policy in the City of Murrieta. As of
January 2011, the City of Murrieta has 12 adopted Specific Plans within its jurisdiction, as
shown on Exhibit 3-1, Specific Plans, which illustrates the location and currently approved
buildout for each specific plan.

Greer Ranch Specific Plan (SPM 2)
The Greer Ranch Specific Plan was adopted in September 1995. The Greer Ranch Specific
Plan area consists of approximately 555 acres located along the northerly boundary of the City,
north of Clinton Keith Road and west of the I-215 Freeway. The Specific Plan area is
characterized by two valleys created by three northeast to southwest trending ridgelines.
The Specific Plan permits 688 residential dwelling units in 12 planning areas, ranging from
gross densities of 0.5 dwelling units per acre (du/ac) to 3.8 du/ac. The residential development
area is approximately 333.1 acres (60 percent) of the site. Approximately 196.8 acres (35.5
percent) of the site would be maintained as open space, predominately comprised of natural
areas. Approximately 17.9 acres (3.2 percent) of the site would be developed for recreational
use, including a 4.3 acre private Community Center for the residents of Greer Ranch and a
                                                                 3-7

13.6-acre public Neighborhood Park. The remaining 7.2 acres (1.3 percent) would serve the
circulation system. Refer to Table 3-7, Greer Ranch Specific Plan.
The purpose of the Greer Ranch Specific Plan is to provide a set of master plans, guidelines,
regulations, and implementation programs for guiding and ensuring the orderly development of
Greer Ranch.

Murrieta Oaks Specific Plan (SPM 10)
The Murrieta Oaks Specific Plan was adopted on June 20, 2000. The Specific Plan is
comprised of approximately 259.6 acres located in the area between the I-15 Freeway and the
I-215 Freeway, north of Los Alamos Road, with Clinton Keith Road crossing the site at the
northern edge. The Specific Plan proposes residential, open space, and recreational uses, as
well as the potential for an elementary school. The land use plan proposes a cluster
development to maintain significant natural features, such as the ridgeline, steep hillside areas,
and drainage courses. Without an elementary school, four residential neighborhoods would
contain up to 600 dwelling units. With an elementary school the four residential neighborhoods
would accommodate up to 560 dwelling units. The elementary school would be located on 10.0
acres. The natural system would consist of 76.02 acres designated for natural hillside,
conserved creek open space, and the natural hillside is not in slope bank, but subject to fuel
modification. Modified open space would consist of 33.58 acres and include a neighborhood
park (5.13 acres), landscaped slope banks, and a trail system with picnic/rest areas, and fuel
modification areas. The remaining area would consist of roadways. Refer to Table 3-10,

Murrieta Springs Specific Plan (SP 309)
The Murrieta Springs Specific Plan was adopted in June 2002. The 697-acre Murrieta Springs
Specific Plan is located east of the I-215 Freeway, adjacent to the western edge of Winchester
Road, north and west of Borel Road and west of the French Valley Airport Road entrance. The
Specific Plan area was annexed into the City of Murrieta in July 2002. The Specific Plan
proposes a master-planned community, primarily composed of residential, open space,
commercial, an elementary school and recreation land uses. The Specific Plan allows for a
maximum of 2,202 dwelling units on 415.3 acres, an elementary school of 12.7 acres, two active
park sites totaling 22.7 acres, 209.6 acres of open space, 9.4 acres of commercial uses, 27.3
acres of primary roadways, and 5.23 acres of expanded landscape parkways (refer to Table 3-
11, Murrieta Springs Specific Plan). The Specific Plan includes land use development
standards and design guidelines for the area.

Plaza de Murrieta Specific Plan (SPM 20)
The Plaza de Murrieta Specific Plan was adopted in September 2007. The Specific Plan is
located on approximately 52.25 acres at the northeast corner of Jefferson Avenue and Lemon
Street. The Plaza de Murrieta Specific Plan proposes a mixed-use master planned community
within five planning areas with up to 95 single family detached units on 17.70 acres, 140
Townhome-1 residential units on 14.08 acres, 68 Townhome-2 residential units and 19 live/work
residential units on 6.07 acres specifically designed to accommodate home-based businesses,
and a Village Commercial center on 7.66 acres. Within the center of the community, a 1.03
Central Park is proposed with opportunities for active and passive recreational uses. The
remaining acreage would consist of pocket parks, landscaped paseos, and roadways. Refer to
Table 3-12, Plaza de Murrieta Specific Plan.

The Specific Plan includes a Pedestrian Connectivity Plan with a system of extensively
landscaped paseos, sidewalks, and pedestrian pathways to facilitate walking throughout the
area. The Specific Plan encourages an “Urban Village” for the commercial component of the
site with a “Main Street” design concept. The Specific Plan establishes planning standards,
architecture design guidelines for each planning area, and site design guidelines for the various
land uses to promote a consistent and compatible development with a “French Cottage” style.
The Vineyard Specific Plan (SP 215)
The Vineyard Specific Plan was originally approved in February 1988 and then revised and
certified complete in September 1988. Since then, four substantial conformances to the
Specific Plan have been approved to facilitate minor modifications to planning area boundaries,
to relocate uses within the planning area, and to facilitate minor modifications to the alignment
of Kalmia Street, while remaining consistent with the intent of the approved Specific Plan.
The Specific Plan is located in the western portion of the City, adjacent to the City’s western City
limit. The Vineyard Specific Plan consists of approximately 521 acres and allows for a
maximum of 1,306 dwelling units on 332.5 acres. Approximately 171.7 acres of open space
would be maintained, including 155.6 acres of passive open space and 16.1 acres of active
park. Neighborhood commercial uses would be located on 4.8 acres. Refer to Table 3-13, The
Vineyard Specific Plan. Development standards and design guidelines, including community
elements, architectural guidelines, and landscape guidelines are identified in the Specific Plan.

Specific Plan 310
Specific Plan 310 was adopted in December 2001 and amended in December 2004. The
purpose of the Specific Plan is to delineate a mixed-use residential development plan
encompassing approximately 1,734.5 acres located in the Winchester area of unincorporated
Riverside County. Approximately 160 acres of the 1,734.5 acres are within the Murrieta Sphere
of Influence.
                                                             3-12

The land use concept creates a community with a historic California theme comprised of up to
4,186 residential units located within three distinct villages focused around a championship 18-
hole golf course integrated into natural habitat/open space and uniquely themed, pedestrian-
oriented mixed-use core areas. The Specific Plan identifies 37 planning areas supplemented by
greenbelts and roadways. Overall the Specific Plan allows for 4,186 residential dwelling units
on 768 acres, including 1,096 dwelling units within the residential portion of the Mixed-Use
designation; 200.8 acres of Mixed Use; 142.4 acres of commercial uses, including 11.4 acres of
Commercial within the Mixed Use area; 147.7 acres of commercial recreation; and 463.1 acres
of Open Space/Recreation/School uses (refer to Table 3-14, Specific Plan 310). The Specific

REGIONAL PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS
The City of Murrieta collaborates with a number of Federal, State and local authorities to
implement regional, State and Federal mandates.
Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan
The Western Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP or Plan) is
a comprehensive, multi-jurisdictional Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) focusing on
Conservation of species and their associated Habitats in Western Riverside County. This Plan
is one of several large, multi-jurisdictional habitat-planning efforts in Southern California with the
overall goal of maintaining biological and ecological diversity within a rapidly urbanizing region.
                                                         3-13
Large-scale HCP planning efforts have been completed in San Diego and Orange Counties.
The MSHCP will allow Riverside County (hereafter, the County) and its Cities to better control
local land-use decisions and maintain a strong economic climate in the region while addressing
the requirements of the State and Federal Endangered Species Acts.
Murrieta is a Permittee under the Western Riverside Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan
(MSHCP), and as such, has existing conservation agreements and also sets aside land parcels
within the City as Conservation Land to meet the land acquisition goals of the MSHCP. The
conceptual conservation scenario for the MSHCP Reserve Area is based on existing public
lands, undeveloped land (Core Areas), and identified potential Linkages between the Core
Areas.
Warm Springs and Murrieta Creeks are important natural features within the City that are
protected for their biotic and aesthetic value; they offer wetland resources and allow for wildlife
migration. These features are included in the MSHCP as potential Linkages between Core
Areas.
For discussion and planning purposes, the Core Areas and Linkages are grouped into Area
Plans and Subunits, as shown in Exhibit 8-3, MSHCP Area Plans and Subunits, in the
Conservation Element. The MSHCP identifies the following Biological Issues and
Considerations for the Subunits within the City and the Sphere of Influence:
        Murrieta Creek (SU1) and Santa Rosa Plateau (SU6). Maintain habitat function as
        riparian and aquatic species live-in habitat and large mammal movement linkage.
        French Valley/Lower Sedco Hills (SU5) and Warm Springs Creek/French Valley
        (SCM1). Maintain habitat Core for narrow endemic plants (saline/alkali and clay), Quino
        checkerspot butterfly, Riverside fairy shrimp, Los Angeles pocket mouse, western pond
        turtle, and habitat linkages through the City limits (east-west and north-south) for wildlife
        movement and plant dispersal.
Airport Land Use Considerations – French Valley Airport
Per the California State Aeronautics Act (Public Utility Code Sections 21670 et. seq.), the
Riverside County Airport Land Use Commission (RCALUC) has two primary functions: 1)
prepare and adopt and airport land use compatibility plan, and 2) review the plans, regulations,
and other actions of local agencies and airport operations with the land use compatibility plan.
On October 14, 2004, the RCALUC adopted the Riverside County Airport Land Use
Compatibility Plan.
The RCALUC is concerned only with the potential impacts related to: 1) exposure to aircraft
noise, 2) land use safety with respect to people on the ground and occupants of aircraft, 3)
protection of airport airspace, and 4) general concerns related to aircraft overflights.
                                                3-14

The RCALUC reviews major land use actions (refer to pages 2-6 and 2-7 of Compatibility Plan):
    1) Actions affecting land uses within any compatibility zone.
    2) Proposed nonaviation development of airport property if such development has not been
         previously included in an airport master plan or community general plan review by the
         RCALUC.
    3) Any proposal for construction or alteration of a structure (including antennas) taller than
         200 feet above the ground level at the site.
    4) Any other proposed land use action, as determined by the local planning agency,
         requiring review by the RCALUC.
Portions of Murrieta are located within Compatibility Zones B1, C, D, and E, as well as the
Height Review Overlay Zone (refer to Exhibit 3-2, French Valley Airport Compatibility Zones).
As of December 2010, a Master Plan is being prepared for the French Valley Airport. The
primary objective of the French Valley Airport Master Plan Study is to develop and maintain a
financially feasible long term development program that will satisfy aviation demand and be
compatible with community development, other transportation modes, and the environment.
The accomplishment of this objective requires the evaluation of the existing airport and a
determination of what actions should be taken to maintain an adequate, safe, and reliable
airport facility to meet the air transportation needs of the area. The completed Master Plan will
provide an outline of the necessary development and give responsible officials advance notice
of future needs to aid in planning, scheduling, and budgeting. Specific objectives of the French
Valley Airport Master Plan are:
         To determine the projected aviation demand and identify the facilities necessary to
         accommodate the demand.
         To determine projected needs of airport users for the next 20 years by which to support
         airport development alternatives.
         To evaluate the current and future airport design standards.
         To recommend improvements that will enhance the airport’s safety and capacity to the
         maximum extent possible.
         To identify a suitable airport traffic control tower (ATCT) location.
         To establish a development schedule and a program for proposed improvements.
         To prioritize the airport capital improvement program.
         To prepare a new airport layout plan (ALP) in accordance with the Federal Aviation
         Administration (FAA) and the California Department of Transportation (CALTRANS)
         guidelines.
                                                   3-15

SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
The Sphere of Influence area is comprised of 5,341 acres east of the City’s boundary, generally
located south of Scott Road, west of Winchester Road (SR-79) and north of Clinton Keith
Road/Los Alamos Road. The area includes:
        2,516 acres currently pre-zoned Rural Residential (RR)
        1,955 acres pre-zoned Estate Residential 2 (ER-2)
        108 acres pre-zoned Single-Family 1 (SF-1) Residential
        149 acres pre-zoned Business Park (BP)
        40 acres pre-zoned Community Commercial (CC)
        175 acres pre-zoned Specific Plan (SP)
To preserve agricultural uses, the Williamson Act established an agricultural preserve contract
procedure by which counties or cities within California can tax landowners at a lower rate, in
return for a guarantee that these properties will remain under agricultural production for a period
of 10 years.
According to the California Department of Conservation, approximately 58 acres of Williamson
Act encumbered acreage are located outside of the City boundary within the Sphere of
Influence, as shown in Exhibit 8-6, Williamson Act Farmland (2006), in the Conservation
Element. None of these contracts are in non-renewal status with the State of California.
MURRIETA REDEVELOPMENT PLAN
The Original Redevelopment Plan for the City of Murrieta was adopted on June 15, 1999. The
Original Project Area is comprised of seven subareas totaling 1,133 acres. On July 5, 2006, the
City approved the 2006 Amendment to the Original Plan, which added approximately 1,193
acres to the Redevelopment Plan Area, as shown on Exhibit 3-3, Redevelopment Project Area.
The purpose of the Amended Plan is to eliminate the conditions of blight existing with the
boundaries of the Plan area. Plan objectives for the Amended Project Area include:
        Encourage employment opportunities through environmental and economic
        improvements resulting from the redevelopment activities.
        Provide for the rehabilitation of commercial structures and residential dwelling units.
        Provide for the participation in the redevelopment of property in the Amended Project
        Area by owners who agree to so participate in conformity with the Amended Plan.
        Provide for the management of property owned or acquired by the Agency.
        Provide relocation assistance where Agency activities result in displacement.
        Provide public infrastructure improvements and community facilities, such as the
        installation, construction and/or reconstruction of streets, utilities, public buildings,
        facilities, structures, street lighting, landscaping and other improvements which are
        necessary for the effective redevelopment of the Amended Project Area.
                                                    3-16

          Increase and improve the community’s supply of affordable housing.
          Acquire real property.
          Dispose of real property acquired by the Agency in the Amended Project Area, except
          property conveyed to it by the City.
          Encourage the redevelopment of the Amended Project Area through cooperation of
          private enterprise and public agencies.
The Redevelopment Plan identifies potential infrastructure improvement projects, community
facilities programs, community development programs, and housing programs.
ESTABLISHMENT OF GENERAL PLAN FOCUS AREAS
As noted in Chapter 2, Vision, prior to commencing the General Plan Update, the Murrieta City
Council identified economic development as the City’s top priority. To support that priority, the
City Council established a Comprehensive Development Strategy presenting the 20-year vision
that Murrieta will be a diversified business hub for Southwest Riverside County and North San
Diego County. To achieve this vision, the City seeks to encourage private sector investment in
the creation of high paying jobs, income, and wealth through economic diversification. The City
is focusing efforts to attract a variety of businesses, higher educational institutions, and health
care facilities. A full range of quality new development will be part of this effort, including retail
centers, corporate/technology parks, hotels, and upscale restaurants.
To compliment the economic development vision, the City Council identified four areas in the
City for potential land use reevaluation as part of the General Plan Update, primarily along the I-
15 and I-215 Freeway corridors: North Murrieta Business Corridor, Clinton Keith/Mitchell,
Golden Triangle North (Central Murrieta), and South Murrieta Business Corridor. Through the
General Plan Update process, three additional areas were identified: areas designated as
Multiple Use 3 (MU-3), Historic Murrieta Specific Plan, and Los Alamos Hills. These areas have
been referred to as “Focus Areas” throughout the General Plan Update process; refer to Table
3-15, 2035 General Plan Focus Areas, and Exhibit 3-4, General Plan 2035 Focus Areas.

North Murrieta Business Corridor
LOCATION
The North Murrieta Business Corridor encompasses approximately 816 acres, and is located on
the east side of the I-215 Freeway and extending to the eastern city-limit boundary, north of
Clinton Keith Road, and generally south of Scott Road (but mostly south of Keller Road).
BACKGROUND
The areas being considered for potential land use changes generally include vacant,
underutilized, or rural residential properties.
The catalysts for reevaluating the land uses are the construction of the new Loma Linda
University Medical Center and the desire to create a medical corridor and a high
technology/office/research employment center, along with commercial uses that support
business and employment needs, such as restaurants or hotels.
Clinton Keith/Mitchell
LOCATION
The Clinton Keith/Mitchell area encompasses approximately 280 acres, and is located west of
the I-215 Freeway, north of Clinton Keith Road, and south of the Greer Ranch development.
BACKGROUND
The area is developed with large-lot single-family homes and retail uses, including a regional
commercial shopping center, and can be generally characterized as rural residential in nature.
The catalyst for reevaluating the land uses is the encroachment of development surrounding the
area and the impact of that development on the rural lifestyle.
Golden Triangle North (Central Murrieta)
LOCATION
The Golden Triangle North (Central Murrieta) area encompasses approximately 218 acres, and
is an area located between the I-15 and I-215 Freeways, south of Los Alamos Road and
generally north of Murrieta Hot Springs Road.
BACKGROUND
The catalysts for reevaluating the land uses are the Crossroads Corporate Center and the
Rancho Springs Medical Center. Portions of this area have been developed, but the remainder
is vacant or occupied with single-family homes or small businesses on the properties.
                                                3-18
South Murrieta Business Corridor
LOCATION
The South Murrieta Business Corridor is located west of the I-15 Freeway, extending to Adams
Avenue to the west and south of Murrieta Hot Springs Road to the southern City boundary.
BACKGROUND
The catalyst for reevaluating the land uses is the Murrieta Education Center, which introduces
Class A office buildings to the area. Properties considered for land use changes are primarily
vacant or underutilized.
Multiple Use 3 (MU-3)
LOCATION
The MU-3 area encompasses approximately 201 acres, and is primarily located on the west of
the I-15 Freeway.
BACKGROUND
This area is developed with both commercial and multi-family uses, and most of the area is
presently developed.
The catalyst for reevaluating the land uses is the past interpretations of how this designation
has or should be developed; these interpretations has resulted in parcels with 100 percent
commercial or 100 percent multi-family developed on individual parcels, as opposed to a true
mix of multiple uses on a parcel.
Land uses considered for the developed areas are consistent with actual uses. There are a
number of parcels that are vacant, single-family residential, underdeveloped, or a combination
of single-family and commercial businesses. Land uses considered for those parcels are
intended to be compatible with existing development.
Historic Murrieta Specific Plan
LOCATION
The Historic Murrieta Specific Plan Area is the historic core of the City. Bounded by Kalmia
Street to the north, Ivy Street to the south, Hayes Avenue to the west and Jefferson Avenue to
the east, the area encompasses approximately 250 acres.
                                                3-19
BACKGROUND
The area was originally part of Juan Murrieta’s Rancho and was purchased by the Temecula
Land and Water Company in 1884, when the land was subdivided into a variety of individual
lots. Over the years, the land was developed with a range of residential and commercial uses.
The predominant use in the area remained residential, with the majority of development activity
occurring around Clay Street’s Fountain House Hotel and the railroad station. Commercial
development began to characterize Washington Avenue at the turn of the 20th century. Today,
Washington Avenue and the entire Historic Murrieta are reminiscent of the City’s past, with a
mixture of historic commercial and residential buildings.
Today, the City has accomplished a number of goals for Historic Murrieta. A Civic Center,
Police Station, Community Library and Senior Center are flourishing. Renewed pride,
investment are evidenced by many new and successful businesses.
Los Alamos Hills
LOCATION
The Los Alamos Hills area is generally bounded by Clinton Keith Road on the north, Whitewood
Road on the west, the Northstar Ranch and Hunter’s Ridge developments on the south, and
Winchester Road on the east.
BACKGROUND
The Los Alamos Hills area has an important history within the Murrieta community. It has long been
a unique area in the City in which to live a rural lifestyle and enjoy the natural resources within the
area. The eastern portion of the Los Alamos Hills area is located close to future Commercial and
Business Park developments and Winchester Road. These uses are not entirely compatible with
the existing rural lifestyle west of Warm Springs Creek, therefore, future land use transitions east of
Warm Springs Creek may be considered. The Los Alamos Hills area has a variety of street
classifications within and abutting its boundary, and is dependent upon small rural streets for
internal circulation.
HISTORY OF LOS ALAMOS HILLS
Los Alamos Area During the Native American Period. Historic archaeological research
suggests that the Murrieta-Temecula area has been occupied for perhaps thousands of years as
evidenced by long-term prehistoric sites and carvings in local rocks and boulders. The Luiseño
Peoples entered into the area sometime after 1500 and settled at various sites along streams
throughout the area.
The Payomkawichum, as they were called prior to the Mission era, were a hunting and gathering
people. Toatwi was a settlement located near Los Alamos Road and Winchester Road. Native
Americans valued sites along streams and trails, as well as near large boulders and trees and atop
hills such as the Hogbacks.
                                                3-20

Los Alamos and the Early European Settlers. During the Spanish-Mexican period in the early
1800s, the area was used for cattle grazing in support of the missions at San Luis Rey and San
Juan Capistrano. The Los Alamos Road was a likely route from the grasslands to the missions.
The area later became part of the Rancho San Jacinto.
Following the gold rush, American and European settlers came into the area searching for mining
claims, grazing land and homesteads. By 1883, the railroad made it possible to export grain and
hay and more settlers arrived to plant nuts, olives, alfalfa, oats, wheat and barley.
Recent History of Los Alamos. The Los Alamos focus area contributed to the agricultural
prosperity of the area, and got its name from the Los Alamos Road and Alamos School. This one-
room school was built in the late 1890s, and taught farmers’ children (and others) until 1969. The
Alamos School has been relocated to Lake Skinner Regional Park and is now being used as a
museum.
                                                         Los Alamos Road is the last rural road in
                                                         Murrieta. For many years, Los Alamos Road
                                                         unified the farm community and served
                                                         families bringing their grains and produce to
                                                         Winchester and the region. The original Los
                                                         Alamos Road includes a portion renamed
                                                         Thompson Road to honor the Thompson
                                                         Family. Resources of historical significance
                                                         in the Los Alamos focus area include the 19th
                                                         century farmsteads - James Place, Hind
                                                         Ranch and Garringer Place.
                                                         After the close of the railroad in 1935, the
                                                         local land boom was over. Active agriculture
                                                         production continued in the Los Alamos area
                                                         through the 1950s. The last small-scale
     Los Alamos Road has a rural character in            farming operation in the area was specialty
                  eastern Murrieta.                      seed production, which operated on the
                                                         Gentry property until 2003.

South Murrieta Business Corridor
VISION
The South Murrieta Business Corridor
Focus Area is intended to:
        Create a signature look as the
        southern gateway into the City.
        Provide a mix of Office and
        Research Park, Business Park,
        and Industrial Uses.

Multiple Use 3 (MU-3)
VISION
This Focus Area is intended to:
       Provide for a mix of Multiple-
       Family Residential, Commercial,
       Office and Research Park,
       Business Park, and Civic and
       Institutional Uses.
       Redesignate parcels with land
       uses that are consistent with
       actual uses on parcels (i.e.,
       residential, office, commercial).
       Redesignate parcels that are
       vacant or underdeveloped to
       uses that are compatible with
       on-site and surrounding uses.
       Eliminate the Multiple Use 3
       (MU-3) Area designation in the
       General Plan.
The land uses in this Focus Area reviewed past interpretations of how the MU-3 designation has
been or should be applied; these interpretations resulted in parcels with 100 percent commercial
or 100 percent multi-family developed on individual parcels, as opposed to a true mix of multiple
uses on a parcel.
New development anticipated in this Focus Area under the General Plan 2035 includes 1,137
new residential units, and an additional 800,710 square feet of commercial uses, 434,336
square feet of office and research uses, 291,802 square feet of business park uses, and 2,028
square feet of civic and institutional uses.

BUILDING TYPOLOGIES ENVISIONED WITHIN THE FOCUS AREAS
The following buildings are provided to give further clarification of the desired building typologies
within the Focus Areas; specifically the North Murrieta Business Corridor, Golden Triangle North
(Central Murrieta), and South Murrieta Business Corridor Focus Areas. Not all of these
buildings would be appropriate in all of the Focus areas; however, each building typology may
be appropriate in multiple Focus Areas. Residential, commercial, and civic/institutional buildings
are not identified here.

Historic Murrieta Specific Plan
VISION
Key Guiding Principles of the Historic Murrieta Specific Plan area include:
         Creating of a Cultural and Governmental Center
         An Attractive Town Center
         A Historic and Pedestrian Scaled Environment
         Proactive Economic Development
The City of Murrieta seeks to continue the enhancement of the Historic Murrieta area through
continued introduction of a complementary mix of residential, retail, civic and job-creating uses.
Additional development anticipated under the General Plan 2035 includes 512 new residential
units, an additional 521,413 square feet of commercial uses, and an additional 251,102 square
feet of office and research uses. This development potential is in addition to the development
potential assumed for the Specific Plan.
Los Alamos Hills
VISION
The property owners within the Los Alamos Hills area may develop and submit a Specific Plan
that would maintain the rural core of the Los Alamos community west of Warm Springs Creek,
while providing certain needed local services. With the Specific Plan, property owners are
looking to develop a land use plan that both reflects the rural character of the area, but provides
for transitional land uses between the rural land uses and more intense development near
Winchester Road. The existing open space, future development pattern, and circulation system
established for the area is intended to maintain and preserve the majority of area as a
picturesque area, whose topography and setting contribute to the rural agricultural enclave. The
Specific Plan would identify the needs and providers of infrastructure.
Additional development anticipated in this area under the General Plan 2035 includes 828 new
residential units and an additional 157,453 square feet of commercial uses.
CITYWIDE BALANCE OF LAND USES
The City of Murrieta has experienced rapid growth over the last 20 years. The majority of
growth within the City has been residential development. As a result of this growth, Murrieta is
perceived as lacking an equitable distribution of residential, commercial, and public uses to
provide convenient accessibility by all Murrieta residents.
The City seeks to provide an equitable and functional distribution of private and public
enterprise including a range of housing types, access to retail and service uses, parks and civic
facilities and local employment opportunities. To achieve this, the City seeks to provide for a
                                               3-47
more effective land use policy that expands and enhances community-wide access to jobs and
services.
With considerable potential for growth due to available vacant land within the community, it is
anticipated that Murrieta will continue to provide growth opportunities well into the future.
LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION
With the recent implementation of the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2008 (AB 32) and SB
375, Murrieta is mandated by the State of California to address the linkages between land use,
transportation and climate change. On a regional level, SB 375 will be implemented by the
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) through the Sustainable Communities
Strategy (SCS). On a local level, , the City must examine the balance between land uses to
meet the needs of a diverse community and examine opportunities to reduce vehicle miles
traveled (VMT) and to increase access alternative transportation.
The Land Use Element provides opportunities to effectively designate land for retail and
services that can be utilized by nearby residential uses. Additionally, employment-generating
land uses provide opportunities for residents of Murrieta to work within the community where
they live. Local access to jobs and services will also enhance the City’s ability to effectively
reduce vehicle miles traveled.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND JOB CREATION
To support this priority, the City Council established a Comprehensive Development Strategy
presenting the 20-year vision that Murrieta will be a diversified business hub for Southwest
Riverside County and North San Diego County.
                                                         To achieve this vision, the City seeks to
                                                         encourage private sector investment in
                                                         the creation of higher paying jobs,
                                                         income, and wealth through economic
                                                         diversification. The City is focusing its
                                                         efforts to attract a variety of businesses,
                                                         higher educational institutions, and health
                                                         care facilities. A full range of quality new
                                                         development will be part of this effort,
                                                         including retail centers,
                                                         corporate/technology parks, hotels, and
                                                         upscale restaurants.
                                                         The General Plan and particularly the
                                                         Land Use Element, seeks to align City
                                                         policy with this emphasis on economic
                                                         development, by directing public

ready sites. It targets key locations for changes in land use and zoning that support the
development of medical, educational, commercial, and business clusters. These key locations
include the areas around Loma Linda University Medical Center-Murrieta and the Murrieta
Education Center.
Economic development is strongly linked to two other major themes of the General Plan
Update: sustainability, and becoming a healthy community. Commuting is one example of a
connection between these themes. When there are more jobs available closer to home,
Murrieta residents can reduce the amount of time that they spend commuting. This should
reduce emissions from their cars, which benefits both the environment and human health. It
would also provide residents with more time to spend in healthy activities with their families.
MIXED USE
The General Plan will include provisions that will allow the development of mixed use. “Mixed
Use” involves greater use of developments that blend residential, commercial, industrial, or
civic/institutional uses. By combining complementary uses, mixed use projects bring energy
and vitality to areas during both daytime and after-work hours. Mixed use areas offer the
opportunity for symbiotic developments that benefit both residents and the businesses operating
within them. In addition, mixed use allows the advantage of flexibility of design to take full
advantage of market shifts and land use trends. The General Plan will allow both vertical and
horizontal mixed use.
TRANSIT AND TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT
There is the potential for alternative transportation modes, including light rail and/or high speed
rail, to have systems and potential stations in Murrieta in the future. The General Plan
acknowledges this potential and intends to establish the policy framework should the systems
and the potential for development around stations become a reality.
Transit-oriented development (TOD) or transit village is a district with frequent public transit,
taller buildings, a mix of commercial and residential, and a lot of people walking. In a transit
village decisions about density, building heights, street design, sidewalk widths, crosswalks,
flow of traffic and parking are made with the intent of encouraging people to walk and use public
transit rather than giving priority to cars. The basic idea behind a transit village is that for buses,
light rail and subways to be convenient for riders, they must run frequently. In order to run
frequently, they need to have a lot of passengers going to the same place. Higher density areas
have more destinations, drawing more passengers and therefore making more frequent transit
economically feasible for the transit agency and more convenient for the people using it. A
transit village is not a one-size-fits-all model for development, but rather a way of coordinating
local land use and transportation planning to reinforce each other.

3.5            DESCRIPTION OF THE LAND USE PLAN
California State law requires General Plans to define land use designations, standards to
measure density/intensity of land use, and provide a diagram to identify the physical location of
each land use. The Land Use Plan is the primary guidance for implementing the General Plan
through zoning. Table 3-16, General Plan 2035 Land Use Distribution, lists each general plan
land use designation, the acreage of that use in the City, and the percentage of that use in the
City.

MURRIETA GENERAL PLAN LAND USE DESIGNATION SYSTEM
The Land Use Element describes the intent, types, and amounts of future development that is
envisioned in various locations throughout the City. The following section provides a description
of each land use designation, as show on Exhibit 3-5, General Plan 2035 Land Use Policy Map.
Associated density/intensity standards and estimated buildout are provided in Table 3-18,
General Plan 2035 Land Use Summary.
                                                                  3-50
     Residential Land Uses
     Residential land uses are measured in terms of dwelling units per gross acre (du/ac). Dwelling
     units per gross acre define the maximum number of dwelling units that can occur on a parcel of
     land that is designated for residential use. The calculation of net dwelling units per acre can be
     determined through the application of site development and building development standards
     articulated in the Murrieta Development Code for all zoning classifications that are consistent
     with each Residential Designation described in the General Plan.
     Non-Residential Land Uses
     Non-Residential land uses are measured in terms of floor area ratio (FAR). FAR is the ratio
     between the net floor area of a building at the total area of the legal parcel upon which it is
     located. For example, a 43,560 net square foot building on a one acre lot (43,560 square feet)
     will result in a FAR of 1.0. FAR does not include the area within parking structures, access
     roadways, parking lots, or open space. Therefore, FAR is not an accurate measure of building
     height or site coverage, which is provided in the zoning standards for each zoning classification.
     2035 PROJECTIONS
     New growth associated with the General Plan 2035 is generally anticipated to occur within the
     identified Focus Areas. Table 3-17, Focus Area Land Use Projections, provides a summary of
     the growth over existing conditions that would occur within each Focus Area.

RESIDENTIAL LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
The City of Murrieta provides a range of housing types to meet the varying needs of its
residents. The following residential land use designations are established for the General Plan
2035.
          Large Lot Residential (0.1 – 1.0 du/ac). Large Lot Residential provides for very-low
          density residential development on land that may have limited access to urban services.
          Typical development consists of single-family detached housing and accessory
          buildings, often with the keeping of horses and other farm animals and/or small
          agricultural plantings.
                                                                   3-52

        Single-Family Residential (1.1 – 10.0 du/ac). Single-Family Residential provides for
        traditional single-family detached and attached housing. Typical development consists
        of a single-family detached home for each legal lot. The Single-Family Residential
        designation also provides for small lot development such as zero lot line.
        Multiple-Family Residential (10.1 - 30 du/ac). Multiple-Family Residential provides for
        attached and detached apartments and condominiums. Typical development consists of
        townhomes, condominiums, apartments, senior housing, and stacked flats. Multiple-
        Family Residential encourages the development of integrated projects that provide
        complementary open spaces and amenities on-site.
Base Land Use Density
The base land use density refers to the maximum number of units per acre permitted under the
corresponding zoning district. The base density for the Rural Residential category is 1 unit per
acre. The base densities for the Single-Family Residential and Multiple-Family Residential
categories are 10 units per acre and 30 units per acre, respectively.
Housing Affordability Bonus
The City provides for the development of affordable housing for lower-income households
through its affordable housing density bonus program in accordance with State law. The
specific provisions of the affordable housing density bonus program are outlined in the City’s
Development Code. When utilizing the affordable housing density bonus program, the
allowable density is increased by up to 100 percent for senior housing and 35 percent for non-
senior housing, consistent with State density bonus law, as amended.
NON-RESIDENTIAL LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
The City of Murrieta provides a range of non-residential land use designations to ensure the
provision of a range of retail, civic, entertainment, service, industrial, and other job-creating land
uses.
        Commercial (0.25 – 0.75 FAR). The Commercial designation provides for a broad mix
        of commercial retail, service, and office uses that serve the local and regional consumer.
        Typical uses include retail stores, personal services, restaurants, motor fuels, business
        offices, and lodging intended to meet the needs of city residents, travelers, and the daily
        employment population.
        Office and Research Park (0.60 – 2.5 FAR). The Office and Research Park
        designation provides for a variety of employment intensive uses such as business and
        medical offices, corporate headquarters, medical services, research and development,
        and technological advancement. Retail and service uses are limited to those that best
        meet the needs of the local businesses and their employees. Development will reflect
        the high freeway visibility of the areas and the appropriate buffering of adjacent
        residential areas.
                                                 3-53

        Business Park (0.40 – 0.60 FAR). The Business Park designation provides for
        employment uses, including office, research and development, educational facilities, and
        light manufacturing. Development should create a campus-like business or industrial
        park setting. Retail and service uses are typically limited to areas along major streets.
        Industrial (0.40 – 0.50 FAR). The Industrial designation provides for both indoor and
        outdoor employment intensive industrial uses, including product assembly,
        warehousing/distribution and manufacturing. The designation also provides for more
        intensive uses, some of which may introduce potential environmental impacts such as
        noise, dust and other nuisances. Impacts should be mitigated through site design and
        appropriate screening and buffering.
        Civic and Institutional (0.5 – 1.0 FAR). The Civic and Institutional designation
        provides for public and quasi-public uses such as hospitals, government offices, schools,
        museums, libraries, public safety facilities, water and sewer treatment plants, and
        publicly or privately owned places intended for public assembly.
MIXED USE LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
Mixed Use
This designation provides for a horizontal or vertical mix of residential and non-residential uses,
and utilizes both residential density and non-residential intensity standards. Floor area ratios up
to 1.0 are permitted and the base residential density is 30 units per acre.
These standards are intended to be applied separately from one another. In other words, a
mixed-use designation that allows a base density of 30 du/ac and an intensity of 1.0 FAR allows
for development of residential units at 30 du/ac on the same site with 1.0 FAR non-residential
development. There is no equivalency calculation required.
OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
The City of Murrieta provides for a variety of passive and active open space and recreational
opportunities for its residents.
Parks and Open Space
The Parks and Open Space designation provides for public parks and recreational activities,
private recreational facilities, and passive open space areas. The designation is intended to
provide for the preservation of natural open spaces, protection of wildlife habitats, maintenance
of natural and scenic resources, greenbelts, and protection from fire and other natural hazards.
The designation includes facilities generally accessible to the public such as bicycle paths,
pedestrian trails, swimming pools, golf courses, equestrian centers, playgrounds, picnic areas,
and sports recreational facilities.
                                               3-54

GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING CONSISTENCY
State law requires a General Plan’s land use designations to be consistent with the
implementing zoning. Table 3-19, General Plan 2035 and Zoning Consistency, provides a
summary of the General Plan 2035 and the associated zoning classifications. The City of
Murrieta Development Code and Official Zoning Map will provide zoning classifications and
maps that are consistent with the land use designations described in this Element.

LU-1.5          Encourage a wide variety of retail and commercial services, such as restaurants,
                and cultural arts/entertainment, in appropriate locations.
LU-1.6          Promote future patterns of development and land use that reduce infrastructure
                construction costs and make better use of existing and planned public facilities.
LU-1.7          Ensure necessary capital improvements are in place prior to new development or
                completed concurrently.

           ensure the City’s ability to provide vital services is not compromised.
LU-1.9     Discourage lands designated for employment-generating uses to be converted to
           other uses without careful consideration of the overall economic strategy and the
           jobs-housing balance implications.
LU-1.10    Apply the following provisions when cases arise regarding the location of land
           use designation boundaries:
               Where land use designation boundaries follow street lines or other identifiable
               property or boundary lines, those lines shall be construed to be those of the
               land use designation boundary.
               Where land use designation boundaries are indicated within street lines or
               identifiable rights-of-way or creeks, the centerline there of shall be construed
               to be that of the land use designation boundary.

          Compatibility Plan.
DEVELOPMENT IN ADJACENT JURISDICTIONS
 GOAL LU-26    The City understands that development on lands adjacent to the City’s
               corporate boundary can profoundly affect Murrieta residents and
               businesses.
POLICIES
LU-26.1   Cooperate with other jurisdictions in developing compatible land uses on lands
          adjacent to, or near, the City’s corporate boundaries to minimize significant
          impacts and potentially benefit residents, businesses, and/or infrastructure

LU-27.4        Provide public education about property maintenance and Development Code
               requirements.
3.7        IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELEMENT
Future development and redevelopment within Murrieta will primarily be guided by individual
decisions by private property owners. In certain instances, implementation of the Land Use
Element will require the coordination of federal, state and regional planning bodies. Water
Management, Public Safety, Airport safety and other related planning considerations will require
coordination and compliance with mandates established by other agencies.
The City’s Development Code is the primary tool for implementing the General Plan, providing
regulating standards, identification of permitted uses, and other regulations that support the
proper implementation of the General Plan Land Use Element. The Development Code
establishes and manages the use and design of future development by providing detailed
descriptions for the use of property and site development standards (e.g., building heights and
setbacks, parking standards, etc.) Subsequent to the adoption of the General Plan, the
Development Code shall be amended to ensure consistency with the policies described in the
Land Use Element.

               Chapter 4:
Economic Development
              Element
 
4.1          INTRODUCTION
Economic development has been identified by City leaders as the key priority of the City and the
focus for the General Plan 2035. The purpose of the Economic Development Element is to
identify current economic development conditions and to demonstrate how the land use plan will
promote business activity and employment growth within the City, consistent with the priorities
identified by City leaders and the community. The Economic Development Element establishes
goals and policies to promote fiscal stability, expand the City’s employment base, and enhance
the City’s revenues in order to provide quality services to the community. These goals and
policies provide for the implementation of the vision of Murrieta as a regional economic job
center and premier commercial hub. The Economic Trends and Conditions Background Report
(January 2010) and Retail Market and Fiscal Impact Analyses (January 2011) prepared by
Stanley R. Hoffman Associates serve as the basis for direction in this Element and can be found
in Appendix R and Appendix S, respectively.
The following Community Priorities relate most directly to this Element:
         Pursue economic vitality and longevity by attracting higher education and growing a
         base of clean industry, while maintaining the current housing affordability.
         Create a vibrant, prosperous Historic Downtown that serves as a community center and
         provides a variety of quality shopping and dining experiences.
4.2          AUTHORITY FOR ELEMENT
The Economic Development Element is not a mandatory element required by State Planning
Law. However, a General Plan may also include other topics of local interest, as chosen by the
local jurisdiction. Murrieta has chosen to include an Economic Development Element to
address the economic health of the City and to establish goals and policies that encourage
economic growth while also maintaining and improving the quality of life in the community.
                                                 4-1

4.3        SETTING THE CONTEXT:
            KEY ISSUES AND CHALLENGES
The community visioning efforts conducted as part of the General Plan Update along with the
Economic Trends and Conditions background report have identified key considerations and
challenges facing Murrieta in regards to the current economic climate and the City’s future
economic development potential.
       Existing Economic Climate. Murrieta, along with other cities within California and
       across the United States are facing challenging times associated with the recent
       economic downturn. Historically, Murrieta benefited from the housing boom preceding
       the downturn, which resulted in growth in household demand for local services and retail
       development. However, starting in 2006 residential activity began to dramatically
       decrease within Murrieta. The economic downturn has also resulted in a loss of jobs
       within the City, primarily concentrated in local serving sectors, such as retail,
       construction, and accommodation and food services. Thus, the City is now faced with
       the challenge of identifying new sources of growth which are more diversified and
       adaptable to recessionary pressures.
       Regional Location. Murrieta has an excellent regional location with the “center” of the
       City at the confluence of the I-15 and I-215 Freeways. This location provides
       opportunities for future rail transit, including High Speed Rail, that will serve broader
       destinations. The transit opportunities allow for transit-oriented development serving
       Western Riverside County. Along with affordable housing and attractive vacant land
       prices, Murrieta is well positioned to capture a competitive share of future regional
       economic growth.
       Lack of High-Skilled Employment
       Opportunities. Murrieta residents
       represent a highly skilled and educated
       workforce. However, local job
       opportunities within Murrieta do not
       adequately serve this workforce, resulting
       in high levels of out-commuting. The
       employment, labor, and commute data
       indicates that residents with higher
       education and occupational skills are
       largely commuting outside of the City for
       work. Approximately 87 percent of the
       City’s labor force commutes to areas
       outside of the City. In comparison to other
       surrounding regions and communities,                   The creation of more high-skilled jobs
       Murrieta has had a noticeably higher                          is a community priority.
       share of local-serving jobs. These jobs
                                                   4-2

are typically categorized as lower to medium skilled. The concentration of local-serving
jobs has resulted in lower average wages in Murrieta when compared to Southern
California.
Retail Trends. Murrieta’s retail sales per capita is performing approximately six percent
below the County of Riverside average and approximately 35 percent below the
comparison with the subregional average. Murrieta’s retail centers are generally
comprised of community oriented, big-box centers. The City lacks a true regional
shopping center. As a result, Murrieta is not capturing its fair share of household
expenditures from within the City and its environs. This is particularly true for general
merchandise and apparel. General
merchandise, apparel, household
furnishings and appliances and other
specialty retail stores are key components of
regional retail centers and have implications
for the City’s fiscal health given the
importance of sales tax revenues. Further,
per capita sales in eating and drinking
places are also lower in Murrieta when
compared to the subregion. The lack of
restaurants, including higher-end
restaurants was identified by the community
as an opportunity. The City should also
evaluate its long-term opportunities to
capture a higher proportion of the                    There may be opportunities for Murrieta
automotive retail category in the future,             to capture more automotive retail sales,
notwithstanding the restructuring that is
                                                                 in the long-term.
taking place in the automotive industry.
Historic Downtown Murrieta. Murrieta’s Historic Downtown is a cherished and valued
resource. It represents the original Murrieta Town site and continues to provide a home
to some of Murrieta’s oldest structures. Washington Avenue represents Historic
Murrieta’s traditional commercial street primarily within free-standing single-occupant
buildings. The City’s Town Center is also located within the Historic Downtown and
includes City Hall, the Senior Center, Library, and Police Station, as well as Town
Square Park. Historic Downtown Murrieta lacks the visibility of the major highways and
corridors that serve other commercial centers, and the small lots limit the potential for
larger commercial uses. Primarily developed with single-family residential uses, mixed
use/higher density residential development is needed to support existing retailers and
services and create market support for new commercial uses.
                                        4-3

4.4          SETTING THE VISION:
             KEY CONCEPTS AND VISION FOR GENERAL PLAN
Opportunities for economic development are the key priority for the City. The following key
concepts and vision for the General Plan directly guide the Economic Development goals and
policies and are intended to respond to the key considerations and challenges identified above.
        Regional Economic Growth. The City has the potential to attract firms that offer
        relatively higher skilled and higher wage jobs due to its educated and skilled resident
        labor force, land use development opportunities, existing regional freeway accessibility,
        proximity to the French Valley Airport, and future transit development programs. Given
        that Murrieta has a significant share of residents with both higher education and higher
        skill levels, there is the potential for growth in the export-base industries, particularly
        within the manufacturing, research and development, professional, scientific and
        technical, information, medical, and finance and insurance sectors. There is also the
        potential for growth in the area of higher education, such as a four-year university in the
        City, as well as the industries that would benefit from proximity and access to higher
        educational institutions, which include the majority of industries cited in the previous
        sentence.
        Office and Industrial Market Trends.
        The City has the opportunity to capitalize
        on the growing lack of office space in
        North San Diego County and Orange
        County. As the Murrieta office market
        improves and evolves, it will attract a
        growing proportion of professional,
        medical, technical, and research
        employment, particularly in developments
        along major highway corridors and at the
        centrally located confluence of the I-15
        and I-215 Freeways. Similarly, as the
        Murrieta industrial market improves, it will
        be well-positioned both geographically and       The industrial base in Murrieta is positioned
        demographically to attract a range of               to grow with a range of R&D and light
        research and development (R&D) and                          industrial businesses.
        light industrial users. The General Plan
        2035 should create opportunities for flex-
        tech buildings and higher intensity office uses along freeway corridors.
        Retail Opportunities. As the economy improves, Murrieta has the opportunity to
        expand its retail base to better serve the community and capture sales tax within the
        City. The General Plan 2035 should encourage opportunities to attract a regional
        shopping and entertainment center and a mix of moderate to higher end restaurants that
        will allow residents, as well as visitors and employees, to shop and dine within Murrieta.
                                                  4-4
       Opportunities to capture a higher proportion of the automotive retail category in the
       future should also be pursued.
       Historic Downtown Murrieta. Demand for both local-serving and specialty retail goods
       and services within the Historic Downtown can be supported through infill and mixed
       use/higher density residential development along with the continued development of
       public uses within the Civic Center area. The General Plan 2035 should encourage
       opportunities to attract neighborhood level retailers and personal services providers that
       are compatible with and reinforce the historic and village atmosphere of the Historic
       Downtown. Higher-density residential and mixed-use developments should be
       evaluated and encouraged. Opportunities for redevelopment, including the use of
       redevelopment assistance and special housing and public improvement programs,
       where allowed, can be utilized to support new development and infrastructure
       improvements within the Historic Downtown.

4.6        IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELEMENT
Implementation of the Economic Development Element requires coordination between the City
of Murrieta, adjacent and regional jurisdictions, and local businesses and residents. There are a
number of activities that assist and contribute to the implementation of the Element. Murrieta
                                               4-11

recognizes that economic development is a challenge accepted by several local agencies and
that the full scope of possible implementation approaches does not fall on any single entity. The
City will implement the Economic Development Element through public/private actions and
policies. A key component will be to establish priorities for policy implementation and
monitoring the progress of the implementation. Overall, the City must maintain flexibility due to
the dynamic nature of our market-based economy.

             Chapter 5:
Circulation Element
 
5.1           INTRODUCTION
The Circulation Element represents the City’s overall transportation plan to accommodate the
movement of people and goods within and through the City. It establishes goals and policies to
achieve a balanced transportation system that adequately serves the growth and development
anticipated in the Land Use Element. The transportation plan consists not only of the physical
transportation system itself, such as streets, highways, bicycle routes, trails, and sidewalks, but
also the various modes of transportation, such as cars, rail, buses, trucks (goods movement),
bicycles, and walking. The Circulation Element acknowledges the heavy use of the road and
highway system by single occupant automobiles, and promotes efforts to provide additional
transportation choices and to use the system more efficiently through increased transit use,
carpooling, walking, and bicycling. The City’s circulation system contributes to the form and
character of the community by providing connections between neighborhoods and commercial
corridors, providing an enhanced network of sidewalks and trails that take advantage of the
natural environment and recreational opportunities, and providing a pedestrian-friendly
streetscape environment that encourages people to walk.
The following Community Priorities relate most directly to this Element:
         Protect and foster a strong sense of community and safety, as well as the “small town”
         feeling.
         Improve roadway networks to reduce traffic, and provide a citywide system of bicycle
         lanes and recreational trails that improve accessibility without a car.
5.2           AUTHORITY FOR ELEMENT
Government Code Section 65302 (b) requires that a General Plan include:
    “A circulation element consisting of the general location and extent of existing and
    proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other local public
    utilities and facilities, all correlated with the land use element of the plan.”
                                                     5-1

5.3         SETTING THE CONTEXT:
            KEY ISSUES AND CHALLENGES
The community visioning efforts conducted as part of the General Plan Update along with the
Traffic and Circulation background report have identified key considerations and challenges
facing Murrieta in regards to the circulation and mobility within and through the City.
        Traffic Congestion. The community has identified traffic congestion as one of the
        challenges within the City. Traffic congestion on local roadways, freeways, and freeway
        intersections was identified as a concern. The community suggested more connections
        for Clinton Keith, Diaz, Winchester, Washington, and Ynez, as well as more freeway
        overpasses and north/south connectivity to Temecula. Future east-west connections
        between I-15, I-215, and SR-79 (Winchester Road) will also be important.
        Roadway Segments
        The existing conditions analysis
        determined the following roadway
        segments are currently operating at an
        unacceptable level of service (LOS D, E,
        or F) per the City of Murrieta’s Level of
        Service standards.
        Level of Service D
            y Kalmia Street between Monroe
                Avenue and Jackson Avenue
            y Jefferson Avenue north of Kalmia
                Street and north of Elm Street
            y Murrieta Hot Springs Road                       An important east-west connection,
                immediately east of I-15              Kalmia Street currently experiences unacceptable
            y Nutmeg Street east of Jackson                levels of congestion on some segments, for
                Avenue                                    instance between I-15 and Madison Avenue.
            y Winchester Road south of Auld
                Road
        Level of Service E
            y Kalmia Street between Madison Avenue and I-15
            y Murrieta Hot Springs Road immediately west of Hancock Avenue
            y Murrieta Hot Springs Road from Jackson Avenue to east of Whitewood Road
        Level of Service F
            y California Oaks Road between I-15 and Monroe Avenue
            y Kalmia Street west of Adams Avenue
            y Murrieta Hot Springs Road at I-215 and west of Winchester Road
                                                  5-2

       Intersections
       Of the 50 existing study intersections identified for analysis, it was determined that all 50
       intersections currently operate at an acceptable level of service (LOS D or better) per the
       City of Murrieta’s Level of Service standards.
       Limited Transportation Modes. The community has stated their desire to utilize other
       modes of transportation (outside of the automobile) within the City and the greater
       region. There are currently no active railways in the City of Murrieta. However, public
       transit service in and around the City of Murrieta is provided by the Riverside Transit
       Agency (RTA). The RTA currently offers five fixed bus routes in the City. In addition to
       fixed and commuter bus services, the City also offers a Dial-A-Ride (DAR) service.
       Potential mode opportunities identified by the community include a trolley system,
       improved bus service, and rail connections. Other opportunities for regional commuter
       service include High Speed Rail and Metrolink, with potential stations located within the
       City.
       Lack of a Connected Bicycle/Trail System. Community members identified the need
       for a city-wide system of bicycle lanes, as well as recreational trails (including equestrian
       trails) that connect parks and open space, and key destinations within the City (such as
       the Historic Downtown), allowing access to amenities without the need to drive.
5.4         SETTING THE VISION:
            KEY CONCEPTS AND VISION FOR GENERAL PLAN
MANAGEMENT OF TRAFFIC
                                                     One of the priorities of the Circulation Element
                                                     is to coordinate the City’s transportation
                                                     system with the development identified on the
                                                     Land Use Policy Map. A variety of options
                                                     may be available to the City in order to
                                                     maintain an efficient roadway system,
                                                     including roadway and intersection
                                                     improvements, traffic monitoring, and/or signal
                                                     coordination. The City should consider the
                                                     latest technologies and creative measures to
                                                     provide an efficient roadway system. The
                                                     overall management of the traffic system also
                                                     needs to address transit, bicycles, and
                                                     pedestrians in order to ensure the safe and
                                                     efficient movement of all users. The
                                                    Circulation Element supports a multi-modal
    A combination of transit-supportive land use

        planning and increased transit service

                 can boost ridership.
                                                 5-3

EXPANDED AND EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION MODES
The Circulation Element promotes a balanced transportation system, encouraging the use of all
alternative transportation modes. A major opportunity for new and expanded modes of
transportation within and around Murrieta is regional transit, such as Metrolink and High Speed
Rail (HSR). The California High Speed Rail Authority is currently conducting Preliminary
Alternatives Analysis to determine the feasibility of several alignments being considered for the
Los Angeles-San Diego Section of the HSR. Preliminary route alignment shows a station in
Murrieta near the I-15 and I-215 freeway interchange or potentially to the south closer to the
City’s boundary with Temecula. Additionally, there is consideration for extending Metrolink
service south along the I-15 and I-215 freeways with stations potentially being located within
Murrieta. The introduction of regional commuter transit within the City could provide for the
possibility of a multi-modal transit station with bus transit service and associated transit-oriented
development.
Improved bus service throughout Murrieta, connecting with the greater region would also
provide additional transit options for the community, reducing the use of personal automobiles.
Potential improvements include additional bus routes and increased service frequencies
connecting major nodes within the City. This is supported by the General Plan through
increased coordination with transportation agencies and encouraging key development along
the corridors, providing concentrated demand for transit services.
CONNECTED AND ENHANCED
NETWORK OF BICYCLE, PEDESTRIAN,
AND MULTI-USE TRAILS
Connecting and enhancing the City’s existing
bicycle, pedestrian, and trails system is a key
priority of the General Plan. An important
component of facilitating this is through the
creation and implementation of a master plan for
non-motorized travel throughout the City,
including multi-use trails, off-street paved
bikeways, on-street bikeways, and related
amenities. The Circulation Element identifies
measures to implement bicycle and pedestrian                     A connected network of bicycle
networks in the City, allowing residents to travel        and pedestrian facilities will enable residents
from neighborhoods to key destinations without                  to travel without having to drive.
having to use their personal automobiles. The
City’s existing and proposed multi-purpose trails
and bikeways are shown on Exhibit 5-1, Trails
and Bikeways.
                                                  5-4

PROTECTION OF RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS
The City strives to maintain an efficient and effective roadway system to limit incentives for
traffic to divert through residential neighborhoods. In order to further protect these
neighborhoods, the Circulation Element identifies measures that address the design of
neighborhoods and traffic claming to reduce through traffic and traffic speeds. An option is to
develop and implement Traffic Calming Guidelines along with the City’s existing Neighborhood
Traffic Management Program to address safety within residential neighborhoods.
TRUCK ROUTES
The designation of truck routes is intended to route truck traffic on City arterials so that trucks
cause the least amount of neighborhood disruption. Roadways providing access to the
freeways are those most likely to be designated for truck routes. The designated truck routes
within the City are shown on Exhibit 5-2, Truck Routes. These streets have been selected
because of their accessibility to the freeway and key industrial/commercial areas. The
designation of truck routes does not prevent trucks from using other roads or streets to make
deliveries to individual addresses, or for other reasons as defined in the State of California
Motor Vehicle Code.
5.5           DESCRIPTION OF THE CIRCULATION PLAN
BUILDOUT VOLUMES AND LEVELS OF SERVICE
General Methodology
Traffic volumes used in the study were developed through the use of a travel demand model,
which is specific to the City of Murrieta, and consistent with the Riverside County Traffic
Analysis Model (RivTAM), and the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
travel demand model. The traffic impact analysis used buildout (2035) land uses in the regional
area, and as part of the study, daily and peak hour volumes were developed in order to assess
potential traffic impacts to roadways and intersections in Murrieta.
A detailed description of the traffic modeling procedures and methodology, including Subdivision
of Traffic Analysis Zones, Highway and Transit Network Development, Trip Generation, Trip
Distribution, Mode Split and Trips Assignment, Traffic Assignment Validation and Traffic Volume
Post-Processing is included in Appendix C.
Study Intersections
A total of 62 intersections (50 existing and 12 future intersections) in the City of Murrieta were
identified as study intersections. Under 2035 conditions, the intersections of Madison Avenue at
Kalmia Street and I-15 Southbound Ramps at Kalmia Street will be reconfigured and combined
into one intersection. Therefore, under 2035 conditions, a total of 61 intersections were
analyzed. The study intersections are included in Table 5-1, Study Intersections and illustrated
on Exhibit 5-3, Study Intersections.

Roadway Level of Service (LOS) Volume-to-Capacity (V/C) Ratios
Roadway segments are evaluated by comparing average daily traffic (ADT) volumes to street
capacity. Capacity is a measure of the ability of the street system to meet and serve the
demands placed on it. It is generally considered the most practical measure of how well the
mobility needs of the City are being met.
The capacity of the road is affected by a number of factors, including street width, roadway
design, number of travel lanes, number of roadway intersections, number of driveways,
presence of on-street parking, and traffic signal cycle length.
The City of Murrieta’s current Level of Service (LOS) standard is LOS C for roadway segments.
Table 5-2, Daily Roadway Capacity Values, identifies the maximum daily capacity values for
each roadway type and Table 5-3, Roadway Segment Level of Service Criteria, identifies the
LOS ranges for roadway segments.

                          Analysis, September 8, 2011.
Intersection Level of Service (LOS) Criteria
Intersection operations are evaluated using a LOS system. The concept of LOS is used to
characterize how well the roadway network operates. These evaluations are based on
empirical data collected and reported in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual, which is
maintained by the Transportation Research Board, as directed by the “Traffic Impact Analysis
Preparation Guide” for the City of Murrieta. The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual utilizes a
methodology that accesses the average control delay at intersections. This methodology
results in LOS measurements, indicating the quality of traffic flow and using letter grades from A
(best) to F (worst). The City of Murrieta’s current LOS standard for intersections is LOS D for
peak hour intersection operations, and LOS E at freeway interchanges. The LOS ranges for
signalized and unsignalized intersections are provided in Table 5-4, Signalized Intersection
Level of Service Criteria, and Table 5-5, Unsignalized Intersection Level of Service Criteria.
Buildout Conditions Analysis
Analysis of the projected traffic conditions was conducted to determine whether or not the City’s
circulation system can accommodate the future traffic demands of buildout, including the land
use changes proposed by the General Plan 2035. For this analysis, buildout assumes the City
will be built-out to its General Plan 2035 potential, and that the proposed land use plans for the
Focus Areas are realized.

                   movements are easily made, and nearly all drivers find freedom of operation.
                   Very good operation. Many drivers begin to feel somewhat restricted within
        B          platoons of vehicles. This represents stable flow. An approach to an intersection      > 10 – 20
                   may occasionally be fully utilized and traffic queues start to form.
                   Good operation. Occasionally drivers may have to wait more than 60 seconds, and
        C          back-ups may develop behind turning vehicles. Most drivers feel somewhat               > 20 – 35
                   restricted.
                   Fair operation. Cars are sometimes required to wait more than 60 seconds during
        D          short peaks. There are no long-standing traffic queues. This level is typically        > 35 – 55
                   associated with design practice for peak periods.
                   Poor operation. Some long-standing vehicular queues develop on critical

The future roadway network generally conforms to the previously adopted Circulation Element
(2006). The City has identified changes to the roadway network that have been incorporated
into the travel demand model. Other changes in the model were made in order to reflect how
the roadways generally function. Changes include:
        Jefferson Avenue from Lemon Street to north of Nutmeg Street – modeled as six-lanes;
        Keller Road between Menifee Road and Briggs Road added as a Secondary;
        Removal of connection of Linnel Lane to Greer Road;
        Removal of connection of Liberty Road to Winchester Road;
        Removal of the connection of Monroe Avenue at Elm Street;
        Removal of Hunter Road as a Collector from west of Via Mira Mosa to Whitewood Road;
        Extension of Whitewood Road as a Major between Murrieta Hot Springs Road and
        Jackson Avenue (when modeled);
 
        Hayes Avenue from Guava Street to Kalmia Avenue, and between Nighthawk Way and
        Vineyard Parkway – modeled as a Collector;
        Hayes Avenue from Guava Street to Kalmia Avenue – modeled as a Collector;
        Washington Avenue from Hawthorn Street to Kalmia Avenue – modeled as a Collector;
        Nighthawk Way/Magnolia Street between Hayes Avenue to Jefferson Street – modeled
        as a Collector;
        Kalmia Street from west City boundary to Washington Avenue; Ivy Street from West City
        Limits to Washington Avenue; portions of Hawthorn Street from west City boundary to
        Adams Avenue; Douglas Avenue from Elm Street to Guava Street; Washington Avenue
        from south City boundary to Elm Street; Date Street from Adams Avenue to Madison
        Avenue; Corning Place between Adams Avenue and Jefferson Avenue; Adams Avenue
        between Ivy Street and Magnolia Street, and south of Calle del Oso Oro; Fig Street
        between Adams Avenue and Monroe Avenue – all modeled as Collectors;
        Elm Street between Hayes Avenue and Washington Avenue; and Hayes Avenue
        between south City boundary and Elm Avenue – modeled as Secondaries;
        Nutmeg Street between Clinton Keith Road and north City boundary; Lincoln Avenue
        between Los Alamos Road and California Oaks Road; Vista Murrieta from Monroe
        Avenue to Los Alamos Road; and Greer Road between Clinton Keith Road the Greer
        Ranch Entry Gate – all modeled as Collectors;
        McElwain Road between Clinton Keith Road and Linnel Lane – modeled as Secondary;
                                             5-11

        Linnel Lane between Meadowlark Road and City boundary; Somers Road between old
        Antelope Road and Antelope Road; Keller Road between Menifee Road and Briggs
        Road – all modeled as Secondaries; and
        Ruth Ellen Way between Whitewood Road and Los Alamos Road; Los Alamos Road
        from east of Whitewood Road to south of Clinton Keith Road; Via Mira Mosa between
        Winchester Road and Hunter Road; Liberty Road south of Clinton Keith Road – all
        modeled as Collectors.
The number of travel lanes in the 2035 model are illustrated on Exhibit 5-4, Future Roadway
Lanes.
For intersections, the 2035 buildout intersection lane configurations incorporate the General
Plan buildout number of through lanes; and assume a separate left-turn lane and a shared right-
turn lane. If intersections, or legs of intersections, have already been built to their maximum
configuration or already designed; these lanes were incorporated.
As part of improvements planned for the I-15 Southbound off-ramp at Kalmia Street/California
Oaks Road, the southbound ramp will be relocated opposite Madison Avenue. Therefore, the
levels of service for the Madison Avenue at Kalmia Street intersection is not shown in future
level of service tables.
The intersection lane configurations used for the analysis is shown on Exhibit 5-5a and Exhibit
5-5b, Existing General Plan Buildout Lane Configurations. Intersection traffic control assumed
for future conditions is shown in Table 5-1.
ROADWAY LOS
Using the General Plan 2035 daily traffic volumes identified on Exhibit 5-6, General Plan 2035
Average Daily Traffic Volumes, and the maximum daily roadway capacity values, daily volume-
to-capacity ratios have been determined with the Whitewood Road extension in place. The
following roadway segments are projected to operate at an unacceptable level of service (LOS
D, E or F) per the City of Murrieta’s LOS standards. The daily volume-to-capacity ratios are
shown on Table 5-6, 2008 and 2035 Roadway Segments with Levels of Service D, E or F, and
Exhibit 5-7, 2035 General Plan 2035 Daily Volume-to-Capacity Ratios, and generally include,
but are not limited to, the following:
     Level of Service D (Shown in green on Exhibit 5-7)
        y Portions of Jefferson Avenue, Washington Avenue, Meadowlark Lane/Menifee Road,
            Leon Road, and Whitewood Road.
     Level of Service E (Shown in yellow on Exhibit 5-7)
        y Portions of Jefferson Avenue, California Oaks Road, Murrieta Hot Springs Road,
            Clinton Keith Road, Hancock Avenue, and Meadowlark Lane/Menifee Road.
     Level of Service F (Shown in Red on Exhibit 5-7)
        y Portions of Jefferson Avenue, Los Alamos Road, Clinton Keith Road, Winchester
            Road, Murrieta Hot Springs Road, Meadowlark Lane/Menifee Road, and Antelope

INTERSECTION LOS
The General Plan 2035 peak hour traffic volumes are illustrated on Exhibit 5-8a and Exhibit 5-
8b, General Plan 2035 Peak Hour Turning Movement Volumes.
Table 5-7, General Plan 2035 Intersection Level of Service, provides the level of service results
for the 61 study intersections. As shown, all 61 study intersections are projected to operate at
level of service of LOS D or better, except for the following 18 locations:
        Menifee Road/Scott Road
        Winchester Road – SR-79/Scott Road

Recommended Improvements
Improvements are recommended for the buildout roadway network and for intersection capacity
augmentation; so that the roadways and intersections meet City LOS standards. Adequate
intersection performance during peak traffic hours can be ensured with enhanced intersection
geometrics which satisfy turning movement and through traffic capacity demands. In many
instances, this may require additional left turn lanes, and right turn deceleration lanes on
intersection approaches of the major roadway.

ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS
Roadway link improvements that were contained in the travel demand model include:
        Jefferson Avenue from Lemon Avenue to north of Nutmeg Street as an Arterial Street.
        Removal of the Linnel Lane extension between Greer Road and Mitchell Road.
        Inclusion of the Whitewood Road extension between Jackson Avenue and Murrieta Hot
        Springs Road.
        Adding the missing link of Keller Road between Menifee Road and Briggs Road.
        Upgrading of several roadway facilities to Collector and Secondary roads, in the area of
        Murrieta west of I-15, to better reflect how they operate.
        Changes to other roadway classifications (both upgrades and downgrades) within the
        City.
Conclusion. With implementation of these improvements, several roadway segments are
projected to exceed the City’s performance standards under General Plan 2035 buildout
conditions; refer to Exhibit 5-7.
INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS
Enhanced intersection geometrics and upgraded signal operations (such as protected phasing
and overlap phasing) have been identified and are shown on Exhibit 5-9a and Exhibit 5-9b,
Enhanced Intersection Lane Configurations. The projected LOS for General Plan 2035 buildout
conditions with enhanced geometrics is shown in Table 5-8, General Plan 2035 Intersections
With Enhanced Geometrics Level of Service.
Conclusion. As indicated in Table 5-8, after enhanced geometrics are applied to the
intersections, the following 16 study intersections would operate at levels of service that exceed
the City’s performance standards:
        Menifee Road/Scott Road

GENERAL PLAN 2035 BUILDOUT CIRCULATION MAP
Exhibit 5-10, General Plan 2035 Circulation Map, identifies the functional classifications of the
roadways based on 2035 General Plan buildout conditions and Exhibit 5-11, Typical Street
Sections, illustrates the street sections for the roadway types shown on Exhibit 5-10.
5.6         GOALS AND POLICIES
 GOAL CIR-1           A circulation system that serves the internal circulation needs of the
                      City, while also addressing the inter-community or through travel
                      needs.
POLICIES
CIR-1.1         Ensure the transportation system can adequately serve the concentrations of
                population and employment activities identified by the Land Use Element.
CIR-1.2         Maintain a Level of Service “D” or better at all intersections during peak hours.
                Maintain a Level of Service “E” or better at freeway interchanges during peak
                hours.
CIR-1.3         Maintain an average daily traffic (ADT) Level of Service “C” or better for all
                roadway segments. As an exception, LOS “D” may be allowed in the North

                Chapter 6:
Infrastructure Element
 
6.1           INTRODUCTION
In order to accommodate sustainable growth of Murrieta’s resident population and employment
centers, the City must actively plan for and allocate resources to infrastructure systems. This
Element addresses Murrieta’s facilities for water, wastewater, flood control, storm drainage,
electricity and natural gas. It identifies infrastructure issues that affect General Plan
implementation, seeking to ensure that adequate infrastructure is provided with all new
development projects, and that infrastructure is maintained and upgraded as needed. This
Element also seeks to encourage the expansion of recycled water systems throughout the City,
as an important part of ensuring sufficient water supplies.
6.2           AUTHORITY FOR ELEMENT
California Government Code Section 65302 (b) requires that the General Plan include “local
public utilities and facilities, all correlated with the land use element of the plan.”
6.3           SETTING THE CONTEXT:
              KEY ISSUES AND CHALLENGES
WATER SUPPLY
The water supply in Murrieta comes from local sources of groundwater and surface water,
imported water from the Metropolitan Water District’s Colorado River Aqueduct and the State
Water Project, recycled water reclamation facilities, and water transfers and exchanges.
Water is provided throughout most of the City by four water districts:
        Western Municipal Water District (WMWD)
        Eastern Municipal Water District (EMWD)
        Rancho California Water District (RCWD)
        Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District (EVMWD)
Their district boundaries are shown in Exhibit 6-1, Water District Service Area Boundaries. A
portion of northeast Murrieta is not served by any water district, and residents in this area rely
                                                     6-1

on wells; this area is commonly referred to as the “keyhole.” Other, smaller areas throughout
the City also lie outside the boundaries of all the water districts.
Due to the varied topography in Murrieta, providing sufficient water pressure can be a
challenge. Each water district maintains multiple pressure zones in the City with pump stations
and reservoirs. In some areas, such as the western edge of the WMWD area, private pumping
systems may be necessary to maintain adequate pressures beyond the meter connection.
The water suppliers are planning to meet increased demand and reduce dependence on
imported water. Their plans include water storage and groundwater recharge, treatment of
wastewater to supply recycled water, and treatment of other non-potable water sources to
increase potable water supply. Brief summaries of some of the districts’ plans are identified
below:
        EMWD is seeking to increase water supplies through investment in facilities that treat
        wastewater, groundwater, and raw water from the State Water Project. In addition,
        EVMWD plans to increase its supplies of imported water and add wells.
        WMWD plans include developing additional storage and pipeline infrastructure, and
        seeking diversions from the Santa Ana River.
        RCWD plans to create additional wells and construct a facility to reduce the salinity of
        recycled water for agricultural use.
        Groundwater recharge is part of most plans to ensure future water supplies. RCWD
        plans to expand groundwater recharge in the Pauba Valley Basin. EVMWD has
        prepared a groundwater management plan for the Elsinore Basin to reduce overdraft
        and improve groundwater supply reliability, which includes replenishment. EMWD does
        not draw groundwater in the southern part of its service area, where Murrieta lies, but is
        involved in groundwater recharge in the San Jacinto Watershed.
All four water districts have adopted Urban Water Management Plans (UWMP), the purpose of
which is to review current and future water resources, and to establish and maintain water
conservation programs for a 25-year planning horizon. At the time this General Plan was being
prepared, the 2005 UWMPs reflected the most recently adopted plan, with a planning horizon
from 2005 to 2030. However as of May 2011, all four districts are in the process of preparing
their 2010 UWMP, with a planning horizon from 2010 to 2035.
WASTEWATER
Murrieta’s sewage (or wastewater) system consists of both public and private facilities.
Developments located outside the public sewer system use on-site septic systems. Septic
systems are regulated by the County of Riverside Department of Environmental Health.
Wastewater collection for the City and Sphere of Influence areas is provided by the same four
water districts that provide potable water: WMWD, EMWD, RCWD, and EVMWD. Only RCWD
and EMWD provide wastewater treatment; RCWD operates two water reclamation plants within
                                                  6-2

the City of Murrieta. Wastewater flows from the other districts discharge into RCWD and
EMWD interceptors for treatment.
With continued growth expected to increase demand for wastewater treatment, both EMWD and
RCWD plan to expand the capacity of the treatment facilities serving Murrieta, which are
respectively, the Temecula Valley Regional Water Reclamation Facility and the Santa Rosa
Water Reclamation Facility.
RECYCLED WATER
Wastewater that has gone through tertiary-level treatment can be used as recycled water to
irrigate crops and landscaping, so that potable water does not have to be used for these
purposes. Water districts also use or plan to use recycled water to replenish groundwater and
surface water sources. EMWD, RCWD, and EVMWD plan to expand their use of recycled
water to boost water supplies.
EMWD operates a recycled water system, with costs and responsibilities shared through an
agreement with RCWD and EVMWD. EMWD has a mandatory recycled water use ordinance
requiring customers to use recycled water for appropriate permitted uses, when it is available.
RCWD also operates a recycled water system and seeks to provide tertiary treated wastewater
to golf courses and major park areas. Accordingly, RCWD non-domestic water mains provide
recycled water to these types of uses in the northwest parts of Murrieta, including the Bear
Creek and Colony Golf Courses.
Mains for recycled water run through Murrieta west of the I-15 Freeway, along Washington
Avenue and Adams Avenue. Other mains exist south of the City boundary in Temecula,
entering Murrieta along Winchester Road north of Robert Trent Jones Parkway; there are
service connections in the neighborhood west of French Valley Airport.
STORM DRAINAGE
Storm water drainage infrastructure within Murrieta consists of a network of natural and
improved streams, storm channels, storm drains, and catch basins. Regional master planned
facilities over 36 inches in diameter are owned and maintained by the Riverside County Flood
Control and Water Conservation District (RCFCWCD), and all non-master planned facilities
smaller than 36 inches in diameter are maintained by the City of Murrieta.
Storm water from the City and most of the Sphere of Influence that is not absorbed into the
ground flows eventually to Murrieta Creek and its tributary Warm Springs Creek. Much of
Murrieta Creek and sections along Warm Springs Creek lack formal flood control systems, and
as a result drainage is haphazard in the less developed areas of the City, even with moderate
rain. Murrieta Creek currently lacks the capacity to convey 100-year storm flows through the
City.
                                               6-3
A Master Drainage Plan prepared by RCFCWCD identifies improvements that would provide
flood protection for both existing and future development within the City. The improvements
proposed for Murrieta Creek include 11 miles of earthen channel from Rancho California Road
in Temecula to Clinton Keith Road, and a network of underground storm drains. Many of the
lines in the Murrieta Creek Drainage Plan have been constructed.
In addition, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and RCFCWCD are coordinating the Murrieta
Creek Flood Control, Environmental Restoration and Recreation Project, along with the City of
Murrieta and City of Temecula. This four-phase project includes channel improvements and a
250-acre detention basin with a natural riverine system. Besides providing flood protection, the
detention basin is designed to improve groundwater recharge. Flood control is discussed more
extensively in the Safety Element.
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE
Strategies for retaining storm water and allowing percolation not only reduce demand on flood
control facilities, but have the added benefit of recharging groundwater, which is an important
source of water for Murrieta. Groundwater recharge can be integrated into the design of
development projects by preserving natural drainage courses, encouraging the use of pervious
surfaces, and creating areas for water retention and infiltration. Recharge techniques that may
be used on-site or off-site include recharge ponds, injection points, and storm water retention
ponds.
ENERGY UTILITIES
Electricity and natural gas are provided by utilities that operate independently of the City. Any
new developments must provide verification from the utilities that they are able to accommodate
the additional demand for service. Besides facilitating the extension of energy services, the City
can play a role in the supply of energy by promoting energy conservation and local installation
of renewable energy systems.
Electricity
Electrical power is provided to Murrieta by the Southern California Edison Company (SCE).
There are a total of six existing substations that service the area; three are located within the
City limits. SCE maintains and operates the transmission and distribution infrastructure
necessary to provide electricity to end users throughout its entire service area. SCE provides
electricity to approximately 13 million people, 180 cities and communities in 50,000 square miles
of service area, encompassing 11 counties in central, coastal and southern California.
A growing percentage of the energy supplied by SCE is from renewable sources: wind,
geothermal, solar, biomass, and small hydroelectric. Under Executive Order S-14-08, California
utilities are required to generate 33 percent of their electricity from renewable resources by the
year 2020.
                                                 6-4
Locally, SCE is in the process of developing the Triton transmission substation, a new 115/12
kilovolt substation that would serve the cities of Temecula, Murrieta, and unincorporated
southwestern Riverside County. The substation would be located in the City of Temecula with
the purpose of strengthening SCE’s electrical network to maintain reliability and meet the area’s
forecasted electrical demands.
Wind turbines on residential lots can reduce household consumption of utility-supplied
electricity. In order to promote the safe, effective, and efficient construction and use of non-
commercial wind energy conversion systems on rural residential lots, the Murrieta City Council
adopted Ordinance No. 408-08 establishing standards for these systems in the Rural
Residential District.
Natural Gas
The City of Murrieta receives its natural gas service from the Southern California Gas Company
(SCG), a subsidiary of Sempra Energy. Currently SCG is the nation’s largest natural gas
distribution utility, serving approximately 20.5 million customers throughout 20,000 square miles
of central and southern California.
The City of Murrieta does not have any natural gas storage facilities. Natural gas is brought to
the City through an existing network of gas transmission pipelines, and distributed through
existing mains located under City streets, which can be extended to serve new projects.
In northeast and southwest areas of the City where natural gas infrastructure is not available,
homes or businesses use propane gas. Individual propane tanks are located on the property
and the owners or occupants execute private agreements with propane companies to maintain
and refill the tanks.
6.4          SETTING THE VISION:
             KEY CONCEPTS AND VISION FOR GENERAL PLAN
There are close connections between Murrieta’s water supply, wastewater, flood control, and
storm drainage. Water used indoors becomes wastewater, while water used to irrigate
landscaping may enter the storm drain system. Water conservation measures, therefore,
reduce demand for water supply and also for infrastructure that handles wastewater and storm
drainage. Conversely, storm water can become part of Murrieta’s water supply if it is allowed to
recharge groundwater aquifers. Wastewater that is treated is another important water source,
whether provided directly through recycled water infrastructure or used to recharge aquifers.
Finally, measures that improve groundwater recharge from storm water can reduce demand for
flood control facilities while also boosting local water supplies.
Energy efficiency and local production of renewable energy not only reduce demand for energy
supplied from outside the area, but fit into the City’s overall efforts to promote environmental
sustainability.
                                                  6-5

WATER SUPPLY
Water management will continue to be a challenging venture as the City grows and water
supplies throughout California are tight. The City will support water district efforts to develop a
more reliable, diverse, and sustainable portfolio of water supplies while also promoting water
conservation and groundwater recharge. Related goals and policies are found in the
Conservation Element.
The lack of water infrastructure in certain areas of the City, such as the northeastern portion,
may be a limiting factor to future development. The City will encourage property owners to
annex to water districts in these areas.
WASTEWATER
The City must continue to coordinate with the water districts to make sure new development
does not exceed the capacity of wastewater conveyance and treatment facilities, and pays its
fair share to increase capacity of those facilities. Water conservation will be a key factor in
reducing the amount of wastewater generated per household. Further development in areas of
the City where sewer infrastructure is not available may require additional alternative on-site
water treatment systems. The City will encourage annexation to water districts in these areas
for wastewater facilities.
RECYCLED WATER
Increased use of recycled water for irrigation and other appropriate uses is essential to reduce
the demand for potable water. Interagency coordination among the water districts will continue
to be important as they upgrade facilities for water treatment and expand distribution systems.
The City will support the water districts in their efforts to promote the use of recycled water, and
to expand recycled water facilities throughout the City.
STORM DRAINAGE
New development will add impervious surfaces and irrigated areas within the Murrieta Creek
drainage basin. To minimize surface water runoff and nuisance flows to storm drains, the City
will encourage new development to incorporate Low Impact Development (LID) strategies and
landscape design that minimizes the need for irrigation. Related goals and policies are found in
the Conservation Element.
To accommodate new growth and revitalization, the City and the Riverside County Flood
Control and Water Conservation District should continue to maintain and replace aging storm
drain systems and minimize the adverse effects of urbanization upon drainage and flood control
facilities. Additional information regarding flooding can be found in the Safety Element.
When it rains, pollutants such as trash, litter, silt, automotive chemicals, animal waste, and other
contaminants are washed into the storm drains. The Federal Pollution Control Act prohibits the
discharge of any pollutant into navigable waters from a point source unless the discharge is
                                                  6-6
authorized by a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. The City of
Murrieta participants in the NPDES permit program through a partnership with County of
Riverside, all cities within Riverside County, and the Riverside County Flood Control and Water
Conservation District.
The City will continue to coordinate with the Riverside County Flood Control and Water
Conservation District to provide for drainage and flood control infrastructure. Impact fees for the
construction and maintenance of storm drains will be critical to ensuring that adequate capacity
is achieved for the 100-year storm.
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE
The City will promote Low Impact Development and other techniques for groundwater recharge
in new developments. Whenever possible, the natural function of creeks and other drainage
courses will be preserved when this does not interfere with flood control. Murrieta will also
continue collaborative efforts to secure funding for completion of the Murrieta Creek Flood
Control, Environmental Restoration and Recreation Project. Related goals and policies are
found in the Conservation Element.
ENERGY UTILITIES
The City of Murrieta is dedicated to using energy more efficiently in its municipal operations, as
well as promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy production throughout the
community. Installations of photovoltaic solar panels and non-commercial wind turbines will be
encouraged. Related goals and policies are found in the Conservation Element.

         that specify the nature, timing, cost, and financing mechanisms to be used to
         fund water, wastewater, and/or storm drainage improvements and services.
INF-1.22 Work with property owners to establish a financing mechanism, such as financing
         districts, to provide infrastructure and maintenance in major employment
         locations and corridors, such as the North Murrieta Business Corridor, South
         Murrieta Business Corridor, and at the confluence of the I-15 and I-215
         Freeways.
                                            6-9

INF-1.23       Utilize, where appropriate, public financing mechanisms, such as special
               assessment or community facilities districts to fund water improvement and
               service costs.
INF-1.24       Consider the use of redevelopment financing, where appropriate, to provide
               infrastructure in areas where the City wishes to stimulate development.
RECYCLED WATER
 GOAL INF-2          Infrastructure for recycled water is expanded throughout Murrieta for
                     irrigation and other non-potable uses.
POLICIES
INF-2.1        Support water district efforts to promote the use of recycled water where
               infrastructure is available, and to expand infrastructure where it does not
               currently exist.
INF-2.2        Work with the water districts to explore options for expanding recycled water
               pipelines to serve City parks and facilities that are near existing infrastructure,
               such as California Oaks Sports Park and Town Square.
INF-2.3        Continue to require installation of recycled water systems for landscaping, unless
               there is an exemption from the applicable water district.
INF-2.4        Encourage other major users of irrigation, such as schools and private golf
               courses, to connect to nearby recycled water pipelines.
INF-2.5        Coordinate with water districts to encourage innovative demonstrations of non-
               potable uses for recycled water and/or groundwater recharge in City facilities and
               industrial applications.
Refer to related goals and policies in the Conservation Element: Goal CSV-3 and Policies CSV-
3.1 through CSV-3.5, and Goal CSV-4 and Policies CSV-4.1 through CSV-4.7 address storm
water management and groundwater recharge.
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
 GOAL INF-3          A satisfactory Capital Improvement Program.
POLICIES
INF-3.1        Ensure that the Capital Improvement Program (CIP) meets the City’s needs.
                                                6-10

INF-3.2          Ensure that the Capital Improvement Program (CIP) meets Measure A, or other
                 appropriate local, regional, or State, requirements.
INF-3.3          Amend as necessary and adopt a Capital Improvement Program.
6.6          IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELEMENT
Most of the infrastructure discussed in this Element is built and maintained by entities operating
independently of the City of Murrieta. However, the City supports water, sewer, and storm
water infrastructure by collecting impact fees from new development. The City has the most
direct influence over the construction and maintenance of storm drains, and can direct the
construction of other storm water infrastructure in private developments. Larger flood control
efforts require coordination with Riverside County Flood Control and Water Conservation
District, as well as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and neighboring jurisdictions. The City’s
role in ensuring the provision of water and sewer services is to coordinate land use planning
with the water agencies providing those services, and encourage annexation of areas not yet
within the service areas of water districts. For those facilities under the City’s jurisdiction, it is
important that the City’s Capital Improvement Program include provisions for new or upgraded
facilities, as well as the maintenance of facilities.
Electricity and gas service is provided by utilities on a development-by-development basis, and
the City requires new development to verify that service will be available. The City can also
contribute to future energy supplies by facilitating efforts to generate renewable energy locally.

           Chapter 7:
Healthy Community
          Element
 
7.1          INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this Healthy Community Element is to promote the health, safety, and general
welfare of Murrieta’s residents, workers, and visitors. It highlights the connections between
health and the physical, social, and economic environment, and provides an overarching
strategy for achieving and maintaining a healthy community. The Element begins by describing
the legal and logical basis for creating a Healthy Community Element; is followed by key health
conditions and determinants in Murrieta; and continues with the Vision and Key Concepts for
health in Murrieta. The centerpiece of the Element is a set of explicit goals and policies to
promote a healthy community. The summary of key health conditions and determinants – are
organized according to the following key topics:
        Healthy Economy
        Citywide Health
        Land Use and Urban Design for Health
        Environmental Health
        Safe, Sustainable, and Active Transportation
        Public Spaces for Physical Activity and Social Cohesion
        Healthy Goods and Services
The following Community Priorities relate most directly to this Element:
        Provide abundant parks and facilities for recreational activities, and cultural amenities.
        Improve roadway networks to reduce traffic, and provide a citywide system of bicycle
        lanes and recreational trails that improve accessibility without a car.
        Improve health care within the City, and continue to provide excellent school, police, fire,
        library, and recreation services.
7.2          AUTHORITY FOR ELEMENT
Health and city planning have been closely connected for a very long time. In fact, the health
crises created by rapid industrialization and urbanization during the late 19th and early 20th
centuries were the impetus for much of modern planning and zoning. Faced with the rampant
spread of diseases such as cholera, and with the frightening health effects of locating industrial
pollution sources like coal-fired manufacturing plants within close proximity to high-density
                                                7-1

residential urban areas, city planners began requiring basic infrastructure to protect public
health – like sewer treatment and garbage disposal – and zoned city blocks to buffer residential
areas from polluting industries. The result was the Federal Zoning Enabling Act, which enabled
modern zoning and is still the legal rationale for land use regulation and planning across the
country. Similarly, the landmark 1926 U.S. Supreme Court decision Village of Euclid vs. Ambler
Realty Co cited preservation of public health as one of the basic responsibilities of local
government. It interpreted zoning as an extension of the local police power to promote the
“health, safety, and general welfare” of a community, a legal rationale that still holds sway in the
United States today.
Continuing research about a variety of topics, including transportation, air and water quality,
economics, nutrition, environmental health, and the design of parks and public spaces, has
confirmed a common-sense observation:
    Your physical surroundings (where you live, work, and play) impacts your health
    and your day-to-day behavior.
Since the goal of the General Plan is to create a long-term vision for the City’s physical form and
character, it provides a fundamental opportunity to promote community health for the long-term.
Local governments are not specifically mandated by the State of California Government Code
(Section 65302) to address health in general plans. However, this Healthy Community Element
is consistent with Government Code Section 65303, which authorizes local jurisdictions to adopt
additional elements to those required by state law when they relate to the physical development
of the jurisdiction.
7.3          SETTING THE CONTEXT:
             COMMUNITY HEALTH CONDITIONS AND
             DETERMINANTS
A person’s or population’s health status is determined by a mix of genetics, surrounding
environment, and behavior. One’s environment can have a direct effect on health, such as if
someone is regularly exposed to tobacco smoke or contaminated water. It can also influence
day-to-day behavior, such as what someone eats or how much exercise they get. The goal of
healthy community planning is to create a built environment that limits exposure to health risks
while also supporting healthy behavior and lifestyles.
The following section summarizes the existing health conditions and determinants in Murrieta,
identifying some of the key issues that are addressed in the subsequent goals and policies. For
additional detail, including a more detailed review of literature and academic research about the
connections between planning and health, refer to the General Plan Existing Conditions
Background Report and the Community Vision Report.
                                                 7-2

HEALTHY ECONOMY
Income is one of the strongest determinants of health status. When people have access to high
quality employment that pays a living wage, they are more likely to have access to health care,
and they can more likely afford basic necessities such as healthy food and housing to support
their health. Additionally, people with higher incomes incur less psychosocial stress about how
to make ends meet.
The number of jobs in a community in proportion to the amount of housing available is an
important indicator of both the availability of housing for the City’s workforce, and the availability
of jobs for City residents. The need to travel long distances for work or for housing increases
time spent driving, which negatively impacts physical health and decreases levels of social
engagement. A lack of jobs can also diminish economic vitality, competitiveness, and
sustainability.
The overall jobs/housing ratio within Riverside County is approximately 0.7, which includes all
cities within its jurisdiction.1 Only 13 percent of the City's labor force is employed in jobs within
Murrieta, with 87 percent of the labor force commuting to areas outside the City. About 16
percent of the labor force commutes to Temecula for employment, while another 22 percent
commutes into San Diego County. Murrieta residents hold only 21 percent of the jobs in
Murrieta. Residents with higher education and occupational skills are largely commuting out of
the City for work.
CITYWIDE HEALTH
The City of Murrieta has a relatively young population, with a median age of 30.7 years, which is
slightly lower than the Riverside County median age of 31.6, but five years younger than the
national median age of 36.2 Additionally, on average, people in Murrieta enjoy higher incomes
and have higher educational attainment than the Riverside County or national average.3
Research has correlated higher income and higher educational attainment with positive health
outcomes, and younger populations are generally at lower risk for many chronic diseases and
illnesses than older populations.4 At the same time, these demographic figures are just
averages. Certain segments of the population, such as young children, older adults, and those
with lower incomes, are often more susceptible to a variety of health risks. In addition,
Murrieta’s young people will age and experience cumulative health impacts over the course of
their lifetimes, and high incomes do not always remain constant for all individuals.

The leading causes of death in Murrieta are cancer and heart disease, followed by stroke,
chronic lower respiratory disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. Deaths from cancer and
Alzheimer’s are more common in Murrieta than California or Riverside County, while the rates of
death from heart disease, diabetes, and chronic liver disease are slightly lower than the State
and County averages.5 Major risk factors for most of the leading causes of death in Murrieta –
cancer, heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes – include a lack of physical activity,
being overweight or obese, chronic stress, and age. A major risk factor for chronic lower
respiratory diseases (CLRD) and illnesses, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, emphysema, pneumonia, and bronchitis, is polluted air. CLRD often restricts physical
activity, which has further negative health impacts. In 2004, CLRD was the fourth leading cause
of death in Murrieta (as well as in the United States6).
Like leading causes of death, hospitalization rates provide a gauge of a population’s health
status. Murrieta’s rates of hospitalizations and emergency room visits for asthma are
significantly lower than those of California and other Southern California counties. This may be
because of better air quality or because Murrieta’s population, which has higher incomes and is
more educated than other parts of California, benefits from better preventative care and regular
asthma management support. A significant portion of the population still suffers from asthma,
which is exacerbated by environmental triggers such as indoor and outdoor air pollution.
Murrieta’s rate of heart attack hospitalizations is similar to the Riverside County average, which
is 32 percent higher than the California average and 54 percent and 45 percent higher than San
Diego and Los Angeles Counties, respectively.7 This means that heart attacks are happening
more frequently in Murrieta than many places in the region.
LAND USE AND URBAN DESIGN FOR HEALTH
Planning decisions such as zoning, land use, and urban design can have a strong impact on our
transportation choices, housing, and social interactions. These decisions can improve physical
and mental health by providing opportunities for physical activity like walking, providing easier
access to nutritious food, or enabling neighbors to interact with each other on a regular basis.
Murrieta’s development pattern is consistent with prevailing development patterns in many other
fast-growing Southern California cities: low densities and automobile-oriented design, with large
sections of the City devoted to single uses, such as residential subdivisions or commercial
shopping centers. Most housing is provided in single-use subdivisions of single-family homes.

The City has a very low density overall: 30.50 percent of land is occupied by single-family
homes while only 1.11 percent is occupied by multi-family homes. At the same time, 73 percent
of housing units are single-family, while 22 percent are multi-family, demonstrating how multi-
family homes consume significantly less land per unit than single-family homes. Murrieta has a
lower proportion of multi-family housing than the rest of the SCAG (Southern California
Association of Governments) region, where approximately 47 percent of housing is estimated to
be multi-family, but a similar amount to Riverside County.8 Forty-three percent of land in
Riverside County is occupied by vacant land, golf courses, and agricultural land, and another
15.60 percent of land is occupied by streets and infrastructure.
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
Environmental health concerns include air pollutants,
contaminated land or water, or even toxic substances
in everyday household items. While it may be
impossible to eliminate all of these environmental
health risks completely, efforts to clean up
contaminated sites, eliminate toxic substances, and
protect air and water quality can reduce environmental
health risks.
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) publishes
guidelines for protecting “sensitive land uses,” such as
residential uses, health care or child care facilities, and
recreation facilities, from various types of air pollution
like freeways, industrial sites, or shipyards.
Of these pollution types, freeways, truck routes, and
other busy roadways are the most prevalent in
Murrieta. CARB generally recommends at least a
500-foot buffer between “sensitive land uses” and
freeways or truck routes, and most existing residential
uses in Murrieta meet this recommendation. There
are a limited number of residential uses within 500 feet
of the I-15 Freeway as it enters the city from the                    Land use planning can encourage walking
northwest, in the center of the City along the I-215                    and biking, not only by creating safe
Freeway, and along the City’s eastern border along                   pathways but by placing different types of
SR-79. Portions of the Loma Linda University Medical                land uses within walking and biking distance
Center site are also within 500 feet of the I-215                                  of each other.
Freeway.
Like air pollution, noise pollution in Murrieta mostly comes from freeways and busy roadways,
and the most heavily impacted areas are those close to freeways and busy roadways.

Partially because it has never been the site of large-scale industrial land use, the City does not
contain a high number of contaminated sites, or any strong geographical concentrations of
contaminated sites. At the same time, there are contaminated sites of various types throughout
the City where clean up is ongoing or needed in the future. There are generally more of these
in the central and southwestern areas of the City. Gas stations with underground leaking
storage tanks are one of the most common types of contaminated sites. In addition, several
formerly contaminated sites in Murrieta are recorded by the State of California as cleaned up.
SAFE, SUSTAINABLE, AND ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION
Most people in Murrieta drive to work, to school, and for daily needs such as shopping. This is
similar to the transportation behavior of Riverside County, where in 2008 the average household
drove 66.5 miles per day (21.26 miles per day per capita).9 Currently, with the exception of
some areas like Historic Downtown Murrieta, walking or cycling is an infeasible mode of daily
transportation for most Murrieta residents. Walking and cycling can provide health benefits by
increasing levels of physical activity and reducing levels of air pollution. In addition, the risk of
being involved in a collision with an automobile is a significant health risk for drivers,
pedestrians, and cyclists alike.
From 2006-2008, 77 percent of Murrieta residents drove to work alone, slightly higher than the
County, State, and national averages, while 13 percent carpooled (higher than the California
average). Around 1.5 percent of Murrieta residents walked or cycled to work, which was about
one-half the State and national average, while 0.1 percent of residents used public
transportation to get to work. Similarly, rates of walking to school are lower than State
averages.10
The average travel time to work (one-way) for a Murrieta resident from 2006-2008 was 36.5
minutes, around 35 percent longer than the California average of 27.0 minutes and 44 percent
longer than the national average of 25.3 minutes.11 This implies that many residents are
traveling outside of Murrieta for work. It also means that commute times and vehicle miles
traveled could decrease if a higher proportion of residents worked in Murrieta.
Most housing in Murrieta is currently provided in single-use subdivisions with a hierarchical
curvilinear street layout of neighborhood feeder streets and large arterials. Streets that do not
connect to adjacent areas, cul-de-sacs without pedestrian cut-throughs, blocks with lengths over
1,000 feet, and a lack of nearby non-residential destinations are very common in almost of the
City’s neighborhoods. Most of Murrieta’s commercial streets are wider than 60 feet, with high
street speeds. These factors all reduce the number of route choices and attractive destinations
for pedestrians, make walking less comfortable and safe, and make it difficult to walk as part of
daily life.

On the other hand, many of Murrieta’s
residential neighborhoods, as well as Historic
Downtown Murrieta, have consistent and
frequent street trees and sidewalks. Mature
street trees, such as those found along
Washington Avenue, are particularly
valuable and pleasant for the pedestrian
environment. Most of the residential
subdivisions around the City have less
mature trees, but with proper maintenance,
they will continue to grow and improve the
pedestrian environment over time.
PUBLIC SPACES FOR PHYSICAL
ACTIVITY AND SOCIAL COHESION                                         Trees, sidewalks, and storefronts along
                                                                 Washington Avenue provide a comfortable and

and other public spaces can have great
health benefits for physical and mental
health. They encourage physical activity by creating a venue for organized or casual recreation.
They can also provide opportunities for social interaction, relaxation, and a connection with
nature, all of which have well-established links to good mental health.
In Riverside County as a whole, 65.2 percent of residents report having visited a park,
playground, or open space in the last week, similar to the California average of 68.8 percent.12
At the time the Parks Master Plan was adopted in June 2009, the City of Murrieta had 476.24
acres of parkland within 48 total parks available for residents to use.13 This total includes one
Citywide park of 45 acres, 95 acres of Community Parks, and 10 Neighborhood Parks that
provide over 72 combined acres of parkland. The City also includes seven “Nature Parks”
containing 140 acres of parkland, 15 multi-use trails, 2,306.01 acres of Open Space, and
additional acreage in joint-use school facilities and private recreation facilities. The City has set
a standard of 5 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents. At 2011 population levels, it will require
34 acres of additional park space to meet this requirement. There are six locations in the City
that are identified as underserved, farther than ½-mile from a park. Research shows that
residents in these areas are less likely to meet minimum weekly exercise recommendations.14

HEALTHY GOODS AND SERVICES
As a whole, the City of Murrieta is well-served
by full-service grocery stores providing fresh
produce, though some neighborhoods are
better-served than others. The City has 14
grocery stores, including large chain vendors
as well as locally owned and small grocery
stores. This equals about 1.4 full-service
grocery stores per 10,000 residents.15 As a
rule of thumb, more than one grocery store per
10,000 residents is considered well served.16
A privately operated farmer’s market and a
community garden sponsored by the City are
currently in operation, providing residents
additional opportunities to access high-quality                   People are more likely to eat fruits and vegetables
local produce.                                                               when they are sold nearby.
Access to health care and preventative care is an important component of community health.
Over the past few decades, Riverside County’s population has increased at a more rapid rate
than have the various services, such as physicians and hospitals, necessary to support the
population. As a result, Riverside County, in particular the Southern Area which includes
Murrieta,17 experienced a general shortage of hospitals, physicians, and nurses compared to the
rest of California. At the same time, three of the five hospitals in the Southern Area of Riverside
County, Rancho Springs Medical Center, Inland Valley Regional Medical Center, and the
recently completed Loma Linda University Medical Center, are located in or very near Murrieta.
As a result, the City of Murrieta itself is fairly well-served by healthcare providers compared to
other cities in the surrounding region.
In general, the ability of Murrieta residents to pay for health care, and their likelihood of being
insured, is greater than the surrounding region. Approximately two-thirds of Murrieta residents
are currently able to pay for hospitalization through private insurance, almost twice the rate for
Riverside County. Conversely, only 23 percent paid with Medicare (compared with 42 for
Southern Riverside County) and 8 percent paid with Medi-Cal (compared with 15 percent for
Southern Riverside County).18 This corresponds with Murrieta’s levels of income, which are
higher than the national and county average,19 and its poverty rates, which are lower. At the

same time, there are still significant segments of the Murrieta community, such as the elderly
and those with lower incomes, that lack affordable access to health care or depend on various
medical safety nets for their care.
7.4          SETTING THE VISION FOR A HEALTHY COMMUNITY
The Healthy Community Element seeks to improve the health of Murrieta’s residents by:
        Promoting overall physical and mental health;
        Creating complete and well-designed neighborhoods and streets;
        Reducing the community’s exposure to environmental hazards;
        Creating public spaces that promote physical activity and social cohesion;
        Promoting safe and active transportation;
        Supporting educational and occupational opportunities; and
        Encouraging healthy goods and services that are physically, economically, and culturally
        easily accessible.
The goals and policies in this Element are the result of a comprehensive analysis of existing
health and environment conditions and input from the community at public workshops. They
reflect a forward-looking but realistic approach to Murrieta’s existing suburban character with
low densities, single-use land areas, high levels of automobile use and orientation, and a very
large land area. It may not be realistic to expect everyone in the City to sell their cars and start
bicycling everywhere, but there are opportunities to promote more physical activity through
improved park access, a better walking environment, a more well-connected cycling and trail
system, and more jobs and services available locally.
As a guide for improving health in a fast-growing suburban community, this Healthy Community
Element is a pioneer for other cities across the country. The Element’s policies, as well as
health-supportive policies in other Elements, include a mix of programmatic and physical
strategies that can be implemented over the course of the General Plan. Their success will
require patience, persistence, openness to change, and creative thinking about the possibilities
of suburban living by local residents, businesses, developers, and the City alike.
The five key topics of the Healthy Community Element goals and policies are as follows:
        Citywide Health
        Environmental Health
        Public Spaces for Physical Activity and Social Cohesion
        Healthy Economy
        Healthy Goods and Services
Additional goals and policies related to the topics discussed in this Element are found in the
following Elements: Land Use, Circulation, Conservation, Recreation and Open Space, Air
Quality, and Noise.

7.6          IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELEMENT
The topic of Healthy Community crosses all areas of City government, and implementation will
require coordination between a number of City departments, including Community
Development, Economic Development, Public Works, and the Community Services District.
The Community Development Department and other relevant departments will review the City’s
existing codes and ordinances (including the Development Code and the Building Code) and
make recommendations on how they can be improved to create more positive health outcomes
in the City.
The Economic Development Department will pursue a program of incentives and outreach to
attract health care related facilities and businesses to the City. The Economic Development
Department will also explore incentives to 1) maintain or expand existing or 2) locate and
establish new grocery stores and other healthy food purveyors, and to the extent possible, strive
for an equal distribution of healthy food stores throughout the City.
The City can lead by example by expanding the Healthy Murrieta program and by developing
City-sponsored programs to address employee health for city employees. Suggested programs
could include weight loss challenges, exercise challenges, lunchtime exercise programs,
sponsoring bike and walk to work days, and providing transit passes for employees.

              Chapter 8:
Conservation Element
 
8.1          INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the Conservation Element is to provide direction regarding the conservation,
development, and utilization of natural and cultural resources. It serves as a guide for the City
of Murrieta, its residents, and its businesses to understand what natural or other resources exist
in the City, how development impacts these resources, and methods to maintain, preserve, or
conserve these resources. The Conservation Element considers the following resources in the
natural environment: water; hills and ridges; and mineral, paleontological, and biological
resources. It also considers resources within the built environment: urban ecology, farmland,
cultural, energy, and solid waste.
Because many of these resources are embodied in the natural and built landscape of Murrieta,
the Land Use Element is an essential part of the City’s conservation efforts. Other Elements
that directly relate to natural resources are Infrastructure, Recreation and Open Space, and Air
Quality.
The following Community Priorities relate most directly to this Element:
         Protect the natural beauty of the mountains, hills, and waterways.
         Preserve elements of Murrieta's rural heritage.
         Create a vibrant, prosperous Historic Downtown that serves as a community center and
         provides a variety of quality shopping and dining experiences.
8.2          AUTHORITY FOR ELEMENT
California Government Code Section 65302 (d) requires “that a General Plan include a
conservation element for the conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources
including water and its hydraulic force, forests, soils, rivers and other waters, harbors, fisheries,
wildlife, minerals and other natural resources.”
                                                  8-1

8.3         SETTING THE CONTEXT:
             KEY ISSUES AND CHALLENGES
The Conservation Element is designed to protect, maintain, and enhance Murrieta’s natural
resources, and balance current community resource needs with the ability of the community’s
natural resources to meet those needs and benefit the common good. Murrieta recognizes that
resources are finite, and is only able to support the human economy and the global ecosystem if
they are used at a sustainable rate and allowed to replenish. Conservation of resources will
also enable the City to become more self-sufficient, and reduce long-term costs associated with
energy, water, and waste. Murrieta promotes sustainability as a core principle, and this concept
applies directly to the management of resources as discussed in this Element. Additionally,
protecting and enhancing the natural environment contributes directly to the community’s quality
of life.
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Murrieta’s natural environment provides resources such as water, landscape, minerals, plants,
and animals. Some of these resources are actively used in the City and must be managed for
those purposes. While not directly used by the current inhabitants of the area, plants and
animals are inseparable parts of the functioning ecosystem in the natural landscape. Their
fossilized remains provide a record of natural history. The community benefits from natural
systems such as waterways that allow groundwater recharge and plants that prevent erosion. It
is therefore important to understand how these natural systems work.
Water
WATERSHED AND GROUNDWATER
The City of Murrieta and most of the Sphere of Influence (SOI) are located within the inland
portion of the Santa Margarita River Basin, which comprises approximately 750 square miles.
Murrieta Creek and Temecula Creek collect water from the upper watershed and represent the
main tributaries to the Santa Margarita River. Western portions of the City are within the
southern portion of the Santa Ana River Basin. The regional boundary for the two basins
divides the Santa Margarita River drainage area from that of the San Jacinto River, which
normally terminates in Lake Elsinore.
Murrieta Creek extends approximately 14 miles and drains an area of approximately 220 square
miles. Warm Springs Creek is a major tributary of Murrieta Creek that traverses Murrieta. Both
creeks remain in a semi-natural state, with areas of significant native vegetation occurring along
portions of each. There are other minor tributaries and intermittent stream courses that occur
within the General Plan Planning Area, as well as vernal pools and seasonal wetlands.
Storm water runoff represents the primary source of surface water within the Murrieta Creek
Basin. Additional sources of surface water include groundwater from springs, runoff from
agricultural uses, and snowmelt.
                                                8-2

Groundwater is water contained within natural underground water systems below the Earth’s
surface, in which the water flows through porous formations called aquifers. Groundwater
recharge is an important source of water supply to each of the retail water purveyors that serve
the City and the Sphere of Influence. Numerous wells have been drilled within the groundwater
basins to allow for the extraction of water from the underlying reservoirs.
Major groundwater basins underlying Murrieta and the Sphere of Influence include the Murrieta-
Temecula Basin and the French Basin. The Murrieta-Temecula Basin underlies approximately
60,000 acres, including the Murrieta Creek channel and Warm Springs Creek, which serve as
important sources of groundwater recharge. Water flows from the Basin to the Lake Elsinore
area in the northwest and to the Santa Margarita River to the southwest. In the northeast, the
French Basin underlies approximately 3,500 acres and discharges to Warm Springs Creek.
Water use and supplies in Murrieta and the Sphere of Influence are discussed in the
Infrastructure Element.
UPPER SANTA MARGARITA INTEGRATED REGIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN
The Integrated Regional Water Management Plan (IRWMP) is a planning and management tool
to facilitate efficient use of water resources and to develop effective water conservation
measures, using a regional- and watershed-based approach. Development of the IRWMP is a
cooperative effort by the Rancho California Water District, Riverside County Flood Control and
Water Conservation District, and County of Riverside.
The intent of the IRWMP is to enable greater watershed-wide coordination and management of
water resources within the Santa Margarita Watershed as a whole, as well as adjoining
watershed and regional planning and funding efforts. Through the IRWMP, stakeholders
collaborate across jurisdictional boundaries to implement water resource management projects.
These stakeholders include regional water agencies; flood control districts; counties; cities; and
federal, state, and local agencies. The IRWMP also provides opportunities to identify and
evaluate information on the present and future needs within the watershed for consideration in
the California Water Plan.
STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
Storm water drainage infrastructure within the City of Murrieta consists of a network of natural
streams, improved channels, storm drains, catch basins, and detention basins. These facilities
and their necessary maintenance are provided by the Riverside County Flood Control and
Water Conservation District and the City.
To minimize detrimental effects of runoff water quality, the City of Murrieta implements its Storm
Water Management Plan (SWMP). The SWMP identifies methods to reduce potential storm
water runoff and the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system from industrial,
commercial, residential, and municipal sources.
                                                 8-3

Hills and Ridges
Murrieta’s natural setting offers views and
vistas of features that have both scenic and
ecological value. A variety of rolling hillsides,
mountain ranges, the Valley floor, and varied
natural vegetation contributes to the unique
visual character of Murrieta, as well as the
surrounding region.
The Hogbacks are a prominent visual feature
within the Murrieta landscape that can be seen
from many vantage points. This ridgeline
crosses the eastern portion of the City and
supports areas of relatively undisturbed natural
                                                                 Ridgelines are visible from the
vegetation along the western slope.
                                                                 freeways traversing Murrieta.
Views to the Santa Rosa Plateau occur along
the I-15 and I-215 Freeways, as well as from lands located to the west of the Hogbacks. Views
from these locations also include the largely undisturbed ridgelines that extend to the north and
south of the Plateau, combined with hillside areas supporting chaparral habitat. Oak woodland
habitat and a variety of canyons are also present along the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains
and add to the existing visual character.
The Murrieta Municipal Code establishes guidelines for future development proposed along the
City’s hillsides. Section 16.24, Hillside Development, provides measures for the long-term
protection of existing natural topography and scenic character whenever feasible through the
regulation of grading activities, intensity, and density of development proposed, structural
massing, building height, and other characteristics in order to minimize potential impacts on the
existing viewshed.
SCENIC CORRIDORS
Views from the major freeways traversing Murrieta play a large part in defining the community’s
identity for people passing through the area. Both freeways have been recognized as
possessing scenic qualities.
Interstate 15 is included in the Master Plan of State Highways Eligible for Official Scenic
Highway Designation, and Interstate 215 was previously shown on the County’s Master Plan of
Scenic Highways as being eligible for official designation as a County Scenic Highway.
Mineral Resources
The City lies within the Temescal Valley Area within Riverside County, which has become a
major area for mining. Existing mineral extraction activities and commodities produced in this
area primarily consist of clay, specialty sands, and specialty stone. Construction aggregate
(crushed rock, sand, and gravel) also represents a valuable mineral commodity. Sand, gravel,
                                                  8-4

and clay are generally used for fill purposes, for the construction of roads and highways within
urban and suburban development, and for other infrastructure purposes such as canals and
aqueducts.
The extent and significance of mineral deposits in the City and the Sphere of Influence are
largely unknown. Exhibit 8-1, Mineral Resources, shows the locations of known resources.
Five resource sites are identified within the City. These sites contain support clay, sand and
gravel (construction), feldspar, feldspar/silica, and gold. One geothermal resource is also
identified within the City boundaries. Three additional sites are identified within the Sphere of
Influence, which contain feldspar, gold, and stone (crushed/broken). According to the State of
California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources
(DOGGR), no underlying oil fields are present in the City, the Sphere of Influence, or in outlying
areas.
The Murrieta Development Code provides guidelines for the review of surface mining permit
applications that are intended to create and maintain an effective surface mining and
reclamation policy, as authorized by the California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975.
The Development Code gives provisions for the regulation of surface mining operations in order
to prevent or minimize potentially adverse effects, and provides for reclamation of mined lands.
Paleontological Resources
Paleontological resources are the fossil remains or traces of past life forms, including both
vertebrate and invertebrate species, as well as plants. The Murrieta area is generally underlain
by highly fossiliferous rock units that include the Pauba formation and Unnamed Sandstone
formation. The San Bernardino County Museum Earth Sciences Division has classified the
majority of the City and the Sphere of Influence as having a high potential for containing
significant, nonrenewable paleontological resources.
Formations in the Murrieta area have yielded extensive fossil remains that include mammoth,
mastodon, ground sloth, dire wolf, short-faced bear, saber-toothed cat, tapir, camel, llama, and
pronghorn. Known deposits have also yielded smaller vertebrate fossils including rabbit, rodent,
bat, shrew, bide, amphibian, lizard, tortoise, and turtle.
Biological Resources
WILDLIFE HABITAT
Approximately 8,374 acres of undeveloped land with potential wildlife habitat are present within
the approximate 26,852-acre General Plan Planning Area, excluding agricultural lands.
Concentrated areas of natural vegetation occur along the foothills and canyons in the western
portion of the City, in the northern portion of the City along the northeastern hillsides, along
Murrieta and Warm Springs Creeks, and along the slopes and base of the Hogbacks.
Plant communities within the General Plan Planning Area include annual grassland, coastal
sage scrub, chaparral, oak woodland, riparian, and wetland habitat. Table 8-1, Wildlife Habitat
in Murrieta and Sphere of Influence, lists specific categories and acreages of the plant
                                                  8-5
communities within the General Plan Planning Area. Exhibit 8-2, Vegetation and Land Use,
identifies the location of potential wildlife habitat areas within the General Plan Planning Area.

SPECIAL-STATUS SPECIES
Special-status species include plants and animals that are listed as rare, threatened,
endangered, or otherwise identified for tracking and protection at the state or federal level.
Conservation efforts in the Western Riverside Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan are
largely aimed at species associated with unusual soil types. Special-status plant species are
likely to occur in habitat areas associated with vernal pools and clay soils, wetlands, and areas
supporting chaparral, scrub, and woodlands.
Within the General Plan Planning Area, listed species with specific soil types include Munz’s
onion, San Diego ambrosia, spreading navarretia, California Orcutt grass, and Quino
checkerspot butterfly. In addition, coastal scrub and chaparral habitat areas are important
habitat for the Quino checkerspot butterfly and California gnatcatcher. Annual grassland and
coastal scrub habitat are important to the Stephens’ kangaroo rat, while riparian, lacustrine, and
emergent wetland habitat are important to the least Bell’s vireo and southwestern willow
flycatcher.
                                                                    8-6

WESTERN RIVERSIDE MULTIPLE SPECIES HABITAT CONSERVATION PLAN
Murrieta is a Permittee under the Western Riverside Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan
(MSHCP), and as such, has existing conservation agreements and also sets aside land parcels
within the City as Conservation Land to meet the land acquisition goals of the MSHCP. The
conceptual conservation scenario for the MSHCP Reserve Area is based on existing public
lands, undeveloped land (Core Areas), and identified potential Linkages between the Core
Areas.
Warm Springs Creek and Murrieta Creek are important natural features within the City that are
protected for their biotic and aesthetic value; they offer wetland resources and allow for wildlife
migration. These features are included in the MSHCP as potential Linkages between Core
Areas.
For discussion and planning purposes, the Core Areas and Linkages are grouped into Area
Plans and Subunits, as shown in Exhibit 8-3, MSHCP Area Plans and Subunits. The MSHCP
identifies the following Biological Issues and Considerations for the Subunits within the City and
the Sphere of Influence:
         Murrieta Creek (SW1) and Santa Rosa Plateau (SW6). Maintain habitat function as
         riparian and aquatic species live-in habitat and large mammal movement linkage.

BUILT ENVIRONMENT
Murrieta’s built environment interacts with the natural environment by drawing on resources like
soil and energy and creating new resources such as farmland, historic structures, and products
that can be re-used or recycled. The community also seeks to integrate the natural world into
the urban fabric by preserving open space and introducing parks and trees. Developing the City
while enhancing the functioning of natural systems is a prudent way to maintain and benefit
from natural resources.
Urban Ecology
In urban areas where the majority of land is given over to pavement, buildings, or other kinds of
development, ecologically functioning land is a unique and valuable asset with widespread
positive impacts. Creeks, wetlands, habitat areas, parks, trees, gardens, storm water
management areas, and other open space can serve as interconnecting islands of bio-diversity,
providing valuable ecological services.
PARKS AND OPEN SPACE
Discussed extensively in the Recreation and Open Space Element, Murrieta’s parks and natural
open space provide opportunities for outdoor recreation and contact with nature. Trails have
                                                 8-7

been constructed through several parks and open space areas. Much of Murrieta’s open space
follows natural drainage courses.
TREES
Murrieta has a Tree Preservation Ordinance that protects native Oak and Sycamore trees, and
trees of historic or cultural significance, groves and stands of mature trees, and mature trees in
general. Trees protected under this ordinance include palms and trees at the Murrieta Hot
Springs Resort, conifers dating from pre-World War I along Murrieta Hot Springs Road, and a
landmark cottonwood tree associated with a former ceremonial ground and trail route located
near Lemon Street.
Farmland
Murrieta’s economy was once based on agriculture, and there is still farmland within the City
and the Sphere of Influence (SOI). California’s Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program
categorizes the quality of farmland in the state based on such factors as soil type, growing
season, availability of water, and history of crop production. Exhibit 8-4, Important Farmland,
shows the location of farmland types in the City and SOI, including 3,207 acres of Farmland of
Local Importance within the City boundaries.
Table 8-2, Farmland Types in Murrieta and Sphere of Influence (2008), provides a breakdown of
the acreage of lands within each Farmland Mapping Category for the City and the Sphere of
Influence. These Farmland Mapping Categories are defined in the Existing Conditions
Background Report.

Exhibit 8-4 and Table 8-2 are based on the Important Farmland maps prepared by the State in
2008. These maps include land that was used for agricultural production anytime in the four
years before the maps were prepared. However, by 2010 the extent of land used for
agricultural production within the City limits was far less than the farmland depicted in
Exhibit 8-4.
WILLIAMSON ACT LANDS
To preserve agricultural uses, the Williamson Act established an agricultural preserve contract
procedure by which counties or cities within California can tax landowners at a lower rate, in
return for a guarantee that these properties will remain under agricultural production for a period
of 10 years.
According to the California Department of Conservation, no Williamson Act encumbered
properties are located within the City of Murrieta. Approximately 58 acres of encumbered
acreage are located outside of the City boundary within the Sphere of Influence, as shown in
Exhibit 8-5, Williamson Act Farmland (2006). None of these contracts are in non-renewal status
with the State.
Cultural Resources
ARCHEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL RESOURCES
Murrieta enjoys a rich cultural history, with more than 199 documented cultural, archaeological
and historic sites. Cultural and archaeological resources include remnants of prehistoric
habitation such as milling features and food processing artifacts, stone artifacts (flakes, points,
debitage), sites with rock art, village complexes and habitation sites, and prehistoric quarries.
Historic sites include built resources and historic archaeological sites (trash scatters, habitation
remains). It also includes historic resources such as ranches, homes, and sites of historic
                                                               buildings that have been demolished. The

Historic Route.
The City has a Cultural Resource Preservation Ordinance that provides “a mechanism by which
community resources such as buildings, structures and sites within the City of Murrieta, which
are of pre-historic or historic interest or value, or which exhibit special elements of the City's
architectural, cultural, or social heritage may be identified, protected, enhanced, perpetuated
and used in the interest of the public's health, safety, welfare, and enrichment.” Under this
ordinance, a natural or constructed feature may be designated as an individual resource, and a
geographic area may be designated as an archeological district or a historic preservation
district.
The City of Murrieta Historic Preservation Advisory Commission acts in an advisory capacity to
the City Council with regard to the preservation of cultural and archaeological resources within
the City’s boundaries.
HISTORIC DOWNTOWN MURRIETA
The Historic Murrieta Specific Plan,
adopted in 2000, provides a framework
for the future enhancement and
preservation of Historic Downtown
Murrieta. The Specific Plan Area is
bounded by Jefferson Avenue to the
east; Ivy Street to the south; Hayes
Avenue to the west; and Kalmia Street
to the north. The Specific Plan sets
forth guidelines for design of appropriate
development including architectural
characteristics, site planning, parking,
landscaping, and signage. The Specific
Plan also identifies several gateways to
Historic Murrieta that have visual

Washington Avenue.
A number of improvements are planned or have been made in recent years within Historic
Downtown Murrieta. These projects include design elements to enhance the overall historic
theme and character, infrastructure and street improvements, parks, and upgrades to various
City facilities. Historic Downtown continues to be a focal point for future improvements and
planning efforts.

Energy
Energy resources are commonly categorized as renewable or nonrenewable. Future availability
and environmental costs are growing concerns with nonrenewable energy. Two renewable
energy sources, solar radiation and wind energy, are readily available in the area. Geothermal
resources also exist, as suggested by the presence of thermal springs. However, most energy
used in Murrieta comes from sources located elsewhere.
Electricity is provided by Southern California Edison (SCE), whose facilities include
hydroelectric, nuclear, and coal power plants. A growing percentage of the energy supplied by
SCE is from renewable sources: wind, geothermal, solar, biomass, and small hydroelectric.
Under Executive Order S-14-08, California utilities are required to generate 33 percent of their
electricity from renewable resources by the year 2020.
Natural gas is supplied through transmission pipelines by the Southern California Gas
Company. In areas of the City where natural gas infrastructure is not available, homes or
businesses use propane gas. Individual propane tanks are located on the property and the
owners or occupants execute private agreements with propane companies to maintain and refill
the tanks.
Transportation energy is supplied primarily by petroleum or fossil fuels, although hybrid and
electric-powered vehicles are becoming more available, as well as vehicles powered by
alternative fuels. At this time, gasoline and diesel fuels are readily available within the General
Plan Planning Area and throughout the Southern California region. The environmentally
significant consequence of using these fuels is the atmospheric release of greenhouse gases
and other pollutants.
WIND ENERGY
Wind turbines on residential lots can reduce household consumption of utility-supplied
electricity. In order to promote the safe, effective, and efficient construction and use of non-
commercial wind energy conversion systems on rural residential lots, the Municipal Code
includes standards for regulating these systems. The standards are intended to minimize
visual, noise, and safety impacts on the surrounding community.
Solid Waste
Murrieta was found to be in compliance with AB 939 in 2006, having made a good faith effort
(49 percent diversion rate) to meet the goal of diverting 50 percent of solid waste from landfills.
In the two years since AB 939 compliance has been measured according to Annual Per Capita
Disposal Rate, Murrieta has succeeded in meeting the AB 939 target set by CalRecycle. The
City of Murrieta has established a number of programs in partnership with Waste Management
that promote recycling, composting, and waste reduction, all of which have contributed to the
City’s increasing diversion rate and decreasing disposal rate in recent years.

8.4          SETTING THE VISION:
             KEY CONCEPTS AND VISION FOR GENERAL PLAN
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Water Supply
Water is a precious natural resource in Murrieta and in California. Water conservation and
efficiency efforts in Murrieta are occurring against a statewide backdrop of increased demand
for water and decreased supply due to many seasons of drought, which will likely be
exacerbated in the future by climate change. In addition, the southern California water supply
has been reduced by severe restrictions in water diversions from the Sacramento-San Joaquin
River Delta for the State Water Project, which has historically supplemented water supplies
along with water from the Colorado River.
California law requires Murrieta and other local governments to adopt ordinances ensuring that
large landscaped areas are designed to be water-efficient. Plant choices, efficient irrigation
systems, and other landscape design techniques can reduce water consumption from large
projects such as parks, golf courses, homeowner association sites, and institutional uses, as
well as residential yards and smaller landscaped areas. Murrieta adopted the latest Water
Efficient Landscape Ordinance in 2010.
Future water supplies in Murrieta will rely heavily on recycled/reclaimed water to reduce the
demand on potable water supplies. Water districts will need to ensure their water reclamation
facilities and pipeline infrastructure are planned and installed according to their Urban Water
Management Plan projections. Coordination between the City and water districts will be
essential as further development is planned.
Residents and businesses in Murrieta will need to play a role in using water resources
efficiently, and this will be encouraged through education and incentives from the City and water
agencies.
Storm Water Management and Groundwater Recharge
Groundwater is an important source of water for Murrieta. When land is in its natural state,
groundwater supplies are recharged as rain infiltrates the soil. But when areas become
urbanized and soil is covered by impervious surfaces, this storm water runs off and is often
diverted into channels that carry the water away. As urbanization continues in Murrieta, efforts
to recharge groundwater will be important for the long-term sustainability of the City’s water
supply.
Groundwater recharge can be integrated into the design of development projects by preserving
natural drainage courses, encouraging the use of pervious surfaces, and creating areas for
water retention and infiltration. Recharge techniques that may be used on-site or off-site include
recharge ponds, injection points, and storm water retention ponds.
                                                8-12

Besides recharging aquifers with clean water, implementing
a comprehensive storm water management program can
reduce pollution and erosion, and prevent flooding.
Unmanaged urban storm water runoff can cause polluted
and excessive storm water flows that diminish water quality
in the Santa Margarita River Basin.
In implementing its Storm Water Management Plan, the
City will continue its efforts to keep pollutants from entering
urban runoff and to provide measures that remove
pollutants before runoff reaches the creeks.
Hills and Ridges
Murrieta’s hills and ridges offer scenic and biological
values, and are considered to be a community treasure.
The City has regulations that protect hillside topography
and scenic characteristics and prevent slope erosion, and
seeks to preserve habitat areas such as the foothills of the
Santa Ana Mountains under the MSHCP.
Scenic corridors through Murrieta allow enjoyment of these
                                                                    Site design can use vegetated areas to
views. With formal designation of these corridors, the
                                                                      remove pollutants from runoff and
scenic qualities of Murrieta could be recognized at the
County and State level as a community amenity.                         allow water to infiltrate the soil
                                                                              rather than flowing
                                                                          directly into storm drains.
Mineral Resources
The City of Murrieta recognizes the economic value of mining areas and facilities within its
borders. Regulation allows these facilities to co-exist with other land uses and reduces negative
impacts that can be associated with mining operations.
Archaeological Resources
The City of Murrieta recognizes the value of prehistoric and Native American traditional cultural
and archaeological sites within its borders and the need to preserve these sensitive non-
renewable resources. The impacts of the area’s traditional inhabitants have played in the
historic development of the City is also recognized and important to future growth and
development. Appropriate steps and protocols as outlined in the Cultural Resources
Preservation Ordinance will be taken to carefully balance protection of these archaeological
sites, cultural resources and traditional cultural properties with the need to accommodate
development.
                                                 8-13

Paleontological Resources
Paleontological resources in Murrieta will require continued protection during grading and
excavation for development. Local displays of excavated fossils could also provide educational
benefits and promote a sense of place and history, with the potential to attract visitors as well.
Biological Resources
The preservation of biological resources is of great importance to the City and to the County of
Riverside. Ongoing net loss of habitat due to development will contribute to the regional loss of
habitat on a cumulative level. Therefore, the City will continue to carefully balance protection of
natural lands, habitat, and protection of multiple species with the need to accommodate
development. In this effort, Murrieta will maintain compliance with the MSHCP and related state
and federal regulations aimed at protecting biological resources.
BUILT ENVIRONMENT
Urban Ecology
Murrieta seeks to balance community needs within the framework of an improved urban
ecological system. Whether naturally occurring or constructed, areas with functioning ecology
can protect against natural disasters and negative environmental impacts. For example,
wetlands can protect urban areas from flooding and provide centers of habitat for ecological
restoration work. Trees and landscaping provide a wide array of ecological benefits, including
absorbing storm water, cooling surrounding temperatures, removing air pollutants, filtering
polluted water, sequestering carbon dioxide, and providing animal habitat. Permeable
landscape features that can treat and retain storm water, instead of releasing it immediately
during a storm, protect downstream waterways, wetlands, and water bodies from pollution,
sedimentation, and flooding.
Preserving native species is a basic requirement for a sustainable ecological system, and can
also enhance the quality of life of a community, when residents are provided opportunities to
connect with nature and natural systems. Sustaining an ecological system requires protecting it
from the negative impacts of invasive species that often accompany the urban edge. It must
also be protected from pesticides and herbicides, which can contaminate water, air, and food;
breed resistance in pests; and have widespread negative health effects on plants, animals and
humans.
Murrieta sets aside natural open space for habitat, drainage, and recreation. In addition, the
community constructs a variety of green spaces. As discussed in the Recreation and Open
Space Element, the City of Murrieta has a parkland standard of 5 acres per 1,000 people, and
seeks to distribute parks among all neighborhoods. Trees and landscaping are promoted
throughout developed areas, supporting property values while offering other benefits. Water-
efficient landscaping with “California-friendly” plants can also provide habitat for fauna such as
butterflies and birds. To assist in storm water management, planted drainage and retention
areas will be incorporated into development.
                                                8-14

Agriculture
Preservation of farmland in areas less
suitable for urban uses can offer multiple
benefits: scenic value, maintaining a link to
Murrieta’s heritage, and providing access
to locally grown food. A farmer’s market in
Murrieta demonstrates the value that
residents place on obtaining fresh, locally
grown produce. Residents also have
opportunities to see where food is grown
when farms and ranches operate farm
stands and other visitor-serving
agritourism activities, which can also
improve the financial viability of these
agricultural uses.
                                                     Pumpkins from the “Produce for People” community

small-scale agriculture as an amenity for
urbanized areas. “Urban agriculture” includes urban farms, community gardens, and cultivation
on private properties. Facilities for processing and distributing food are another part of a local
food system that supports agricultural uses. Consistent with its heritage and interest in
community health, Murrieta will encourage opportunities for community members to access
fresh, locally grown food.
Cultural and Historical Resources
Murrieta promotes the preservation of historically and architecturally significant sites, structures,
and landscape features within the community and seeks to encourage proper adaptive reuse of
historic structures and sites. In reviewing proposed development projects involving historic
resources, the use of the California Historic Building Code and the U.S. Secretary of the
Interior’s rehabilitation, reconstruction, restoration, and preservation treatments has assisted in
maintaining the historic character of the City while achieving local and regional growth goals.
The City will continue to provide protective measures for the City’s Historic Downtown and Los
Alamos area, as well as other historically and architecturally significant sites, structures, and
landscape features throughout the community that enhance and/or reinforce the City’s rich
history and character.
Historic Downtown Murrieta has been recognized as a special cultural resource in the City of
Murrieta. The Historic Murrieta Specific Plan describes this vision and the guiding principles to
establish a cultural and governmental center, create an attractive town center, improve the
historic and pedestrian scale, and foster proactive economic development.
Building on its historic resources and the cultures that make up Murrieta, the City can help
satisfy community demand for more cultural institutions and events.
                                                 8-15

Energy
Murrieta recognizes the responsibility
of local governments to help combat
climate change and ensure stable
energy supplies. Energy conservation
and improvements in efficiency
reduce demand for energy, while
production of energy from renewable
sources such as wind and solar has
far fewer negative impacts than
producing energy from fossil fuels. As
such, the City is dedicated to using
energy more efficiently and reducing
greenhouse gas emissions — both in
municipal operations and in the
community as a whole.
                                                  Renewable energy can be produced at a large scale
Buildings and transportation combined                 in fields, or by individual panels or turbines
account for approximately two-thirds of                      located on smaller properties.
the energy consumption and greenhouse
gas emissions in the United States. Therefore, in addition to efforts to reduce energy
consumption in buildings, land use decisions and transportation behavior that decrease vehicle
miles traveled can play an important role in reducing the energy consumed and emissions
produced from transportation.
Solid Waste
Discarded waste uses up finite landfill space and often releases toxic material or produces toxic
concentrations of material. Landfill waste also creates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that
contribute to climate change. Organic waste decomposes anaerobically (without using oxygen)
in a landfill, which produces methane gas, a GHG that has approximately 23 times greater
greenhouse gas effect than carbon dioxide. In addition, sending recyclable materials to a
landfill is a missed opportunity to recapture their “embedded” energy — the energy expended in
extracting raw materials and creating these items from scratch.
Waste reduction and recycling efforts are thus proven tools to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions along with material waste. They are also opportunities to raise awareness about
environmental sustainability and the importance of changing behaviors. Murrieta seeks to
continue the success of its efforts to divert waste from landfills. In anticipation of further
requirements from the state related to AB 32, Murrieta should look to create a commercial
recycling program that would promote recycling and diversion of solid waste from landfill by
requiring businesses, nonresidential properties, and commercial buildings to source separate
recyclable materials from all other solid waste for recycling and diversion from landfill and
provide for the collection of recyclable materials.
                                                8-16

Green Building
Green building, either for new construction or retrofits for existing buildings, can greatly reduce
the impacts associated with conventional building practices. Green buildings are designed to
save energy and water, reduce waste, minimize air pollution (including greenhouse gas
emissions), and create healthier and safer indoor environments. Green buildings also aim to
reduce impacts to the site vicinity, by reducing development footprint impacts and encouraging
native plantings that contribute to local ecosystems.
Municipalities are in the position to effect significant change in the adoption and success of
green building practices, either by creating standards or incentivizing green building — for
instance, by removing barriers within City codes or review processes. Murrieta intends to
encourage the application of green building practices within the community that will lead the way
through the upgrade of municipal facilities.
Although the State of California incorporates a set of green building practices into its building
standards code, the field of green building will continue to advance. Murrieta can stay abreast
of current techniques and save more natural resources by encouraging green construction,
where feasible, to go beyond state standards.

8.6         IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELEMENT
Natural resources are shared across jurisdictions and, therefore, conservation of these
resources is an effort that is best accomplished through cooperative efforts between cities,
counties, and various agencies. As called out in this Element, multi-jurisdictional plans
pertaining to conservation include the Upper Santa Margarita Integrated Regional Water
Management Plan (IRWMP) and Western Riverside Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan
(MSHCP). Although implemented by public entities, both plans have implications for private
development in Murrieta.
A number of City ordinances exist that promote conservation of natural and cultural resources in
Murrieta through the regulation of private activity. These regulations are largely carried out
through the development review process and development agreements. The Cultural
Resources Ordinance requires proactive measures by the City of Murrieta Historic Preservation
Advisory Commission in order to recognize and preserve historical and archaeological
resources.
                                                8-26
Businesses and residents in Murrieta are the end users of most resources, and they can be
stewards as well. Education and outreach efforts to these community members by the City and
its partners such as utility providers will go a long way toward conservation of Murrieta’s
valuable resources. The City of Murrieta can implement changes in its own operations to set an
example for these efforts.

Conservation Element
 
8.1          INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the Conservation Element is to provide direction regarding the conservation,
development, and utilization of natural and cultural resources. It serves as a guide for the City
of Murrieta, its residents, and its businesses to understand what natural or other resources exist
in the City, how development impacts these resources, and methods to maintain, preserve, or
conserve these resources. The Conservation Element considers the following resources in the
natural environment: water; hills and ridges; and mineral, paleontological, and biological
resources. It also considers resources within the built environment: urban ecology, farmland,
cultural, energy, and solid waste.
Because many of these resources are embodied in the natural and built landscape of Murrieta,
the Land Use Element is an essential part of the City’s conservation efforts. Other Elements
that directly relate to natural resources are Infrastructure, Recreation and Open Space, and Air
Quality.
The following Community Priorities relate most directly to this Element:
         Protect the natural beauty of the mountains, hills, and waterways.
         Preserve elements of Murrieta's rural heritage.
         Create a vibrant, prosperous Historic Downtown that serves as a community center and
         provides a variety of quality shopping and dining experiences.
8.2          AUTHORITY FOR ELEMENT
California Government Code Section 65302 (d) requires “that a General Plan include a
conservation element for the conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources
including water and its hydraulic force, forests, soils, rivers and other waters, harbors, fisheries,
wildlife, minerals and other natural resources.”
                                                  8-1

8.3         SETTING THE CONTEXT:
             KEY ISSUES AND CHALLENGES
The Conservation Element is designed to protect, maintain, and enhance Murrieta’s natural
resources, and balance current community resource needs with the ability of the community’s
natural resources to meet those needs and benefit the common good. Murrieta recognizes that
resources are finite, and is only able to support the human economy and the global ecosystem if
they are used at a sustainable rate and allowed to replenish. Conservation of resources will
also enable the City to become more self-sufficient, and reduce long-term costs associated with
energy, water, and waste. Murrieta promotes sustainability as a core principle, and this concept
applies directly to the management of resources as discussed in this Element. Additionally,
protecting and enhancing the natural environment contributes directly to the community’s quality
of life.
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Murrieta’s natural environment provides resources such as water, landscape, minerals, plants,
and animals. Some of these resources are actively used in the City and must be managed for
those purposes. While not directly used by the current inhabitants of the area, plants and
animals are inseparable parts of the functioning ecosystem in the natural landscape. Their
fossilized remains provide a record of natural history. The community benefits from natural
systems such as waterways that allow groundwater recharge and plants that prevent erosion. It
is therefore important to understand how these natural systems work.
Water
WATERSHED AND GROUNDWATER
The City of Murrieta and most of the Sphere of Influence (SOI) are located within the inland
portion of the Santa Margarita River Basin, which comprises approximately 750 square miles.
Murrieta Creek and Temecula Creek collect water from the upper watershed and represent the
main tributaries to the Santa Margarita River. Western portions of the City are within the
southern portion of the Santa Ana River Basin. The regional boundary for the two basins
divides the Santa Margarita River drainage area from that of the San Jacinto River, which
normally terminates in Lake Elsinore.
Murrieta Creek extends approximately 14 miles and drains an area of approximately 220 square
miles. Warm Springs Creek is a major tributary of Murrieta Creek that traverses Murrieta. Both
creeks remain in a semi-natural state, with areas of significant native vegetation occurring along
portions of each. There are other minor tributaries and intermittent stream courses that occur
within the General Plan Planning Area, as well as vernal pools and seasonal wetlands.
Storm water runoff represents the primary source of surface water within the Murrieta Creek
Basin. Additional sources of surface water include groundwater from springs, runoff from
agricultural uses, and snowmelt.
                                                8-2

Groundwater is water contained within natural underground water systems below the Earth’s
surface, in which the water flows through porous formations called aquifers. Groundwater
recharge is an important source of water supply to each of the retail water purveyors that serve
the City and the Sphere of Influence. Numerous wells have been drilled within the groundwater
basins to allow for the extraction of water from the underlying reservoirs.
Major groundwater basins underlying Murrieta and the Sphere of Influence include the Murrieta-
Temecula Basin and the French Basin. The Murrieta-Temecula Basin underlies approximately
60,000 acres, including the Murrieta Creek channel and Warm Springs Creek, which serve as
important sources of groundwater recharge. Water flows from the Basin to the Lake Elsinore
area in the northwest and to the Santa Margarita River to the southwest. In the northeast, the
French Basin underlies approximately 3,500 acres and discharges to Warm Springs Creek.
Water use and supplies in Murrieta and the Sphere of Influence are discussed in the
Infrastructure Element.
UPPER SANTA MARGARITA INTEGRATED REGIONAL WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN
The Integrated Regional Water Management Plan (IRWMP) is a planning and management tool
to facilitate efficient use of water resources and to develop effective water conservation
measures, using a regional- and watershed-based approach. Development of the IRWMP is a
cooperative effort by the Rancho California Water District, Riverside County Flood Control and
Water Conservation District, and County of Riverside.
The intent of the IRWMP is to enable greater watershed-wide coordination and management of
water resources within the Santa Margarita Watershed as a whole, as well as adjoining
watershed and regional planning and funding efforts. Through the IRWMP, stakeholders
collaborate across jurisdictional boundaries to implement water resource management projects.
These stakeholders include regional water agencies; flood control districts; counties; cities; and
federal, state, and local agencies. The IRWMP also provides opportunities to identify and
evaluate information on the present and future needs within the watershed for consideration in
the California Water Plan.
STORM WATER MANAGEMENT
Storm water drainage infrastructure within the City of Murrieta consists of a network of natural
streams, improved channels, storm drains, catch basins, and detention basins. These facilities
and their necessary maintenance are provided by the Riverside County Flood Control and
Water Conservation District and the City.
To minimize detrimental effects of runoff water quality, the City of Murrieta implements its Storm
Water Management Plan (SWMP). The SWMP identifies methods to reduce potential storm
water runoff and the contribution of pollutants to the storm drain system from industrial,
commercial, residential, and municipal sources.
                                                 8-3

Hills and Ridges
Murrieta’s natural setting offers views and
vistas of features that have both scenic and
ecological value. A variety of rolling hillsides,
mountain ranges, the Valley floor, and varied
natural vegetation contributes to the unique
visual character of Murrieta, as well as the
surrounding region.
The Hogbacks are a prominent visual feature
within the Murrieta landscape that can be seen
from many vantage points. This ridgeline
crosses the eastern portion of the City and
supports areas of relatively undisturbed natural
                                                                 Ridgelines are visible from the
vegetation along the western slope.
                                                                 freeways traversing Murrieta.
Views to the Santa Rosa Plateau occur along
the I-15 and I-215 Freeways, as well as from lands located to the west of the Hogbacks. Views
from these locations also include the largely undisturbed ridgelines that extend to the north and
south of the Plateau, combined with hillside areas supporting chaparral habitat. Oak woodland
habitat and a variety of canyons are also present along the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains
and add to the existing visual character.
The Murrieta Municipal Code establishes guidelines for future development proposed along the
City’s hillsides. Section 16.24, Hillside Development, provides measures for the long-term
protection of existing natural topography and scenic character whenever feasible through the
regulation of grading activities, intensity, and density of development proposed, structural
massing, building height, and other characteristics in order to minimize potential impacts on the
existing viewshed.
SCENIC CORRIDORS
Views from the major freeways traversing Murrieta play a large part in defining the community’s
identity for people passing through the area. Both freeways have been recognized as
possessing scenic qualities.
Interstate 15 is included in the Master Plan of State Highways Eligible for Official Scenic
Highway Designation, and Interstate 215 was previously shown on the County’s Master Plan of
Scenic Highways as being eligible for official designation as a County Scenic Highway.
Mineral Resources
The City lies within the Temescal Valley Area within Riverside County, which has become a
major area for mining. Existing mineral extraction activities and commodities produced in this
area primarily consist of clay, specialty sands, and specialty stone. Construction aggregate
(crushed rock, sand, and gravel) also represents a valuable mineral commodity. Sand, gravel,
                                                  8-4

and clay are generally used for fill purposes, for the construction of roads and highways within
urban and suburban development, and for other infrastructure purposes such as canals and
aqueducts.
The extent and significance of mineral deposits in the City and the Sphere of Influence are
largely unknown. Exhibit 8-1, Mineral Resources, shows the locations of known resources.
Five resource sites are identified within the City. These sites contain support clay, sand and
gravel (construction), feldspar, feldspar/silica, and gold. One geothermal resource is also
identified within the City boundaries. Three additional sites are identified within the Sphere of
Influence, which contain feldspar, gold, and stone (crushed/broken). According to the State of
California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources
(DOGGR), no underlying oil fields are present in the City, the Sphere of Influence, or in outlying
areas.
The Murrieta Development Code provides guidelines for the review of surface mining permit
applications that are intended to create and maintain an effective surface mining and
reclamation policy, as authorized by the California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975.
The Development Code gives provisions for the regulation of surface mining operations in order
to prevent or minimize potentially adverse effects, and provides for reclamation of mined lands.
Paleontological Resources
Paleontological resources are the fossil remains or traces of past life forms, including both
vertebrate and invertebrate species, as well as plants. The Murrieta area is generally underlain
by highly fossiliferous rock units that include the Pauba formation and Unnamed Sandstone
formation. The San Bernardino County Museum Earth Sciences Division has classified the
majority of the City and the Sphere of Influence as having a high potential for containing
significant, nonrenewable paleontological resources.
Formations in the Murrieta area have yielded extensive fossil remains that include mammoth,
mastodon, ground sloth, dire wolf, short-faced bear, saber-toothed cat, tapir, camel, llama, and
pronghorn. Known deposits have also yielded smaller vertebrate fossils including rabbit, rodent,
bat, shrew, bide, amphibian, lizard, tortoise, and turtle.
Biological Resources
WILDLIFE HABITAT
Approximately 8,374 acres of undeveloped land with potential wildlife habitat are present within
the approximate 26,852-acre General Plan Planning Area, excluding agricultural lands.
Concentrated areas of natural vegetation occur along the foothills and canyons in the western
portion of the City, in the northern portion of the City along the northeastern hillsides, along
Murrieta and Warm Springs Creeks, and along the slopes and base of the Hogbacks.
Plant communities within the General Plan Planning Area include annual grassland, coastal
sage scrub, chaparral, oak woodland, riparian, and wetland habitat. Table 8-1, Wildlife Habitat
in Murrieta and Sphere of Influence, lists specific categories and acreages of the plant
                                                  8-5
communities within the General Plan Planning Area. Exhibit 8-2, Vegetation and Land Use,
identifies the location of potential wildlife habitat areas within the General Plan Planning Area.

SPECIAL-STATUS SPECIES
Special-status species include plants and animals that are listed as rare, threatened,
endangered, or otherwise identified for tracking and protection at the state or federal level.
Conservation efforts in the Western Riverside Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan are
largely aimed at species associated with unusual soil types. Special-status plant species are
likely to occur in habitat areas associated with vernal pools and clay soils, wetlands, and areas
supporting chaparral, scrub, and woodlands.
Within the General Plan Planning Area, listed species with specific soil types include Munz’s
onion, San Diego ambrosia, spreading navarretia, California Orcutt grass, and Quino
checkerspot butterfly. In addition, coastal scrub and chaparral habitat areas are important
habitat for the Quino checkerspot butterfly and California gnatcatcher. Annual grassland and
coastal scrub habitat are important to the Stephens’ kangaroo rat, while riparian, lacustrine, and
emergent wetland habitat are important to the least Bell’s vireo and southwestern willow
flycatcher.
                                                                    8-6

WESTERN RIVERSIDE MULTIPLE SPECIES HABITAT CONSERVATION PLAN
Murrieta is a Permittee under the Western Riverside Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan
(MSHCP), and as such, has existing conservation agreements and also sets aside land parcels
within the City as Conservation Land to meet the land acquisition goals of the MSHCP. The
conceptual conservation scenario for the MSHCP Reserve Area is based on existing public
lands, undeveloped land (Core Areas), and identified potential Linkages between the Core
Areas.
Warm Springs Creek and Murrieta Creek are important natural features within the City that are
protected for their biotic and aesthetic value; they offer wetland resources and allow for wildlife
migration. These features are included in the MSHCP as potential Linkages between Core
Areas.
For discussion and planning purposes, the Core Areas and Linkages are grouped into Area
Plans and Subunits, as shown in Exhibit 8-3, MSHCP Area Plans and Subunits. The MSHCP
identifies the following Biological Issues and Considerations for the Subunits within the City and
the Sphere of Influence:
         Murrieta Creek (SW1) and Santa Rosa Plateau (SW6). Maintain habitat function as
         riparian and aquatic species live-in habitat and large mammal movement linkage.
         French Valley/Lower Sedco Hills (SW5) and Warm Springs Creek/French Valley
         (SCM1). Maintain habitat Core for narrow endemic plants (saline/alkali and clay), Quino
         checkerspot butterfly, Riverside fairy shrimp, Los Angeles pocket mouse, western pond
         turtle, and habitat linkages through the City limits (east-west and north-south) for wildlife
         movement and plant dispersal.
BUILT ENVIRONMENT
Murrieta’s built environment interacts with the natural environment by drawing on resources like
soil and energy and creating new resources such as farmland, historic structures, and products
that can be re-used or recycled. The community also seeks to integrate the natural world into
the urban fabric by preserving open space and introducing parks and trees. Developing the City
while enhancing the functioning of natural systems is a prudent way to maintain and benefit
from natural resources.
Urban Ecology
In urban areas where the majority of land is given over to pavement, buildings, or other kinds of
development, ecologically functioning land is a unique and valuable asset with widespread
positive impacts. Creeks, wetlands, habitat areas, parks, trees, gardens, storm water
management areas, and other open space can serve as interconnecting islands of bio-diversity,
providing valuable ecological services.
PARKS AND OPEN SPACE
Discussed extensively in the Recreation and Open Space Element, Murrieta’s parks and natural
open space provide opportunities for outdoor recreation and contact with nature. Trails have
                                                 8-7

been constructed through several parks and open space areas. Much of Murrieta’s open space
follows natural drainage courses.
TREES
Murrieta has a Tree Preservation Ordinance that protects native Oak and Sycamore trees, and
trees of historic or cultural significance, groves and stands of mature trees, and mature trees in
general. Trees protected under this ordinance include palms and trees at the Murrieta Hot
Springs Resort, conifers dating from pre-World War I along Murrieta Hot Springs Road, and a
landmark cottonwood tree associated with a former ceremonial ground and trail route located
near Lemon Street.
Farmland
Murrieta’s economy was once based on agriculture, and there is still farmland within the City
and the Sphere of Influence (SOI). California’s Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program
categorizes the quality of farmland in the state based on such factors as soil type, growing
season, availability of water, and history of crop production. Exhibit 8-4, Important Farmland,
shows the location of farmland types in the City and SOI, including 3,207 acres of Farmland of
Local Importance within the City boundaries.
Table 8-2, Farmland Types in Murrieta and Sphere of Influence (2008), provides a breakdown of
the acreage of lands within each Farmland Mapping Category for the City and the Sphere of
Influence. These Farmland Mapping Categories are defined in the Existing Conditions
Background Report.

Exhibit 8-4 and Table 8-2 are based on the Important Farmland maps prepared by the State in
2008. These maps include land that was used for agricultural production anytime in the four
years before the maps were prepared. However, by 2010 the extent of land used for
agricultural production within the City limits was far less than the farmland depicted in
Exhibit 8-4.
WILLIAMSON ACT LANDS
To preserve agricultural uses, the Williamson Act established an agricultural preserve contract
procedure by which counties or cities within California can tax landowners at a lower rate, in
return for a guarantee that these properties will remain under agricultural production for a period
of 10 years.
According to the California Department of Conservation, no Williamson Act encumbered
properties are located within the City of Murrieta. Approximately 58 acres of encumbered
acreage are located outside of the City boundary within the Sphere of Influence, as shown in
Exhibit 8-5, Williamson Act Farmland (2007). None of these contracts are in non-renewal status
with the State.
Cultural Resources
ARCHEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL RESOURCES
Murrieta enjoys a rich cultural history, with more than 199 documented cultural, archaeological
and historic sites. Cultural and archaeological resources include remnants of prehistoric
habitation such as milling features and food processing artifacts, stone artifacts (flakes, points,
debitage), sites with rock art, village complexes and habitation sites, and prehistoric quarries.
Historic sites include built resources and historic archaeological sites (trash scatters, habitation
remains). It also includes historic resources such as ranches, homes, and sites of historic
                                                         buildings that have been demolished. The
                                                         most historically significant areas generally
                                                         occur along Washington Avenue, west of
                                                         the I-15 Freeway, and Los Alamos Road,

Historic Route.
The City has a Cultural Resource Preservation Ordinance that provides “a mechanism by which
community resources such as buildings, structures and sites within the City of Murrieta, which
are of pre-historic or historic interest or value, or which exhibit special elements of the City's
architectural, cultural, or social heritage may be identified, protected, enhanced, perpetuated
and used in the interest of the public's health, safety, welfare, and enrichment.” Under this
ordinance, a natural or constructed feature may be designated as an individual resource, and a
geographic area may be designated as an archeological district or a historic preservation
district.
The City of Murrieta Historic Preservation Advisory Commission acts in an advisory capacity to
the City Council with regard to the preservation of cultural and archaeological resources within
the City’s boundaries.
HISTORIC DOWNTOWN MURRIETA
The Historic Murrieta Specific Plan,
adopted in 2000, provides a framework
for the future enhancement and
preservation of Historic Downtown
Murrieta. The Specific Plan Area is
bounded by Jefferson Avenue to the
east; Ivy Street to the south; Hayes
Avenue to the west; and Kalmia Street
to the north. The Specific Plan sets
forth guidelines for design of appropriate
development including architectural
characteristics, site planning, parking,
landscaping, and signage. The Specific
Plan also identifies several gateways to
Historic Murrieta that have visual

Washington Avenue.
A number of improvements are planned or have been made in recent years within Historic
Downtown Murrieta. These projects include design elements to enhance the overall historic
theme and character, infrastructure and street improvements, parks, and upgrades to various
City facilities. Historic Downtown continues to be a focal point for future improvements and
planning efforts.

Energy
Energy resources are commonly categorized as renewable or nonrenewable. Future availability
and environmental costs are growing concerns with nonrenewable energy. Two renewable
energy sources, solar radiation and wind energy, are readily available in the area. Geothermal
resources also exist, as suggested by the presence of thermal springs. However, most energy
used in Murrieta comes from sources located elsewhere.
Electricity is provided by Southern California Edison (SCE), whose facilities include
hydroelectric, nuclear, and coal power plants. A growing percentage of the energy supplied by
SCE is from renewable sources: wind, geothermal, solar, biomass, and small hydroelectric.
Under Executive Order S-14-08, California utilities are required to generate 33 percent of their
electricity from renewable resources by the year 2020.
Natural gas is supplied through transmission pipelines by the Southern California Gas
Company. In areas of the City where natural gas infrastructure is not available, homes or
businesses use propane gas. Individual propane tanks are located on the property and the
owners or occupants execute private agreements with propane companies to maintain and refill
the tanks.
Transportation energy is supplied primarily by petroleum or fossil fuels, although hybrid and
electric-powered vehicles are becoming more available, as well as vehicles powered by
alternative fuels. At this time, gasoline and diesel fuels are readily available within the General
Plan Planning Area and throughout the Southern California region. The environmentally
significant consequence of using these fuels is the atmospheric release of greenhouse gases
and other pollutants.
WIND ENERGY
Wind turbines on residential lots can reduce household consumption of utility-supplied
electricity. In order to promote the safe, effective, and efficient construction and use of non-
commercial wind energy conversion systems on rural residential lots, the Municipal Code
includes standards for regulating these systems. The standards are intended to minimize
visual, noise, and safety impacts on the surrounding community.
Solid Waste
Murrieta was found to be in compliance with AB 939 in 2006, having made a good faith effort
(49 percent diversion rate) to meet the goal of diverting 50 percent of solid waste from landfills.
In the two years since AB 939 compliance has been measured according to Annual Per Capita
Disposal Rate, Murrieta has succeeded in meeting the AB 939 target set by CalRecycle. The
City of Murrieta has established a number of programs in partnership with Waste Management
that promote recycling, composting, and waste reduction, all of which have contributed to the
City’s increasing diversion rate and decreasing disposal rate in recent years.

8.4          SETTING THE VISION:
             KEY CONCEPTS AND VISION FOR GENERAL PLAN
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Water Supply
Water is a precious natural resource in Murrieta and in California. Water conservation and
efficiency efforts in Murrieta are occurring against a statewide backdrop of increased demand
for water and decreased supply due to many seasons of drought, which will likely be
exacerbated in the future by climate change. In addition, the southern California water supply
has been reduced by severe restrictions in water diversions from the Sacramento-San Joaquin
River Delta for the State Water Project, which has historically supplemented water supplies
along with water from the Colorado River.
California law requires Murrieta and other local governments to adopt ordinances ensuring that
large landscaped areas are designed to be water-efficient. Plant choices, efficient irrigation
systems, and other landscape design techniques can reduce water consumption from large
projects such as parks, golf courses, homeowner association sites, and institutional uses, as
well as residential yards and smaller landscaped areas. Murrieta adopted the latest Water
Efficient Landscape Ordinance in 2010.
Future water supplies in Murrieta will rely heavily on recycled/reclaimed water to reduce the
demand on potable water supplies. Water districts will need to ensure their water reclamation
facilities and pipeline infrastructure are planned and installed according to their Urban Water
Management Plan projections. Coordination between the City and water districts will be
essential as further development is planned.
Residents and businesses in Murrieta will need to play a role in using water resources
efficiently, and this will be encouraged through education and incentives from the City and water
agencies.
Storm Water Management and Groundwater Recharge
Groundwater is an important source of water for Murrieta. When land is in its natural state,
groundwater supplies are recharged as rain infiltrates the soil. But when areas become
urbanized and soil is covered by impervious surfaces, this storm water runs off and is often
diverted into channels that carry the water away. As urbanization continues in Murrieta, efforts
to recharge groundwater will be important for the long-term sustainability of the City’s water
supply.
Groundwater recharge can be integrated into the design of development projects by preserving
natural drainage courses, encouraging the use of pervious surfaces, and creating areas for
water retention and infiltration. Recharge techniques that may be used on-site or off-site include
recharge ponds, injection points, and storm water retention ponds.
                                                8-12

Besides recharging aquifers with clean water, implementing
a comprehensive storm water management program can
reduce pollution and erosion, and prevent flooding.
Unmanaged urban storm water runoff can cause polluted
and excessive storm water flows that diminish water quality
in the Santa Margarita River Basin.
In implementing its Storm Water Management Plan, the
City will continue its efforts to keep pollutants from entering
urban runoff and to provide measures that remove
pollutants before runoff reaches the creeks.
Hills and Ridges
Murrieta’s hills and ridges offer scenic and biological
values, and are considered to be a community treasure.
The City has regulations that protect hillside topography
and scenic characteristics and prevent slope erosion, and
seeks to preserve habitat areas such as the foothills of the
Santa Ana Mountains under the MSHCP.
Scenic corridors through Murrieta allow enjoyment of these
                                                                    Site design can use vegetated areas to
views. With formal designation of these corridors, the
                                                                      remove pollutants from runoff and
scenic qualities of Murrieta could be recognized at the
County and State level as a community amenity.                         allow water to infiltrate the soil
                                                                              rather than flowing
                                                                          directly into storm drains.
Mineral Resources
The City of Murrieta recognizes the economic value of mining areas and facilities within its
borders. Regulation allows these facilities to co-exist with other land uses and reduces negative
impacts that can be associated with mining operations.
Archaeological Resources
The City of Murrieta recognizes the value of prehistoric and Native American traditional cultural
and archaeological sites within its borders and the need to preserve these sensitive non-
renewable resources. The impacts of the area’s traditional inhabitants have played in the
historic development of the City is also recognized and important to future growth and
development. Appropriate steps and protocols as outlined in the Cultural Resources
Preservation Ordinance will be taken to carefully balance protection of these archaeological
sites, cultural resources and traditional cultural properties with the need to accommodate
development.
                                                 8-13

Paleontological Resources
Paleontological resources in Murrieta will require continued protection during grading and
excavation for development. Local displays of excavated fossils could also provide educational
benefits and promote a sense of place and history, with the potential to attract visitors as well.
Biological Resources
The preservation of biological resources is of great importance to the City and to the County of
Riverside. Ongoing net loss of habitat due to development will contribute to the regional loss of
habitat on a cumulative level. Therefore, the City will continue to carefully balance protection of
natural lands, habitat, and protection of multiple species with the need to accommodate
development. In this effort, Murrieta will maintain compliance with the MSHCP and related state
and federal regulations aimed at protecting biological resources.
BUILT ENVIRONMENT
Urban Ecology
Murrieta seeks to balance community needs within the framework of an improved urban
ecological system. Whether naturally occurring or constructed, areas with functioning ecology
can protect against natural disasters and negative environmental impacts. For example,
wetlands can protect urban areas from flooding and provide centers of habitat for ecological
restoration work. Trees and landscaping provide a wide array of ecological benefits, including
absorbing storm water, cooling surrounding temperatures, removing air pollutants, filtering
polluted water, sequestering carbon dioxide, and providing animal habitat. Permeable
landscape features that can treat and retain storm water, instead of releasing it immediately
during a storm, protect downstream waterways, wetlands, and water bodies from pollution,
sedimentation, and flooding.
Preserving native species is a basic requirement for a sustainable ecological system, and can
also enhance the quality of life of a community, when residents are provided opportunities to
connect with nature and natural systems. Sustaining an ecological system requires protecting it
from the negative impacts of invasive species that often accompany the urban edge. It must
also be protected from pesticides and herbicides, which can contaminate water, air, and food;
breed resistance in pests; and have widespread negative health effects on plants, animals and
humans.
Murrieta sets aside natural open space for habitat, drainage, and recreation. In addition, the
community constructs a variety of green spaces. As discussed in the Recreation and Open
Space Element, the City of Murrieta has a parkland standard of 5 acres per 1,000 people, and
seeks to distribute parks among all neighborhoods. Trees and landscaping are promoted
throughout developed areas, supporting property values while offering other benefits. Water-
efficient landscaping with “California-friendly” plants can also provide habitat for fauna such as
butterflies and birds. To assist in storm water management, planted drainage and retention
areas will be incorporated into development.
                                                8-14

Agriculture
Preservation of farmland in areas less
suitable for urban uses can offer multiple
benefits: scenic value, maintaining a link to
Murrieta’s heritage, and providing access
to locally grown food. A farmer’s market in
Murrieta demonstrates the value that
residents place on obtaining fresh, locally
grown produce. Residents also have
opportunities to see where food is grown
when farms and ranches operate farm
stands and other visitor-serving
agritourism activities, which can also
improve the financial viability of these
agricultural uses.
                                                     Pumpkins from the “Produce for People” community
Increasingly, cities and master-planned            garden were sold at City Hall to raise funds for the garden,
communities are seeking to incorporate               which generates fresh produce for local food pantries.
small-scale agriculture as an amenity for
urbanized areas. “Urban agriculture” includes urban farms, community gardens, and cultivation
on private properties. Facilities for processing and distributing food are another part of a local
food system that supports agricultural uses. Consistent with its heritage and interest in
community health, Murrieta will encourage opportunities for community members to access
fresh, locally grown food.
Cultural and Historical Resources
Murrieta promotes the preservation of historically and architecturally significant sites, structures,
and landscape features within the community and seeks to encourage proper adaptive reuse of
historic structures and sites. In reviewing proposed development projects involving historic
resources, the use of the California Historic Building Code and the U.S. Secretary of the
Interior’s rehabilitation, reconstruction, restoration, and preservation treatments has assisted in
maintaining the historic character of the City while achieving local and regional growth goals.
The City will continue to provide protective measures for the City’s Historic Downtown and Los
Alamos area, as well as other historically and architecturally significant sites, structures, and
landscape features throughout the community that enhance and/or reinforce the City’s rich
history and character.
Historic Downtown Murrieta has been recognized as a special cultural resource in the City of
Murrieta. The Historic Murrieta Specific Plan describes this vision and the guiding principles to
establish a cultural and governmental center, create an attractive town center, improve the
historic and pedestrian scale, and foster proactive economic development.
Building on its historic resources and the cultures that make up Murrieta, the City can help
satisfy community demand for more cultural institutions and events.
                                                 8-15

Energy
Murrieta recognizes the responsibility
of local governments to help combat
climate change and ensure stable
energy supplies. Energy conservation
and improvements in efficiency
reduce demand for energy, while
production of energy from renewable
sources such as wind and solar has
far fewer negative impacts than
producing energy from fossil fuels. As
such, the City is dedicated to using
energy more efficiently and reducing
greenhouse gas emissions — both in
municipal operations and in the
community as a whole.
                                                  Renewable energy can be produced at a large scale
Buildings and transportation combined                 in fields, or by individual panels or turbines
account for approximately two-thirds of                      located on smaller properties.
the energy consumption and greenhouse
gas emissions in the United States. Therefore, in addition to efforts to reduce energy
consumption in buildings, land use decisions and transportation behavior that decrease vehicle
miles traveled can play an important role in reducing the energy consumed and emissions
produced from transportation.
Solid Waste
Discarded waste uses up finite landfill space and often releases toxic material or produces toxic
concentrations of material. Landfill waste also creates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that
contribute to climate change. Organic waste decomposes anaerobically (without using oxygen)
in a landfill, which produces methane gas, a GHG that has approximately 23 times greater
greenhouse gas effect than carbon dioxide. In addition, sending recyclable materials to a
landfill is a missed opportunity to recapture their “embedded” energy — the energy expended in
extracting raw materials and creating these items from scratch.
Waste reduction and recycling efforts are thus proven tools to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions along with material waste. They are also opportunities to raise awareness about
environmental sustainability and the importance of changing behaviors. Murrieta seeks to
continue the success of its efforts to divert waste from landfills. In anticipation of further
requirements from the state related to AB 32, Murrieta should look to create a commercial
recycling program that would promote recycling and diversion of solid waste from landfill by
requiring businesses, nonresidential properties, and commercial buildings to source separate
recyclable materials from all other solid waste for recycling and diversion from landfill and
provide for the collection of recyclable materials.
                                                8-16

Green Building
Green building, either for new construction or retrofits for existing buildings, can greatly reduce
the impacts associated with conventional building practices. Green buildings are designed to
save energy and water, reduce waste, minimize air pollution (including greenhouse gas
emissions), and create healthier and safer indoor environments. Green buildings also aim to
reduce impacts to the site vicinity, by reducing development footprint impacts and encouraging
native plantings that contribute to local ecosystems.
Municipalities are in the position to effect significant change in the adoption and success of
green building practices, either by creating standards or incentivizing green building — for
instance, by removing barriers within City codes or review processes. Murrieta intends to
encourage the application of green building practices within the community that will lead the way
through the upgrade of municipal facilities.
Although the State of California incorporates a set of green building practices into its building
standards code, the field of green building will continue to advance. Murrieta can stay abreast
of current techniques and save more natural resources by encouraging green construction,
where feasible, to go beyond state standards.

8.6         IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELEMENT
Natural resources are shared across jurisdictions and, therefore, conservation of these
resources is an effort that is best accomplished through cooperative efforts between cities,
counties, and various agencies. As called out in this Element, multi-jurisdictional plans
pertaining to conservation include the Upper Santa Margarita Integrated Regional Water
Management Plan (IRWMP) and Western Riverside Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan
(MSHCP). Although implemented by public entities, both plans have implications for private
development in Murrieta.
A number of City ordinances exist that promote conservation of natural and cultural resources in
Murrieta through the regulation of private activity. These regulations are largely carried out
through the development review process and development agreements. The Cultural
Resources Ordinance requires proactive measures by the City of Murrieta Historic Preservation
Advisory Commission in order to recognize and preserve historical and archaeological
resources.
                                                8-26
Businesses and residents in Murrieta are the end users of most resources, and they can be
stewards as well. Education and outreach efforts to these community members by the City and
its partners such as utility providers will go a long way toward conservation of Murrieta’s
valuable resources. The City of Murrieta can implement changes in its own operations to set an
example for these efforts.

             Chapter 9:
     Recreation and
Open Space Element
 
9.1          INTRODUCTION
Surrounded by natural beauty, with hills and creeks within its borders, Murrieta is well positioned
to provide opportunities for recreation, outdoor activities, and enjoyment of nature. Parks,
recreation facilities, and trails promote health, and community members value them highly.
Recreation programs such as classes and events offer a variety of benefits including health,
education, and social interaction. Besides promoting aesthetic values, open space
management and conservation can provide habitat, contribute positively to air and water quality,
and protect residents from hazards such as fires and floods.
The following Community Priorities relate most directly to this Element:
         Protect the natural beauty of the mountains, hills, and waterways.
         Provide abundant parks and facilities for recreational activities, and cultural amenities.
         Provide ample activities for all ages of youth, and jobs for teens.
 9.2         AUTHORITY FOR ELEMENT
California Government Code Section 65560(b)(3) stipulates that the General Plan address:
    “…Open space for outdoor recreation, including but not limited to, areas of outstanding
    scenic, historic and cultural value; areas particularly suited for park and recreation
    purposes, including access to lakeshores, beaches, and rivers and streams; and areas
    which serve as links between major recreation and open-space reservations, including
    utility easements, banks of rivers and streams, trails, and scenic highway corridors…”
9.3          SETTING THE CONTEXT:
             KEY ISSUES AND CHALLENGES
Recreation planning is guided by the City of Murrieta Parks and Recreation Master Plan (Parks
Master Plan). The Parks Master Plan provides information about Murrieta’s parks and
recreation facilities. It also includes a needs assessment and gap analysis, recommendations
for meeting current and future needs, and a financial implementation plan.
                                                  9-1

PARKLAND
At the time the Parks Master Plan was
adopted in 2009, the City had 467.24 acres of
parkland in 48 City parks. This total does not
include joint use school facilities, some natural
areas in Nature Parks, or private facilities. It
includes six types of City Parks – City-Wide
Parks, Community Parks, Neighborhood
Parks, Neighborhood Play Areas, Special Use
Parks, Native Parks – shown in Exhibit 9-1,
Parks, and listed in Table 9-1, Recreation
Facilities Inventory. Table 9-1 reflects several
new parks and facilities that have been added
since the completion of the Parks Master Plan,
                                                         Los Alamos Hills Sports Park is already Murrieta’s
and which increase the City’s parkland
acreage total.                                              largest active park, and will become larger
                                                                 as Phases 2 and 3 are completed.
The following facilities have been added, are
in the design phase, or constructed since adoption of the Parks Master Plan in 2009:
         Torrey Pines Park (8.80 acres) – Neighborhood Park
         Vineyards (10 acres) – Neighborhood Park
         Grizzly Ridge Park (0.44 acres) – Neighborhood Play Area
         Murrieta Equestrian Park (21.98 acres) – Special Use Park
These facilities range in size from Neighborhood Play Areas that are at most 5 acres to City-
Wide Parks with at least 50 acres of parkland. They include Special Use Parks, which are
focused on one type of activity, and Nature Parks, which have limited improvements that
provide public access to natural open space. Los Alamos Hills Sports Park is Murrieta’s only
City-Wide Park, with 45 acres of parkland developed in Phase 1.
Parkland Needs
The City has adopted a standard of 5 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents. As of June 2009,
the City had a deficit of 34 acres according to this standard; and if no new parkland is added,
there will be a deficit of approximately 200 acres at buildout (assuming a population of 133,261).
Additional acreage is required to accommodate recreation facilities such as sports fields and
courts that meet the population’s demands. The Parks Master Plan estimated that 240.3 acres
of parkland would be needed for a population of 120,000 to meet identified needs for
recreational facilities, in addition to what is needed to meet the parkland standard.

Access to Parkland
Besides seeking an adequate quantity of parkland, the City seeks to locate parks within
convenient distance of neighborhoods throughout Murrieta. There are six residential areas that
the Parks Master Plan identified as outside the ½-mile service area of any Neighborhood Park
or Neighborhood Play Area. However, proximity to joint use school sites was not considered in
that analysis, and those sites are located in at least two of the areas indicated as underserved.
RECREATION AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES
Recreation facilities include sports fields and
courts, buildings for indoor recreation, and
other facilities that accommodate recreation
activities. Murrieta’s parks offer a range of
recreation facilities, listed in Table 9-1.
Special Use Parks offer different amenities
than other types of parks. For instance,
Murrieta Equestrian Park (formerly Murrieta
Stud Ranch) has equestrian arenas, a barn,
stables, and open pasture.
Additional public recreation facilities are
found in school campuses and in community
facilities. Murrieta residents also have
access to private recreational facilities, some
of which are used for City recreation                      The former Murrieta Stud Ranch, pictured here in 2009

Joint Use Facilities
A joint use agreement between the City and the Murrieta Valley Unified School District provides
a framework for the City to access the recreation facilities of all school campuses except the
continuation and independent study high schools; and for the District to access California Oaks
Sports Park, Copper Canyon Park, Community Center, and Senior Center. Future facilities
acquired or constructed by either party may be added to the list of facilities included in the
agreement.
Through this agreement, 11 District sports fields become City parks in evenings and on
weekends, and the District has exclusive access to certain City fields and parks adjacent to
school campuses during the school day.1 The agreement also grants the City further use of
District sports fields, as scheduled in semi-annual meetings of the two parties. The City and
District may use each other’s facilities besides sports fields through an application process,
giving each other first priority after their own use (including events that they sponsor, or by
affiliated or related groups).

The City and District may assist organizations such as youth sports leagues and school booster
clubs to access joint use facilities. In addition to the Joint Use Agreement, community sports
organizations can make separate agreements with the District to use school facilities.
Community Center
The Murrieta Community Center is located near Town Square at 41810 Juniper Street. This
facility, built in 1979, provides office space for the Community Services Department and a
3,600-square foot multipurpose room. The multipurpose room has a theatrical stage and a
kitchen, and can accommodate 250 people. However, there are no room dividers, so it can only
be programmed with one class or activity at a time.
The need for additional community centers was identified as a key issue in the Parks Master
Plan. Specifically, the Parks Master Plan calls for community centers that serve youth, multi-
generational families, and older adults with a variety of activities and programs as well as
opportunities for supervised free play.
Senior Center
The Senior Center opened in 2006, and has a 2,000 square foot multipurpose room, 1,200-
square foot lounge, educational room with computers, and offices. The multipurpose room is
used for classes, workshops, and meals. Visitors can use the computers in the educational
room when a class is not in session.2
Besides providing a gathering place for
Murrieta’s seniors, the Senior Center
aims to provide opportunities for learning;
workshops on arts, crafts, and other
hobbies; exercise programs; and
information and services from
organizations serving seniors.
Community Event Space
Murrieta offers indoor and outdoor
spaces for community events that are
held by the City, residents, and
organizations. Community members may
reserve the Community Center, Town
Square Park, and some Library facilities
for events, as well as picnic shelters at                       Town Square Park has a large lawn and stage

Square Park provides space for community events in its amphitheater and large open turf area.
The Library has a community room with adjacent garden that may be reserved for events.
There is also an amphitheater at Antelope Hills Park.
Program Space
Recreation facilities make it possible for the City to offer recreation programs. Community
Services programs are held at the Community Center and a nearby trailer; Senior Center; Hunt
Field; Town Square Park; and in Copper Canyon Park, which has classroom space. Programs
are also held in Murrieta schools and private facilities.3
Facility Needs
Murrieta has an identified need for the following additional recreation facilities in order to meet
current and future demand:
           Swimming pools
           Sports facilities, including:
              y Baseball fields
              y Soccer fields
              y Softball fields
              y Tennis courts
           Off-leash dog areas
           Gymnasiums and indoor basketball courts
Facilities are planned that will help meet the needs for community centers, gymnasiums, and
indoor basketball. Future plans for Los Alamos Hills Sports Park call for a 20,000-square foot
community center that may include a gymnasium and outdoor facilities, including a swimming
pool and tennis courts. A teen center planned for California Oaks Sports Park may also include
a gymnasium.
Recreation Programs
In fiscal year 2010, the Community Services Department served over 8,500 participants with its
programs and activities; the number of participants served increased to 15,009 in fiscal year
2011. Senior programs drew the greatest number of participants, followed by gymnastics,
aquatics, and dance. Other recreation offerings include sports, toddler, art and music, health
and fitness, martial arts, camp, and teen programs. The City also holds a number of community
events throughout the year, such as celebrations for major holidays.
The Parks Master Plan process produced a priority list of recreation program needs but also
advised that responding to changing demographics and recreation preferences is an ongoing
process that will demand staff’s continual attention and resources.

Recreation Funding
Funding for capital improvements and additions to park and recreation facilities in the City of
Murrieta comes from several sources. Fees on new development (development impact fees
and developer special agreements) are a major source of funding to provide parks and
recreation facilities for the residents of newly developing areas of the City. Other sources of
funding include Redevelopment Agency tax allocation bonds, grant funds (including Community
Development Block Grants), and contributions from the City’s general fund reserves.
Funding for maintenance and operation of Murrieta park and recreation facilities and programs
are provided by Community Services District funds, user fees for recreation programs and
facility use, and the City’s general fund.
OPEN SPACE
Murrieta had 1,216.95 acres classified as Open Space on the 2006 General Plan/Zoning Map
within the City limits, as shown in Exhibit 9-2, Open Space.
Lands set aside for protection and conservation of natural resources are designated as open
space. This may include steep hillsides with a slope of at least 50 percent, significant habitat
areas, and creeks. Additionally, within Specific Plan areas, open space may be set aside to
serve as buffer areas and drainage areas.
Some open space is found in conjunction with parkland, especially in Nature Parks. Nature
Parks are distinguished from open space because they provide public access via trails. Up to
10 percent of a Nature Park can be improved for active recreation. However, most of the park is
undeveloped and contains vegetation, topography, or features that are important to retain in
their natural states. Murrieta has seven Nature Parks, the largest of which is Cole Canyon Park.
Trails
There are 15 multi-use trails within the City that
provide opportunities to walk and ride through
parkland and open space. These trails are
shown in Exhibit 5-1, Trails and Bikeways, and
are described in a guide produced by the City in
2006. Made of asphalt, concrete, native soil, or
decomposed granite, these multi-use trails are all
open to horses, bikes and pedestrians.
                                                       Multi-use trails allow walking, biking, and horseback
                                                          riding around and through parks in Murrieta.
                                                  9-8

The Parks Master Plan identifies the need to develop an effective, connected, multi-use trail
system for walking, jogging, hiking, biking, and horseback riding. Community members
repeatedly expressed the same sentiment in workshops for the General Plan Update.
9.4          SETTING THE VISION:
             KEY CONCEPTS AND VISION FOR GENERAL PLAN
PARKLAND
In general, a parkland acreage standard is the ratio upon which development fees and
dedications can be based. Establishment of a standard creates an obligation to fund
improvements that achieve the standard throughout the City. Murrieta’s parkland standard of 5
acres per 1,000 people is the highest allowed under California’s Quimby Act, which gives the
City its authority to require fees or dedicated property to offset new development impacts on
recreation facilities.
However, this standard will not provide enough parkland to accommodate all the recreational
facilities that the General Plan 2035 population is anticipated to demand. In order to plan for
future parkland needs, the City will need to look beyond the parkland standard. The City may
also consider counting joint use facilities as parkland.
The Parks Master Plan identifies 13 undeveloped park sites totaling over 100 acres within the
City of Murrieta, as shown in Exhibit 9-3, Park Site Opportunities. Some of these park sites may
ultimately be considered Nature Parks, for which a maximum of 10 percent of the park’s
acreage would meet the parkland acreage requirement and the remainder of the park would be
considered open space.
RECREATION AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES
Murrieta has a need for additional recreation and community facilities and will need to keep up
with greater demand as the population grows. Table 9-2, Recreation Facility Recommendations
for Current Needs, details how current needs for recreation facilities can be accommodated in
existing parks, joint use schools, and opportunity sites. Opportunity sites are a combination of
parks that have been designed but not constructed, sites acquired by the City but not yet
designed, and other sites with the potential for park use; their locations are shown in Exhibit 9-3.
The City will seek to meet needs for recreation and community facilities throughout Murrieta.
Satisfaction of these needs can be pursued by acquiring and developing new sites, preferably in
partnership with schools or private parties, but also through increased joint use of school sites,
renovation and improvement of existing facilities, and building facilities in current or planned
parks.
RECREATION PROGRAMS
Murrieta’s recreation programs offer sports, activities, and experiences for participants of all
ages. They promote health, provide opportunities to pursue interests and learn, and encourage
                                                 9-9

    social interaction. The City’s special events provide opportunities for residents to meet each
    other and feel that they belong to a community. There is demand for more programming in arts
    and culture, for community events, and for youth programs, as well as for therapeutic recreation
    programs.

Source: City of Murrieta Parks and Recreation Master Plan, 2009.
                                                                                                           9-11

The availability of recreation facilities affects the City’s ability to offer some types of
programming that are in demand, such as swimming lessons and indoor fitness classes.
Besides pursuing the construction of new facilities, the City can access additional facilities by
working with private partners and through the joint use agreement with Murrieta Valley Unified
School District. In locating programs, the City should consider how to make them convenient,
accessible, and equitably distributed.
YOUTH
Children under 18 make up about one-third of Murrieta’s population, and providing programs
and facilities for youth is a community priority. For commuting parents, out-of-school care for
children is especially important. The community can promote success in school by providing
tutoring through the Library, at other venues such as the teen and senior centers, and on-site at
school campuses. Youth programs should provide opportunities for physical activity and team
sports, as well as a range of learning experiences including arts and environmental education.
Community members including youth have also asked for job training and jobs for teens. By
preparing youth for careers, Murrieta can help maintain its skilled workforce. Youth mentoring
programs can also be rewarding volunteer opportunities for the adults doing the mentoring.
For teens, events such as dances and battle of the bands are important social activities, while
facilities such as the skate park provide spaces where they have a sense of ownership. The
planned teen center can meet a variety of facility and program needs, and teens should be
involved in overseeing it. Teen demand for a dance club could be met by encouraging a
privately operated business or through frequent City- and school-sponsored dances.
Murrieta teens are enthusiastic about providing input to the City, as demonstrated in the
General Plan Update youth visioning workshop at Vista Murrieta High School. The City of
Murrieta has a Youth Advisory Committee, in which 11 middle and high school students provide
input on recreation planning and addressing issues that affect teens in Murrieta. This is an
example of the ways in which youth can be engaged in their community, while also developing
leadership skills that can prepare them for the workforce.
OPEN SPACE
It is a community priority to protect the natural beauty of the mountains, hills, and waterways in
and around Murrieta. Community members consider open space to be a treasure and would
like to see natural areas retained in the future, while balancing preservation with development
and understanding that some residents are concerned about property rights.
With over one-third of its land undeveloped and natural resources such as creeks and hills
within its borders, Murrieta has opportunities to designate additional land as open space. Under
the Western Riverside Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP), the City sets
aside parcels as Conservation Land. These parcels contribute to large “Core Areas” of habitat
in the northeast and southwest areas of the City and Sphere of Influence, and create “Linkages”
between them along Murrieta Creek and Warm Springs Creek. To the southwest of Murrieta,
open space connects to the Santa Rosa Plateau.
                                                  9-12

Other considerations for planning open space include recreation access and management of
wildfire and stormwater.
TRAILS
The ability to bike and walk between Murrieta’s multi-use trails, neighborhoods, and regional
open space is a community priority and can be provided in different ways. Additional multi-use
trails provide connectivity for the greatest variety of users, while off-street paved Class I
bikeways accommodate all but equestrian users. On-street bikeways and sidewalks provide
connectivity for bicyclists and pedestrians, respectively.
The Circulation Element provides goals and policies related to connecting multi-use trails to
other paths for pedestrians and bicycles.

Department, Building Department, Public Works, and Community Service, whose day-to-day
decisions are guided by the public policies in this document and the actions of the Community
Services Commission.
The business and development community will do a fair share of the implementation as they
incorporate plan policies into their various interests and projects. Murrieta residents should also
be engaged in planning and providing for recreation and open space.
The City of Murrieta Parks and Recreation Master Plan is the implementation document that will
guide City investments in parks and recreation.

            Chapter 10:
Air Quality Element
 
10.1        INTRODUCTION
Recognizing the importance of air quality associated with the public’s health and welfare and
that air quality is a regional issue that extends beyond the jurisdictional boundaries of a city,
Murrieta has chosen to include Air Quality as an optional Element within its General Plan. The
Air Quality Element is intended to establish policy direction and implementation measures that
allow the South Coast Air Basin to attain Federal and State air quality standards, as well as to
protect Murrieta residents and businesses from the harmful effects of poor air quality. The
Element establishes a number of programs to reduce current pollution emissions and to require
new development to include measures to comply with air quality standards. This Element also
contains provisions to address new air quality regulations and requirements. The City has also
prepared a Climate Action Plan, which addresses global climate change issues and the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
The City of Murrieta is located in the South Coast Air Basin (Basin), a 10,743-square mile area
bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west and the San Gabriel, San Bernardino, and San
Jacinto Mountains to the north and east. Regulatory oversight for air quality in the Basin rests
with South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) at the regional level, the
California Air Resources Board (CARB) at the State level and the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) at the Federal level. The SCAQMD monitors air quality at 37
monitoring stations throughout the Basin. Each monitoring station is located within a Source
Receptor Area (SRA). The communities within an SRA are expected to have similar climatology
and ambient air pollutant concentrations. The City of Murrieta is located in SRA 26 (Temecula
Valley).
10.2        AUTHORITY FOR ELEMENT
Although Air Quality is not a required element, California Government Code Section 65303
authorizes cities and counties to adopt “any other elements or address any other subjects,
which, in the judgment of the legislative body, relate to the physical development of the county
or city.” Once adopted, an optional element carries the same legal weight as any of the seven
mandatory elements and must be consistent with all other elements. Government Code Section
65302(d), which provides the statutory requirements for the Conservation Element, also serves
as the applicable Government Code section for the Air Quality Element. Further guidance is
provided in the Office of Planning and Research’s 2003 General Plan Guidelines regarding the
assessment of air quality impacts in General Plans.
                                                10-1

10.3         SETTING THE CONTEXT:
             KEY ISSUES AND CHALLENGES
The following have been identified as key issues and challenges facing Murrieta in regards to air
quality, its effects on the community, and how it can be addressed as the City continues to
grow.
        Air Quality. Although air quality has steadily improved in the Basin in recent history, the
        Basin (including the City) is designated as a nonattainment area under State standards
        for one-hour ozone and under Federal standards is designated as nonattainment for
        eight-hour ozone. The Basin is nonattainment under both State and Federal standards
        for PM10, and PM2.5. Murrieta community members have identified “good air quality” as a
        treasure of the City, in comparison to other cities within the region. Maintaining and
        improving upon the existing air quality is a focus for Murrieta.
        Land Use Patterns that Contribute to Air Pollutant Emissions. Air pollutant
        emissions within the City of Murrieta are currently generated by stationary and mobile
        sources, with mobile sources accounting for the majority of emissions. Mobile sources
        of emissions refer to those moving objects that release pollution and include cars, trucks,
        buses, planes, trains, and motorcycles. Within the County of Riverside, vehicular
        sources are the largest contributor to the estimated annual average pollutant levels for
        reactive organic gas (ROG), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOX), sulfur oxide
        (SOX), and particulate matter less than 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter (PM10, and PM2.5,
        respectively). In Murrieta, mobile sources of emissions are primarily attributed to
        automobiles and trucks. Murrieta’s urban form and street layout is primarily low-density
        and automobile-oriented with most uses separated from each other. These land use
        patterns support the use of low-occupancy vehicles and higher vehicle miles traveled.
        Many Murrieta residents travel outside the City for services, recreation, and amenities
        that could be provided more broadly within the City. Murrieta community members have
        identified ‘traffic issues,” “uncontrolled expansion,” and “attracting new business and
        jobs” as challenges within the City.
        Population Growth and Development. Population growth and associated increases in
        vehicles and development within the City and surrounding region would further
        contribute to the amount of air pollutants in the City and the Basin. Murrieta community
        members have identified “growth,” as well as increased “traffic and transportation issues”
        as challenges within the City.
        Changing Regulations and Requirements. As concerns over air quality continue to
        become more heightened, the regulatory agencies continue to investigate and
        implement policies and measures to achieve Federal and State standards for improved
        air quality. New and/or revised policies and guidelines require cities to be proactive in
        order to respond to these changes.
        Health Impacts of Air Quality. Air quality can directly impact a person’s health.
        Sensitive populations (or sensitive receptors) are more susceptible to the effects of air
                                                  10-2

         pollution than are the general population. Consideration regarding the placement of land
         uses is important in order to ensure that land uses that potentially emit harmful
         emissions are not located in proximity to sensitive receptors, such as residences,
         schools, playgrounds, childcare centers, athletic facilities, churches, long-term health
         care facilities, rehabilitation centers, convalescent centers, and retirement homes.
10.4         SETTING THE VISION:
             KEY CONCEPTS AND VISION FOR GENERAL PLAN
Murrieta community members have acknowledged
the City’s air quality as a treasure and identified
“stewardship of our good air” as a vision for the
future. Maintaining good air quality is important for
the physical health of the community, as well as for
the City’s economic health. Many of the visions
identified by the community contribute to improved
air quality. The following key concepts and vision
for the General Plan directly guide the Air Quality
goals and policies and are intended to respond to
the key issues and challenges identified above:

         Agencies and Compliance with New
         Regulations and Requirements
NEW DEVELOPMENT AND BALANCED GROWTH
Murrieta has one of the fastest growth rates in the state over the past 20 years. With
opportunities for new development, it is anticipated that Murrieta will continue to grow. Focusing
growth and providing a balance of land uses to meet the needs of the community will contribute
to a reduction in vehicle miles traveled and increase in non-motorized transportation, reducing
mobile sources emissions. This can be achieved by developing a diverse mix of uses
throughout the City, attracting a variety of employment opportunities to reduce the need for
residents to commute for jobs, providing neighborhood retail and services near residential uses,
and providing opportunities to shop, dine and recreate in Murrieta. It can also be achieved by
creating attractive and safe pedestrian and bicycle facilities and by promoting high-quality transit
service. This is consistent with the priorities articulated by the community, which include
economic vitality by attracting higher education, growing a base of clean industry, improving
roadway networks to reduce traffic, and providing a citywide system of bicycle lanes and
recreational trails that improve accessibility without a car. Balancing land uses and growth will
help to reduce air pollutant emissions, while at the same time contributing to achieving a
sustainable economy.

                                                              populations. Sensitive populations (or
                                                              sensitive receptors) are more

    Murrieta can improve air quality by reducing the need for Contaminants (TACs) can have
          residents to make car trips outside the City.       significant health impacts. Land use
                                                              compatibility and potential health
impacts should be considered as part of the development review process. Addressing potential
air pollutant impacts on sensitive receptors can be accomplished through the initial design
phase of a development project, allowing for appropriate siting and identification of mitigation
that minimize health impacts prior to construction. The General Plan guides development and
establishes land use policies to avoid siting sensitive sites near sources of air pollution and to
protect the health and safety of the Murrieta community.
MAINTAIN COORDINATION WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES AND
COMPLIANCE WITH NEW REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS
Rules, regulations, and guidelines to achieve Federal and State standards for improved air
quality continue to change as new information and guidance becomes available. In order to
maintain compliance with regulatory requirements, Murrieta will need to be proactive and
monitor any updated rules and regulations from the SCAQMD, revisions to SCAQMD’s CEQA
Guidelines, and periodic updates to the Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP). General Plan
policies encourage regional and local efforts to address air quality.

                actions, at construction projects when the source represents a public nuisance or
                potential safety hazard due to reduced visibility on streets surrounding the
                property.
10.6        IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELEMENT
To meet State and Federal air quality goals requires commitment and involvement by all
jurisdictions within the South Coast Air Basin. Protecting public health is a mutual goal shared
by Murrieta, as well as other jurisdictions located within the Basin. Although an individual
agency does not have the authority or jurisdiction to implement air quality measures for the
larger region, local governments do have the legal authority and responsibility to direct policies
and actions within their community. The City of Murrieta has established a policy program that
addresses air quality through new development and balanced growth; land use compatibility;
and coordination and compliance with regulatory agencies and new regulations/requirements.
The responsibility of implementing the goals and policies of the Air Quality Element are
assigned to the City’s Community Development Department, and in some instances, this
authority is shared with the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and the
South California Association of Governments (SCAG).

Noise Element
 
11.1         INTRODUCTION
The Noise Element examines noise sources in the City to identify and assess the potential for
noise conflicts and problems, and to identify ways to reduce existing and potential noise
impacts. This Element addresses noise that affects the larger community, rather than noise
associated with site-specific conditions. Existing and future noise from mobile and stationary
sources are considered, as well as the compatibility of land uses and sensitive receptors. The
Element identifies projected noise levels and contains goals and policies to maintain noise
levels that are compatible with various types of land uses, as well as prevent high noise levels in
sensitive areas. The regulatory framework, background information, and existing and future
conditions can be found in the General Plan EIR.
11.2         AUTHORITY FOR ELEMENT
Government Code Section 65302(f) requires that a General Plan include:
    “... a noise element which shall identify and appraise noise problems in the community.
    The Noise Element shall recognize the guidelines established by the Office of Noise
    Control in the State Department of Health Services and shall analyze and quantify…
    current and projected noise levels for all of the following sources: (1) highways and
    freeways; (2) primary arterials and major local streets; (3) passenger and freight on-line
    railroad operations and ground rapid transit systems; (4) commercial, general aviation,
    heliport, and military airport operations, aircraft overflights, jet engine test stands, and all
    other ground facilities and maintenance functions related to airport operation; (5) local
    industrial plants, including but not limited to, railroad classification yards; (6) other ground
    stationary noise sources identified by local agencies as contributing to the community
    noise environment.”

11.3         SUMMARY OF EXISTING STANDARDS AND
             CONDITIONS
Noise, defined as unwanted sound, is principally caused by the operation of machinery for
transportation (automobiles, trucks, trains, and aircraft) and machinery for production (industry
and construction). Noise affects the quality of the environment, both at home and work, as well
as enjoyment of recreational activity. Excessive amounts of noise may have adverse affects on
physical activity and psychological stability. The effect of noise on the individual and the
community varies with its duration, intensity, and the tolerance level of the individual.
NOISE DESCRIPTORS
The standard unit of measurement of the loudness of sound is the decibel (dB). This unit
expresses an exponential increase, where an increase of 10 decibels represents a tenfold
increase in the sound generated. In order to describe “average noise levels,” the
measurements are then weighted and added over a specified time period to reflect the
magnitude of the sound, as well as its duration, frequency, and time of occurrence.
The sound pressure level is measured on a logarithmic scale. The 0 dB level is based on the
lowest detectable sound pressure level that people can perceive (an audible sound that is not
zero sound pressure level). The decibel scale has a value of 1.0 dB at the threshold of hearing
and 140 dB at the threshold of pain. Each interval of 10 decibels indicates a sound energy ten
times greater than before, which is perceived by the human ear as being roughly twice as loud.
A 1.0-decibel increase is just audible, and a 10-decibel increase means the sound is perceived
as being twice as loud as before. In most situations a 3 dB change in sound pressure level is
considered a “just-detectable” difference and a 5 dB change (either louder or quieter) is readily
noticeable.
Sound from a small localized source (approximating a “point” source) radiates uniformly outward
as it travels away from the source in a spherical pattern. The sound level attenuates or drops-
off at a rate of 6 dB for each doubling of the distance (6 dB/DD). This decrease, due to the
geometric spreading of the energy over an ever-increasing area, is referred to as the inverse
square law. However, highway traffic noise is not a single, stationary point source of sound.
The movement of the vehicles makes the source of the sound appear to emanate from a line
(line source) rather than a point when viewed over some time interval. Since the change in
surface area of a cylinder only increases by two times for each doubling of the radius instead of
four times associated with spheres, the change in sound level is 3 dB per doubling of distance.
Noise levels are expressed as A-weighted decibels (dBA), which adjusts the actual sound level
to reflect only those frequencies audible to the human ear. The human ear is most sensitive to
frequencies around 4,000 Hz (about the highest note on a piano) and less sensitive to low
frequencies below 100 Hz (such as a low rumble). Other examples of the decibel level of
various noise sources include: the quiet rustle of leaves (10 dBA), a soft whisper (20 to 30
dBA), the hum of a small electric clock (40 dBA), ambient noise outdoors or in a kitchen (50
dBA), normal conversation at five feet (55 dBA), and a busy street at 50 feet (75 dBA).
                                                11-2

Examples of various sound levels are shown in Exhibit 11-1, Sound Levels and Human
Response.
SCALES AND DEFINITIONS
Numerous methods have been developed to measure sound over a period of time. These
methods typically include (1) the community noise equivalent level (CNEL); (2) equivalent sound
level (Leq); and (3) day/night average sound level (Ldn). These methods are described in Table
11-1, Noise Descriptors.

                                                       The unit for measuring the volume of sound equal to 10 times the logarithm
  Decibel (dB)                                         (base 10) of the ratio of the pressure of a measured sound to a reference
                                                       pressure (20 micropascals).
                                                       A sound measurement scale that adjusts the pressure of individual
                                                       frequencies according to human sensitivities. The scale accounts for the
  A-Weighted Decibel (dBA)
                                                       fact that the region of highest sensitivity for the human ear is between 2,000
                                                       and 4,000 cycles per second (hertz).
                                                       The sound level containing the same total energy as a time varying signal
  Equivalent Sound Level (Leq)                         over a given time period. The Leq is the value that expresses the time
                                                       averaged total energy of a fluctuating sound level.
  Maximum Sound Level (Lmax)                           The highest individual sound level (dBA) occurring over a given time period.
  Minimum Sound Level (Lmin)                           The lowest individual sound level (dBA) occurring over a given time period.

                                                       differentiates between daytime, evening, and nighttime noise exposure.

                                                       These adjustments are +5 dBA for the evening, 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM, and
                                                       +10 dBA for the night, 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM.
                                                       The Ldn is a measure of the 24-hour average noise level at a given location.
                                                       It was adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for
                                                       developing criteria for the evaluation of community noise exposure. It is
                                                       based on a measure of the average noise level over a given time period

                                                       called the Leq. The Ldn is calculated by averaging the Leq’s for each hour of
                                                       the day at a given location after penalizing the “sleeping hours” (defined as
                                                       10:00 PM to 7:00 AM), by 10 dBA to account for the increased sensitivity of
                                                       people to noises that occur at night.
                                                       The Single Event Noise Exposure Level (SENEL) is the most appropriate
                                                       noise level duration rating scale for a single noise occurrence. The SENEL,
  Single Event Noise Exposure Level (SENEL)
                                                       given in decibels, is the noise exposure level of a single event measured
                                                       over the time interval between the initial and final times for which it exceeds

SENSITIVE NOISE RECEPTORS
Sensitive populations are more susceptible to the effects of noise and air pollution than are the
general population. Land uses considered sensitive by the State of California include schools,
playgrounds, athletic facilities, hospitals, rest homes, rehabilitation centers, long-term care and
mental care facilities. Some jurisdictions also consider day care centers, single-family
dwellings, mobile home parks, churches, and libraries to be sensitive to noise. Generally, a
sensitive receptor is identified as a location where human populations (especially children,
senior citizens, and sick persons) are present, and where there is a reasonable expectation of
continuous human exposure to noise.
                                                         According to the Murrieta Police Department,

                                                         specific domestic activity, the majority of calls
                                                         include complaints pertaining to commercial
                                                         activities such as deliveries/loading docks, lot
                                                         sweeping, employee activities (i.e., talking and
                                                         music), and mowing.
                                                         Land uses less sensitive to noise are business,
                                                         commercial, and professional developments.

                                                         manufacturing, utilities, agriculture, natural open
                                                        space, undeveloped land, parking lots,
    Schools are a type of land use that is considered
                                                        motorcycle parks, rifle ranges, warehousing,
                   sensitive to noise.
                                                        liquid and solid waste facilities, salvage yards,
                                                        and transit terminals. These types of land uses
often generate high noise levels. Moderately sensitive land uses typically include: multi-family
dwellings, hotels, motels, dormitories, and outpatient clinics. Current land uses located within
the City that are sensitive to intrusive noise include residential uses (particularly those in the
vicinity of I-15 and I-215 Freeways), schools, hospitals, churches, and parks.
NOISE REGULATIONS
Noise Standards and Land Use Compatibility
The State of California General Plan Guidelines, published by the state Governor’s Office of
Planning and Research (OPR), provides guidance for the acceptability of specific land use types
within areas of specific noise exposure. Table 11-2, Land Use Compatibility for Community
Noise Environments, presents guidelines for determining acceptable and unacceptable
community noise exposure limits for various land use categories. The guidelines also present
adjustment factors that may be used to arrive at noise acceptability standards that reflect the
noise control goals of the community, the particular community’s sensitivity to noise, and the
community’s assessment of the relative importance of noise pollution. OPR guidelines are
advisory in nature. Local jurisdictions, including the City of Murrieta, have the responsibility to
set specific noise standards based on local conditions.

NORMALLY ACCEPTABLE: Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings involved are of normal conventional
construction, without any special noise insulation requirements.
CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTABLE: New construction or development should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of the noise reduction
requirements is made and needed noise insulation features have been included in the design. Conventional construction, but with closed windows and
fresh air supply systems or air conditioning, will normally suffice.
NORMALLY UNACCEPTABLE: New construction or development should be discouraged. If new construction or development does proceed, a detailed
analysis of the noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise-insulation features must be included in the design.
CLEARLY UNACCEPTABLE: New construction or development should generally not be undertaken.

      City of Murrieta Noise Standards
      The City of Murrieta’s regulations with respect to noise are included in Chapter 16.30 of the
      Development Code, also known as the Noise Ordinance. Construction-related and operational
      noise restrictions are discussed below.
                  Construction Noise. Section 16.30.130 of the City of Murrieta Noise Ordinance
                  regulates construction noise. The Noise Ordinance prohibits noise generated by
                  construction activities between the hours of 7:00 PM and 7:00 AM and on Sundays and
                  holidays. Construction activities shall be conducted in a manner that the maximum
                  noise levels at the affected structures will not exceed those listed in Table 11-3, City of
                  Murrieta Construction Noise Standards.
                                                                       11-5

        Operational Noise. Within the City of Murrieta, the Noise Ordinance governs
        operational noise generated between two properties and does not regulate noise from
        transportation sources, such as traffic, aircraft, and railways. Section 16.30.090 of the
        Noise Ordinance establishes the exterior noise standards for all receptor properties
        within a designated noise zone. The City’s exterior noise level limits between properties
        are presented in Table 11-4, City of Murrieta Exterior and Interior Noise Limits.
                                                              Table 11-4

Section 16.30.090(B) of the Development Code further restricts noise levels. Section
16.30.090(B) states, in part:
    No person shall operate or cause to be operated any source of sound at any location
    within the city or allow the creation of any noise on property owned, leased, occupied or
    otherwise controlled by a person that causes the noise level, when measured on any
    other property to exceed the following exterior noise standards:
        1. Standard No. 1 shall be the exterior noise level which shall not be exceeded for a
            cumulative period of more than thirty (30) minutes in any hour. Standard No. 1 may
            be the applicable noise level from Table 11-4 above.
        2. Standard No. 2 shall be the exterior noise level which shall not be exceeded for a
            cumulative period of more than fifteen (15) minutes in any hour. Standard No. 2
            shall be the applicable noise level from Table 11-4 above, plus five dB.
        3. Standard No. 3 shall be the exterior noise level which shall not be exceeded for a
            cumulative period of more than five minutes in any hour. Standard No. 3 shall be the
            applicable noise level from Table 11-4 above plus ten dB.
        4. Standard No. 4 shall be the exterior noise level which shall not be exceeded for a
            cumulative period of more than one minute in any hour. Standard No. 4 shall be the
            applicable noise level from Table 11-4 above plus fifteen (15) dB.
        5. Standard No. 5 shall be the exterior noise level which shall not be exceeded for any
            period of time. Standard No. 5 shall be the applicable noise level from Table 11-4
            above plus twenty (20) dB.
Section 16.30.100 sets forth interior noise levels limits for multi-family residential properties, as
stated in Table 11-4. Section 16.30.100 states, in part:
    No person shall operate or cause to be operated within a residential unit any source of
    sound, or allow the creation of any noise, that causes the noise level when measured
    inside a neighboring receiving residential unit to exceed the following standards:
        1. Standard No. 1. The applicable interior noise level for cumulative period of more
            than five minutes in any hour;
        2. Standard No. 2. The applicable interior noise level plus five dB for a cumulative
            period of more than one minute in any hour; or
        3. Standard No. 3. The applicable interior noise level plus ten dB for any period of time.
Vibration Standards
Vibration is the periodic oscillation of a medium or object with respect to a given reference point.
Sources of vibration include natural phenomena (e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, sea
waves, landslides) and those introduced by human activity (e.g., explosions, machinery, traffic,
                                                11-7
trains, construction equipment). Vibration sources may be continuous, (e.g., machinery) or
transient in nature (e.g., explosions). Vibration levels can be depicted in terms of amplitude and
frequency relative to displacement, velocity, or acceleration. Vibration amplitudes are
commonly expressed in peak particle velocity (PPV) or root-mean-square (RMS) vibration
velocity. PPV is defined as the maximum instantaneous positive or negative peak of a vibration
signal. PPV is typically used in the monitoring of transient and impact vibration and has been
found to correlate well to the stresses experienced by buildings. PPV and RMS vibration
velocity are normally described in inches per second (in/sec). Although PPV is appropriate for
evaluating the potential for building damage, it is not always suitable for evaluating human
response. The response of the human body to vibration relates well to average vibration
amplitude; therefore, vibration impacts on humans are evaluated in terms of RMS vibration
velocity. Similar to airborne sound, vibration velocity can be expressed in decibel notation as
vibration decibels (VdB). The logarithmic nature of the decibel serves to compress the broad
range of numbers required to describe vibration.
CEQA states that the potential for any excessive groundborne noise and vibration levels must
be analyzed; however, it does not define the term “excessive” vibration. Numerous public and
private organizations and governing bodies have provided guidelines to assist in the analysis of
groundborne noise and vibration. The City’s Development Code Section 16.30.130(K) prohibits
the operation of any device that creates vibration above the City’s established perception
threshold of 0.01 in/sec over the range of one to 100 Hertz.
11.4          SETTING THE CONTEXT:
              KEY ISSUES AND CHALLENGES
LAND USE COMPATIBILITY
Land use decisions can have significant impacts on the noise environment. When determining
the placement of land uses, it is important to consider the activities associated with potential
uses and existing uses within the surrounding environment. Incompatible uses can impact the
quality of life of the community. Policies in the General Plan, zoning regulations, and the City’s
Noise Ordinance are implemented to ensure land use compatibility with respect to noise and
locations of sensitive receptors throughout the City.
Noise Measurements
Noise measurements were taken throughout the City of Murrieta at 15 locations as illustrated in
Exhibit 11-2, Noise Measurement Locations. Based upon the City’s development patterns, the
City was divided into Acoustical Analysis Zones (AAZ) to identify areas of homogenous
acoustical conditions. Aerial imagery with a one-foot pixel resolution was utilized for a visual
representation of the City’s roadway and land use layout. In addition, the City’s existing General
Plan/Zoning Map and proposed land use change areas (Focus Areas) maps were utilized to
determine the City’s existing and proposed patterns of development.
                                                11-8

The noise measurement locations were selected as a representative sample of the more
urbanized portions of the City in order to identify ambient baseline levels. The noise
measurements described in Table 11-5, Noise Measurements, were taken to identify ambient
noise exposure in the City.

Noise levels at the selected sensitive receptor sites were measured on November 4, 2010,
using a Brüel & Kjær model 2250 sound level meter (SLM) equipped with Brüel & Kjær pre-
polarized freefield microphone, which meets standards of the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) for general environmental noise measurement instrumentation. Each
measurement was for 10 minutes, and the sound meter was calibrated prior to noise monitoring.
         Measurement Site 1 was located at the corner of Elm Street and Madison Avenue.
         Sources of peak noise included vehicular noise from Elm Street, Madison Avenue, I-15,
         and I-215, an airplane, and truck horn. The noise level monitored at Site 1 was 52.7
         dBA.
         Measurement Site 2 was located at the intersection of Arjay Drive and Estate Hill Way.
         The monitored noise level was 41.9 dBA, with the majority of noise from traffic along
         Hayes Avenue, two airplanes, and a siren.
         Measurement Site 3 was located at the intersection of Jefferson Avenue and Kalmia
         Street. The monitored noise level was 58.4 dBA with peak noise from traffic along
         Jefferson Avenue and Kalmia Street, and vehicles in the City Hall parking lot.
         Measurement Site 4 was located at the cul-de-sac of Pomerado Court off of Douglas
         Avenue. Sources of peak noise included traffic along Douglas Avenue and an overhead
         aircraft. The monitored noise level was 51.3 dBA.
         Measurement Site 5 was located at the cul-de-sac of Summit Park Center off of
         Vineyard Knoll Drive. The monitored noise level was 49.9 dBA. The source of peak
         noise included traffic along Clinton Keith Road and landscaping activities.
         Measurement Site 6 was located at the cul-de-sac of Kilkare Circle off of Boldin Drive.
         The monitored noise level was 51.4 dBA. Sources of peak noise were from traffic along
         Kilkare Circle and three airplanes.
         Measurement Site 7 was located at the intersection of Catalina Street and Chateau
         Drive. Sources of peak noise included traffic along Catalina Street, I-15, and I-215, and
         a siren. The monitored noise level was 51.4 dBA.
         Measurement Site 8 was located at the cul-de-sac of Kaelan Court off of Roland Road.
         Sources of peak noise included a helicopter and an airplane. The monitored noise level
         was 47.1 dBA.
         Measurement Site 9 was located at the cul-de-sac of Copperleaf Court off of Mimosa
         Drive. Sources of peak noise included an airplane, trucks, and maintenance activities.
         The monitored noise level was 50.4 dBA.
         Measurement Site 10 was located along Baxter Road off of Antelope Road, adjacent to
         the Loma Linda Medical Center. The monitored noise level was 41.6 dBA and peak
         noise included traffic along I-215 and Antelope Road, and two airplanes.

MOBILE NOISE SOURCES
The most significant source of noise within the City is generated from mobile sources. In
particular, freeway traffic (vehicles and trucks) and traffic on heavily traveled surface streets
contribute the greatest amounts of mobile noise sources. The Murrieta community has
identified traffic as a challenge, and has identified transportation, including improving
accessibility without a car as a priority for the City.
Motor Vehicle Noise
The roadways within the City that generate the most traffic noise from vehicle and truck traffic
include the major north-south trending I-15 and I-215 Freeways due to higher traffic volumes
and vehicle speeds than other roadways. Major east-west arterials that generate significant
noise include Jefferson Avenue and Washington Avenue. Major north-south arterials
generating traffic noise include Clinton Keith Road, Kalmia Street/California Oaks Road, and
Murrieta Hot Springs Road.
Vehicular noise along major roadways was modeled to estimate existing noise levels from
mobile traffic. The existing and future roadway noise levels were projected using the FHWA
Traffic Noise Prediction Model (RD-77-108), together with several roadway and site parameters.
The FHWA model is based upon reference energy mean emission levels (REMELS) for
automobiles, medium trucks (two axles) and heavy trucks (three or more axles), with
consideration given to vehicle volume, speed, roadway configuration, distance to the receiver,
and the acoustical characteristics of the site. To predict CNEL values, it is necessary to
determine the hourly distribution of traffic for a typical day and adjust the traffic volume input
data to yield an equivalent hourly traffic volume. The California Vehicle Noise (Calveno) traffic
noise emission curves are used as recommended by the California Department of
Transportation (Caltrans) to more accurately calculate noise levels generated by traffic in
California.
Traffic volumes used in the FHWA model were obtained from Iteris (January 2011). These
traffic inputs determine the projected impact of vehicular traffic noise and include the roadway
cross-section (e.g., number of lanes), roadway width, average daily traffic (ADT), vehicle travel
speed, percentages of automobile and truck traffic, roadway grade, angle of view, and site
conditions (hard or soft). The model does not account for ambient noise levels (i.e., noise from
adjacent land uses) or topographical differences between the roadway and adjacent land uses.
Exhibit 11-3, Existing Roadway Noise Contours and Table 11-6, Existing Roadway Noise
Levels, indicates the location of the 60-, 65-, and 70-CNEL noise contours associated with
vehicular traffic along local roadways as modeled with the FHWA computer model.
As shown in Table 11-6, the existing noise levels adjacent to City roadways range from a low of
45.2 CNEL along Guava Street from Madison Avenue to Monroe Avenue to a high of 72.9
CNEL along Murrieta Hot Springs Road from I-215 to Alta Murrieta Drive.

Source: Traffic noise modeling is based on traffic data provided by Iteris, January 2011.
Under existing conditions, very few areas (seven segments along Murrieta Hot Springs Road)
within the City experience traffic noise levels in excess of 70 CNEL. The 70-dBA contour along
these roadway links extends to a maximum of 231 feet from the roadway centerline. However,
many of the City’s commercial areas experience noise levels in excess of 65 CNEL adjacent to
major arterial roadways and freeway rights-of-way. Residences located within this area may
experience unacceptable noise levels. It should be noted that these are modeled traffic noise
levels, and are not based upon actual site measurements.
Freeways typically result in greater noise levels than other roadways due to higher traffic
volumes and vehicle speeds. As depicted on Exhibit 11-3, the I-15 and I-215 Freeways traverse
the City of Murrieta and represent a primary source of traffic noise. The following describes the
traffic volumes and general characteristics of the freeways within the City.
           Interstate 15. I-15 is a major regional transportation corridor that serves as the
           backbone of the transportation system connecting the major urban centers of San Diego
           County and San Bernardino County, while passing through the western portion of
           Riverside County. Based on traffic data from Iteris, ADT along the segments of I-15 that
           pass through Murrieta ranges from approximately 124,000 to 186,000 for both
           northbound and southbound traffic.
                                                                 11-15

         Interstate 215. I-215 is a major regional transportation corridor that serves as the
         backbone of the transportation system connecting western Riverside County to the
         major urban center of San Bernardino County. Based on traffic data from Iteris, ADT
         along the segments of I-215 that pass through Murrieta ranges from approximately
         83,000 to 91,000 for both northbound and southbound traffic.
Airport Noise
Off-road transportation noise is also generated by aircraft traffic from one nearby airport, the
French Valley (Rancho California) Airport, located outside of the City’s Sphere of Influence.
Aircraft flyovers are heard occasionally in the City; however, the aircraft do not contribute a
significant amount of noise heard in the City. The Riverside County Airport Land Use
Commission has prepared a Comprehensive Land Use Plan for the French Valley Airport
(CLUP), which experiences an average of 506 daily operations. The CLUP indicates that the 55
CNEL noise level contour extends slightly into the eastern part of the City along the westerly
side of Winchester Road. The CLUP also designates portions of the City as being located
within Compatibility Zones B1, C, D, and E, all of which require certain land use restrictions.
Railway Noise
Although there are currently no railway operations or associated noise sources within the City,
opportunities to pursue future light rail transit and high speed rail are anticipated. The potential
locations of these facilities have not been determined.
STATIONARY NOISE SOURCES
Stationary noise sources, including construction activities and commercial and industrial uses
contribute to overall noise within the City. Existing and future noise associated with stationary
noise will need to be considered. Residential land uses and areas identified as noise-sensitive
must be protected from excessive noise from stationary sources including commercial and
industrial centers. These impacts are best controlled through effective land use planning and
application of the City Noise Ordinance.
Construction noise is one of the most common stationary noise sources in the City. The use of
pile drivers, drills, trucks, pavers, graders, and a variety of other equipment can result in short,
sporadic elevated noise levels. Although construction noise impacts are generally short-term in
nature, it can often disturb nearby sensitive uses.
Commercial uses within the City are generally located along the I-15 and I-215 Freeway
corridors, as well as other major roadways such as Jefferson Avenue, Madison Avenue, and
Murrieta Hot Springs Road. The primary noise sources associated with commercial facilities are
caused by delivery trucks, air compressors, generators, outdoor loudspeakers, and gas venting.
Residential, institutional, and park uses are located adjacent to several commercial areas of the
City. Commercial operations may cause annoyance to these nearby sensitive receptors.
The primary noise sources associated with these facilities are caused by mechanical
equipment, loading and unloading of vehicles and trucks, and amplified communication.
                                                11-16

Industrial noise is generally limited to the immediate source area and only impacts sensitive
receptors if there is an incompatible mix of land uses in the vicinity of the industrial facility.
Therefore, proper planning, zoning, and enforcement of the Noise Ordinance are important
factors in limiting the amount of disturbance to sensitive receptors from industrial noise sources.
POPULATION GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Future population growth and development within the City will generate new and additional
noise. As vacant and underutilized land is developed in Murrieta, it will be important to ensure
land use compatibility with respect to noise and locations of sensitive receptors.
11.5         SETTING THE VISION:
             KEY CONCEPTS AND VISION FOR GENERAL PLAN
Protecting the public’s health, safety, and welfare
from unnecessary, excessive, and harmful noise is
a key objective of the City. The following key
concepts and vision for the General Plan directly
guide the Noise Element goals and policies and are
intended to respond to the key issues and
challenges identified above:
        Mobile Sources
        Stationary Sources
        Noise Control Techniques
        City Noise Ordinance
                                                            Setbacks and landscaped walls can help to

effective means of controlling noise from
transportation systems is to reduce noise at the source. However, the City has no direct control
over noise produced by trucks and cars because of State and Federal preemption rules.
Vehicular noise emissions standards are established at the State and Federal levels. Local
agencies can play a part in reducing traffic noise by controlling traffic volume and congestion.
Therefore, City noise programs focus on reducing the impact of transportation noise along
freeways and arterial roadways and on site planning, landscaping, topography, and the design
and construction of noise barriers to alleviate vehicular traffic noise impacts.
Motor Vehicle Noise
Future noise levels have been calculated for various roadway segments within the City of
Murrieta. Table 11-7, General Plan Buildout Roadway Noise Levels, outlines the City’s future
roadway noise levels under proposed General Plan 2035 buildout conditions and Exhibit 11-4,
General Plan 2035 Noise Contours, illustrates the proposed General Plan 2035 noise contours.
As indicated in Table 11-7, 24 modeled roadway segments (along Clinton Keith Road, Kalmia
                                               11-17

Street, California Oaks Road, Los Alamos Road, Murrieta Hot Springs Road, and Jefferson
Avenue, excluding freeway segments) would generate noise levels greater than 70 dBA CNEL
at 100 feet from centerline.

Source: Traffic noise modeling is based on traffic data provided by Iteris, January 2011.
Of the roadway segments modeled, 25 segments (along Clinton Keith Road, Calle del Oso Oro,
Nutmeg Street, Kalmia Street, California Oaks Road, Ivy Street, Los Alamos Road, Elm Street,
Washington Avenue, Jefferson Avenue, Madison Avenue, Jackson Avenue, and Hancock
Avenue) would generate noise levels between 65 dBA CNEL and 70 dBA CNEL at 100 feet
from the centerline.
Sixteen modeled roadway segments (along Calle del Oso Oro, Nutmeg Street, Lemon Street,
Kalmia Street, Ivy Street, Elm Street, Hayes Avenue, and Washington Avenue) would generate
noise levels between 60 dBA CNEL and 65 dBA CNEL at 100 feet from the centerline.
Thirteen modeled roadway segments (along Ivy Street, Los Alamos Road, Guava Street, Hayes
Avenue, and Washington Avenue) would generate noise levels below 60 dBA CNEL at 100 feet
from the centerline.

Rail Noise
Opportunities to pursue light rail transit and high speed rail are planned for the future of the City,
which would create a new source of mobile noise. At this time, the location of any potential
stations or rail alignments is not known. The City would be proactive in coordinating with
appropriate agencies in the siting, design, and construction of rail stations and track alignments
to ensure that noise attenuation measures are addressed.
CALIFORNIA HIGH-SPEED TRAIN PROGRAM
The California High-Speed Rail Authority is currently in the process of analyzing the potential for
a high-speed train connecting northern and southern California. The California High-Speed
Train Program consists of a more than 700-mile-long high-speed train system capable of high-
speed train (HST) speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour on a dedicated, fully grade-separated
track with state-of-the art safety, automated train control systems, and signaling. The system
described is designed to connect and serve the major metropolitan centers of California,
extending from Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area, through the Central Valley, to Los
Angeles and San Diego. The HST system is projected to carry approximately 88-117 million
passengers annually by the year 2030.
As of October 2010, the Los Angeles-San Diego Section of the HST alignment is in the
Preliminary Alternatives Analysis (AA) phase. Several alternative alignments are being
analyzed as part of the process. The current set of alternatives will undergo analysis to
determine if each alternative is practical and feasible. Evaluation factors include: operations,
community disruption and impacts, travel time, capital and operating costs, constructability,
environmental constraints and impacts, intermodal connections, development potential, property
impacts and right-of-way constraints. Alignments being considered include the I-15 and I-215
Freeways through Murrieta with a potential station located within Murrieta or Temecula.
The HST has similar noise and vibration characteristics to conventional trains with unique
features resulting from the higher speed of travel. The HST is expected to be a steel-wheel,
steel-rail electrically-powered train operating on its own tracks in an exclusive right-of-way. Due
to no highway grade crossings, the train horn and warning bells would be eliminated except in
the case of emergencies. The use of electrical power cars eliminates the rumble associated
with diesel-powered locomotives. All of these factors allow HST to generate lower noise levels
than conventional trains at speeds with which most people are familiar. However, at higher
speeds, HST shows a noise increase over conventional trains due to aerodynamic effects. A
mitigating factor is that the high speeds enable HST noise to occur for a relatively short duration
(a few seconds at the highest speeds).
Vibration of the ground caused by the pass-by of the HST is similar to that caused by
conventional steel wheel/steel rail trains. The same speed-dependent vibration generation
mechanisms are present in each type of train. Holding down vibration levels associated with the
HST are the new track construction and smooth track and wheel surfaces resulting from high
maintenance standards required for high speed operation.
                                               11-22
Airport Noise
Off-road transportation noise is also generated by aircraft traffic from one nearby airport, the
French Valley (Rancho California) Airport, located outside of the City’s Sphere of Influence. The
CLUP indicates that the 55 CNEL noise level contour is located outside of City boundaries. The
CLUP also designates portions of the City as being located within Compatibility Zones B1, C, D,
and E, all of which require certain land use restrictions. The City will continue to work with the
Riverside County Airport Land Use Commission in the development of the French Valley Airport
Land Use Plan and other planning and environmental studies.
STATIONARY SOURCES
Commercial and industrial land uses are located near sensitive receptor areas. These uses
currently generate occasional stationary noise impacts. Primary noise sources associated with
these facilities are due to customer trips, delivery trucks, heavy machinery, air compressors,
generators, outdoor loudspeakers, and gas vents. Other significant stationary noise sources
within the City include construction activities, street sweepers, and gas-powered leaf blowers.
Residential Uses
Residential uses will comprise the largest land use category in Murrieta, with 10,255 acres and
56.5 percent of the total land in the City. Rural and single-family parcels cover the largest total
area of land. A total of 93.7 percent of the residential land are rural and single-family, while 6.3
percent of the land contains multi-family uses. Future development of residential lots would
create stationary noise typical of any new residential development. Noise that is typical of
single-family residential areas includes children playing, pets, amplified music, pool and spa
equipment operation, mechanical equipment, woodworking, car repair, and home repair. Noise
from residential stationary sources would primarily occur during the “daytime” activity hours.
Commercial/Industrial Uses
Noise generally produced in commercial and industrial districts includes that typically associated
with slow moving truck deliveries, parking areas, landscape maintenance, and similar activities.
Overall, 6.2 percent (1,335 acres) of the total land within the City is designated for commercial
use and 0.5 percent (108.69) acres is designated for industrial use. Commercial land uses are
generally located along major corridors, including the I-15 and I-215 Freeways, and segments of
Jefferson Avenue, Madison Avenue, California Oaks Road, Murrieta Hot Springs Road, and
Clinton Keith Road. Industrial land uses are dispersed throughout the City. Noise strategies
and actions require the reduction of noise transmission between commercial/industrial and
residential uses. Proper site planning and design would ensure the reduction of noise
transmission between these uses. Additionally, any future development of mixed uses would be
designed to limit noise from loading areas, refuse collection, and other activities associated with
commercial activity.
                                               11-23

NOISE CONTROL TECHNIQUES
There are several basic techniques available to minimize the adverse effects of noise on
sensitive noise receivers. Acoustical engineering principles suggest controlling the noise source
whenever feasible and protecting the noise receptors when noise source control mechanisms
have been pre-empted by State and Federal governments.
Noise producers within local jurisdictions include industrial processes, electrical substations,
wastewater treatment facilities, transportation system locations, swimming pool/spa pump
motors, air conditioning units, drive-through speakers, siren usage, and local government
controlled or sanctioned activities (City vehicles, public works projects). Regulatory
mechanisms available to control these noise sources include: City Noise Ordinance, the
application of “conditions of approval” on new developments, land use policy and approval
practices as outlined in the General Plan, and noise information in permit applications for
sources of stationary noise. In the event that source control mechanisms have been employed
and noise impacts persist or are projected to occur, additional techniques should be considered.
The following is a partial listing of noise control techniques:
        Site Planning. Involves the careful arrangement of land uses, lots, and buildings to
        minimize intrusive noise levels. The placement of noise compatible land uses between
        the roadway and more sensitive uses is an effective planning technique. The use of
        buildings as noise barriers, and their orientation away from the source of noise, can
        shield sensitive activities, entrances, and common open space areas. Clustered and
        master planned developments can maximize the amount of open space available for
        landscaped buffers next to heavily traveled roadways and thereby allow aesthetic
        residential lot setbacks in place of continuous noise barriers.
        Architectural Design. Involves the incorporation of noise reduction strategies in the
        design and layout of individual structures. Building heights, room arrangements, window
        size and placement, balcony and courtyard design, and the provision of air conditioning
        all play an important role in shielding noise sensitive activities from intrusive sound
        levels.
        Construction. Involves the treatment of various parts of a building to reduce interior
        noise levels. Acoustic wall design, doors, ceilings and floors, as well as dense building
        materials, the use of acoustic windows (i.e., double glazed, double paned, thick, non-
        opening, or small with air-tight seals), and the inclusion of maximum air spaces in attics
        and walls are all available options.
        Noise Barriers. Ideally, noise barriers incorporate the placement of berms, walls, or a
        combination of the two in conjunction with appropriate landscaping to create an
        aesthetically pleasing environment. Where space is available (e.g., in clustered
        developments), a meandering earth berm is both effective and aesthetically pleasing.
        Where space is restricted, a wall is an effective treatment.
                                               11-24

City Noise Ordinance
Implementation and enforcement of the City’s Noise Ordinance will continue to be the primary
means of regulating and controlling construction and operational noise. The City may require
acoustical studies be prepared as part of the development review process to ensure adequate
analysis of potential noise impacts associated with a development project. Additionally, the City
will continue to coordinate with airport operators to minimize noise impacts associated with this
use.
11.6        GOALS AND POLICIES

N-4.3     Employ construction noise reduction methods to the maximum extent feasible.
          These measures may include, but not limited to, shutting off idling equipment,
          installing temporary acoustic barriers around stationary construction noise
          sources, maximizing the distance between construction equipment staging areas
          and occupied sensitive receptor areas, and use of electric air compressors and
          similar power tools, rather than diesel equipment.
N-4.4     Encourage municipal vehicles and noise-generating mechanical equipment
          purchased or used by the City to comply with noise standards specified in the
          City’s Municipal Code, or other applicable codes.

11.7         IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELEMENT
Noise is generated by a variety of sources throughout the City. Protecting public health is a
priority for Murrieta. The goals and policies of the Noise Element will be implemented by
several City departments including, but not limited to, Community Development, Building, and
Code Enforcement. Individual development projects and activities will be reviewed to determine
whether the proposed use will have an impact on existing and proposed uses within the vicinity.
Project review will include the analysis of land use patterns, compliance with Noise Ordinance
requirements, and may include project-specific noise studies. Code enforcement activities
include responding to and /investigating noise complaints, and noise monitoring. Through
coordinated efforts of all City departments, Murrieta will maintain acceptable noise levels for all
residents and businesses.

       Chapter 12:
Safety Element
 
12.1         INTRODUCTION
The Safety Element describes hazards that exist in Murrieta and the measures that the City is
taking to address them. Some naturally occurring hazards may be unavoidable, but their
impacts on communities can be reduced through planning and preparation. Thus, the Safety
Element addresses geologic, seismic, flood, and fire hazards. This Element also addresses
hazards created by human activity: hazardous materials and waste, aircraft hazards, and
incidents that call for police protection. Expecting that emergencies will occur even when
precautions are taken against hazards, the Safety Element describes the City’s efforts to
prepare for and respond to emergencies.
This Element supports the following Community Priorities:
        Protect and foster a strong sense of community and safety, as well as the “home town”
        feeling.
        Improve health care within the City, and continue to provide excellent school, police, fire,
        library, and recreation services.
12.2         AUTHORITY FOR ELEMENT
California Government Code Section 65302(g) requires that a General Plan include:
    “…A safety element for the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks
    associated with the effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking,
    ground failure, tsunami, seiche, and dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides
    and landslides; subsidence, liquefaction, and other seismic hazards identified pursuant
    to Chapter 7.8 (commencing with §2690) of Division 2 of the Public Resources Code,
    and other geologic hazards known to the legislative body; flooding; and wildland and
    urban fires…”
                                               12-1

12.3        SETTING THE CONTEXT:
            KEY ISSUES AND CHALLENGES
GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
Geological Setting
The City and Sphere of Influence are located within the northern portion of the Peninsular
Range geomorphic province, which is characterized by steep, elongated valleys and ranges that
generally trend northwestward from the tip of Baja California to the Los Angeles Basin.
Features around Murrieta include the Santa Ana Mountains and the Santa Rosa Plateau directly
to the west, the Santa Margarita and Agua Tibia ranges approximately 12 to 14 miles to the
south, and the San Jacinto ranges approximately 35 miles to the east.
Murrieta is situated within two structural blocks or subdivisions of the Peninsular Range
province that are separated by the active Elsinore fault zone, which forms a complex pull-apart
basin known as the Temecula Valley that is filled with sedimentary deposits. Major deposits
and bedrock formations are shown in Exhibit 12-1, Regional Geology Map.
Soils
Expansive soils and collapse soils present potential hazards in Murrieta. Expansive soils are
surface deposits rich in clays that expand when wet and shrink when dried. The change in
volume can exert detrimental stresses on buildings and cause structural damage. The collapse
soils process, or hydro-consolidation, typically occurs in soils deposited less than 10,000 years
ago that contain a high percentage of voids and possess low relative density. Damage to
structures and ground cracking due to collapse of recent alluvial deposits occurred in the
California Oaks area of Murrieta when ground water levels rose due to a rise in groundwater or
irrigation.
Loading Settlement
Loading settlement can be immediate or occur gradually over a long period of time. Immediate
settlement is normally associated with loose granular soils when they are subjected to loads.
These soils are generally found in young alluvium or loosely deposited materials.
Subsidence
Subsidence is the ground settlement that results over time from the extraction of oil or
groundwater. This process usually extends over a large area and occurs on a gradual basis so
the settlement effects on a single site, relative to its immediate neighbors, may be negligible as
the neighboring properties are also subsiding.
                                                12-2
Although there are no reports of significant subsidence due to groundwater withdrawal in the
City, alluvial valley areas are considered susceptible; refer to Exhibit 12-2, Subsidence
Susceptibility Map.
Radon Gas
According to the California Department of Public Health Services website, rocks containing the
minerals that release radon gas exist in the Murrieta area. Radon gas is a naturally occurring
radioactive gas that is tasteless, odorless, and invisible. It becomes hazardous when confined
in buildings and the long term exposure levels in the air exceed the United States Environmental
Protection Agency’s concentration of 4 picocuries per liter (4pCi/L).
SEISMIC HAZARDS
The City of Murrieta, like the rest of southern California, is located within a seismically active
region. Faults and earthquakes present direct hazards from fault rupture and ground shaking as
well as indirect hazards, described below.
Faults
The most significant known active fault zones that are capable of seismic ground shaking and
can impact Murrieta are the Elsinore Fault Zone, San Jacinto Fault Zone, Newport-Inglewood
Fault Zone, and the San Andreas Fault Zone.
         Elsinore Fault Zone. The Elsinore Fault Zone, which includes the local Elsinore-
         Temecula fault, passes through Murrieta to the west of Interstate I-15; refer to Exhibit
         12-3, Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone Map, and Exhibit 12-4, Riverside County
         Fault Hazard Map. The Elsinore-Temecula Fault Zone is capable of generating a
         Maximum Earthquake Magnitude (Mw) of 6.8 per the Richter scale.
         San Jacinto Fault Zone. The San Jacinto Fault Zone is located approximately 21 miles
         northeast of the City and is capable of generating earthquakes in excess of 7.2 Mw.
         Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone (Offshore). The Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone is
         located approximately 28 miles southwest of the City and is capable of generating
         earthquakes in excess of 6.9 Mw.
         San Andreas Fault Zone (Southern Section). The San Andreas Fault Zone is located
         approximately 38 miles northeast of the City and is considered the dominant active fault
         in California. This fault zone is capable of generating earthquakes in excess of 7.4 Mw.
FAULT RUPTURE
To assist cities and counties in avoiding the hazard of surface fault rupture, the Alquist-Priolo
Earthquake Fault Zoning Act requires the State Geologist to establish Earthquake Fault Zones
around the surface traces of active faults. The State has identified two Alquist-Priolo
Earthquake Fault Zones within Murrieta, shown in Exhibit 12-3. The Temecula Segment of the
                                                12-3

Elsinore Fault Zone traverses the City, and the Murrieta Creek Fault is located at the extreme
southwest corner of the City.
Before a project can be permitted within a fault zone, a site-specific geologic investigation must
demonstrate that proposed buildings will not be constructed across an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake
Fault Zone, County Fault Zone, or any other active or potentially active fault. Structures are
required to be set back from active faults. The earthquake fault zones extend approximately
500 feet in width on either side of a major active fault trace and approximately 200 to 300 feet in
width on either side of a well defined minor active fault, as designated by the State.
Development of a building designated for human occupancy is generally restricted within 50 feet
of an identified fault.
In addition, the Natural Hazards Disclosure Act requires that sellers of real property and their
agents provide prospective buyers with a “Natural Hazard Disclosure Statement” when the
property that is being sold lies within an Earthquake Fault Zone.
SEISMIC SHAKING
The effect of seismic shaking on future structures and land development projects within the City
may be mitigated by adhering to adopted building codes. The California Building Standards
Code regulates the design and construction of foundations, building frames, retaining walls,
excavations, and other building elements to mitigate the effects of seismic shaking and adverse
soil conditions.
Secondary Seismic Hazards
Ground shaking can induce secondary seismic hazards such as liquefaction, lateral spreading,
subsidence, ground fissuring, and landslides. Liquefaction of saturated cohesionless soils can
be caused by strong ground motion resulting from earthquakes. A majority of the alluvial
deposits along the Murrieta Creek lie within a liquefaction hazard zone per the County of
Riverside; refer to Exhibit 12-5, Liquefaction Susceptibility Map. The process of liquefaction
may also produce lateral spreading of soils on properties adjacent to creeks and drainages,
such as Murrieta Creek and Warm Springs Creek.
The active Elsinore-Temecula Fault and the Murrieta Creek Fault may develop fissuring along
the fault trace during a significant seismic event or groundwater elevation change, which could
lead to differential subsidence. If commercial water wells are installed within or near the
subsidence zone, the potential for ground fissuring and differential settlement could be
substantially increased.
Earthquake-related landslide potential within the City limits can be understood based on known
conditions and published geologic maps. Several old landslides have been mapped in areas
along the Santa Ana Mountains eastern slopes and the hills along the northern side of the City.
The State Seismic Hazard Zones map provides locations of previous known landsliding or
where local conditions indicate a potential for ground displacements.
The potential for rock fall due to a seismic event or natural weathering and instability is present
in properties at the base of hillsides where rocks and boulders exist.
                                                12-4

FLOOD HAZARDS
Creeks
The City and most of the Sphere of Influence (SOI) lie within the inland portion of the Santa
Margarita River Basin. Murrieta Creek and Temecula Creek are the main tributaries of the
Santa Margarita River. Murrieta Creek drains approximately 220 square miles of the upper
watershed. It runs through the Murrieta Valley and flows southeasterly through the portion of
the City that lies between Interstate 15 and the base of the Santa Rosa Plateau. A network of
washes and intermittent stream courses occur throughout Murrieta, collecting the seasonal
runoff from slopes and valley floors and bringing it towards the creek. Stream flows for Murrieta
Creek have been highly variable, and flooding frequently occurs in Historic Murrieta. Warm
Springs Creek is a tributary to Murrieta Creek that drains extensive valley and upland areas; it
flows southwesterly through the Murrieta Hot Springs area, entering Murrieta Creek in the
southern part of the City.
FLOOD HISTORY
The largest known flood in the Santa Margarita Watershed was in January 1862, and the
second greatest was in February 1884. Other major floods occurred in years 1916, 1938, 1943,
1969, 1978, 1980, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, and 1998. In both January and February 1993,
Riverside County was hit by severe storms resulting in a Presidential Disaster Proclamation.
These large flood events deposited two to six feet of sediment in the Murrieta Creek streambed
from Winchester Road south into Old Town Temecula. Breakouts of floodwaters were caused
largely by the magnitude of the event, vegetation density, and the sediment accumulations
within the channel that severely reduced flow-carrying capacity. Damage to flood control and
other public facilities resulted.
Much of Murrieta Creek and sections along Warm Springs Creek lack formal flood control
systems, and as a result drainage is haphazard in the less developed areas of the City, even
with moderate rain. This results in frequent overtopping of the Murrieta Creek channel by
floodwaters in a number of channel reaches, flood inundation of structures with attendant
damages, and other water-related problems caused by these events including emergency costs,
traffic disruption, and automobile damage.
The Riverside County Multi-Jurisdictional Local Hazard Mitigation Plan assigned Murrieta a
flood severity rating of 3 and a probability rating of 3 on a scale of 0-4, with 4 being the most
severe or most likely to occur.
100-YEAR FLOODS
One-hundred-year floods are those that have a 1/100 or one percent chance of occurring in any
given year. A total of 1,021.2 acres in the City of Murrieta are within the 100-year flood zone, as
shown in Exhibit 12-6, FEMA Flood Zones.
                                                 12-5
The 100-year flood is a regulatory standard used by Federal agencies and most states to
administer floodplain management programs, and is also used by the National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP) as the basis for insurance requirements nationwide. Flood insurance rates are
based on FEMA designations of flood zones. The practice is to avoid or restrict construction
within 100-year flood zones, or to engage in flood-proofing techniques such as elevating
building pads or constructing walls and levees.
Dam Inundation
Portions of the City of Murrieta are subject to potential flooding in the event of dam failure at
Lake Skinner or Diamond Valley Lake. Potential dam inundation zones are shown in Exhibit 12-
7, Dam Inundation. Dam failure is considered an extremely remote possibility as dams are
designed to be much stronger than necessary to survive the largest magnitude possible
earthquake without affecting the dam structure; however, it must be considered and recognized
in the planning process.
Preventive Measures
CITY REGULATIONS
The City of Murrieta’s regulations with respect to flood damage prevention are included in
Municipal Code Chapter 15.56, Flood Damage Prevention Regulations. The purpose of this
chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas.
MASTER DRAINAGE PLAN
The City of Murrieta is located within Flood Control District Zone 7 of the Riverside County
Flood Control and Water Conservation District. A Master Drainage Plan prepared for the
Murrieta Creek area by the District evaluates drainage needs and proposes an economical
drainage plan to provide flood protection for both existing and future development in Murrieta.
Improvements proposed for Murrieta Creek consist of the channelization of the creek and its
major tributaries, and include several concrete-lined open channels and a small network of
underground storm drains. The Plan states that certain flood and drainage facilities are critically
needed for an orderly and economical development of the Murrieta Creek area.
MURRIETA CREEK FLOOD CONTROL, ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION AND
RECREATION PROJECT
Besides causing damage to structures and other problems for Murrieta inhabitants, flooding of
Murrieta Creek has degraded habitat in one of the last high quality minimally disturbed riverine
environments in southern California. In 1997, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers initiated
studies on Murrieta Creek that resulted in the Congressional authorization in 2000 of a $90
million, multi-faceted project known as the Murrieta Creek Flood Control, Environmental
Restoration and Recreation Project. However, limited funding has been appropriated for
construction to date. This project has four phases:
                                               12-6

         Phase One. Channel improvements
         through the City of Temecula, completed
         in 2004. This phase included an earthen
         channel flanked by a habitat corridor and
         multi-purpose trails.
         Phase Two. Channel improvements
         through the City of Temecula to address
         the possible collapse of the bridge at
         Main Street with a major rainfall event.
         Phase Three. Construction of a 250-
         acre detention basin which would
         attenuate tributary flows to reduce the
         peak discharge of flood waters                    The Murrieta Creek Flood Control, Environmental
         downstream, and remove the floodplain             Restoration and Recreation Project would address
         designation from Phases One and Two of              flooding in Historic Murrieta while providing
         the Project. Bounded by Warm Springs                      habitat and recreational facilities.
         Creek to the north and Santa Gertrudis
         Creek to the south, the basin is designed
         as a natural riverine system with ponds that would improve groundwater recharge,
         establish approximately 160 acres of new environmental habitat, and create over 50
         acres of recreational facilities within the City of Murrieta. The multi-purpose basin is
         critical to the overall design of the Project. Until it is completed, improvements
         constructed in Phase One remain at risk of damages from floods.
         Phase Four. Channel improvements through the City of Murrieta that address risk to
         the treatment plant adjacent to the creek from moderate storms. A spill of untreated
         water could contaminate downstream waters including the Santa Margarita River and
         the Ecological Preserve. This phase provides for the largest expansion of “Waters of the
         U.S.” with the development and establishment of a 150-foot wide riparian habitat
         corridor. The City of Murrieta continues to be actively engaged in both the design and
         funding issues related to the Project and has initiated engineering design on both the
         Guava Street and Ivy Street Bridges.
FIRE HAZARDS
Wildland Fires
A wildland fire is an uncontrolled fire spreading through vegetative fuels that may expose or
consume structures. Although not located in a wilderness area, the threat of a wildland fire in or
near Murrieta is high due to the wildland urban areas in and around the City, where structures
and other human development meet or intermingle with wildland or vegetative fuels. The threat
of wildfire is particularly significant during dry summer months and when there are strong Santa
Ana winds. The fire season extends approximately five to six months, from late spring through
fall. The aftermath of wildland fire produces new areas of potential landslide as burned and
defoliated areas are exposed to winter rains.
                                                   12-7

The undeveloped hillside areas in and adjacent
to the City present a potentially serious hazard
due to the high potential for large scale wildland
fires, as shown in Exhibit 12-8, High Fire
Hazard Zones. The escarpments along the
western boundary of the City are notorious for
their threat of wildland fires that move quickly
through the area. Similar wildland areas exist in
northern Murrieta, in the Greer Ranch and Los
Alamos areas. Within the City, wildland fires
are assigned a severity rating of 3 and a
probability rating of 2 in the Riverside County
Multi-Jurisdictional Local Hazard Mitigation
Plan.
There are a number of building criteria and site
maintenance techniques available for the
Murrieta Fire Department and property owners
to use for areas within a High Fire Hazard Zone
or areas described as Wildland Urban Interface
areas, which are areas where structures and
other human development meet and intermingle
with undeveloped wildland or vegetative fuels.
These techniques are detailed in the California
Building Standards Code, Chapters 7 and 7A,           A vegetation fire near I-15 on a windy day in October
and the California Fire Code, Chapter 47              2009 was contained without damage to structures.
(California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part
9), and address topics such noncombustible
siding for buildings and 100-foot fuel modification (buffer) zones. In addition, community
planning, awareness, and involvement are proven elements of effectively reducing the
occurrence of wildland fires and damage associated with them.
Urban Fires
No significant unusual urban fire hazards have been identified in Murrieta. Local high fire
hazard zones are located in the wildland/urban interface areas, as described above.
Management of hazardous materials that can cause fires is described in the Hazardous
Materials Hazards section. Protection from urban fire hazards includes fire prevention and
suppression, described in Fire Protection below.
                                                12-8
Fire Protection
The Murrieta Fire Department is the primary
provider of fire suppression and fire
prevention services in the City of Murrieta,
while the Sphere of Influence is served by
the Riverside County Fire Department.
However, the Department participates in an
Automatic Aid Agreement with the County
Fire Department to expedite service
delivery to the eastern portion of the City.
The Murrieta Fire Department may also
provide service to the Sphere by means of
this Automatic Aid Agreement.
The Fire Department participates in the                      The Murrieta Fire Department is prepared
California Master Mutual Aid Agreement. In                     to respond to a variety of emergencies.
the event of a major fire, outside resources
can be brought into the City as needed.
The Fire Department has five stations located to optimize response times throughout the City of
Murrieta, listed in Table 12-1, Murrieta Fire Department Stations, with a proposed sixth station in
the eastern Sphere of Influence area (refer to Exhibit 12-9, Fire Station Service Areas).
                                               Table 12-1

                     Fire Station No. 4          28155 Baxter Road
                     Fire Station No. 5          38391 Vineyard Parkway
                     Fire Station No. 6          Specific Location TBD
RESPONSE TIME AND ISO RATING
The Department has a target response time of 6½ minutes from the time of the alarm on all
calls, which includes 5½ minutes of drive time and a one minute “turnout” time. Stations in the
outlying regions experience longer average response times, such as the eastern portion of the
City along Winchester Road and in the area between Winchester and the I-215 north of Clinton
Keith. A sixth fire station in this area is contemplated to help achieve the target response time.
Insurance Services Office (ISO) rates fire department staffing and equipment, communications
centers and water systems. The numeral classification rating is utilized to establish the
community's commercial and industrial insurance rates. For every decrease in one rating point,
                                                  12-9

these insurance costs decrease by approximately 10 percent. The Fire Department’s ISO rating
is 4 in areas with fire hydrants and 9 in outlying areas that do not have water supply.
PROTECTION FOR HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS
As Murrieta develops with more Class A high-rise office buildings, further investments in Fire
Department equipment and personnel are needed. An aerial truck company with a ladder
extension of 100 feet will be able to access and provide fire suppression for buildings such as
Loma Linda University Medical Center-Murrieta.
FIRE PREVENTION
The Fire Department engages in activities that are aimed at preventing fires and compliance
with California Building Standards Code, Chapters 7 and 7A, and the California Fire Code
(California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part 9). The Department provides fire protection
engineering, building inspections for code compliance, and hazardous materials inspections. As
described later in this Element, the Department also provides education and training in public
safety and emergency preparedness.
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND WASTE
A hazardous material is any substance that may be explosive, flammable, poisonous, corrosive,
radioactive, reactive, or any combination thereof, because of its quantity, concentration, or
characteristics. Hazardous materials require special care in handling due to the hazards they
pose to public health, safety, and the environment. Potential hazards associated with
hazardous materials include fires, explosions, and leaks. Releases of hazardous materials can
be damaging when they occur in highly populated areas or along transportation routes.
Hazardous materials are transported through the City, and businesses within the City handle,
transport, and/or store hazardous materials. Other sources of hazardous materials include
agricultural operations, illegal drug manufacturing, and clandestine dumping. Within the City,
hazardous materials accidents are assigned a severity rating of 3 and a probability rating of 3 in
the Riverside County Multi-Jurisdictional Local Hazard Mitigation Plan.
Existing Federal, State, and local laws regulate the use, transport, disposal, and storage of
hazardous materials within the City.
Transport of Hazardous Materials
Hazardous substance incidents are likely to occur within the City of Murrieta due to the
presence of highways and railways. Transportation of hazardous materials/wastes is regulated
by California Code of Regulations Title 26. The Federal Department of Transportation (DOT) is
the primary regulatory authority for the interstate transport of hazardous materials, and
establishes regulations for safe handling procedures (i.e., packaging, marking, labeling, and
routing). The California Highway Patrol and the California Department of Transportation enforce
Federal and State regulations and respond to hazardous materials transportation emergencies.
                                               12-10

Emergency responses are coordinated as necessary between Federal, State and local
governmental authorities and private persons through the Murrieta Emergency Operations Plan.
Hazardous Materials Sites
Certain businesses in the City of Murrieta incorporate hazardous materials into their production
or service processes, and some generate hazardous waste. These businesses include
automotive services, dry cleaners, photo processing, printing, lithography, and medical services.
Hazardous materials disclosure allows for the inspection of businesses that generate, store, and
use hazardous materials. Through regular inspections, the Murrieta Fire Department can
identify hazardous conditions and can obtain compliance through the fire code to provide for the
safety of citizens and fire fighters in the event of a hazardous materials fire or release.
Monitoring of sites which have contamination associated with underground tanks used to store
petroleum products is the primary responsibility of the California Department of Health Services
and the Regional Water Quality Control Board. The Existing Conditions report provides
information on known leaking underground fuel tank (LUFT) sites in Murrieta.
At least one property in Murrieta is subject to regulation under the Site Mitigation and
Brownfields Reuse Program of the California Department of Toxic Substances Control. Further
information is provided in the Existing Conditions Background Report.
Hazardous Materials Incidents
The Murrieta Fire Department responds to hazardous materials incidents, with further
assistance provided by the County Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response Team and
the County Health Department. All Murrieta Fire Department personnel receive first responder
operations training and are trained in hazardous materials decontamination procedures, so that
they can determine that a problem exists, isolate the problem, and assist an advanced team
when it arrives.
Hazardous Waste
Hazardous waste is waste with properties that make it dangerous or potentially harmful to
human health or the environment. Through its membership in the Southern California
Hazardous Waste Management Authority, the County of Riverside has agreed to work on a
regional level to solve problems involving hazardous waste. The County of Riverside does not
presently have any hazardous waste management facilities within its jurisdiction and therefore
must rely on intergovernmental agreements to fulfill its fair share responsibility. The Riverside
County Hazardous Waste Management Plan is the County’s primary planning document for the
management of hazardous materials and waste.
Riverside County landfills do not accept hazardous waste. However, households may bring
hazardous waste to collection centers and collection events, while businesses contract with
registered hazardous waste transporters.
                                               12-11

AIRCRAFT HAZARDS
The French Valley Airport is a County-owned public-use airport located on SR-79 (Winchester
Road) in unincorporated Riverside County east of Murrieta, adjacent to Temecula and
Winchester. The airport is primarily used for single engine fixed-wing general aviation aircraft.
Airport activity is anticipated to increase from approximately 84,000 annual operations in 2002
to 185,000 in about 20 years.
The Riverside County Airport Land Use Commission (RCALUC) adopts plans to protect and
promote the safety and welfare of airport users and residents in the airport vicinity. The
Riverside County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan establishes policies applicable to land use
compatibility planning in the vicinity of airports throughout Riverside County. Compatibility plans
serve as a tool for use by airport land use commissions in fulfilling their duty to review proposed
development plans for airports and surrounding land uses. Additionally, compatibility plans set
compatibility criteria applicable to local agencies in their preparation or amendment of land use
plans and ordinances and to landowners (including special district and other local government
entities as well as private parties) in their design of new development. State law requires each
local agency having jurisdiction over land uses within an ALUC’s planning area to modify its
general plan and any affected specific plans to be consistent with the compatibility plan.
As adopted by the RCALUC, the Riverside County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan Policy
Document establishes policies applicable to land use compatibility planning in the vicinity of
airports throughout Riverside County, including French Valley Airport. Included in the Policy
Document are Compatibility Criteria and Airport Influence Area maps for each individual airport.
The Compatibility Plan details the procedural requirements associated with the compatibility
review of development proposals. An “Airport Influence Area” is an area in which current or
future airport-related noise, overflight, safety, or airspace protection factors may significantly
affect land uses or necessitate restrictions on those uses.
The basic function of airport land use compatibility plans is to promote compatibility between
airports and the land uses that surround them. Compatibility plans set compatibility criteria
applicable to local agencies in their preparation or amendment of land use plans and ordinances
and to landowners in their design of new development. The principal compatibility concerns
involve impacts related to:
         Exposure to aircraft noise;
         Land use safety with respect both to people on the ground and the occupants of aircraft;
         Protection of airport airspace; and
         General concerns related to aircraft overflights.
                                                12-12

The basic criteria for assessing whether a land use plan, ordinance, or development proposal is
deemed compatible with a nearby airport are set forth in Table 2A of ALUC’s Policy Document,
Basic Compatibility Criteria Matrix.1 These criteria are used in conjunction with the compatibility
map and policies for each airport. The Compatibility Criteria matrix represents a compilation of
compatibility criteria associated with each of the four airport impacts identified above. The
Compatibility Criteria are presented according to the following Compatibility Zones, which are
set forth for the purposes of assessing land use compatibility within the airport influence area:
        Zone A, Runway Protection Zone and Within Building Restriction Line: Noise
        impact is very high; and risk level is very high.
        Zone B1, Inner Approach/Departure Zone: Noise impact is high; risk level is high.
        Zone B2, Adjacent to Runway Zone: Noise impact is moderate to high; risk level is
        low to moderate.
        Zone C, Extended Approach/Departure Zone: Noise impact is moderate; risk level is
        moderate.
        Zone D, Primary Traffic Patterns and Runway Buffer Area Zone: Noise impact is
        moderate; risk level is low.
        Zone E, Other Airport Environs Zone: Noise impact is low; risk level is low.
        “*”, Height Review Overlay: Noise impact is low; risk level is moderate.
The Compatibility Criteria in Table 2A specify the maximum residential densities and non-
residential intensities, required open land, prohibited land uses, and other development
conditions (i.e., avigation easement dedication, structure locations, minimum Noise Level
Reductions (NLR), airspace review, and deed notice requirement). The Compatibility Criteria
are discussed in detail in Chapter 2 of the ALUC’s Policy Document, Compatibility Criteria for
Land Use Actions.
The Compatibility Plan identifies the following prohibited uses within each of the zones:
        Zones B1 and B2 prohibit children’s schools, day care centers, libraries, hospitals,
        nursing homes, places of worship, buildings with more than two above ground habitable
        floors, highly noise-sensitive outdoor non-residential uses, aboveground bulk storage of
        hazardous materials, critical community infrastructure facilities, and hazards to flight
        which can include physical (e.g., tall objects), visual, and electronic forms of interference
        with the safety of aircraft operations.
        Zone C prohibits children’s schools, day care centers, libraries, hospitals, nursing
        homes, buildings with greater than three aboveground habitable floors, highly noise-
        sensitive outdoor non-residential uses, and hazards to flight.

         Zone D prohibits highly noise-sensitive outdoor non-residential uses and hazards to
         flight.
         Zone E prohibits hazards to flight.
The Compatibility Plan identifies additional compatibility policies for specific zones that pertain
to building heights, residential densities, non-residential intensities, and calculations regarding
the concentration of people.
The Compatibility Plan contains land use restrictions for the French Valley Airport that affect
land use densities and building heights within the City of Murrieta. As addressed in the Noise
Element, aircraft from French Valley Airport do not contribute a significant amount of noise
heard in the City. Refer to the Land Use Element for goals and policies related to the French
Valley Airport.
POLICE PROTECTION
The Murrieta Police Department provides
police protection services within the City of
Murrieta. Besides responding to incidents
involving safety and law enforcement, the
Police Department actively promotes
safety through education programs,
community partnerships, and providing
advice on incorporating Crime Prevention
Through Environmental Design principles
into development projects.

Staffing and Response Times
The Department’s goals will be to reach and maintain police officer and civilian support
employee staffing levels to effectively and efficiently address public safety needs. Established
response times are as shown in Table 12-3, Target Response Times. The average response
times for Priority 1 and Priority 3 calls are longer than the targets while average response time
for Priority 2 calls is shorter than the target.
                                               Table 12-3

                          Priority 1                 6 minutes
                          Priority 2                 15 minutes
                          Priority 3                 35 minutes
Mutual Aid Agreements
The Department has an automatic aid agreement with the Hemet Police Department S.W.A.T.
Team and participates in mutual aid agreements with other S.W.A.T. Teams in Riverside
County. The Department also follows the State of California Law Enforcement Mutual Aid Plan.
Resources shared through these agreements include Murrieta’s bloodhound—used for
investigations—and the Riverside County Sheriff’s helicopter.
Community Education and Participation
A safe, crime-free environment is created by the community as a whole. Thus, the Police
Department has several programs to engage community members, including youth, as partners
in promoting safety.
YOUTH PROGRAMS
The Police Department has several educational programs for children in 1st grade through 12th
grade: 9-1-1 For Kids, D.A.R.E. and Red Ribbon Week, Every-15-Minutes, and Kid Print/Safety
Fairs.
The School Resource Officer Program assigns officers full-time to middle and high schools.
School Resource Officers interact with students and serve as positive role models, while
providing law enforcement for the campuses.
                                                 12-16

Police Activities League (PAL) coordinates recreational, educational, and athletic activities for
disadvantaged or at-risk youth between the ages of 5 and 17. Police officers volunteer their
time to attend PAL events with the intention of providing mentorship and to serve as positive
role models. PAL activities create an environment where youth and law enforcement are able to
communicate with each other in a neutral environment to foster positive attitudes and mutual
respect.
The Department has two programs for youth rehabilitation. The Youth Accountability Team
assesses the situations and arrests of delinquent youth aged 12 to 17 and implements a
program aimed at rehabilitation, including service referrals and visits. The Southwest Valley
Youth Court provides an alternative approach to juvenile justice in which juvenile respondents
are sentenced by a jury of their peers for infractions and non-violent misdemeanor crimes.
VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS
Community members are involved in many of the Department’s programs. For instance, in
Home to School Safety Patrols, parents and community members monitor designated locations
around schools to ensure the safety of children on their way to and from school. The Special
Enforcement Team manages Murrieta’s Neighborhood Watch program.
The Department expands its capacity with the Reserve Officer program, as well as with the
Volunteer Program in which participants volunteer at least 16 hours per month. Volunteers
assist in Neighborhood Watch, youth programs, Crime Free Multi-Housing, parades, citizen
patrols, front counter and receptionist responsibilities, school patrols, and special events.
Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)
The built environment can present opportunities for crimes to occur, or discourage crimes. For
instance, design can influence the amount of surveillance provided by residents or passersby,
and whether there is an easy escape for someone who commits a crime. Design of public
spaces and the relationships between buildings and public space are important considerations
in Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED). CPTED is a set of approaches
to the design of the built environment that seek to minimize opportunities for crime.
CRIME FREE MULTI-HOUSING PROGRAM
New multi-family housing developments going through the development review process in
Murrieta must participate in the Crime Free Multi-Housing Program. Through this program, the
Department provides recommendations for improving the safety of the developments using
CPTED strategies. Tenants also sign a lease addendum form, which lists criminal acts that
result in immediate termination of the lease. Communication between rental property managers
and the Department helps both parties to deal with problem tenants.
                                              12-17

EMERGENCY RESPONSE
Emergency Services
EMERGENCY DISPATCH
Emergency 911 services are provided by the Murrieta Police Department as a joint police/fire
dispatch center, dispatching Murrieta fire, police, paramedics, and ambulance services. The
dispatch center is inter-connected to neighboring law and fire dispatch centers as well as AMR
Ambulance dispatch, the County Operational Area, School District, and utility companies. It is
also interconnected to fire apparatus via systems that allow for backup forms of communication
between the dispatch center, vehicles, and personnel.
MEDICAL SERVICES
Firefighters are cross-trained to provide services for medical emergencies. All fire suppression
personnel are trained to the level of Emergency Medical Technician Defibrillator (EMT-D).
Firefighters, Engineers, and Captains are trained as Paramedics. The Department’s engine
companies are equipped for paramedic service, and the front-line engines can transport
critically ill or injured persons to hospitals.
URBAN SEARCH AND RESCUE (USAR) TASK FORCE
The Murrieta Fire Department maintains an Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) team of
professional firefighters that are certified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
They serve the larger community as part of California Task Force 6, supervised by the Riverside
City Fire Department and composed of representatives from several Inland Empire fire
agencies. The USAR team members regularly train with other agencies for rapid deployment to
local, regional, and national incidents.
S.W.A.T. TEAM
The purpose of the Special Weapons and Tactics (S.W.A.T.) Team is to perform special tactical
missions in response to unusual occurrences or highly dangerous, life threatening police
situations where special skills, tactics, training, and/or equipment are required to protect life and
property.
Emergency Preparedness
EVACUATION ROUTES
Currently, the City of Murrieta has no defined emergency routes. Interstate 15 (I-15) and
Interstate 215 (I-215) may be considered emergency routes as they traverse the City granting
access from many of the main thoroughfares.
                                                12-18

EMERGENCY INCIDENT INFORMATION
In the event of a major emergency such as fire, hazardous materials spill, police activity or other
situation which may directly impact the City of Murrieta or its residents, the “Emergency Incident
Information” City website page will contain updated information on the nature of the incident,
potential impacts to traffic circulation, possible evacuations and/or other pertinent information.
The City also has an emergency radio station at AM 1640. Residents who wish to be notified of
emergency events and disasters in their area can sign up for the Riverside County’s Early
Warning Notification System.
COMMUNITY EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM (CERT)
The Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) is a nationally recognized program
designed to train citizens in the skills needed to survive an earthquake or other disaster should
emergency services be interrupted for an extended period of time because of the size of the
areas affected, lost communications, and impassable roads. CERT training consists of basic
understanding of disaster preparation, disaster teamwork, fire suppression, light search and
rescue, and First Aid and CPR. Murrieta firefighters provide the free training to community
groups and associations.
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION
The City’s website provides information from the Murrieta Fire Department to assist community
members in preparing for emergencies, such as a list of supplies and a preparedness checklist.
As in CERT training, residents are urged to prepare for at least a week of self-sufficiency.
Emergency Operations Plan
The City of Murrieta Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) addresses the planned response to
extraordinary emergency situations associated with natural disasters, national security
emergencies, and technological incidents affecting the City of Murrieta. The objective of the
EOP is to coordinate and incorporate all the facilities and personnel of the City into an efficient
organization capable of responding effectively to all disasters and emergencies. It also
facilitates multi-agency and multi-jurisdictional coordination, particularly between the City of
Murrieta and Riverside County, special districts, and State agencies, in emergency operations.
The EOP describes the operations of the City of Murrieta Emergency Operations Center (EOC),
which is the central management entity responsible for directing and coordinating the various
City departments and other agencies in their emergency response activities. The EOC
centralizes the collection and dissemination of information about the emergency and makes
policy-level decisions about response priorities and the allocation of resources. The Police
Department has been designated at the primary EOC. As part of the City’s Emergency
Management Program, the EOC Manager is responsible for ensuring the readiness of the EOC.
Departments within the City that have roles and responsibilities identified by the plan are
expected to develop and maintain their own department-specific EOPs, emergency response
checklists based on and consistent with the provisions of the plan, and detailed Standard
Operating Procedures (SOPs).
                                                12-19

Mutual Aid Agreements
Incidents frequently require responses that exceed the resource capabilities of the affected
response agencies and jurisdictions. When this occurs, mutual aid is provided by other
agencies, local governments, and the State. Mutual aid is voluntary aid and assistance by the
provision of facilities and services, including fire, police, medical and health, transportation,
communications, utilities, and other assistance.
The California Master Mutual Aid Agreement is designed to ensure that adequate facilities,
resources, and other support are provided to jurisdictions whenever their own resources prove
to be inadequate to cope with a given situation. The City of Murrieta is part of Mutual Aid
Region VI. Inter-agency, multi-agency, and discipline-specific mutual aid system coordination is
used by the City of Murrieta and other member jurisdictions of the Riverside County for
coordinating mutual aid. The Murrieta Fire Department is also part of the standard Countywide
and Statewide mutual aid systems.
Volunteer and private agencies are part of the City of Murrieta’s mutual aid system. The
American Red Cross and Salvation Army are significant elements of response to meet the care
and shelter needs of disaster victims. Private sector medical/health resources are also an
essential part of the medical response. Volunteer and private agencies mobilize volunteers and
other resources through their own systems. They may also identify resource needs that are not
met within their own systems that would be requested through the mutual aid system.
12.4        SETTING THE VISION:
            KEY CONCEPTS AND VISION FOR GENERAL PLAN
Community members describe Murrieta as safe, and place importance on keeping it that way.
Residents feel that Murrieta is good for families and want it to be a safe, healthy environment for
children in the future. Youth also recognize and value the safety and sense of community they
feel in Murrieta. This sense of safety in Murrieta comes from the trust between community
members, upkeep of the physical environment, and the provision of effective fire and police
services.
The City promotes safety through education, engineering, enforcement, community design, and
planning for hazards. Fire and Police Departments are involved in these preventive activities
and respond to emergencies. These Departments also recognize that safety is in the hands of
the people who live and work in Murrieta. Through outreach and education, the City can help
community members to create a safe environment.
                                               12-20

GEOLOGIC AND SEISMIC HAZARDS
Site-specific geologic review is used to evaluate geologic and seismic hazards that may affect a
particular development, and identify appropriate corrective measures. The City requires
geotechnical engineering reports for any development within areas with known geologic or
seismic hazards, for grading permits, for hillside development, and for proposed critical uses
such as hospitals and utilities. The City may also designate land as open space where hazards
such as fault lines preclude development.
FLOOD HAZARDS
The Murrieta Creek Flood Control, Environmental Restoration and Recreation Project is
designed to reduce flooding as well as to provide other benefits including groundwater recharge,
improved habitat, wildlife corridors, and recreation. Key entities involved in this project are the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Riverside County Flood Control and Water Conservation District,
City of Murrieta, and City of Temecula. These partners should make it a priority to secure
funding for construction of this project.
The Master Drainage Plan provides another guide to the flood control improvements that are
needed in Murrieta. Where possible, natural drainage will be preserved in conjunction with
open space. The City will also seek opportunities to construct recreational trails along
waterways, balancing demands for recreation with considerations for safety and habitat.
Flood hazards within floodplain and dam inundation areas will continue to be addressed through
land use regulations and project review.
FIRE PROTECTION
Development in the eastern part of the City will create additional demand for a sixth fire station
to serve this area, where response times are longer than the target time. Providing fire
protection for high-rise office buildings will require investment in new equipment as well as
staffing for four-person engine companies. In both cases, new development will need to pay its
fair share of the costs associated with fire protection.
Between the time of dispatch and arriving on the scene of an emergency, the majority of Fire
Department response time is spent driving. Circulation improvements planned for Murrieta
should positively affect Fire Department response times.
Preventive measures will continue to be an important part of fire protection in Murrieta, including
conditions of development and weed clearance to deter the spread of wildland/urban interface
fires, Fire Department review of site plans, and community education, engineering, and
enforcement.
                                                12-21
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND WASTE
Fire Department oversight and inspection of sites handling hazardous materials is the City’s
primary tool for reducing risks related to these materials.
Given the City’s dependence on groundwater, remediation of leaking underground fuel tanks
should be taken seriously. Although regional and state authorities are responsible for
monitoring these sites, the City should facilitate their efforts when possible.
Household hazardous waste collection events raise community awareness that items such as
cleaning products, batteries, and paint should not be disposed of in the trash. The City and its
waste services contractor should promote these events to divert household hazardous waste
from landfills.
AIRCRAFT HAZARDS
To reduce risk from aircraft in the eastern part of Murrieta, the City will continue to ensure that
land use policies are consistent with the French Valley Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan.
POLICE PROTECTION
Demand for Police Department services will continue to grow with the population, while the
Department seeks to reach and maintain police officer and civilian support employee staffing
levels to effectively and efficiently address the public safety needs of the community. Expansion
of the Police Department facility is needed to accommodate additional staff. Target response
times for calls is another measure that the City will strive to meet.
Community Design
Police Department input into the design of the built environment can promote a safer
community, whether by incorporating Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design
strategies into housing developments, or designing streets to minimize traffic conflicts that can
cause accidents. Coordination between departments should provide opportunities for this kind
of input during project review or City project design.
Code Enforcement
Well-kept properties convey the sense of a watchful community that will notice criminal
behavior. Code enforcement is an important strategy for addressing health and safety issues at
the property level while maintaining order in the community overall. Residents value the
cleanliness of Murrieta and contribute their own time for cleanup efforts such as maintaining the
yards of foreclosed properties. This volunteerism should be encouraged and expanded.
In addition to individual property owner commitment to well-kept properties, the City has a
comprehensive code enforcement program that helps to protect property owner investment,
promote general health and welfare, and enhance the quality of neighborhoods. This program
                                               12-22

will continue to be an important part of the City’s commitment to neighborhood and business
safety, preservation, and improvement, and ensuring that Murrieta maintains and enhances its
overall community appearance.
Community Participation
Developing partnerships and trust in the community are essential for effective law enforcement.
When residents and businesses are engaged as partners, they can provide information about
criminal activity, supplement Police Department resources by volunteering, and promote a safe,
law-abiding environment.
Residents become leaders in creating a safer community by participating in programs such as
Home to School Safety Patrols, Neighborhood Watch, and Business Group Meetings with Law
Enforcement. Property owners are key to the success of the Crime Free Multi-Housing
Program, which relies on their vigilance to identify tenants engaging in criminal activity,
communicate with the Police Department about problem tenants, and enforce the lease
addendum. Reserve Officers and volunteers expand the capacity of the Police Department.
Incorporating community participation into Police Department programs requires investments of
staff time in outreach, supervision, and volunteer recognition.
Youth
Police Department outreach programs for youth offer education about safe behavior, police
presence at schools, mentoring, and rehabilitation. These programs supplement other activities
available for youth in Murrieta and are a form of proactive law enforcement, promoting safe
behavior and providing positive interaction with police. Mentoring and rehabilitation programs
are targeted toward youth who may otherwise stray into anti-social and illegal behavior. The
Southwest Valley Youth Court also provides an opportunity for youth volunteers to participate in
the legal system. Because Murrieta is a community that prioritizes youth and safety, it will
continue to support youth programs.
EMERGENCY RESPONSE
Emergency Services
The emergency dispatch system in Murrieta provides quick access to the range of services
provided by the Police and Fire Departments. Cross-training of fire suppression personnel in
life-saving medical procedures and ability of their engines to transport people to hospitals
provides an extra measure of safety for people who are critically injured or ill. Incorporating
Emergency Medical Dispatch into the dispatching system would provide emergency medical
assistance to 911 callers even before an engine company can arrive, through properly trained
dispatchers. The Fire Department is evaluating the feasibility of using this program.
Cross-training of Fire Department personnel in Urban Search and Rescue, swift water rescue,
and hazardous materials decontamination allows Murrieta to respond to incidents involving a
number of hazards discussed in this Element.
                                              12-23

Fire Department and Police Department responses to emergencies are discussed further in Fire
Protection and Police Protection.
Emergency Preparedness
The Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) is the master document that organizes emergency
preparedness and response efforts in Murrieta, and that provides a framework for coordination
with other actors at the regional and state levels. Each department involved in implementation
of the EOP has the responsibility to internalize the plan in its own operations, as well as keep
the plan up-to-date. Dedicated staff support for maintenance and implementation of the EOP
would make this effort more likely to succeed. Staff training at all levels would also promote
readiness to implement the plan.
Public awareness and education is a critical part of emergency preparedness addressed in the
EOP. An educated public will know how to prevent injury and property damage during and after
emergency events, and also know how to find and offer help to their neighbors. Community
members should be prepared to be self-sufficient for as long as a week in the event of a major
emergency.
The City will work to educate residents and businesses about appropriate actions to safeguard
life and property during and after emergencies. The CERT program offered by the Fire
Department provides a higher level of emergency preparedness training for more interested
residents, while basic emergency preparation information should be disseminated throughout
the population. Education aimed at children has the potential to shift the expectations of an
entire generation while also raising awareness among parents. The City will continue education
about emergency preparedness through such avenues as presentations to residents, instruction
in local schools, and the City's website.

                appropriate.
12.6        IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELEMENT
Ensuring safety in Murrieta begins with understanding the hazards that are present. Maintaining
current information and maps of hazards provides a basis for Citywide planning, while site-
specific analysis is often needed to evaluate geologic and seismic hazards.
Land use policy in the General Plan and Municipal Code will guide efforts to limit damage from
known hazards. Project review provides another opportunity to prevent harm to new
developments and their inhabitants. Inspections and code enforcement promote compliance
with City codes for building and fire safety, as well as hazardous materials handling.
Engineering can mitigate geologic and seismic hazards.
Multiple levels of government are involved in safety. The City must follow State and Federal
laws and abide by County plans. The City coordinates with agencies from the County to
Federal level in planning, enforcement, and emergency response.
The Emergency Operations Plan is intended to coordinate the City response to major
emergencies. Under the EOP, emergency response is managed by the Emergency Operations
Center, headed by the Fire Division Chief. However, multiple City departments have
implementation responsibility for the EOP.
Responses to smaller-scale emergencies are handled every day by the Fire Department and
Police Department, which have the combined capacity to handle emergencies caused by any of
the hazards described in the Safety Element — or at least to initiate a response, as in the case
of hazardous materials accidents.
Members of the public and business community are important partners in maintaining safety,
whether they are helping to prevent crime or preparing to respond appropriately in the event of
an emergency. The Police and Fire Departments offer many opportunities for community
members to become directly involved in public safety with programs such as the Youth
Accountability Board and CERT.

iv                                  2008-2014 Housing Element
1. Introduction
                                                                                                Section 1
   1.1 -   Housing Element Purpose
           The Housing Element as part of the Murrieta General Plan is developed to ensure that the City
           establishes policies, procedures and incentives in its land use planning and redevelopment
           activities that result in the maintenance and expansion of the housing supply to adequately
           accommodate households currently living and expected to live in Murrieta. The Housing
           Element institutes policies that will guide City decision-making, and establishes an action
           program to implement housing goals through the year 2014.
           The Housing Element has been designed to address key housing issues in the City. Foremost
           among these issues is ensuring a balance of housing types, at a variety of costs is available to meet
           the needs of all economic segments found within Murrieta. Consequently, the Housing Element
           makes provisions for affordable and accessible housing for special needs groups in the
           community, and is designed to provide guidance in the maintenance of existing affordable
           housing. These commitments are an expression of the statewide housing goal of “early
           attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every Californian”, as well as
           an expression of the City of Murrieta’s goal for the attainment of a suitable living environment
           for every household.
   1.2 - New State Legislation
           The Housing Element addresses new State legislation, which mandates that the following
           reforms be included in the Housing Element update to facilitate and expedite the construction of
           affordable housing. This new legislation targets four specific areas including: emergency shelters,
           extremely-low-income households, reasonable accommodation and a detailed land inventory and
           analysis.
           1.2.1 - Emergency Shelters
                    California Senate Bill 2, Chapter 633 requires jurisdictions to identify a zone or zones
                    where transitional housing and emergency shelters will be allowed as a permitted use
                    without a conditional use permit or other discretionary permit. The Housing Element
                    addresses this issue and recommends a new implementation action within the Housing
                    Plan that will ensure the City’s Zoning Ordinance is consistent with this statute.
           1.2.2 - Extremely Low-Income Households
                    State housing element law requires jurisdictions to quantify the existing and projected
                    housing need for residences of all income levels. A new provision within this legislation
                    requires localities to take into consideration the number of extremely low-income
                    households living in their jurisdiction. An extremely low-income household is defined as
                    those earning between 0-30 percent of the Area Median Income for the Riverside-San
                    Bernardino Metro area. The Background Technical Report includes extremely low-
                    income households in its analysis.
   City of Murrieta                                                                                           1

      1.2.3 - Reasonable Accommodation
               As part of the governmental constraints analysis, the City must analyze potential and
               actual constraints upon the development, maintenance and improvement of housing for
               persons with disabilities and demonstrate local efforts to remove governmental
               constraints to help meet the housing needs for persons with disabilities established in
               the Federal Fair Housing Act. The Housing Element includes a discussion on the
               establishment of reasonable accommodation procedures such as modifications to
               processes, materials, and procedures to enable an individual with a disability to fully
               participate in activities which will provide them equal housing opportunities.
      1.2.4 - Land Inventory and Analysis
               Assembly Bill 2348 (Chapter 724) amended housing element law to include more specific
               requirements for the content of the land inventory and analysis section. The land
               inventory must specifically include a parcel-specific listing of available sites including
               the parcel number, address or other “unique” reference. The Housing Element should also
               include a map showing the location of sites. The General Plan and Zoning designations,
               along with parcel size, shall be provided for each site. The analysis must identify which
               sites in the inventory are available and suitable to accommodate affordable housing and
               must also demonstrate that the inventory can provide for a variety of housing types. The
               Housing Resources Section of the Housing Element provides maps of vacant and
               underutilized lands that could potentially be used to accommodate affordable housing in
               Murrieta.
1.3 - Citizen Participation
      California Government Code requires that local governments make a diligent effort to achieve
      public participation from all economic segments of the community in the development of the
      housing element. In the preparation of the Housing Element Update, a number of organizations
      and agencies that provide housing, or housing related services, were contacted. Stakeholder
      groups that have been identified as influential to the development of housing and the provision of
      services in the community are:
               Riverside County Housing Authority
               Riverside County Economic Development Agency
               Affirmed Housing Group
               St. Martha’s Catholic Church
               Single Mom’s Life Skills Program
      The City held two workshop meetings with Planning Commission prior to the submittal of this
      Housing Element draft to HCD for informal review. The first meeting with the Commission took
      place in June 25, 2008 and was intended to provide Commissioners and the public with general
      information regarding the Housing Element (i.e. contents, process and information on the
      RHNA). A second workshop with the Planning Commission occurred in January 28, 2009 and
      was focused more on the specific sections included in the draft Housing Element update (i.e. the
      Housing Plan, Land Inventory and technical background reports.) For both meetings the
      Housing Element workshop was noticed in the local paper, at City Hall, and in other public
      places such as the Senior Center. Despite the City’s efforts to engage the public, no public
      comments were made at either Planning Commission meeting regarding the Housing Element.
      Prior to final submittal of the Housing Element to HCD a workshop was held with the Planning
2                                                                         2008-2014 Housing Element

                                                                                      1 –Introduction
        Commission on August 26, 2009, and the City Council on September 1, 2009. Similar to the
        meetings with the Planning Commission, no public comments were made during the regularly
        scheduled meeting regarding the Housing Element.
        On October 29, 2010, the State Department of Housing and Community Development issued
        confirmation that the Housing Element was found to be in compliance with State law. The City
        held another workshop with the Planning Commission on December 8, 2010 to review the final
        draft. Comments from the public focused on specific sites in the inventory, affordability, and
        density.
        The City plans to hold final hearings on the Housing Element with the Planning Commission in
        May 2011 and the City Council in June 2011. These meetings will be noticed and open for public
        comment on the final Housing Element draft.
1.4 - Consistency with State Planning Law
        The Housing Element is one of the seven General Plan elements mandated by the State of
        California. Sections 65580 to 65590 of the California Government Code contain the legislative
        mandate for the housing element. State law requires that the City's Housing Element consist of
        "an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals,
        policies, quantified objectives, financial resources, and scheduled programs for the preservation,
        improvement and development of housing" (Section 65583). In addition, the housing element
        shall identify adequate sites for housing, including rental housing, factory-built housing, and
        mobile homes, and shall make adequate provision for the existing and projected needs of all
        economic segments of the community.
1.5 - Detailed Components of the Housing Element
        There is no single approved format for a Housing Element. Instead, State law defines of the
        issues that must be addressed. A housing element should clearly identify and address, at a
        minimum, each component listed below:
        1. Review of the existing Housing Element.
        2. An assessment of existing and projected housing and employment trends to assess a locality’s
             housing needs for all income levels.
        3. An inventory of resources relevant to meeting housing needs.
        4. An inventory of constraints relevant to the meeting of these needs.
        5. A statement of the community's goals, quantified objectives, and policies relative to the
             maintenance, preservation, improvement and development of housing.
        6. A program that sets forth a five-year schedule of actions the local government is undertaking
             or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the goals and objectives of the
             housing element.
1.6 - General Plan Consistency
        The Housing Element is one of seven elements of the Murrieta General Plan. The goals, policies,
        actions and programs within this element relate directly to, and are consistent with, all other
        elements. The City’s Housing Element identifies programs and resources required for the
        preservation, improvement and development of housing to meet the existing and projected needs
        of its population. Through the regulation of the amount and variety of open space and recreation
        areas, acceptable noise levels in residential areas, and programs to provide for the safety of the
City of Murrieta                                                                                        3

      residents, policies contained in General Plan elements directly affect the quality of life for all
      Murrieta citizens.
      The Housing Element is affected by development policies contained in the Land Use Element,
      which establishes the location, type, intensity and distribution of land uses throughout the City,
      and defines the land use build-out potential. In designating residential development, the Land
      Use Element places an upper limit on the number and types of housing units constructed in the
      City. The acreage designated for a range of commercial and office uses creates employment
      opportunities for various income groups. The presence and potential for jobs affects the current
      and future demand for housing at the various income levels in the City.
      The Circulation Element of the General Plan also affects the implementation of the Housing
      Element. The Circulation Element establishes policies for a balanced circulation system in the
      City. Consequently the Housing Element must include policies that take into account the types
      of infrastructure essential for residential housing units in addition to mitigating the effects of
      growth in the City.
      The Housing Element utilizes the most current data available, and includes 2008 California
      Department of Finance data when possible, 2000 Census data and the 2005-2007 American
      Community Survey. All figures represented in the Housing Element are consistent with existing
      and projected population, employment and housing figures presented by county, State, national
      and non-profit agencies.
      The Housing Element has been reviewed for consistency with the City’s other General Plan
      elements, and the policies and programs in this Element are consistent with the policy direction
      contained in other parts of the General Plan. As portions of the General Plan are amended in the
      future, the Housing Element will be reviewed to ensure that internal consistency is maintained.
1.7 - Housing Element Organization
      This Housing Element updates the Housing Element drafted by the City in 2001. The Housing
      Element is designed to meet several key objectives. These include provisions to: ensure internal
      consistency with the recently adopted General Plan; meet recently enacted statutory
      requirements; introduce updated housing, population and needs analysis; and incorporate the
      suggested staff responses to HCD comments.

   The Housing Plan presented in this section includes goals, policies, and programs focused specifically on
   housing in the City of Murrieta. The general goal of the Housing Element is to ensure that all residents
   have decent, safe, sanitary and affordable housing regardless of income. In order to achieve this general
   goal, five specific goals have been established to guide the development, redevelopment and preservation
   of a balanced inventory of housing to meet the needs of present and future residents of the City.
   Murrieta’s housing goals address the following five major areas:
                1.   Increased opportunities for affordable housing;
                2. Conservation of the City’s existing housing stock;
                3. Removal of constraints to the construction of affordable housing;
                4. Equal housing opportunity; and
                5. Identification of adequate sites to achieve a variety and diversity of housing.
   For each of the five goals identified, specific policies and programs are also summarized within the
   Housing Plan. Individual policies and actions included in this element are intended to provide a wide
   variety of programs and tools to implement the City’s General Plan goals. The housing plan includes
   programs currently in existence as well as new actions which have been added to address the City’s
   unmet housing need. Actual programs will be implemented at the discretion of the City in order to meet
   established objectives. It should be noted that the listing of a potential funding source of a particular
   program and/or action does not signify that money has been allocated or appropriated as a source of
   funding for such a program and/or action.
    City of Murrieta                                                                                      5

Goal 1:          Provide adequate housing opportunities throughout the
                 City of Murrieta.
Murrieta strives to achieve a balanced community, with housing units available for all income segments
of the population. The existing housing stock is in good condition, with majority of the units constructed
during or after the 1980’s, providing a variety of affordable housing options. The intent of this goal is to
assist in the provision of adequate housing that continues to meet the needs of the community, including
both renter and owner households.
     Policy 1.1:   Provide a range of residential development types in Murrieta, including low density
                   single-family homes, moderate density townhomes, higher density multifamily units,
                   and residential/commercial mixed use in order to address the City’s share of regional
                   housing needs.
     Policy 1.2:   Continue to use redevelopment set-aside funds, when possible, to purchase properties
                   and land in order to construct affordable housing or to purchase covenants to create
                   new affordable units.
     Policy 1.3:   Facilitate development of senior and low-income housing through use of financial
                   and/or regulatory incentives.
     Policy 1.4:   Provide homeownership assistance to low- and moderate-income households.
     Policy 1.5:   Design new higher-density residential projects at a scale, (number of units, height, etc.)
                   that are compatible in design with adjacent residential areas.
     Policy 1.6:   Encourage lot consolidation in the Historic Murrieta Specific Plan area in order to more
                   cohesively redevelop larger areas of the City.
Actions and Programs
Action 1.1 – General Plan Review
The City of Murrieta recognizes that the General Plan and City’s Zoning Ordinance are crucial tools that
guide development in the City. These tools can also create barriers if they are not reviewed and updated
to reflect the needs of the community. To address and prevent development barriers the City will
periodically review the Land Use Element of the General Plan, as well as the Zoning and Subdivision
Ordinances, to ensure that housing opportunities for all income groups are provided. The City is
currently in the process of updating the General Plan and should complete the process during the
planning period. Within the General Plan update process any barriers to affordable housing will be
identified and where appropriate, removed. The City typically reviews their Zoning Code on a biannual
basis, periodically correcting inconsistencies that may exist; however, the City will also review the
Zoning Code as part of the General Plan update in order to ensure that the Zoning Code and General
Plan are consistent.

             o   Objective: Complete a General Plan update and continue to review the Zoning Code for inconsistencies
                 and standards that may prevent the development of affordable housing.
Action 1.2 – Land Use Database
Throughout the City of Murrieta there are a number of vacant parcels ranging in size that provide
opportunities for the development of affordable and market rate housing. In order to monitor and more
carefully plan residential development in the City, Murrieta will maintain, on an ongoing basis, the
comprehensive land use database identifying parcels and/or structures suitable for residential
development and/or redevelopment. This will allow the City to direct affordable housing developers to
areas in the City with the appropriate zoning and acreage to develop an affordable housing project.

             o   Objective: Provide information on development opportunities to interested developers online, at City Hall
                 and in other public places.
Action 1.3– First-Time Home Buyer Assistance Program
In addition to the First-Time Home Buyer Program offered by the County of Riverside the City of
Murrieta will establish and promote a City operated first-time homebuyer program. The City’s program
will provide up to 20 percent down payment assistance to qualified home buyers. The City may establish
this program to coincide with Action 1.4, Land and Property Acquisition Program, so that as the City
purchases properties and assists in the development of affordable housing, residents can seek assistance
in purchasing the affordable units that are developed. The City anticipates allocating $400,000 in
redevelopment set-aside funds to the program throughout the planning period.
             o   Responsible Agency: Murrieta Redevelopment Agency
             o   Timeframe: 2010-2011 to establish the program
             o   Potential Funding Source: Redevelopment set-aside funds
             o   Objective: This action is intended to assist 10 units during the planning period. The City will also establish
                 the program and provide information at City Hall, on the City’s website and in other public places to
                 increase awareness.
Action 1.4– Land and Property Acquisition Program
Consistent with State law, the Redevelopment Agency must allocate not less than twenty percent of its
gross tax increment to the housing fund for the purpose of increasing, improving and preserving the
supply of housing to very low, low and moderate-income households. The City of Murrieta recognizes
that one of the most significant barriers to affordable housing is the acquisition of the property on which
City of Murrieta                                                                                                             7

to construct affordable housing. The City has budgeted approximately $4.8 million in redevelopment set-
aside funds to purchase properties in and around the Historic Murrieta Specific Plan area in order to
construct 302 low-income units. The City recently purchased a 2 acre site at the corner of Jefferson
Avenue and Juniper Avenue known as “Monte Vista II” for approximately $1.3 million. This site is
expected to yield 60 units, with a minimum density of 30 units per acre. The City also recently closed on
a 6.2 acre property on Adams Avenue using $3.5 million in redevelopment set-aside funds, and on a 2.09
acre site on the south side of Jefferson Avenue known as “Jefferson South”. With a minimum density of 30
units per acre, the Adams Avenue property is expected to yield 62 units and the Jefferson South property
is expected to yield 180 units. To facilitate the development of the Monte Vista II property, Murrieta
planning and housing staff are currently negotiating a Disposition and Development Agreement (DDA)
with Affirmed Housing Group for the project at Jefferson and Juniper. Development on the Adams
Avenue property and the Jefferson South property will be facilitated at a later date.
In addition to purchasing land the City of Murrieta Redevelopment Agency intends to provide gap
financing and/or land write downs for the construction of multifamily developments that are constructed
with established affordability covenants. Applications will be reviewed on a case by case basis to
determine whether a developer qualifies for assistance from the Redevelopment Agency. The City will
also provide information on affordable housing financing at City Hall. The City shall also encourage the
Redevelopment Agency to work with affordable housing developers to utilize a portion of set-aside funds
for development of housing affordable to extremely low-income households.

                  in order to construct 302 affordable units.
Action 1.5 - Lot Consolidation Program
Parcels located in downtown Murrieta as well as the Historic Murrieta Specific Plan area tend to be
smaller and in some cases, narrow and/or shallow in size, adding an additional constraint to the
development of housing. In order to encourage the development of residential and mixed-use projects,
the City will establish a lot consolidation program which offers incentives such as a reduction in
development standards (i.e. lot size, parking, and open space requirements). The City, with assistance
from Riverside County, may also offer to subsidize a portion of development fees to encourage lot
consolidation and to promote more intense residential and mixed use development on vacant and
underutilized sites within the downtown Murrieta region.

Action 1.6 – Large Sites Program
Most assisted housing developments utilizing State or federal financial resources include 50 to 150 units
on parcels ranging from 3-7 acres in size. To facilitate the subdivision of larger parcels (>15 acres) located
in the TOD Overlay Program area, the City will provide incentives and technical assistance to facilitate
and encourage development of a variety of housing types and affordability consistent with typical
developments affordable to lower income households. The City will offer on a case-by-case basis the
following incentives for the development of affordable housing including but not limited to: priority
processing for subdivision maps that include affordable housing units, expedited review for the
subdivision of larger sites into buildable lots where the development application can be found consistent
with the General Plan, applicable Specific Plan and master environmental impact report, financial
assistance (based on availability of federal, State, local foundations, and private housing funds, and
modification of development requirements, such as reduced parking standards for seniors, assisted care
and special needs housing. To determine the effectiveness of this program monitor the number of large
sites available to be developed for a variety of income groups the City will monitor this program and
assess its effectiveness on a bi-annual basis.

Action 1.7 – Housing for Extremely Low Income Families
The City shall apply for State and federal funds for direct support of low-income housing construction
and rehabilitation. The Redevelopment Agency shall continue to monitor and access potential funding
sources, when available, such as, but not limited to, the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG),
and HOME. The City shall also seek State and federal funding specifically targeted for the development
of housing affordable to extremely low-income households, such as the Local Housing Trust Fund
program, Proposition 1-C funds, Emergency Housing and Assistance Program (EHAP), Federal
Emergency Shelter Grant Program (FESG), Housing Assistance Program (HAP) and the Multifamily
Housing Program (MHP & MHP-SH). The City shall promote the benefits of this program to the
development community by posting information on its web page and creating a handout to be
distributed with land development applications.

Goal 2:          Conserve and enhance the quality of existing housing and
                 residential neighborhoods in Murrieta.
Continued maintenance and preservation of the existing housing stock in Murrieta is crucial to ensure
quality neighborhoods. Housing programs focused on the achievement of this goal include rehabilitation
of single- and multifamily housing units, code enforcement, and efforts to preserve assisted housing units
at risk of converting to market-rate housing. Through code enforcement, neighborhood, and home
improvement programs, the City is able to maintain the condition of existing housing units.
     Policy 2.1:   Using Redevelopment Agency funds continue and/or create programs to maintain or
                   improve the character and quality of existing housing and neighborhood environments.
     Policy 2.2:   Assist in the preservation of all units “at-risk” of converting from affordable housing to
                   market rate.
     Policy 2.3:   Encourage energy efficient design in existing and new residential units and promote
                   sustainability upgrades in existing and proposed residential complexes.
     Policy 2.4:   Encourage property owners to maintain and make improvements to their properties by
                   taking advantage of programs offered by the City and County.
Actions and Programs
Action 2.1 –Property Maintenance Enforcement
Enforce and expand where necessary, the property maintenance provisions embodied in the Uniform
Building Code and the Zoning Ordinance in order to conserve and improve the quality of the housing
units in the City. The City’s housing stock is generally in good condition as majority of the units were
constructed during or after the 1980’s. Consequently, potential code violations are identified by
complaints reported to the City and are addressed by the City’s police department and when appropriate
Community Development staff. These efforts are intended to result in the continued maintenance of
housing units throughout the City. If a property requires significant repairs or maintenance, code
enforcement officials will inform property owners of any rehabilitation loans or grants provided through
Riverside County that are be available to address such issues.

Action 2.2 – Monitor Affordable Units
The City of Murrieta currently has three affordable housing complexes, one rental and two ownership
developments, with 118 deed restricted units that do not expire until 2050 and 2051. In order to
determine how effective the City’s housing programs have led to the development and maintenance of
affordable housing, the City will monitor these affordable units to ensure that the rent payments charged
are consistent with levels appropriate for the identified income category. The City has posted their
Redevelopment Agency AB 987 Affordable Housing Database on its website and will continue to track
affordable housing units citywide through the annual certification process. In addition, as the City
develops additional affordable units these properties will be added to the table and will be monitored
annually to ensure they meet affordability requirements.

Action 2.3– Purchase Housing Covenants
Existing housing units throughout the residential areas of the City are generally in good condition as
most were constructed during or after the 1980’s. The Redevelopment Agency plans to acquire 55 year
affordability covenants on existing multifamily rental units, focusing on residences that may be in need of
minor rehabilitation. The City of Murrieta Redevelopment Agency will dedicate approximately $20-
30,000 in redevelopment set-aside funds per unit, totaling $200,000-$300,000 during the planning period
to purchase affordability covenants on 10 units in market rate multifamily developments. The Agency
will target multifamily complexes with 4-16 units, located around or in the redevelopment area, but if
necessary will also purchase covenants in developments outside of the redevelopment area.

Action 2.4 –Neighborhood Stabilization Program
The City of Murrieta does not currently have direct access to Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds;
however they are able to support local organizations receiving funds through the County of Riverside.
The City provides letters of support for participating organizations such as: Habitat for Humanity and
the Housing Authority of Riverside to ensure that these organizations have funding to assist the City
with foreclosure property rehabilitation and the resale of units to moderate and low-income homebuyers.

Action 2.5– Energy Efficient Design
The City will review ordinances and recommend changes where necessary to encourage energy efficient
housing design and practices that are consistent with state regulations. The City will periodically
distribute literature or post information on their website regarding energy conservation, including solar
power, energy efficient insulation, and subsidies available from utility companies, and encourage
homeowners and landlords to incorporate these features into construction and remodeling projects.
When possible the City will encourage energy conservation devices including, but not limited to
lighting, water heater treatments, and solar energy systems for all residential projects. The Planning and
Housing divisions will encourage maximum utilization of Federal, State, and local government programs,
such as the County of Riverside Home Weatherization Program, that assist homeowners in providing
energy conservation measures. Additionally as part of the economic stimulus package offered by the
federal government, the City of Murrieta is eligible for $881,500 in Energy Efficiency Community
Development Block Grants (EECDBG). The City intends to apply for this funding in order to focus on
sustainability, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emission analysis in the General Plan update.

awareness and application for County run housing assistance programs. These programs include:
             Home Repair Program,
             Senior Home Repair Program,
             Home Weatherization Program,
             First-time Home Buyer Down Payment Assistance Program, and
             Mortgage Credit Certificate Program.
The County offers a variety of housing assistance programs that can supplement the City’s current
housing programs. As the City has little control over how the County’s programs are administered the
City will be responsible for providing program information on the City’s website and at City Hall.

Goal 3:         Minimize the impact of governmental constraints on
                housing production and affordability.
    Policy 3.1:   Provide developer incentives, such as a density bonus or flexibility in development
                  standards, to facilitate the development of quality housing that is affordable to lower
                  and moderate-income households.
    Policy 3.2:   Periodically review and revise the City’s development standards, if necessary, to
                  facilitate quality housing that is affordable to all income levels.
    Policy 3.3:   When feasible, consider reducing, subsidizing, or deferring development fees and
                  offering faster permitting time periods to facilitate the provision of affordable housing.
    Policy 3.4:   Support innovative public, private and non-profit partnership efforts for the
                  development of affordable housing.
    Policy 3.5:   Encourage the development of rental units with three or more bedrooms to provide
                  affordable housing for large families.
Actions and Programs
Action 3.1 – Density Bonus Ordinance
The City of Murrieta will revise the density bonus ordinance to be consistent with State law, which
includes decreasing the number of affordable units a developer must provide to receive a density bonus
and allowing up to three regulatory concessions. This action is intended to facilitate the development of
housing for low and very low-income households that is restricted for a period of no less than 45-55
years. The City will promote the use of the density bonus ordinance in Redevelopment Project Areas, in
conjunction with mixed-use projects, senior housing, and within Specific Plans. Information on the
ordinance will be provided at City Hall and online at the City’s website to promote the application of
ordinance for the development of affordable units.
            o   Responsible Agency: Murrieta Planning and Redevelopment and Housing Divisions
            o   Timeframe: Ongoing 2008-2014 as projects are received
            o   Potential Funding Source: Redevelopment set-aside fund
            o   Objective: Provide information about such incentives at City Hall, on the City’s website and in other
                public places to increase awareness. Encourage the construction of 10 units over the planning period.

Action 3.2 – Permit Processing Time
Continue to implement permit streamlining, which includes monitoring the development plan review
process to reduce any identified impediments to affordable housing. Additionally, the processing time of
applications for new construction or rehabilitation of housing for lower and moderate-income
households and seniors will be prioritized.
             o   Responsible Agency: Murrieta Planning Division
             o   Timeframe: Ongoing 2008-2014
             o   Potential Funding Source: General Fund
             o   Objective: Provide information about permit streamlining at City Hall, on the City’s website and in other
                 public places to increase awareness.
Action 3.3 – Fee Subsidies for Extremely Low-Income Households
On an affordable housing transaction basis, the City shall adopt a resolution subsidizing up to 100
percent of the application processing fees for developments in which five percent of units are affordable
to extremely low-income households. To be eligible for this fee subsidy, the units shall be affordable by
affordability covenant (no less than 45 years for owner-occupied units and not less than 55 years for
rental units). The subsidy or reduction of fees may also be considered when an alternative funding source
is identified to pay these fees. The City may use either redevelopment set-aside funds or the Housing
Trust Fund to subsidize fees for housing affordable to extremely low-income households. The City shall
promote the benefits of this program to the development community by posting information on its web
page and creating a handout to be distributed with land development applications.
             o   Responsible Agency: Murrieta Planning and Redevelopment and Housing Divisions
             o   Timeframe: Promotional materials will be prepared and utilized within six months after adoption of the
                 Housing Element
             o   Funding: General Fund, Redevelopment set-asides, Housing Trust Fund
Action 3.4 – Incentives for Large Multifamily Units
It is crucial that affordable units constructed in the City are available for families as well as the other
special needs groups; however, larger units are often more costly to develop. The City will provide
incentives to developers to encourage the inclusion of units with three or more bedrooms to
accommodate low-income large family households. Incentives may include utilizing the density bonus,
fast track processing, fee reductions, waiving of specific development standards, etc. The City has
previously developed affordable units with three bedrooms in Monte Vista and anticipates that the
second phase of Monte Vista located on City-purchased at Jefferson and Juniper Avenues will also have
units with three or more bedrooms. Individual projects will be evaluated to determine if they qualify for
any incentives on a case by case basis.

             o   Objective: Aim to construct 16 multifamily rental units with three or more bedrooms in the planning
                 period.
Action 3.5 – Residential Development Standards
In conjunction with Action 1.1, City staff will specifically review the development standards for the
residential zones to identify standards that may constrain the development of affordable housing and
housing for special groups such as disabled individuals. Within the Housing Element there are several
standards, such as lot coverage, parking requirements and minimum parcel size, which may in some
instances be interpreted to be a constraint. While the City is flexible and is committed to working with
developers to build affordable units, resulting in modifications to these standards, the City will further
review these standards and alter them as necessary to ensure no constraints to affordable housing exist.
In conjunction with the current General Plan update, Staff will also review requirements such as the
minimum unit size, property line setbacks, parking requirements, height restrictions, etc. to ensure that
they are necessary and pertinent. The City is committed to address any constraints identified in Chapter
6, Housing Constraints, during the General Plan update process. In the interim, staff will, on a case by
case basis, identify ways that standards can be relaxed if it is determined that such requirements are in
any way impeding the development of affordable housing or housing for disabled residents. The City will
also continue to provide development standard modifications, fast track processing for applications
related to the creation of affordable housing and will offer fee modifications for projects including
affordable units that are required to apply for variations to the existing development standards.
             o   Responsible Agency: Murrieta Planning Division
             o   Timeframe: Within 1-2 years of Housing Element adoption and address all constraints identified in
                 Chapter 6 of the Housing Element.
             o   Potential Funding Source: General Fund and Redevelopment set-aside funds
             o   Objectives: Review development standards to identify constraints and remove or offset constraints where
                 possible.
Action 3.6 – Second Unit Ordinance
The City recognizes that second units are a unique opportunity to provide affordable units in residential
areas particularly for elderly residents. Consequently, Staff will review the second unit ordinance to
ensure that it complies with State law and plans to amend the second unit ordinance to ensure that no
constraints exist to the development of second units in the City. In addition to any revisions that occur,
the City will continue to administer their existing second unit ordinance and will promote the ordinance
online and at City Hall.

             o    Objective: Construct 5 units over the planning period
Action 3.7 – Water and Sewer Service Providers
In accordance with Government Code Section 65589.7 as revised in 2005, immediately following City
Council adoption, the City must deliver a copy of the 2008 Housing Element to all public agencies or
private entities that provide water or sewer services to properties within the City of Murrieta.
             o    Responsible Agency: Murrieta Planning and Redevelopment and Housing Divisions
             o    Timing of Implementation: By August/September 2011
             o    Funding Source: Redevelopment set-aside fund
             o    Objective: Ensure that water and sewer providers are aware of the City’s intentions for residential
                  development throughout the City.
Action 3.8 - Flood Management
In accordance with Government Code Section 65302, as part of the current General Plan update process
the City shall review and revise where appropriate the Conservation and Safety Elements to consider
flood risks when making land use decisions. Specifically, the City shall upon the next revision of the
housing element on or after January 1, 2009, the Conservation Element shall identify rivers, creeks,
streams, flood corridors, riparian habitats, and land that may accommodate floodwater for purposes of
groundwater recharge and storm water management.
Upon the next revision of the housing element on or after January 1, 2009, the Safety Element shall
identify information regarding flood hazards, including, but not limited to flood hazard zones, National
Flood Insurance Program maps published by FEMA, information about flood hazards, designated
floodway maps, dam failure inundation maps, areas subject to inundation in the event of the failure of
levees or floodwalls, etc. as listed in Section 65302(g)(2) and establish a set of comprehensive goals,
policies, and objectives for the protection of the community from the unreasonable risks of flooding.
             o    Responsible Agency: Murrieta Planning Division
             o    Timing of Implementation: Consistent with the current General Plan update (2011)

Goal 4:              Promote equal housing opportunity for all residents.
To fully meet the community’s housing needs, the City must assure that housing is accessible to all
residents, regardless of race, religion, family status, age, or physical disability. The City, through a
partnership with Riverside County Economic Development Agency, refers residents with fair housing
concerns to the Fair Housing Council.
     Policy 4.1:  Continue to enforce fair housing laws prohibiting discrimination in the building,
                  financing, selling, or renting of housing on the basis of race, ethnicity, ancestry, national
                  origin, religion, sex, disability, age, marital status, familial status, source of income,
                  sexual orientation, or any other arbitrary factor.
     Policy 4.2:  Cooperate with the Riverside County Fair Housing Council in the enforcement of fair
                  housing laws and in the review of violations of applicable Federal and State fair housing
                  laws
     Policy 4.3:  Address households at-risk of foreclosure to prevent abandonment and limit the impact
                  on neighborhoods.
     Policy 4.4:  Assess the social service needs of the community and provide a wide variety of social
                  service programs to City residents.
Actions and Programs
Action 4.1 – Reasonable Accommodation
The purpose of this program is to ensure that sufficient provisions are provided by the City to facilitate a
resident’s request for “reasonable accommodation.” This means that Murrieta will ensure that the
established development requirements do not place an undue burden on disabled persons living or
moving into the City. For example, a household with a handicapped family member may require
modifications to the housing unit to accommodate that family member. These include the installation of
wheel chair ramps (both interior and exterior), wider doorways, and installation of wheelchair elevators
in units containing multiple-levels, and the installation of handrails and modified plumbing fixtures in
bathrooms.
The City has currently adopted the Universal Design Standards and will develop further procedures for
reasonable accommodation in accordance with fair housing and disability laws. To accomplish this, the
City will amend the Municipal Code to provide for clear rules, policies, procedures, and fees for
reasonable accommodation in order to promote equal access to housing. Policies and procedures will
clearly indicate the qualifying individuals who may request a reasonable accommodation (i.e., persons
with disabilities, family-members, landlords, etc.) along with any specific procedures that must be
followed. The City staff will also focus on eliminating or modifying those land use, zoning, regulations,
and fees that may constrain the housing needs of persons of disabilities. The City will provide
information on the City website and at public counters to inform residents of the procedures for
requesting reasonable accommodation.

                 in other public places to increase awareness.
Action 4.2 – Fair Housing
The City will continue to receive fair housing services through the County of Riverside’s program for
participating cities. The City will ensure that information about the Fair Housing Council of Riverside
County, Inc., and its programs is available to all City residents. As part of this program the City will also
revise the definition of family in the Zoning Code to ensure compliance with federal and State housing
laws. The definition shall not distinguish between related and unrelated persons and not impose
numerical limitations on the number of persons that constitutes a family.
            o     Responsible Agency: Murrieta Planning Division
            o    Timeframe: Ongoing 2008-2014 for services. The City will revise the definition of family within one year

            o    Potential Funding Source: Riverside County CDBG
            o    Objective: Cooperate as needed with the Fair Housing Council of Riverside County, Inc., to mediate
                 housing issues involving Murrieta residents. Provide information about tenant and landlord housing
                 rights at City Hall, on the City’s website and in other public places to increase awareness.
Action 4.3– Homeless Assistance Program
According to the Riverside County Homeless Count and Survey there are approximately 5 homeless
individuals that have been indentified in the City of Murrieta. Regardless, the City will continue to assist
local nonprofit organizations that have expertise in assisting homeless persons and families in applying
for funding from the Riverside County CDBG program. Currently, organizations apply to the City and
the City is responsible for reviewing applications and recommending specific organizations receive
funding. Organizations that have received funding in the past include: St. Martha’s Catholic Church and
the Single Mom’s Life Skills Program. The City will continue to assist local organizations in applying for
CDBG funding through the County, allowing them to provide irreplaceable services to extremely low-
income families in the community.

Action 4.4 – Foreclosure Prevention Program
Like most southern California communities, Murrieta is experiencing an increase in foreclosures in the
community. To mediate the situation, the City currently contracts with the Fair Housing Council of
Riverside County to provide foreclosure prevention counseling and mediation services to homeowners
who are experiencing financial hardship and mortgage delinquencies. The City allocated $24,000 in
funding in fiscal year 2008/2009 to increase foreclosure counseling services. The City recently enacted
two ordinances requiring homeowners to register abandoned properties and allowing the City to assess
higher penalties for property maintenance violations. In addition to the City’s efforts, a foreclosure
hotline has also been established by the Homeownership Preservation Foundation to assist homeowners
in the early stages of the process and a citizen group has been established to maintain the exterior
appearance of abandoned residences in the community. Information on foreclosure assistance is available
at City Hall. The City’s partnership with the County has also led to discussions of how CDBG funds may
be used to create additional services to prevent additional foreclosures.

Goal 5:           Identify adequate sites to achieve housing variety.
Meeting the housing needs of all residents of the community requires the identification of adequate sites
for all types of housing. By capitalizing on the allowances in the Development Code and continuing to
maintain an inventory of potential sites, the City will assure that adequate residentially-zoned and
mixed-use sites are available.
      Policy 5.1:  Identify vacant and/or underutilized parcels, throughout the City, that can
                   accommodate a variety of housing types for all socioeconomic segments of the
                   community.
     Policy 5.2:   Support the construction of new affordable housing by rezoning vacant and
                   underdeveloped parcels to allow for higher density development.
     Policy 5.3:   Allow for and encourage the provision of emergency shelters and temporary housing.
     Policy 5.4:   Maintain zoning regulations that permit by right, in designated zones, housing that
                   meets temporary and short-term housing needs for individuals and families.
     Policy 5.5:   Require that housing constructed expressly for low- and moderate-income households
                   not be concentrated in any single portion of the City.
Actions and Programs
Action 5.1 – Ensure Adequate Sites to Accommodate Allocated Regional Housing Growth
Based on units developed and approved, the City has met a portion of its RHNA, with a remaining
RHNA of 3,002 housing units, including 1,568 units for very low-income households, 1,063 units for low-
income households, and 371 units for above moderate-income households. To accommodate the
remaining RHNA allocation, the City of Murrieta has both vacant residentially zoned land and three
sites consisting of four (4) parcels of approximately 10 acres that require rezoning as identified in Section
7.4 of the Housing Resources section available. However, legislation passed since adoption of the last
Housing Element codified in Section 65583.2 of the California Government Code, requires that cities the
size of Murrieta must permit residential development at a density of 30 dwelling units per acre to
accommodate low and very-low units.
To accommodate the default density of 30 dwelling units per acre, the City has identified three sites (four
parcels totaling 10 acres) in the land inventory exclusively for residential uses. The City will through
consequent zone changes, create a new high density multifamily land use designation and zone, known
as Multi-Family 3, with a minimum development density of 30 units per acre. Upon the creation of this
zone, all of the parcels identified in the sites inventory will be rezoned to Multi-Family 3, allowing for a
minimum density of 30 units per acre. The City will complete the following zone changes within the
General Plan update schedule with the goal of rezoning the identified properties by December 31, 2011.
The sites will be selected from the parcel listings in Table A-6 of Appendix A, and will have the capacity
for at least 16 units, and will be available for development in the planning period where water and sewer
can be provided. The City will follow the requirements of subdivision (h) of Section 65583.2 of the
Government Code and will ensure that owner-occupied and rental multifamily residential development
is allowed by right in accordance with subdivision (f) of Section 65589.5 of the Government Code.
City of Murrieta                                                                                          21

The City will establish and implement a new “Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Overlay Program” to
provide for and allow a mixture of residential and non-residential development, in close proximity to
transit. The area identified is adjacent to Interstate 15 and 215, two major transportation routes. The
TOD Overlay Program will permit by right 30 dwelling units per acre and will accommodate
approximately 2,340 units as it will initially apply to 78 acres as shown Exhibit 7-4 which identifies the
boundary of the TOD Overlay Program area.
To facilitate development of affordable housing and to accommodate the remaining RHNA of 2,631 very
low and low-income households, as mentioned above, the City has identified approximately 10 acres to
be rezoned to Multi-Family 3, and will designate approximately 78 acres of underutilized and vacant land
within TOD Overlay Program area, at a minimum density of 30 units per acre, for a combined total of 88
acres. At least 50 percent of the remaining very low and low-income need (1,315 units) will be
accommodated on sites designated for exclusively residential uses. These sites will be selected from the
parcel listings in Table A-6 and Table A-7 of Appendix A.
The City will report on the progress of this rezone and the TOD Program in its annual progress reports
required pursuant to Government Code Section 65400 and due on April 1st of each year.
             o    Responsible Agency: Murrieta Redevelopment & Housing Division, and the Murrieta Planning Division
             o    Timeframe: Rezoning will be complete by December 31, 2011.
             o    Funding Source: General Fund
             o    Objectives: Continue to provide appropriate land use designations and maintain an inventory of suitable
                  sites for residential development. Make the vacant and underutilized residential sites inventory available
                  on the City’s website to non-profit and for-profit housing developers.
Action 5.2 – Provide Emergency and Transitional Housing
Extremely low-income households and households with special needs have limited housing options in
Murrieta. Housing types appropriate for these groups include: emergency shelters, transitional housing,
supportive housing, and single-room occupancy (SRO) units. To accommodate this population group the
City will amend the Zoning Code so that the Community Commercial zone permits SRO units by right
without a Conditional Use Permit or other discretionary action. The City will also revise the Zoning
Code to permit emergency shelters by right without a Conditional Use Permit or other discretionary
action in the Mixed-Use-2 (MU-2) and/or Business Park (BP) zones and will ensure that a proposed
shelter is subject to only the same development standards required for other uses permitted in the zone.
These zones are appropriate to accommodate emergency shelters as they are typically located along
major arterial roadways with access to employment centers and near stores and other services. There are
currently 281 acres of vacant land zoned for MU-2 and 376 acres of vacant land zoned BP, including sites
between 2 and 5 acres, in size that are appropriate and able to accommodate a shelter of approximately
20 beds if one is proposed. It is estimated that there are approximately 17 sites zoned Business Park and
29 sites zoned MU-2 between 2 and 5 acres in size, which is more than sufficient to accommodate at
least one emergency shelter. To better accommodate emergency shelters in the City, specific siting
standards and conditions for approval will be developed in accordance with State Law.
The City will also amend the Zoning Code to permit transitional and supportive housing as a residential
use, subject only to those regulations that apply to other residential dwelling units of the same type in

providers and will continue to do so throughout the planning period.

3. Quantified Objectives
                                                                                                Section 3
   California Housing Element Law requires jurisdictions to estimate the number of affordable housing
   opportunities that will be created over the planning period. The quantified objectives for the 2008-2014
   Housing Element presents the anticipated and potential affordable housing development for the planning
   period starting on July 1, 2008 and ending June 30, 2014.
   It is important to note that while the goal of the quantified objective section is to show how the City will
   meet its remaining RHNA allocation, and based on the premise that the City intends to make every effort
   to achieve these goals, Murrieta cannot guarantee that these needs will be met given limited financial and
   staff resources, and the increasing gap in affordability of housing resources and incomes. Satisfaction of
   the City’s regional housing needs will partially depend on the cooperation of private funding sources and
   resources of the State, Federal and County programs that are used to support the needs of the extremely
   low-, very low--, low-, and moderate-income households. Additionally, outside economic forces heavily
   influence the housing market. State law recognizes that a locality may not be able to accommodate its
   regional fair share housing need.
   Table 3-1 presents the City’s quantified objectives in three categories: construction of new affordable
   units, program assistance and the conservation of affordable housing. New affordable units are broken
   down into two sub categories: city assisted developments and units accommodated in the Transit
   Oriented Development (TOD) Overlay Program area. The first subcategory references four parcels (Sites
   One, Two, and Three in the land inventory - Section 7.4.2), that were purchased by the Murrieta
   Redevelopment Agency for the purpose of developing 302 affordable housing units. The second
   subcategory shows the City’s efforts to accommodate its remaining RHNA units (2,340 units) on parcels
   within the TOD Overlay Program area as described in Section 7.4.2.D. It is important to note that this
   subcategory assumes optimum conditions for the production of housing and does not take into account
   how environmental, physical and market conditions influences the timing, type and cost of housing
   production in a community. The parcels with densities appropriate to accommodate multifamily
   housing and affordable units are shown in Tables A-4, A-5, A-6, and A-7.
   In addition to new construction, the City anticipates that approximately 25 units will be assisted
   through programs, such as the First-Time Homebuyers Program and the City’s Density Bonus ordinance
   as outlined in Section 2, Housing Plan. Also as indicated in the third category, the City has allocated funds
   to purchase covenants on 10 units to preserve their affordability. In total, the City anticipates that 302
   affordable units will be accommodated on City owned land, 25 units will be assisted by City
   administered programs, 10 units will be preserved through purchasing covenants, 371 moderate units will
   be accommodated on vacant residentially zoned sites and vacant non-residentially zoned sites that allow
   residential uses (such as mixed-use), and 2,340 units (excluding the City owned sites) will be
   accommodated on vacant and underutilized land within the TOD Overlay Program area which will allow
   for higher density development.
   Below is an estimate quantified objectives for the number of housing units, broken down by income
   category, over the 2008-2014 timeframe.

Notes:
(a) This objective represents construction that has been proposed by the City of Murrieta on City owned land (Sites One, Two, and Three in Section 7.4.2, Housing
Resources) that will realistically be developed during the planning period. These sites are shown in Table A-6.
(b) This objective represents the City’s construction capacity based on the vacant sites identified in Tables A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, and A-5 and on the vacant and
underutilized sites within the TOD Overlay Program area (Table A-7). Construction on these parcels assumes optimum conditions for the production of housing
and does not consider constraints that are outside of the City’s control (i.e. financial and market constraints).
(c) In accordance with State law, the City has determined that approximately fifty percent of its very low-income units (664 units) are designated to accommodate
the need of extremely low-income households.

4. Community Profile
                                                                                                 Section 4
   Introduction
   The housing needs of the City are determined by the demographic characteristics of the population (age,
   household size, employment, income levels), the characteristics of its housing (number of units, age of
   units, tenure, size, cost), and the nature or type of community (suburban, industrial, agricultural,
   resort/tourism, high tech, schools, parks, transportation). The local housing market is seldom static, and
   is constantly changing based on dynamic social and economic factors. As City demographics and
   household socio-economic conditions change, different housing opportunities arise and/or must be
   created to meet demand. This section explores the characteristics of the existing and projected
   demographics and housing stock in order to define the extent of unmet housing needs in Murrieta. This
   information is critical in providing direction to update the City's Housing Element goals, policies,
   programs, and actions.
   Housing Assistance Summary
   Several factors will influence the degree of demand, or "need," for new housing in Murrieta in coming
   years. The four major needs categories considered in this Element include:
           Housing needs resulting from population growth in the City and the surrounding region;
           Housing needs resulting from the overcrowding of units;
           Housing needs that result when households pay more than they can afford for housing; and
           Housing needs of "special needs groups" such as elderly, large families, female-headed
            households, households with a disabled person, farm workers, and the homeless.
   In identifying specific housing needs within the City, it appears that assistance for first-time homebuyers
   will continue to be critical for the low- and moderate-income households. Lower income groups will
   need the most assistance in meeting the higher cost burdens associated with owning a home. Although,
   new homes are for the most part, above the financial attainment of lower income households, there are
   homeownership opportunities for moderate-income households with the City’s existing stock of older
   resale homes. In terms of rental households, there appears to be a need for additional rental resources
   with three or more bedrooms at rates affordable to lower income households.
   Table 4-1 below summarizes the housing assistance needs of all households (categorized by income
   percentage of the Riverside County Area Median Income) in Murrieta by household tenure
   (renter/owner), household type (elderly, small/large families, other), and “housing problems.” This count
   of households with “housing problems” includes those who: 1) occupy units with physical defects, such
   as lacking complete kitchen or bathroom; 2) live in overcrowded conditions (housing units with more
   than one person per room); 3) have a housing cost burden exceeding 30% of gross income; or 4) have a
   severe housing cost burden exceeding 50% of gross income.

According to the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy Databook, nearly 36% of all households
in the City of Murrieta experienced some form of housing problem. The percentage of households that
experienced some type of housing problem was greater among owners than renters within all income
categories, and for each household type. This is because there are more single-family homes than
multifamily units in the City. The statistics as identified in Table 4-1 indicate that housing cost burden is
a contributing factor to housing problems.
Data Sources
The sources used in this needs assessment include the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Census, California Department
of Finance (DOF) 2009 Population and Housing Estimates, the Census Bureau 2005-2007 American
Community Survey (ACS), and various other sources. For demographic data, estimates are used to show
changes in conditions since the 2000 U.S. Census. Many of these estimates (such as data from the
Department of Finance and American Community Survey) are shown solely as percentages, as the raw
numbers carry a significant margin of error, especially for smaller jurisdictions such as counties or cities.
Nonetheless, the percentages presented give a general indication of population and employment trends.
Additional information has been drawn from the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy
(CHAS), which is drawn from 2000 Census data. Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy data is
based on special tabulations for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from
sample Census data. Thus, the number of households in each category often deviates slightly from the
100% count due to extrapolations to the total household level. Because of this, interpretations of

Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy data should focus on proportions and percentages, rather
than on precise numbers.
Data contained in tables in this Needs Assessment are derived from two Census data sources: Summary
File 1 (SF-1) and Summary File 3 (SF-3). Summary File 1 contains the 100% data, which is the
information compiled from the questions asked of all people and about every housing unit. Summary File
3 contains the sample data, which is the information compiled from the questions asked of a sample of all
people and housing units. Summary File 3 data has a sampling error that occurs because only part of the
population is contacted directly. Therefore, differences are likely to exist between the characteristics of
the sampled population and the larger group from which the sample was chosen. As a result, tables using
SF-1 data are likely to have different population and housing totals than tables using SF-3 data.
4.1 - Population Trends and Characteristics
            4.1.1 - Growth
                     The City of Murrieta was incorporated July 1, 1991 and encompasses 33.6 square miles.
                     Since 2000, the City of Murrieta has been one of the largest housing markets in western
                     Riverside County. The California Department of Finance estimated the population of
                     Murrieta to be 100,714 in 2009; compared to the 2000 Census population of 44,282.
                     From 2000 to 2009, Murrieta grew at a faster rate (126%) than nearby Temecula (75%)
                     and Riverside County (35%).1 Murrieta’s growth can be attributed to many factors,
                     including an increased supply of affordable housing when compared to higher prices in
                     other nearby housing markets such as those in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego
                     Counties, and the 2002 annexation of the 3,200 acres Hot Springs area with a population
                     of approximately 12,000. From 2006 to 2009, Murrieta grew from an estimated 92,933
                     to 100,714, or about 7.7%.

            4.1.2 - Age of Population
                     According to the 2005-2007 American Community Survey, the median age in Murrieta is
                     31.5 years old. The largest segments of the City’s population is the 35-64 age bracket
                     (36%) and the under the age of 19 bracket (34.0%). The young adult and senior
                     populations make up the remainder 30 percent of the population. Age plays an important
                     role in determining housing needs. For example, younger adults require more affordable
                     housing as they begin their careers as compared to adults that are established in the

                     population according to the 2005-2007 ACS. Asians comprised 10% of the population
                     while the Black population accounts for 7%. Approximately 8% of the population
                     classified themselves as “Other”.2 Of the total percentage of residents, approximately
                     23% of the population consider themselves to be ethnically, Hispanic.

          4.1.4 - Employment Characteristics
                     Murrieta residents are employed in diverse industries, with the largest percentage
                     (17.5%) of the population employed in the Service sector, which includes educational and
                     healthcare services. The second most common sector of work is Retail Trade, with
                     13.6%, followed by Construction, at 10.8%. The retail sector is important to consider
                     when assessing housing affordability as salaries tend to be lower, which decreases the
                     amount of income available for housing. Generally, the retail sector does not offer health
                     and other employment benefits, further increasing economic strain.

                As of January 2006, the largest non-retail employer in the City is the Murrieta Valley
                Unified School District (1,579 employees). The second and third largest employers are
                Southwest Healthcare (1,200) and the City of Murrieta (356). Analysis of employment
                data indicates that the vast majority of Murrieta’s households have one or two wage
                earners who commute to jobs outside the City, while the jobs provided within the
                jurisdiction tend to be in the lower-paying service, retail trade and manufacturing
                sectors. In Riverside County, unemployment rates are expected to reach 7.1% in 2008,
                while unemployment in Murrieta is expected to be 2.5% lower than that of Riverside
                County, by approximately 4.6%. Existing employment and the direction of the City’s
                economic growth have important implications for both the type of housing supplied and
                the balance between services required and income derived The City’s jobs to housing
                ratio is currently estimated at 0.63, whereas the City goal is to achieve a jobs to housing
                ratio of 1.0.
4.2 - Household Characteristics
        A household is defined by the Census as all persons occupying a housing unit. Families are a
        subset of households and include all persons living together who are related by blood, marriage
        or adoption. Single households include persons living alone in housing units, but do not include
        persons in group quarters such as convalescent homes, dormitories, or rehabilitation facilities.
        Other households are unrelated people living together, such as roommates.

            The California Department of Finance estimated the number of households in 2009 has increased
            to 34,293, a 130% increase over the 2000 Census estimate of 14,921. The Riverside County Center
            for Demographic Research projections suggest further growth, with a forecast growth of 36,203
            households in 2010 and 39,705 households in 2020.3 Similarly, the City of Murrieta Planning
            Department anticipates the City will grow to include a total of 39,340 units by June of 2010.
            In 2007, the American Community Survey estimated that the City of Murrieta had 28,838
            households. Out of this total, 76% (22,002 households) were family households and 24% (6,836
            households) were non-family households. Table 4-6 provides detailed information on the
            demographics of the family and non-family households.

                                                                                       4 – Community Profile
           4.2.1 - Household Type
                     Household composition and size are often two interrelated factors. Communities
                     containing a large number of families with children tend to have a larger average
                     household size. Such communities have a greater need for larger units with adequate
                     open space and recreational opportunities for children. The household size in Murrieta
                     is an average of 2.9 persons per household, which is similar, but slightly higher than
                     Riverside County in general. The County average household size by comparison was 2.7
                     persons per household, according to the Department of Finance in 2009.4
           4.2.2 - Tenure
                     Tenure in the housing industry typically refers to the occupancy of a housing unit based
                     on whether the unit is owner-occupied or renter-occupied. Tenure preferences are
                     primarily related to household income, composition, and age of the householder. The
                     tenure distribution of a community’s housing stock influences several aspects of the local
                     housing market. Residential mobility is influenced by tenure with ownership housing
                     showing a lower turnover rate than rental housing.
                     In 2007, the City had a total of 28,838 occupied housing units out of which 22,177 (77%)
                     were owner-occupied and 6,661 (23%) were renter-occupied. Since 2000, the total of
                     occupied housing units increased 94% from 11,407 owner-occupied units to 22,177
                     owner-occupied units. Likewise, renter-occupied housing units have increased 2,913
                     units in 2000 to 6,661 units in 2007, an increase of 128%.
                     Typically, multifamily units allow a community to meet a wider range of affordable
                     housing needs. Murrieta offers programs to increase the housing options available for
                     lower income families. The City has a number of programs that are designed to increase
                     the number of affordable housing units in the City and to maintain the existing
                     affordable housing stock, while still staying within the parameters of the goals of the
                     Land Use Element.
           4.2.3 - Household Income
                     The Census Bureau defines household and family incomes differently. Household income
                     is defined as any income earners within a residence combining their income, while family
                     income is defined as households with two or more persons related through blood,
                     marriage or adoption combining their income.5 The 2005-2007 American Community
                     Survey indicates that the City experiences higher household and family median incomes
                     of $74,775 and $85,439 respectively, than the 2007 Riverside County medians of $55,881
                     and $62,430.

                     Typically, payment assistance is needed from local, State, or Federal government
                     agencies to assist lower-income households in securing adequate housing because lower
                     income households require housing with rents or payments lower than market rates. The
                     City will continue to utilize available programs administered through the County
                     (Mortgage Credit Certificate Program, Home Repair Program, First-time Homebuyer
                     Program) and in conjunction with non-profit organizations (Habitat for Humanity) to
                     provide residents with affordable housing. The City will also continue to utilize Federal
                     Programs (Community Development Block Grant, HUD 202 Grant, and Section 8) and
                     State Programs (Home Mortgage Purchase Program, Low-Income Housing Tax Credits)
                     to further implement affordable housing in the City.
4.3 - Housing Stock Characteristics
           Before current housing problems can be fully identified and future needs anticipated housing
           occupancy characteristics need to be examined within the City. The following is an analysis of
           household type, age of housing stock, and other housing stock characteristics that may affect
           access to and demand for housing and housing programs.
           The Census Bureau defines a housing unit as a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of
           rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or, if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate
           living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from
           any other individuals in the building and which have direct access from outside the building or
           through a common hall.
           In 2009, the California Department of Finance estimated that the City of Murrieta had 34,293
           housing units. Between 2000 and 2009, the total amount of housing units increased by 19,327
           units, or 130%. In 2009 the majority of housing units in Murrieta are single-family detached
           units (71%).6 Out of the total units that were constructed between 2000 and 2009, majority,
           71% or 11,986 units were single-family detached units.

        In addition to Single-Family detached homes, multifamily developments with 5 or more units
        make up 20% of the total housing units in Murrieta while complexes with 2 to 4 units are only
        1% of the total. Finally, mobile home units, typically classified separately from single-family
        detached units, round out the City’s housing stock with 3.6% of total units in the City. Between
        2000 and 2008, an additional 7,489 multifamily units of varying affordability levels were
        constructed.
        4.3.1 - Vacancy Rate
                   The vacancy rate of a community's housing supply is a key indicator or whether an
                   appropriate number of units are available in the City. If the vacancy rate is too high, this
                   can have negative impacts on the community and the investment potential of a
                   neighborhood. If the vacancy rate is too low, it may indicate that there are not enough
                   units for any one income category to meet existing market demands, and that a portion
                   of the population may be denied housing opportunities. The State Department of
                   Housing and Community Development has determined that the “healthy” vacancy rate
                   for ownership is between 2% and 3% and 5% to 6% for rental complexes. This ensures
                   the continued upkeep of rental properties and keeps housing costs down.
                   The 2007 American Community Survey reported that the vacancy rate for ownership
                   housing in the City was 3.6% while the rate for rental units was 7.4%. Vacancy rates for
                   both ownership and rental housing are not within the “healthy” range established by
                   HCD; however they are only slightly higher than the target rates. These percentages
                   suggest that there is a surplus of owner and renter housing, especially renter occupied
                   units. This may be related to a high turnover of rental units as residents’ transition from
                   rental to ownership housing in the City.
                   Beginning in the latter half of 2007 through spring of 2009 there were a record number of
                   foreclosures in California. Information obtained online indicated that approximately
                   11,714 Notices of Default processed for single-family homes and condominiums in
City of Murrieta                                                                                              37

                    Riverside County. Notices of Default are recorded at county recorders offices and mark
                    the first step of the formal foreclosure process. This marked a 161% increase in the total
                    of Notices of Default processed from the first quarter of 2007.7 Based on information
                    from Foreclosure Radar, approximately 1,144 properties in Murrieta were in pre-
                    foreclosure in July 2009; meaning either a Notice of Default or Lis Pendens (pending
                    lawsuit) against the borrower/owner has been processed. 8 In addition, there were an
                    additional 447 bank owned properties and 796 propertied set to go to auction. In July
                    2009 there were approximately 2,387 properties in some stage of foreclosure.
                    Consequently the City has established a variety of ordinances and efforts to assist
                    homeowners as outlined in Action 4.4 of the Housing Plan.
           4.3.2 - Condition of Housing Stock
                    Age is one measure of housing stock condition and a factor for determining rehabilitation
                    or replacement need within the City. Without proper maintenance, housing units
                    deteriorate over time. Units that are older are more likely to be in need of repairs (e.g. a
                    new roof or plumbing). In general, houses 40 years or older are considered aged and are
                    more likely to generate major repairs. In addition, older homes may not be built to
                    current housing standards for fire and earthquake safety. The units of general concern
                    are those that were constructed prior to 1959.
                    Majority of the City’s current housing stock (96%) was constructed after 1980. Since
                    1980, housing construction has continued to rise.9 The 2005-2007 ACS showed that
                    Murrieta has only 198 units that were constructed prior to 1959, or 0.6% of the total
                    housing stock. Table 4-9 provides information on the number of units constructed by
                    decade. In addition to age, a lack in infrastructure and utilities often serves as an
                    indicator of substandard conditions. According to the 2007 ACS, there were only 81
                    units lacking complete plumbing facilities, and 123 units lacking complete kitchen
                    facilities in the City. Due to the low number of units built prior to 1959 and low number
                    of units lacking utilities, the housing stock in the City is less likely in need of major
                    repair.
                    The City provides resources through the County of Riverside for the rehabilitation of
                    housing units for lower income households; however the City does not provide direct
                    funding for this program. The City offers information about the rehab program on their
                    website, through City newsletters, local newspapers, and at public counters at City Hall.

4.4 - Housing Costs
        This section discusses new home prices and resale costs of existing housing, as well as the
        average rental prices in the City. The information provided was obtained from reliable real estate
        industry data sources, the 2000 Census, 2005-2007 American Community Survey, 2009
        California Department of Finance, the Riverside County Center for Demographic Research, and
        data provided by the City.
        4.4.1 - Ownership Housing
                Table 4-10 lists the value of existing ownership units in the City in 2007. The 2005-2007
                ACS documents a median housing unit value of $472,500 in Murrieta which is $77,400
                above the County median of $395,100 in the same year. The increase in home prices for
                Murrieta is a significant increase from an average value of $190,700 in 2000. In addition
                to the large increase in home values Table 4-10 also indicates that 88.5% of homes in
                Murrieta were valued between $300,000 and $1,000,000.
                The overall increase of home prices in Murrieta may be the attributed to the City’s
                proximity to other major cities in Orange, Los Angeles, and San Diego Counties. Despite
                the fact that home prices in Murrieta were increasing the City was still more affordable
                and in commuting distance to all three of the identified urban areas. In comparison to
                Murrieta the median home price in 2007 for Orange, Los Angeles, and San Diego
                Counties were $656,600, $550,000, and $559,400 respectively. This makes Murrieta a
                more affordable option for above moderate-income homebuyers that cannot afford a
                home in Orange, Los Angeles, or San Diego Counties.

                      Following the large increase in housing prices from 2000 to 2007 the Murrieta housing
                      market has more recently been affected by the housing market collapse and economic
                      downturn that is affecting most cities across the nation. Nationally, housing prices have
                      declined from the peak reached in 2006. According to Data Quick, from November 2007
                      to November 2008, the median home price decreased 29 percent from $348,750 to
                      $246,500.10 From November 2008 to June 2009 the average sales price had continued to
                      decline to $237,785.11 These figures have decreased enough that they are affordable even
                      to moderate-income households, who are more likely than low and very low-income
                      households to have a down payment available. For households that are able to afford
                      purchasing a home, Table 4-11 shows the monthly house payment calculated for the
                      average priced existing and new home. This information is useful in determining the
                      affordability of home purchases. In calculating the payments, 10% down and a 30-year
                      mortgage were assumed. The prevailing mortgage rate of 5.5% was used in the
                      calculation.

                exceeds a low-income households’ ability to pay as determined by HCD 2008 California
                Income Limits shown in Table 4-13. Existing and new housing is however now affordable
                to moderate-income households earning between 80-120% AMI. Moderate-income
                households may also utilize the County of Riverside First-Time Home Buyers Program
                which is designed to assist households to bridge the gap in affordability between sales
                price and maximum income restrictions as shown in Table 4-11. This program provides
                qualified buyers with down payment assistance up to 20% of the purchase price of the
                home. In addition the City of Murrieta has also outlined in the Housing Plan an action to
                initiate a first-time home buyers program to be run through the City’s Redevelopment
                Agency. These programs along with other programs administered through the County
                can be used to assist households in affording homes; however, previously high home
                prices kept many applicants from using the First-Time Home Buyers Program.
        4.4.2 - Renter Housing
                According to the 2007 American Community Survey, 23% of Murrieta households lived
                in rental housing. The median rent was $1,265 in 2008, a 50% increase from the 2000
                median rent of $842. In 2008, rents in Murrieta ranged from $770 to $1,595 for a studio
                or one bedroom apartment, $987 to $1,650 for a two bedroom apartment, and $1,290 to
                $1,880 for a three bedroom apartment. Generally, these rents fell within the range
                established by the HUD fair market rents for the County of Riverside as shown in Table
                4-12.
                                                    Table 4-12:

                A survey of homes in Murrieta for rent on Realtor.com revealed that home rental prices
                vary by size of the home, number of bedrooms, and location. Predominantly, three and
                four bedroom home rents range from $2,000 to $4,000 per month. Because four bedroom
                apartments are rare, many large families would need to rent a Single-Family home in
                order to avoid overcrowded conditions.
        4.4.3 - Housing Affordability
                Table 4-13 identifies maximum affordable rents and purchase prices by income category
                for one person, small family, four person family, and large family. Comparing housing
                costs and maximum affordable prices for low-income households shows that many
                households are being priced out of the Riverside County rental and ownership market.
                Given the median home prices presented in Table 4-10, single-family home ownership is
                beyond the reach of all low-income households. For home rental, most moderate-income
                households may be able to afford a condominium or town home.

 Notes:
  1. Small Family = 3 persons; Large Family = 6 persons
  2. Property taxes and insurance based on averages for the region
  3. Calculation of affordable home sales prices based on a down payment of 10%, annual
     interest rate of 6.5%, 30-year mortgage, and monthly payment 30% of gross household income
  4. Based on Riverside County AMI $64,500 and 2009 HCD State Income Limits
  5. Monthly affordable rent based on payments of no more than 30% of household income
                        In 2009, the starting price for a rental unit in the City was around $690 per month for a
                        one bedroom unit. Rental housing in the City can generally be considered affordable for
                        those families annually earning 50% of the Riverside County median income limit
                        ($64,500) and above. This was determined by multiplying 50% of the AMI ($32,250) by
                        30% which is HUD’s affordability limit for housing costs. The resulting monthly
                        payment affordable to households earning 50% or more of the AMI is $806 a month.

                               There are currently eleven known developments that offer affordable housing options for
                               residents in Murrieta. As shown in Table 4-14, there are a total of 118 deed restricted
                               affordable units for very low-, low and moderate-income households that were
                               constructed between 2000 and 2009. Of the total, 6 units are for extremely low-income,
                               64 units are for very low-income, 10 are for low-income and 38 are restricted for
                               moderate-income. An additional 1,911 units are not deed restricted, but are considered to
                               be affordable for moderate-income households.

   Introduction
   The housing needs section provides an analysis of current housing conditions in the City, focusing on the
   demographics outlined in the previous section and housing concerns related to the various population
   groups of Murrieta. Several factors are projected to influence the degree of demand, or "need," for new
   housing in the City in coming years. In this element the housing needs of four groups are taken into
   consideration. These groups include:
           New population growth, both in the City and the surrounding region;
           Residents living in overcrowded units;
           Households paying more than they can afford for housing; and
           “Special needs groups" including the elderly, large families, female-headed households,
            households with a disabled person, farm workers, and the homeless.
   Analysis of demographic and market conditions indicates that the number of households at the high and
   low ends of the income spectrum will continue to grow, while the traditional middle income segments’
   participation in the housing market will continue to decline. Consequently analysis of specific housing
   needs and the necessary assistance for first-time homebuyers will become critical to assist low and
   moderate-income population in achieving home ownership. Lower income groups will require the most
   assistance in order to meet the increasing cost burden associated with owning a home. While many new
   homes are for the most part above the financial attainment of lower income households, there are limited
   homeownership opportunities for low and moderate-income households with the City’s existing stock of
   older resale homes. In regards to rental households, there appears to be a need for additional rental
   resources of all sizes at rates affordable to lower income households.
   Summary of Special Needs Groups
   Table 5-1 below summarizes the housing assistance needs of lower income households (less than 80% of
   the AMI) for special needs groups in Murrieta by household tenure (renter/owner), household type
   (elderly, small/large families), and “housing problems.” This count of households with “housing
   problems” includes those who: 1) occupy units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or
   bathroom); 2) live in overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room); 3)
   have a housing cost burden exceeding 30% of gross income; or 4) have a severe housing cost burden
   exceeding 50% of gross income.

  Table 5-1 indicates that within special needs groups, renters experience more housing problems than
  homeowners. For both renters and owners, more than 50% of all special needs households experienced a
  housing problem. The highest percentage of lower income households experiencing housing problems
  were large family renter and owner households. One-hundred percent of renter households and 90% of
  owner households experience a housing problem. These percentages demonstrate that large family renter
  households are at the greatest need for housing programs to assist in rehabilitating their homes.
  5.1 - Existing Need
            State housing policy recognizes that cooperative participation between the private and public
            sectors is necessary to expand housing opportunities to all economic segments of the
            community. A primary State goal is the provision of decent housing and suitable living
            environment for Californians of all economic levels. Historically, the private sector has responded
            to the majority of the community's housing needs through the production of market-rate
            housing. However, the percentage of the population on a statewide basis who can afford market
            rate housing is declining. Special needs groups are consequently experiencing additional housing
            challenges associated with their unique characteristics.
            The following subsections analyze the households in Murrieta, which experience some type of
            problem in their housing situation: overcrowding; overpayment; and special needs groups
            including the elderly, large-families, female headed households, the disabled, the homeless and
            farm workers.

           5.1.1 - Overpayment
                      A primary State goal is the provision of decent housing and a suitable living environment
                      for Californians of all economic levels. State housing policy recognizes that cooperative
                      participation of the private and public sectors are necessary to expand housing
                      opportunities to all economic segments of the community.
                      Consistent with HUD’s “threshold of overpayment” definition, California’s housing
                      administration has determined that, “Affordable housing costs with respect to extremely
                      low-, very low-, and low-income households shall not exceed 30% of gross household
                      income and 35% of gross household income for moderate-income households."12 That is,
                      when households must exceed 30% of their incomes for rent or mortgage payments, they
                      are left with insufficient funds for other necessities, such as food, health care, clothing,
                      and utilities.
                      Exceeding 30% of income for rent or mortgage may cause a series of related financial
                      problems, and can result in a deterioration of housing stock, because costs associated
                      with maintenance must be sacrificed for more immediate expenses (e.g. food, clothing,
                      medical care, and utilities). Overpayment also promotes overcrowding, which leads to a
                      variety of problems, from accelerating the rate of deterioration to code enforcement
                      issues. The State recognizes, however, that upper-income households are generally more
                      able to secure housing within their budgets, and are more capable of paying a larger
                      proportion of their income for housing. Therefore, housing overpayment estimates
                      usually focus on lower income groups.
                                                                       Table 5-2:

                      The 2005-2007 American Community Survey identifies housing overpayment for lower
                      income households. Table 5-2 displays total housing units overpaying for housing based
                      on tenure. The majority of households overpaying (75%) were owner-occupied units.
           5.1.2 - Overcrowding
                      In response to higher housing prices, lower-income households must often be satisfied
                      with smaller, less adequate housing for their available income. This may result in
                      overcrowding which places a strain on physical facilities and does not provide a healthy
                      living environment. Overcrowding is defined by the Census as a unit occupied by 1.01
                      persons or more per room (excluding bathrooms and kitchens). Units with more than
                      1.50 persons per room are considered severely overcrowded. Overcrowding is often
                      reflective of one of three conditions:

                    2. Familial households includes extended family members (i.e. grandparents or grown
                          children and their families living with parents, termed doubling); or
                    3. A family is renting living space to non-family members.
                    In 2007, overcrowding affected 320 units, or 1.1% of all households in Murrieta.
                    Additionally, 404 housing units (1.4%) were classified as severely overcrowded.13 In
                    comparison to Riverside County, Murrieta was significantly below the County
                    percentages of 5.4% and 1.7% respectively.14 Typically, very low-income rental
                    households experience the most overcrowding. This is because very low-income
                    residents are often unable to afford the month rent required to secure a unit with an
                    adequate number of bedrooms to meet the needs of their household. In 2007, 79 lower
                    income owner-occupied units and 114 lower income renter-occupied units were
                    considered to be overcrowded.15
                    According to Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy data, 3,110 lower income
                    households were overpaying for rental or owner housing. Out of this total, 627
                    extremely low-income households overpaid for housing. Table 5-3 displays that 59% of
                    owner-occupied households experienced more overpayment than renter households; the
                    highest total occurring in low-income households.

5.2 - Special Needs Groups
           State Housing Law requires that the special needs of certain disadvantaged groups be addressed
           within the Housing Element. These households typically experience difficulty in securing decent,
           affordable housing, and are not maintained under market conditions. The needs of the elderly,
           handicapped, large families, female heads of household, the homeless and farm workers are
           addressed below.
           5.2.1 - Elderly
                    The special housing needs of the elderly are an important concern in Murrieta. Many of
                    the elderly resident in the City are retired and living on a fixed low-income, which puts
                    them at greater risk of impaction, or housing overpayment. In addition, the elderly
                    maintain special needs related to housing construction and location. The elderly often

                   require ramps, handrails, lower cupboards and counters to allow greater access and
                   mobility. In terms of location, because of limited mobility, the elderly typically need
                   access to public facilities (i.e., medical and shopping) and public transit facilities.
                   Finding a reliable means of transportation to medical appointments, senior activity and
                   meal sites remains a serious problem for seniors. Many seniors lack private
                   transportation due to physical or financial limitations. Because of this, the Riverside
                   Transit Agency provides a dial-a-ride shuttle service that can be used by the elderly for
                   transportation.
                   As reported in the 2007 American Community Survey, 8,538 City residents, or 9% of the
                   total population, were 65 years old or older. In terms of tenure, 2,528 owner-occupied
                   and 497 renter-occupied units were headed by occupants 65 years old or older.16
                   Many elderly persons have limited income potential, as they are most often retired and
                   have fixed income. Table 5-1 revealed that 84% of lower income senior households (62
                   years old or older) paid more than 30% of their income on housing, experiencing a
                   housing cost burden. While the vast majority of seniors are homeowners, the percentage
                   of lower income senior renters who overpaid (84%) was higher than senior homeowners
                   (65%) who overpaid. Lower income renter senior households experienced a greater
                   percentage of housing problems (73%) than lower income senior homeowners (28.1%) as
                   shown in Table 5-1.
                   In 2000, 62% of the elderly population was disabled. Despite the large number of seniors
                   who have disabilities, 36% live alone, according to the Census. However, the vast
                   majority of elderly own their home, estimated at 50% in 2000. 17
           5.2.2 - Disabled Household Needs
                   Access and affordability are the two major housing needs of disabled persons. Access is
                   particularly important for the physically disabled. Physically disabled persons often
                   require specially designed dwellings to permit access within the unit, as well as to and
                   from the site. The California Administrative Code Title 24 sets forth access and
                   adaptability requirements for the disabled. These regulations apply to public buildings
                   such as motels, employee housing, factory built housing, and privately funded newly
                   constructed apartment houses containing five or more dwelling units. The regulations
                   also require that ramp-ways, larger door widths, and restroom modifications, be
                   designed which enable access to the disabled. Such standards, however, are not
                   mandatory of new single-family residential construction.
                   The disabled, like the elderly, have special needs with regard to location. There is
                   typically a desire to be located near public facilities, and especially near public
                   transportation facilities that provide service to those who rely on them. The needs for
                   residents with mobility limitations are currently being met by the Riverside Transit
                   Agency through a dial-a-ride service with specialized transportation vehicles for those
                   who are not able to provide their own transportation or reach established boarding areas
                   for the City bus routes.

 City of Murrieta                                                                                       49

           Table 5-4 reflects that 7,844 persons 16 years and older in the City of Murrieta had a
           disability in 2000. A disability with a self-care limitation does not necessarily translate
           into a need for specially constructed housing units; therefore it makes it difficult to
           estimate the number of disabled persons in need of housing. Out of the total disabled
           persons, 1,971 persons had a disability that either prevented them from working or made
           it difficult to work; while 1,520 individuals had a disability that hindered their mobility.
           For this reason, the need for programs to assist disabled households on a fixed income is
           important.
                                                                  Table 5-4:

           Currently there is no direct source that provides information on the number of housing
           units in the City equipped to handle the needs of disabled citizens. The City, therefore,
           needs to have programs to ensure that all affected households have the means to be able
           to provide the necessary improvements on an as-needed basis. Through the Riverside
           County Economic Development Agency and Office on Aging, the County is able to offer
           assistance to qualifying low-income households to provide the necessary improvements
           that will make their homes accessible as needed.
   5.2.3 - Large Family Household Needs
           The 2000 Census reported 2,592 households in the City of Murrieta with five or more
           persons. Large family households require special consideration because they require
           larger dwellings with sufficient bedrooms to meet their housing needs, without
           overcrowding.
           Difficulties in securing housing large enough to accommodate all members of a
           household are heightened for renters, because multifamily rental units are typically
           smaller than single-family units. Apartment complexes in the City offering three- and
           four-bedroom models are few. Large families in Murrieta, therefore, may satisfy their
           housing needs mostly through the rental and ownership of single-family units, for which
           there appears to be sufficient stock. However, as shown previously in the Housing Costs
           Section, the larger single-family rental stock is generally not affordable to the majority of
           lower income households.

                Table 5-5 reveals tenure of housing units by number of persons in the unit. The table
                shows that there are more owner-occupied units than renter-occupied units housing
                large families. Owner-occupied units account for 84% of the large households in the City,
                representing about 9% of all owner-occupied housing; while 16% of large households
                occupy rental units in the City.
                                                                        Table 5-5:

        5.2.4 - Female Head of Household
                The primary concern in this segment of the population is households where, for one
                reason or another, there is only one parent. This creates conflicts between the economic
                needs of the home and the daycare needs of the family. Historically, females in this
                situation have earned less income than the rest of the population, restricting their ability
                to provide for both housing and daycare. According to the 2007 ACS, there were 2,122
                female-headed households in the City; 1,432 (67%) of which had children under 18 years
                old. Of the female headed households, with children under 18 years old, were below the
                federally established poverty level; compared to the County where the percentage is
                15.1% of the total.
                With existing housing programs, female-headed households can be eligible to qualify for
                housing assistance, such as Section 8 vouchers, based on income level. One program
                available to single parent households is the CalWORKs Greater Avenues for
                Independence (GAIN) program, which is a program of the Riverside County Department
                of Public Social Services. This program assists applicants and recipients of temporary
                assistance to become self-sufficient. This program provides child care and transportation
                assistance.
        5.2.5 - Farm Worker Housing
                In the 2007 American Community Survey, approximately 303 people were classified as
                working in the agriculture industry sector. Although Murrieta and Riverside County
                contain a number of major employers in southern California, this growth is not tied to an
                agricultural base. Although some land in the City remains for agricultural use, most land
                previously used for agricultural uses is currently developed or designated for commercial
                or residential development. Majority of the lower density land in the City is not used for
                agriculture, but rather for equestrian purposes with some land remaining for personal
                farming in comparison with commercial farm operations. Consequently, the estimated
                303 individuals identified as working in the agricultural sector are likely to be employed
                in nurseries, stables, and not in traditional agricultural production. The demand for
                housing generated by farm workers in the City is thus estimated to be extremely low.
                The City does allow for second dwelling units to be constructed in the rural and estate
                residential zones which can provide units for employees working in these areas. The City
City of Murrieta                                                                                                 51

           also has a number of affordable multifamily units that also provide housing for employees
           in the sector.
   5.2.6 - Homeless Persons
           The RHNA produced by SCAG defines homelessness as:
           1. Persons who are living or staying in emergency shelters;
           2. Persons who sleep outside, in a makeshift shelter, in cars, or transportation areas
               such as bus or train terminals;
           3. Persons who are considered “at risk” (i.e., doubled up, in marginal circumstances,
               motel population with limited stay or general relief recipients whose payments have
               been canceled due to “no forwarding address”).
           Enumerating the homeless population is difficult due to the transient nature of the
           population, as well as the existence of hidden homeless or persons that move between
           housing situations (e.g. doubling up with another household). However, according to
           the 2007 County of Riverside Homeless Assessment, there were an estimated 4,508
           homeless persons on any given day in Riverside County. There were an additional
           number of homeless person who were not known and therefore not counted. More
           recently according to the Riverside County Homeless Count and Survey there were 5
           homeless individuals identified in the City of Murrieta by service providers.
           The trends largely responsible for homelessness include: a shortage of affordable housing,
           combined with a simultaneous growth in the population of low-income renters, which
           has correlated with high demand and limited supply of affordable units. Each of these
           factors could potentially exacerbate any of the traditional conditions, but may
           increasingly become stand-alone causes of homelessness. The numbers of homeless
           people, the cost of housing, and the number of people living in poverty combine to create
           a potential for homelessness.
           Currently, the Murrieta Zoning Code does address transitional and emergency housing.
           As outlined in Action 5.2 the City will amend the development standards for the
           Multiple Use-2 (MU-2) and Business Park (BP) zoning districts to allow emergency
           shelters by right, without a Conditional Use Permit or other discretionary action, and
           will ensure that a proposed shelter is subject to only the same development standards
           required for other uses permitted in the same zone. The MU-2 and BP zones are
           appropriate to accommodate emergency shelters as they are typically located along major
           arterial roadways with access to employment centers and in close proximity to
           commercial and retail stores as well as social services. There are currently 281 acres of
           vacant land zoned for MU-2 and 376 acres of vacant land zoned BP, including
           approximately 46 sites between 2 and 5 acres in size that are appropriate and able to
           accommodate a shelter of approximately 20 beds if one is proposed. To better
           accommodate emergency shelters in the City, specific siting standards and conditions for
           approval will be developed in accordance with State Law.
           The City will also amend the Zoning Code to permit transitional and supportive housing
           as a permitted residential use without a CUP, subject only to those regulations that
           apply to other residential dwelling units of the same type in the same zone. Further,
           Section 16.44.200 will be added to the Development Code detailing the conditions and
           requirements for operations of such housing and shelters. Although no homeless shelters

                     exist in Murrieta due to the limited number of homeless persons, the City does provide
                     support to shelters located near Murrieta located in Wildomar and Lake Elsinore.
                     Another means of assisting the homeless is through community outreach programs
                     sponsored by non-profit organizations. King’s Hall is a shelter for the homeless located at
                     March Air Reserve Base approximately 20 miles from Murrieta. The shelter is run by the
                     Path of Life Ministries and uses volunteers from the Calvary Chapel in Murrieta to
                     maintain the shelter. King’s Hall is a transitional housing program for homeless women
                     with children, single men with children, complete families, and chronic homeless
                     women. Also, the Community Food Pantry and Second Hand Treasures of Murrieta
                     distribute food to needy families while providing families the opportunity to purchase
                     clothing, furniture, and household items at discounted prices. This community outreach
                     program is sponsored by St. Martha’s Catholic Church in Murrieta.
5.3 - Assisted Housing At-Risk of Conversion to Market Rate Housing
           State housing law requires an inventory and analysis of government-assisted dwellings units
           eligible for conversion from low-income housing to market rate housing during the next ten
           years, or until 2018 for this at-risk planning period. Reasons for potential conversion may
           include expiration of subsidies, mortgage pre-payments or pay-offs, and concurrent expiration of
           affordability restrictions. A review of the assisted housing inventory maintained by HUD
           indicates that no assisted units are subject to the expiration of affordability restrictions in the
           next planning period or within the next ten years.18 To ensure continued affordability, four
           complexes were constructed between 2000 and 2008 that have deed restricted units maintained
           through an affordability covenant. The following table lists 10 apartment complexes that were
           built between 2000 and 2008, and the amount of units in each complex that were allocated for
           each income level. Units that are deed restricted are identified with “DR”.

                 As Table 5-6 displays, 118 units were constructed between 2000 and 2008 that have deed
                 restrictions. The deed restrictions range from 30 to 55 years ensuring these deed restrictions will
                 not expire during the upcoming planning period. Since these deed restrictions are not set to
                 expire in the upcoming planning period and there are no at-risk units in the City, further analysis
                 of costs and programs for preserving such units is not necessary.
                 5.3.1 - Public Agencies and Non-Profit Corporations
                              The analysis of existing assisted living developments must “identify public and private
                              non-profit corporations known to the local government which have legal and managerial
                              capacity to acquire and manage these housing developments.” The State HCD has
                              compiled a list of entities interested in a “right of first refusal” in connection with the
                              possible acquisition of assisted housing projects. The entities that have expressed an
                              interest in Riverside County properties are listed below:

             These local public agencies, public or private non-profit corporations, and for-profit
             organizations identified have the legal and managerial capacity to acquire and manage at-risk
             projects.
5.4 - Regional Housing Needs Assessment
        California’s State Housing Element law requires that each city and county develop local housing
        programs designed to meet its “fair share” of existing and future housing needs for all income
        groups. This effort is coordinated by the jurisdiction’s Council of Governments (The City of
        Murrieta is in the Western Riverside Council of Governments) when preparing the State-
        mandated Housing Element of its General Plan. This “fair share” allocation concept seeks to
        ensure that each jurisdiction accepts responsibility for the housing needs of not only its resident
        population, but for all households who might reasonably be expected to reside within the
        jurisdiction, particularly lower income households. This assumes the availability of a variety and
        choice of housing accommodations appropriate to their needs, as well as certain mobility among
        households within the regional market.
        5.4.1 - Overview of the SCAG Fair Share Allocation Process
                 The fair share allocation process begins with the State Department of Finance’s
                 projection of statewide housing demand for a five year period, which is then apportioned
                 by HCD among each of the State’s official regions. The regions are represented by an
                 agency typically termed a Council of Government (COG). In the six county southern
                 California region, which includes Murrieta and all other incorporated cities and
                 unincorporated areas of Riverside County, the agency responsible for assigning these fair
                 share goals to each jurisdiction is the Southern California Association of Governments
                 (SCAG).
                 A local jurisdiction’s “fair share” of regional housing need is the number of additional
                 dwelling units that will need to be constructed during a given seven-year planning
                 period. SCAG estimates each jurisdiction's future housing need in terms of four factors:
               1) The number of units needed to accommodate forecasted household growth;
               2) The number of units needed to replace demolitions due to attrition in the housing
                   stock (i.e., fire damage, obsolescence, redevelopment and conversions to non-housing
                   uses);
               3) Maintaining an ideal vacancy rate for a well-functioning housing market; and
               4) An adjustment to avoid an over-concentration of lower-income households in any one
                   jurisdiction.
                 The new construction need must be allocated to four household income categories used
                 in Federal and State programs: very low-, low-, moderate-, and above moderate-income,
                 defined operationally as households earning up to 50% , 80% , 120%, and more than 120%
                 of the Riverside County median income, respectively. The allocations are further
                 adjusted to avoid an over-concentration of lower income households in any one
City of Murrieta                                                                                       55

        jurisdiction. The fair share allocation must also consider the existing “deficit” of housing
        resulting from lower income households that pay more than 30% of their incomes for
        housing costs. As discussed earlier, this is the threshold used by HUD to determine
        housing affordability. The 2006-2014 Regional Housing Needs Assessment for the City
        of Murrieta is:
                                                             Table 5-7:

   Thus, Murrieta’s “fair share” allocation is 6,303 units. According to Housing Element Law
   Section 65583, local agencies shall calculate the subset of very low-income households that
   qualify as extremely low-income households (30% or less of the Riverside County median
   income) by using available Census data to calculate the percentage of very low-income
   households that qualify as extremely low-income households.
   The 2005-2007 ACS reported that there were 2,266 households (7.9%) earning less than 30%
   of the 2008 Riverside County Area Median Income of $62,000. The 2006 SCAG RHNA
   projected 1,568 very low-income households in the upcoming planning period. To determine
   the RHNA allocation of extremely low-income households, HCD recommends assuming that
   50 percent of very low-income households are actually extremely low-income. This means
   that with a RHNA allocation of 1,568, the City should allocate 784 units for extremely low-
   income and the remaining 784 units for very low-income. The Housing Plan in Section 2
   describes policies and programs that the City can utilize towards implementing this housing
   needs allocation.

6. Housing Constraints Analysis
                                                                                               Section 6
   Pursuant to State law, a Housing Element shall provide an analysis of existing and potential
   governmental and non-governmental constraints on the improvement, maintenance, and development of
   the housing stock. This analysis must include housing for all segments of the population including all
   income levels and persons with special needs (such as the homeless, disabled, and elderly).
   Governmental and non-governmental constraints are discussed in this section.
   6.1 - Governmental Constraints
           Local policies and regulations can affect the availability of housing and in particular, the
           provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, fees and
           exactions, permit processing procedures, and other factors can affect the maintenance,
           development, and improvement of housing.
           State, Federal and Regional regulations, which the City has no control over, also affect the
           availability of land for housing and the cost of producing housing. Regulations related to
           environmental protection, building codes, and other topics have significant, often adverse
           impacts on housing cost and availability. While constraints exist at other levels of government,
           this section emphasizes policies and regulations that are under the control of the City.

           It is important to note that the City of Murrieta’s intent is to find a balance between
           implementing community standards and quality for new residential development, and
           maintaining a development review process and appropriate regulations that do not unreasonably
           constrain new residential construction. The City of Murrieta has been successful in achieving
           that balance as evidenced by: (1) the construction of approximately 11,160 new residential units
           since 2003, including 4,800 multiple-family units; and (2) the affordability of many newer
           market-rate multiple-family units (rental and ownership) for moderate-income households.
           Consequently, the number and cost of many newer residences is a clear indicator that the
           constraints outlined in this chapter are not hindering the construction of affordable and market-
           rate housing in the City of Murrieta.

   6.1.1 - Land Use Designations, Standards and Procedures
           Land use controls take a number of forms which affect the development of housing. One
           example of a land use control is the City’s General Plan, which establishes the overall
           character and development of the community. The Murrieta Land Use Element of the
           General Plan and Title 16 of the Murrieta Municipal Code (Development Code) identify
           eight residential land use designations/zoning districts. Table 6-1 below specifies the
           following land use designations and allowable density ranges for residential uses.
                                                                       Table 6-1:

            *For previously established and recorded lots, the minimum lot size may be less and the requirement is not applicable.
           Density is a critical factor in the development of affordable housing. Maintaining low
           density detached dwellings typically increases the cost of construction per unit, while
           higher density attached development lowers the per-unit land cost and facilitates
           improved construction efficiency. The Murrieta General Plan and Development Code
           currently allow for the development of housing up to a density of 18 dwelling units per
           acre. Of the housing developments constructed in the previous decade, the City has
           encouraged and approved housing for a variety of income levels that meet their
           established density requirements. In addition to the multifamily residential designations,
           the City has also established a density bonus that allows developers to go above the
           established densities; however developers offered the bonus have not chosen to take
           advantage of the opportunity.
           Within the City’s existing land use designations, the Multi-Family 2 (MF-2) and
           Multiple Use-3 (MU-3) designations offer the most feasible opportunity for the
           development of affordable housing. Several affordable housing complexes have already
           been constructed within these two designations. While affordable housing
           developments have been constructed in the City within the existing designations, the
           City plans to establish a new high density zone and land use designation that would
           allow up to 30 dwelling units an acre in a multi-family residential zone (MF-3). The City
           anticipates that this new designation will help to facilitate the development of additional
           housing for very low- and low-income families as they meet and exceed the State’s
           established default densities.

                                                                                                   Analysis
      6.1.1.A -       Minimum Lot Size Requirements
                                 Large-lot zoning (minimum 5 acres per lot) is currently required for multifamily
                                 zones including the MF-1 and MF-2 zones. This requirement does not pertain to
                                 any existing and recorded lots, which applies to the majority of the City. The SF-
                                 1 zone requires a minimum of 7,200 square feet per lot. This minimum
                                 requirement is typical in suburban communities and is not excessive or
                                 burdensome in that it does not exclude most lots from developing residential
                                 uses at an achievable maximum density assumed under these zones. The
                                 minimum lot size requirement for an SF-2 zoned parcel, however, is reduced to
                                 5,000 square feet.
                                 The bulk of sites in Murrieta, as shown in the sites inventory in Chapter 7 of the
                                 Housing Element, are larger than 5 acres, which resulted in the creation of
                                 Action 1.6, a large lot subdivision program in the Housing Plan, as required by
                                 HCD. While the City primarily contains large sites, Staff has historically
                                 worked with affordable housing developers to construct affordable units on sites
                                 that are smaller than 5 acres. Murrieta is currently working with an affordable
                                 housing developer to construct a 40 unit, deed-restricted, development on 2
                                 acres of land with all units affordable for extremely low, very low and low
                                 income families. The City will continue to offer flexible development standards
                                 in instances where affordable units will be created. It is rare that a developer
                                 would not meet the minimum lot size requirements; however in the event that it
                                 is a constraint to affordable housing, Action 3.5 will assure that the City
                                 addresses the standard and will work with the developer to alter the standard to
                                 produce affordable units.
           6.1.2 - Development Code
                      The City of Murrieta Development Code establishes specific development standards,
                      allowable uses and other limitations, and must be consistent with the community’s
                      standards as set forth in the General Plan. Zoning regulations control development by
                      establishing requirements related to height, density, lot area, yard setbacks, and
                      minimum parking spaces. Site development standards ensure a quality living
                      environment for all households groups in the City, including special needs groups, and
                      low- and moderate-income households. Differences in development standards are just
                      one factor of many that can affect the relative affordability of housing.
                      Approximately 71% of residential units in Murrieta are single-family detached homes.19
                      Some of these units are located in the RR, ER and SF zones, although a majority of
                      residential areas in the City are zoned SF-1. Single-family subdivisions are the primary
                      use in this designation. Developments in the single-family residential zones range in
                      density from 2 to 10 dwelling units per acre and have uniform lot patterns, with a
                      minimum lot size of 7,200 square feet. Cluster developments with smaller lot sizes of
                      5,000 to 6,000 square feet are possible within the Master Plan Overlay district, so long as

   the size is justified through the provision of significant open space, recreational facilities,
   and/or other public amenities.
   In comparison to single-family units, multifamily attached units make up approximately
   23% of the total housing stock in Murrieta in 2008. These units are often constructed in
   the multifamily zones which allow for between 10 and 18 dwelling units per acre. The
   City has identified that developments should occur on parcels between 5 to 15 acres in
   size; however, City Staff will work with developers to design affordable housing
   complexes on smaller sites when feasible. The City may encourage lot consolidation or
   will discuss density bonus opportunities in order to increase the number of units on-site.

                                                                                                   6 – Housing Constraints Analysis
                In general, the development standards found in the City of Murrieta Development Code
                are comparable to those of jurisdictions in the surrounding area including the County of
                Riverside Zoning Code. The setbacks, minimum lot sizes and minimum lot dimensions
                are similar if not the same. The building heights allowed by the City of Murrieta are
                lower than those of the County, however the City’s standard still allows for the
                development of a multi-story structure without requiring a variance.
                Within the City’s Development Code there are two standards that are not addressed in
                Table 6-2 that may create constraints to the development of affordable housing in the
                City. These standards include: parking requirements and open space requirements. To
                minimize constraints and maintain incentive for affordable housing developers, the City
                relies primarily on the application of Density Bonuses and Specific Plans or a reduction
                in the required standards. The City may consider additional concessions to offset
                developer costs by providing waivers or modifying development fees to make low-
                income and senior housing units more economically feasible.
    6.1.2.A - Parking Requirements
                         The City’s parking standards for residential developments are tailored to the
                         vehicle ownership patterns associated with different residential uses. All single-
                         family residential homes must have two spaces within an enclosed garage.
                         However, parking requirements for multiple-family units vary depending on the
                         number of bedrooms in each unit. Guest parking is based on a percentage of the
                         total number of units. To facilitate the development of affordable units, the City
                         will consider an incentive, reduction or elimination of the garage requirement,
                         which will reduce the constraint on the development of affordable housing.
                         Parking standards for residential developments in Murrieta are shown in Table
                         6-3.

                       While the City’s parking requirements could be viewed as a constraint to the
                       construction of multifamily affordable housing, the City offers developers the
                       option to utilize a density bonus, which also permits the construction of
                       carports in lieu of enclosed garages. Recently, the City worked with Affirmed
                       Housing, the developer of Monte Vista Apartments in Murrieta, to approve an
                       affordable housing complex that did not require the construction of garages.
                       This example illustrates how the City is willing to work with developers to
                       promote the development of affordable units through the modification of
                       development standards. The City of Murrieta is determined and historically has
                       been successful in addressing specific development constraints and has created
                       Action 3.5 to ensure that any residential development standards that may
                       constrain the future development of affordable housing are removed.
   6.1.2.B -   Open Space Requirements
                       To improve the living environment of residential neighborhoods, communities
                       typically require housing to have a required amount of common and private open
                       space, such as yards, patios and landscaping areas. For single-family homes,
                       open space is achieved through setbacks and lot coverage limits. For multifamily
                       projects open space is more important due to the fact that residents do not have
                       their own yard. Therefore, private and common open space requirements ensure
                       that multifamily units have adequate open space for landscaping and recreation.
                       Both multifamily zoning districts require 60 square feet of private open space if
                       on upper floor(s) and 100 square feet of private open space if on the ground floor.
                       Additionally, 200 square feet of common open space is required for each unit.
                       Open space requirements could constrain the development of housing in terms
                       of having land available that provides sufficient open space to satisfy the City’s
                       requirements. However, the City’s open space requirements are considered
                       standard for most cities in southern California and do not act as a considerable
                       constraint to housing development.
       6.1.3 - Mixed Use Zones
               The City of Murrieta recognizes the importance of locating affordable housing near
               services. The City currently has 3 mixed use zones, one of which allows for a mix of
               residential and commercial development. Specifically, as part of the General Plan update
               the City has committed to establishing a General Plan policy with performance
               standards to ensure that the sites zoned for mixed use are developed to be truly mixed
               use projects with a required residential component.
               Within the Development Code there are currently no other requirements limiting the
               placement or design of a project that includes both residential and commercial uses.
       6.1.4 - Density Bonus
               Chapter 16.20 of the City’s Development Code addresses affordable housing incentives
               and density bonus provisions. State law mandates that all cities and counties shall adopt
               an ordinance that specifies how the city/county intends to comply with Government
               Code Section 65915 regarding density bonus opportunities. In order to be eligible for a
               density bonus and other incentives, a proposed residential project shall consist of five or
               more dwellings and must provide at least one of the following:
64                                                                         2008-2014 Housing Element

                                                                              6 – Housing Constraints Analysis
                            Twenty percent of the total number of proposed dwellings is for lower-
                             income households.
                            Ten percent of the total number of proposed dwellings is for very low-
                             income households.
                            Fifty percent of the total number of proposed dwellings is for residents with
                             incomes between 80% and 120% of the Riverside County AMI for a family of
                             four, which is currently $64,500.
                The density bonus provided to developers who incorporate affordable housing will allow
                them to construct 25% more residential dwelling units than normally allowed by the
                zoning district and General Plan designation applicable to the parcel. In the City of
                Murrieta’s MF-2 zone, the maximum density would increase from 18 units per acre to
                22.5 units per acre with a 25% density bonus.
                The City plans to amend its density bonus as indicated in Program 3.1 of the Housing
                Plan and will also allow density bonus regulations also include incentives and
                concessions. A developer can receive an incentive or concession based on the proportion
                of affordable units for target groups. Developers may seek a waiver or modification of
                development standards that have the effect of precluding the construction of a housing
                development meeting the density bonus criteria. The developer must show that the
                waiver of modification is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible.
                Incentives or concessions may include, but are not limited to, the modification of
                development standards such as a reduction in setback and square footage requirements,
                height limits, and/or parking requirements.
        6.1.5 - Secondary Dwelling Unit Requirements
                In response to State mandated requirements and local needs, the City of Murrieta allows
                for the development of attached secondary dwelling units in specified Single-Family
                residential zoning districts. Prior to July 1, 2003, secondary units required the approval
                of a Conditional Use Permit. For applications received after July 1, 2003, State law
                requires that secondary units must be considered a ministerial action without
                discretionary review or public hearing. Secondary units shall have a minimum area of the
                underlying zoning district and the parcel shall be developed with only one existing
                owner occupied single-family detached main dwelling unit. Only one secondary unit is
                allowed on a single-family parcel. The second unit must share a common wall with the
                main structure and have separate kitchen, bathroom and parking facilities. The City
                plans to amend the second unit ordinance as part of Action 3.4 of the Housing Plan to
                ensure that the ordinance is consistent with State law.
        6.1.6 - Environmental Review (CEQA)
                The environmental review requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act
                (CEQA) are perhaps the most potentially significant government regulation that
                constrains new housing development. The key elements of CEQA review can affect the
                affordability of new housing development by extending the time frame for completing
                the project review, plus the direct costs to prepare the necessary technical studies of
                potential impacts. The time constraint to new housing development includes mandatory
                public review and comment periods, delays in preparing the needed technical studies,
City of Murrieta                                                                                      65

           implementation of required mitigation measures and the potential for post-approval
           litigation. In addition, technical studies of potential impacts such as traffic, biological
           resources, air quality, surface runoff water quality, archaeological resources and noise
           can cost several thousands of dollars each, the cost of which is passed in the sale price or
           rental cost.
   6.1.7 - Codes and Enforcement
           Building and safety codes regulate new construction, alteration, and rehabilitation of
           buildings and are intended to protect occupants from unnecessary risk of fire, structural
           collapse, unsanitary conditions, and injury or loss of life. While building and safety
           codes are adopted for the purposes of preserving public health and safety, and ensuring
           the construction of safe and decent housing, they have the potential to increase the cost
           of housing construction and/or maintenance. The City of Murrieta’s building codes are
           based on regulations necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare of its
           residents.
           The City has adopted into its Codes and Ordinances the 2007 California Building,
           Plumbing, Mechanical, Fire and Electrical Codes. These Codes establish construction
           standards for all residential buildings. Enforcement of building code standards does not
           constrain the production or improvement of housing in Murrieta, but instead serves to
           maintain the safety and condition of the City’s neighborhoods.
   6.1.8 - On- and Off-Site Improvements
           Development in Murrieta requires site improvements that vary by size and location.
           These improvements may include, but are not limited to, reservation of sites for public
           parks and trails, landscaping, irrigation, exterior lighting, storm water drainage, streets
           and roads and vehicle and pedestrian access including curb cuts. Site improvements are
           required to ensure that there is adequate structure and access to a site. Site
           improvements also help in making the project more compatible with surrounding
           neighborhoods.
           On- and off-site improvements are generally provided directly by developers when
           building a new subdivision and are regulated by the Subdivision Ordinance (Title 16) of
           the Municipal Code. Specifically, Chapter 16.108 specifies the improvement requirements
           to be performed and fees to be collected prior to approval of the final map. Typical
           requirements include:
                   City standard street widths (curb-to-curb): Private Residential Road – 36-40
                    feet; Local Street – 40 feet; Collector Street – 44 feet; Secondary Street – 64 feet;
                    Major Arterial– 86 feet.
                   Streetlights and street trees
                   Drainage and water system facilities
                   Traffic Signals
           Private residential roads and local street classification are the typical requirement for
           housing development in the City. Most of the City’s on- and off-site improvements are
           provided through the payment of fees, which have been accounted for under
           development fees. Outside of subdivision development, new development under
66                                                                        2008-2014 Housing Element

                                                                            6 – Housing Constraints Analysis
                established zones pays its prorated share for on/off-site improvements, if found to be
                required, as a part of the standard fee schedule.
                The City recognizes that improvements can create barriers to the development of
                affordable housing. When possible, the City has indicated that they will use
                redevelopment set-aside funds, grant money or other available funding, when available,
                to offset the cost of on- and off-site improvements in order to assist affordable housing
                developers in the production of units. In the recent development of the Monte Vista
                Apartments, the City was able to complete the street, curb, gutter and sidewalk
                upgrades required to complete the complex. In completing the required improvements
                for Monte Vista, the City contributed $250,000 toward the development of the project.
                Additionally, through its density bonus ordinance (Action 3.1 of the Housing Plan) the
                City will continue to provide incentives, such as assistance with on- and off-site
                improvements whenever possible.
        6.1.9 - Fees and Exactions
                The City and other agencies charge various fees to cover the cost of processing
                development permits and providing local services. These fees help ensure quality
                development and the provision of adequate public services. In addition, developer fees
                and exactions imposed on new development can help to minimize impacts on existing
                infrastructure and enable required upgrades of infrastructure consistent with demands
                of the new development. State law requires that these fees be reasonably related to the
                mitigation of the identified impact, and that they be proportionate to the extent of
                impact associated with any given development project. These development fees are
                typically passed on to renters and homeowners in the cost of housing, and thus affect
                housing affordability.
                The City’s Planning Department fees Schedule are outlined in Table 6-4. City fees are
                comparable to other local jurisdictions such as the City of Temecula and the County of
                Riverside.

   6.1.9.A - Development Fees for Residential Projects
                            In addition to the fees identified in the fee schedule, the City is able to anticipate
                            on average the typical fees that will be charged for a single-family home and a
                            multifamily unit. Table 6-5 provides the average per unit fees that are charged by
                            the City for new residential development. Of the fees a developer will incur these
                            fees will vary depending on the jurisdiction.

                    TOTAL                                        $4,500                   $528
                       On average for a single-family unit a developer will pay $4,500 in plan check fees
                       to complete the necessary plan checks and inspections required by the City. In
                       comparison a developer will pay on average $528 per unit for a multifamily unit.
                       The cost for each multifamily unit was calculated for a 200 unit project. For the
                       entire multifamily residential project, a developer would pay approximately
                       $105,600 in fees. In comparison to other jurisdictions in the surrounding area,
                       such as Temecula, the City’s fees are slightly higher; however, the City has
                       provided other financial resources to help offset any additional fees that maybe
                       be charged. For example, the City has historically purchased land and essentially
                       donated it to affordable housing developers, which is often a more significant
                       cost (and barrier) to the development of affordable units.
    6.1.9.B -   City-based Development Impact Fees
                       Once a project has completed the plan check phase, the City will assess
                       development impact fees that are typically paid when the applicant applies for
                       development permits. Development Impact Fees are charged to offset the cost of
                       installing necessary facilities and infrastructure to serve the needs of new
                       development. A discussion of the anticipated fees will, however, usually occur in
                       the planning process. The City of Murrieta’s Development Impact Fees are
                       allocated to law enforcement, fire suppression, streets and bridges, traffic
                       signals, freeway access, storm drainage, general government, public libraries and
                       meeting spaces, aquatics facilities, park lands and park facilities, and the
                       purchase of public open space. Impact fees are another source of expense to
                       developers and can act as a constraint to the supply of affordable housing. Table
                       6-6, provides the average fee charged for public services for both a single-family
                       and multifamily unit.

                    In comparison to other jurisdictions in the surrounding area, such as Temecula,
                    the City’s fees are comparable for both single-family and multifamily units.
                    While these fees should not constrain development, the City does attempt to
                    assist affordable housing developments by completing infrastructure
                    improvements when funds are available. The types of improvements, the City
                    can or has assisted with historically include parks, open space acquisition,
                    streets, signals and storm drainage.
   6.1.9.C - Countywide Development Fees
                    In addition to the fees shown above, Table 6-7 provides additional development
                    impact fees that are not controlled by the City, but may apply to development.
                    These fees include:
                              the Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Program
                             (MSHCP), which is a criteria-driven Habitat Conservation Plan
                             intended to create a network of permanent open space;
                             Transportation Uniform Mitigation Fee (TUMF) fees, intended to fund
                             the mitigation of cumulative regional transportation impacts resulting
                             from future development;
                             Stevens Kangaroo Rat Mitigation Fees, to replace and preserve habitat
                             for the species that may be affected by new development;
                             School Impact Fees, which are determined by district to maintain
                             healthy schools throughout the County; and
                             Area Wide Drainage Fees, which were established to maintain and
                             upgrade the City’s drainage system as new development occurs.

      Source: City of Murrieta Mitigation Fee Schedule 2007
                                  The fees identified in Table 6-7 were not established by the City of Murrieta, but
                                  rather, for example, by the Riverside County Board of Supervisors or the school
                                  district. The City does not have the authority to waive or modified these fees;
                                  however, these fees are often examined and/or waived for affordable housing
                                  developments. For example, TUMP fees are not applied to affordable housing
                                  complexes and kangaroo rat fees are reduced for multifamily developments.
                                  These fees should not be viewed as a constraint because they are required for all
                                  new development and are often not applied to affordable development. In
                                  addition, as mentioned previously, the City does attempt to help lower
                                  development cost by assisting with infrastructure improvements and by
                                  purchasing land.
        6.1.10 -            Processing and Permit Procedures
                            Development review and permit processing are necessary steps to ensure that
                            residential construction proceeds in an orderly manner. However, the time and cost
                            of permit processing and review can be a constraint to housing development if the
                            agency does not complete its review in a timely manner or otherwise delays the start
                            of construction. In general the City’s processing times are consistent with the time
                            frames for processing applications in nearby Temecula and Riverside County. The
                            City understands that a lengthy processing time frame can increase design, financing
                            and other costs, which, in turn, impact the final price of housing. Consequently, the
                            City has worked to improve their permitting process by providing public counter
                            services Monday through Friday in addition to establishing a streamlined permit
                            processing system. The reduction in processing time results in a shorter holding
                            time for the developer, which translates to cost savings that should be reflected in
                            the prices or rents for the residential units. The City will continue to assess policies,
                            procedures, and fees to remove unnecessary delays or expenses to projects that may
                            help to lower housing costs.
City of Murrieta                                                                                                                     71

   6.1.10.A - Permit Processing for Single-Family Construction
                    The permitting approval process for a residential project depends on the number
                    of units requested by the applicant. If a property owner applies for permits to
                    construct a Single-Family home the permitting process on average takes two to
                    eight weeks. Once the applicant submits their plans and plan check fees the
                    planning department begins their review for completeness. The more
                    information an applicant provides and the quicker they correct any revisions on
                    their plans, the shorter the permit processing time.
   6.1.10.B - Permit Processing for Multifamily Construction
                    For a multifamily residential project the permitting procedure can be more
                    complex and consequently can result in longer and more variable processing
                    times. The City currently has two different processes for multifamily
                    developments; one for projects with four or fewer units and another for projects
                    with four or more. For projects with four or fewer units the plans are approved
                    through a process known as Administrative Development Plan Review. Once the
                    applicant submits their application and plans, an appointment it scheduled with
                    the City’s Development Review Committee (DRC) which is composed of City
                    Staff. The DRC reviews the plans for completeness as well as assessing
                    comments made by the various other City departments including, fire, public
                    works and building. Once the plans have been approved by the DRC the City
                    notifies the applicant that the project will be approved by the Planning Director.
                    The Administrative Development Review Process typically takes between 8 to 12
                    weeks however the processing time is often dependent on how efficient the
                    applicant is at revising and resubmitting plans if corrections are required.
                    For a multifamily development with four or more units the development review
                    process requires approval by the Planning Commission. Upon submitting an
                    application and development plans, the project is reviewed by the DRC initially
                    for completeness and then to determine if any conditions of approval including
                    required improvements are necessary to complete the project. Conditions of
                    approval typically protect the health, safety and welfare of the public and ensure
                    a project’s consistency with established architectural design guidelines. Upon
                    completing their review the DRC’s conditions of approval are sent to the
                    applicant. At the applicant’s request a meeting can be scheduled to discuss the
                    conditions of approval if necessary. If the applicant understands and accepts the
                    DRC’s findings and conditions the project is sent as a public hearing item before
                    the Planning Commission. Findings and conditions do not exceed the limits and
                    requirements of the State law. Any finding or conditions are provided primarily
                    to ensure that the project is consistent with the City’s General Plan, the Zoning
                    Code and Health and Safety codes, Typical findings for a multifamily housing
                    project includes analysis of street improvements, fire suppression, and water
                    quality. In most cases a project would then be approved by the Planning
                    Commission and permits would be issued soon after. The processing time for a
                    multifamily development with four or more units typically takes between 14 to
                    18 weeks. Similar to the process for the projects with four or fewer units, the
                    processing time is often dependent on how efficient the applicant is at revising
                    and resubmitting plans if corrections are required.

City of Murrieta                       73

      6.1.11 - Variance
               In some instances, a property owner or applicant may apply for a variance allowing for
               reduced set backs, increased building height or a reduction in other development
               standards. The purpose of the variance is to provide a discretionary permit process that
               allows for deviations from applicable standards of the Zoning Code, provided very
               specific findings can be made pursuant to State law. The Planning Commission may
               approve or deny the variance based on the determination that there are compelling
               physical constraints which affect the ability of the property to meet the zoning
               requirements. The decision of the Planning Commission is final unless appealed to the
               City Council. The variance procedure does not burden housing development because the
               City’s discretion in granting variances is tied to the limitations established by State law.
               A variance may take four to eight weeks for review, and an additional four weeks if
               appealed to City Council
6.2 - Housing for Disabled Persons
      State law requires localities to analyze potential and actual constraints upon housing for persons
      with disabilities, demonstrate efforts to remove governmental constraints, and include programs
      to accommodate housing designed for people with disabilities. The City has no special zoning or
      land use restrictions including minimum distance requirements that regulate the location of
      housing for persons with disabilities. There are no requirements, standards or regulations that
      present constraints to the development of housing for disabled individuals. The City has
      adopted “Universal Design” standards for new residential construction, which provides for the
      features intended to assist disabled or frail persons in remaining in their own homes. These
      regulations require 15% of all units to have universal design features, such as first floor
      accessibility and cooking facilities, and wider door and hallways.
      In accordance with State law, Murrieta permits State-licensed residential care facilities serving
      six or fewer persons in all of its residential zoning districts. Residential care facilities serving
      seven or more persons are a conditional use in all residential zoning districts. To accommodate
      disabled persons in public facilities, the City defers to Title 24 of the California Handicap
      Accessibility Code.
      The City’s housing rehabilitation programs are designed to meet the needs of persons with
      disabilities who may require wheelchair ramps, wider doors, grab bars, and lower counter tops.
      These types of improvements are eligible under the City’s housing rehabilitation loan programs.
      6.2.1 - Americans with Disabilities Act
               Building codes require that new residential construction and rehabilitation construction
               comply with the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). ADA provisions
               include requirements for a minimum percentage of units in new development to be fully
               accessible to the physically disabled. Unlike the Uniform Building Code, enforcement of
               ADA requirements is not at the discretion of the City, but is mandated under Federal
               law. Compliance with building codes and ADA increases the cost of housing production,
               and can potentially delay the rehabilitation of older properties required to be brought up
               to current standards. However, these regulations provide minimum standards that must
               be complied with in order to ensure the development of safe and accessible housing.

                                                                              6 – Housing Constraints Analysis
        6.2.2 - Reasonable Accommodation
                The Fair Housing Act requires that cities and counties provide reasonable
                accommodation to rules, policies, practices, and procedures where such accommodation
                may be necessary to afford individuals with disabilities equal opportunity to housing.
                The City’s Senior Residential Overlay Zoning District and Universal Design
                requirements help facilitate reasonable accommodation by creating a process for making
                requests for reasonable accommodation to land use and zoning decisions and procedures
                regulating site locations, funding, development and use of housing for the elderly with
                disabilities. Within Action 4.1 of the Housing Plan, the City has established a reasonable
                accommodation program to assist persons with a disability and will provide information
                for residents at City Hall and the City website.
6.3 - Non-Governmental Constraints
        The production and availability of housing may be constrained both by government regulations
        and by non-governmental factors, such as natural hazards, construction costs, global climate
        change and interest rates on home mortgages.
        6.3.1 - Natural Hazards
                Natural hazards include geologic and seismic conditions that provide the greatest threat
                to the built environment. The City has identified areas where land development should
                be carefully controlled. The following hazards may impact future development of
                residential units in the City.
    6.3.1.A - Seismic Hazards
                     Two active faults are located within the City of Murrieta. The Elsinore Fault passes
                     through the City to the west of Interstate 15 and the Wildomar Fault runs
                     northwest/southeast through the City west of Interstate 15. Portions of these areas,
                     especially along the Wildomar Fault, are subject to liquefaction. Liquefaction occurs
                     when a mass of soil collapses from a sudden loss of cohesion due to an earth tremor
                     or to a sudden increase in groundwater from an external source. The greatest
                     potential danger due to earthquakes and liquefaction is the collapse of older
                     residential units constructed from un-reinforced building materials.
                     The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act of 1972 is used in California to
                     prevent the construction of buildings used for human occupancy on the surface trace
                     of active faults. The Act prohibits new construction of houses within these zones
                     unless a comprehensive geologic investigation shows that the fault does not pose a
                     hazard to the proposed structure. Areas along the Wildomar Fault are within a
                     “Special Studies Zone” as designated under the Act, which would affect housing
                     production.
    6.3.1.B -   Flood Hazards
                     Many areas of the City are within the 100-year flood zones, and there has been a
                     history of severe flooding associated with overflow from Murrieta Creek and its
                     tributaries. The flood zones in the City are primarily located between Jefferson
                     Avenue and Hayes Avenue along Murrieta Creek and portions of Warm Springs
City of Murrieta                                                                                      75

                  Creek. Portions of the City are subject to potential dam inundation zones associated
                  with Lake Skinner and Diamond Valley Lake.
   6.3.1.C - Wild Fires
                  Undeveloped hillside areas in and adjacent to the City can present a serious hazard
                  due to the potential for large-scale wild fires. The threat is particularly significant
                  during dry summer months and when there are strong “Santa Ana” winds. To
                  mitigate the threat of wild fires, the Murrieta Fire Department, along with the
                  California Department of Forestry, has initiated special response protocols to
                  prevent and combat wild fires.
   6.3.1.D - Hazardous Waste
                  Murrieta has a number of businesses that use hazardous materials or generate
                  hazardous waste. There are also a numbers of sites in the City which have
                  contamination associated with underground tanks used to store petroleum
                  products. These sites are located in commercial and industrial zones. The City does
                  not consider hazardous waste an overwhelming concern or constraint to the
                  development of housing.
      6.3.2 - Infrastructure Constraints
              Site improvements and property dedications are important components of new
              development and contribute to the creation of decent and affordable housing. Residential
              development in Perris requires site improvements that vary by size and location. These
              improvements may include, but are not limited to:
                     Separate and adequate distribution lines for domestic water supply
                     Sewage collecting system where main lines of an adequate disposal system are
                      available
                     Adequate grading and surfacing of streets, highways, and alleys
                     Concrete curbs and gutters
                     Concrete sidewalks
                     Fire hydrants at locations designated by the City engineer and Fire Department
                     Traffic control devices
                     Necessary barricades and safety devices
                     Utility facilities including, but not limited to, wires, cables and ducts for
                      distributing electricity, communication, and cable television
                     Fees for, or dedication of, parks and recreation facilities
                     Roadway widening
                     Street lighting
                     Median islands
                  Site improvements are required to ensure that there is adequate infrastructure for
                  and access to a site. Site improvements also help in making the project more
                  compatible with surrounding neighborhoods; however, these site improvements can
                  act as a constraint on the development of housing due to the significant commitment
                  in cost for the developer, which in turn this cost is carried over into the purchase
                  price of the home by the developer. To encourage the development of affordable
                  housing many of these requirements and dedications can be waived by the City to
                  help mitigate cost impacts. The City has also historically completed road, curb and

                 sewer improvements to allow an affordable housing developer to more easily
                 development their project. In addition, Murrieta also attempts to offset the overall
                 cost of development by purchasing land and donating it for an affordable housing
                 project, which is typically a significant cost barrier when combined with
                 infrastructure and construction costs.          A brief summary of the principal
                 infrastructure systems serving the City follows:
    6.3.2.A - Water
                 Water is supplied to the City by the four water districts: Western Municipal Water
                 District, Eastern Municipal Water District, Rancho California Water District, and
                 Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District. Each district determines residential water
                 backup charges, which are assessed on a sliding scale, according to zone. A water
                 deposit and water meter fees are charged upon application for a residential building
                 permit. It is difficult to anticipate the fees associated with water infrastructure as
                 the cost varies greatly depending on the size of the project and the location of the
                 site in the City. Table 6.8 illustrates the fees for each of the four districts. The
                 availability of water in Murrieta is largely reflective of the resources available in the
                 region as a whole including western Riverside County. The City is currently
                 evaluating its available water resources as part of the General Plan update and will
                 likely establish mitigation measures to ensure that adequate water is available for
                 existing and future development.

                                                                                      6 – Housing Constraints Analysis
       6.3.2.B - Sewer
                           The City’s sewer system is maintained by the above mentioned water districts. The
                           City has identified that there is existing sewer capacity to accommodate the
                           development of residential units as allocated by the 2008-2014 RHNA. Recently, the
                           Western Municipal Water District has initiated the removal of septic tanks and
                           installed a new sewer system in Historic Downtown Murrieta.
       6.3.2.C - Flood Control
                           The City of Murrieta is divided into four drainage areas: Murrieta Valley; Temecula
                           Valley; Santa Gertrudis Valley; and Warm Springs Valley. A drainage fee is
                           determined by the size of the development based on acreage and which drainage area
                           the development is located in. Fee amounts were shown previously in Table 6-7.
                           The drainage fee is paid prior to final map approval, or if associated with a
                           development plan, prior to the issuance of a building permit.
           6.3.3 - Construction Costs
                      Construction costs are the total costs to developers exclusive of profit, but including
                      fees, materials, labor and financing. Construction costs for housing can vary
                      significantly, depending on the type of housing, such as single-family detached homes,
                      townhomes, and multiple-family apartments. However, even within a particular
                      building type, construction costs vary by unit size and amenities. Furthermore,
                      neighborhood resistance to some developments lengthens development time, driving up
                      the holding costs. The difficulty of developing awkward infill sites can also add to costs.
                      The permitted residential uses within the RR, ER, and SF residential zoning districts are
                      primarily low-density single-family detached units. Development Plan approval for
                      higher density development may also add to costs.
                      The cost of labor is based on a number of factors, including housing demand, the number
                      of contractors in an area and the unionization of workers, but it is generally two to three
                      times the cost of materials. Thus, the cost of labor represents an estimated 17% to 20% of
                      the cost of building a unit, which is a substantial portion of the overall cost of
                      construction.20
                      In the State of California, all projects utilizing public funds must pay prevailing wages to
                      all workers employed on the project. This includes any residential or commercial project
                      that is funded federal funds or assisted residential projects controlled or carried out by
                      an awarding body. The prevailing wage rate is the basic hourly rate paid on publicly
                      funded projects to a majority of workers engaged in a particular craft, classification, or
                      type of work within the locality and in the nearest labor market area.
                      Twice a year, prevailing wage rates are determined by the director of the California
                      Department of Industrial Relations. A prevailing wage ensures that the ability to get a
                      publicly funded contract is not based on paying lower wage rates than a competitor, and
                      requires that all bidders use the same wage rates when bidding on a publicly funded

                      Prevailing wages may constrain construction of affordable housing because they are
                      often higher than normal wages.21
       6.3.3.A - International Code Council
                            Residential construction cost estimates established by the International Code
                            Council (ICC) in summer 2008 indicate average costs of labor and materials between
                            $89.32 and $123.28 per square foot for multifamily residential depending on the type
                            of construction.22 Single-family residential costs range between $96.83 and $123.28
                            per square foot, depending on the type of construction. Construction costs may
                            vary based on the type of material used, location of development, structural features
                            present, and other factors.
                            The data indicates that construction costs in the Murrieta vicinity can constitute
                            approximately 40% of the cost of a single-family detached housing unit. These
                            figures are even more noteworthy considering that the cost of raw land constitutes
                            only four to 14% of the cost of a housing unit. Typically, in the private sector market,
                            the development of residential units is a business and investment venture. Therefore,
                            developers seek the greatest return for their investment. As with most businesses, a
                            constraining factor in the area of profitability continues to be the market place
                            where developers sell their products. To a great extent, the market place sets the
                            upper end of the profit margin with overhead costs for construction constituting the
                            lower parameter of profit.
                            The construction cost of housing affects the affordability of new housing and can be
                            a constraint to the creation of affordable housing in the City and greater Riverside
                            County region. Particularly with the tightening of mortgage lending standards and
                            increases in current rates, homebuilders may be slowing down on the construction of
                            new homes, which could potentially effect the provision of affordable housing. A
                            reduction in construction costs can be brought about in several ways. One such
                            method involves a reduction in amenities and quality of building materials in new
                            homes (still above the minimum acceptability for health, safety and adequate
                            performance), which may result in lower sales prices. State Housing Law provides
                            that local building departments can authorize the use of materials and construction
                            methods if the proposed design is found to be satisfactory and the materials or
                            methods are at least equivalent to that prescribed by the applicable State building
                            codes.
            6.3.4 - Land Costs
                      Residential land prices contribute significantly to the cost of new housing. Location
                      factors such as proper zoning, proximity to freeway access, public facilities, and
                      intangible factors such as image and quality of life contribute to the demand and price of
                      land. As fewer parcels become available for new development, the price for land
                      increases.

                                                                                     6 – Housing Constraints Analysis
                      Due to the current economic downtown there is variation in land prices throughout the
                      region. In general, land prices in Riverside County are more affordable than the Los
                      Angeles, Orange, and San Diego markets; in fact, the lack of inexpensive residential land
                      in Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego Counties was a major impetus for the
                      development of the Inland Empire, including Murrieta. Land prices along with home
                      prices in Murrieta have become more affordable; however property acquisition remains
                      one of the largest barriers to affordable housing development. Land cost may vary
                      depending on whether the site is vacant or has an existing use that must be removed.
                      Similarly, site constraints such as environmental issues (e.g. steep slopes, soil stability,
                      seismic hazards or flooding) can also be factored into the cost of land.
                      While the City can not control or influence the cost of land, Staff has indentified in the
                      Housing Plan that the City will purchase properties in order to facilitate the
                      development of affordable housing. The City has spent $4.8 million on two properties
                      totally 8 acres that are intended for the development of affordable housing. A developer
                      has already been identified for one of the parcels while the other will be developed in the
                      near future. The City will continue to identify and purchase properties when funding is
                      available to further reduce land cost as a barrier to the development of affordable
                      housing.
           6.3.5 - Financing
                      The availability of financing affects a resident’s ability to purchase or improve a home
                      and the cost of borrowing money for residential development is incorporated directly
                      into the sales price or rent. Interest rates are determined by national policies and
                      economic conditions and there is very little a local government can do to affect these
                      rates. In June 2009, the posted interest rate on resale single-family homes was 5.34% on
                      a 30-year fixed-rate loan with a 20% down payment.23
                      First-time homebuyers tend to be the group most directly impacted by financing
                      requirements. Mortgage interest rates for new home purchases ranged from 5% to 7%
                      for a fixed rate 30-year loan in 2008/2009. Lower initial rates may be available with
                      Graduated Payment Mortgages (GPM), Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARM), and Buy-
                      Down Mortgages.24 However, variable interest rate mortgages on affordable homes may
                      increase to the point that interest rates exceed the cost of living adjustments, which is a
                      constraint on affordability. Although interest rates are currently low, they can change
                      significantly and substantially impact the affordability of the housing stock. Given the
                      economic downturn interest rates have been lowered but fewer first-time homebuyers
                      are being approved for 30 year mortgages.
                      Interest rates in 2008-2009 are not a direct constraint to affordable housing; however
                      higher interest rates could pose a constraint to affordable housing. A change by one
                      percentage point can make a monthly payment out of reach for many lower income
                      households. Financing for long term mortgages is generally available in Murrieta, subject
                      to normal underwriting standards.

                      A more critical impediment to homeownership involves both the affordability of the
                      housing stock and the ability of potential buyers to fulfill down payment requirements.
                      Typically, conventional home loans will require 80% loan-to-value and represents the
                      largest constraint to homebuyers. Other programs, such as those for first-time
                      homebuyers, can find down payment requirements between 5% and 20%. Also, the
                      availability of financing for developers poses a constraint on development outside of the
                      City's control.
                      The greatest impediment to home ownership, however, is credit worthiness. According
                      to the Federal Housing Authority, lenders consider a person’s debt-to-income ratio, cash
                      available for down-payment, and credit history, when determining a maximum loan
                      amount. Many financial institutions are willing to significantly decrease down-payment
                      requirements and increase loan amounts to persons with good credit rating.
                      Persons with poor credit ratings may be forced to accept a higher interest rate or a loan
                      amount insufficient to purchase a house. Poor credit rating can be especially damaging
                      to lower-income residents, who have fewer financial resources with which to qualify for
                      a loan. The FHA is generally more flexible than conventional lenders in its qualifying
                      guidelines and allows many residents to re-establish a good credit history.
                      Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions must disclose
                      information on the disposition of loan applications by the income, gender, and race of the
                      applicants. This applies to all loan applications for home purchases and improvements,
                      whether financed at market rate or through government assistance. HMDA data can be
                      used to evaluate lender compliance with anti-discrimination laws and other consumer
                      protection laws. The anti-discrimination laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act
                      (ECOA) and the Fair Housing Act (FHA). These laws prohibit discrimination in home
                      mortgage lending, among other things, on several bases such as race, national origin, sex,
                      and age.
                      Table 6-9 presents the outcome of home purchase loan applications in 2007 by income of
                      the applicants from HMDA data. The data is the most recent data for the Riverside-San
                      Bernardino-Ontario Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and for the purchase of single-
                      family, duplexes, and manufactured homes. Over 80% of the loan applications were
                      received from above moderate-income households (earning greater than 120% of the
                      AMI). Moderate-income households (80% to 120% of the AMI) and lower-income
                      households (less than 80% of the Riverside AMI) accounted for approximately 12% and
                      4%, respectively.25 The average loan origination rate was 46% and this rate was
                      significantly lower for lower income households earning below 80% AMI. These rates
                      can be expected to contract further as a recent national survey conducted by the Federal
                      Reserve found that more than half of banks responding reported they had tightened their
                      lending standards for sub-prime mortgages.

   Please note that there is a slight margin of error in the percentage calculations because the sum of the total applications for each income
category does not equal the actual total count.

          6.3.6 - Home Purchase Costs
                      Another constraint that affects the ability of a person, family, or household to purchase a
                      home is the cost of the house itself and the costs that are associated with the purchase. In
                      June 2009, the median sales price of a home was reported to be $237,780.26 While this
                      price is moderate for the southern California region, it often exceeds what is considered
                      affordable to the homebuyer. Other factors in home purchasing can constrain a buyer’s
                      ability to qualify for a buyer’s loan such as high escrow costs, mortgage processing, title
                      acquisition, realtor fees, etc. Factors such as homeowner associations, increased tax bills
                      due to special assessment districts, and Mello-Roos districts also affect a potential
                      homebuyer’s ability to qualify for a loan.

7. Housing Resources
                                                                                                                          Section 7
   This section summarizes the land, financial, and administrative resources available for the development
   and preservation of housing in Murrieta. The analysis provided includes an evaluation of the availability
   of land resources for future housing development; the City’s ability to satisfy its share of the region’s
   future housing needs, the financial resources available to support housing activities, and the
   administrative resources available to assist in implementing the City’s housing programs and policies.
   7.1 - Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA)
           Murrieta’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) for the 2008-2014 planning period has
           been determined by SCAG to be 6,303 housing units, including 1,568 units for very low-income
           households, 1,067 units for low-income households, 1,171 units for moderate-income households,
           and 2,497 units for above moderate-income households.
           7.1.1 - Progress toward the RHNA
                      For the Housing Element planning period of 2008-2014, January 1, 2006 is identified as
                      the baseline for growth projections. Consequently, a jurisdiction may count newly
                      constructed residential units or approved building permits for housing since January 1,
                      2006 toward its current RHNA obligation. Within the City of Murrieta, 2,588 housing
                      units have been constructed or approved since January 2006. Table 7-1 indicates the
                      number of new units that fall within each income category. It is important to note that
                      the income categories have been determined based on the AMI and definitions from
                      HUD for each income level, while the affordability of the unit is based on the sales or
                      rental price of the complex or unit.
                                                                   Table 7-1:

           Note: AB 2634 mandates that localities calculate the subset of the very low-income regional need that constitutes the communities
           need for extremely low-income housing. As an alternative to calculating the subset, local jurisdictions may assume that 50 percent of
           the very low-income category (629 units) is represented by households of extremely low-income (less than 30 percent of the AMI).
   City of Murrieta                                                                                                                              85

7.2 - Projects Credited towards the RHNA Allocation
      Of the 2,588 units approved or constructed in the City, there are three specific projects that have
      been approved for development of multifamily units. These three multifamily projects will
      ultimately result in the addition of 976 multifamily units in the City, providing crucial housing
      opportunities for the residents of Murrieta. It is unlikely that these projects will be deed
      restricted; however, each offers a variety of housing opportunities that may be able to
      accommodate both moderate and above moderate-income families. The three approved projects
      are:
           1.  Plaza de Murrieta Specific Plan yielding 330 units on a 52 acre site (average density of 8.7
               du/ac);
           2. Creekside Village Specific Plan yielding 246 units on 10.14 acres (approximately 25
               du/ac);
           3. Adessa Landing yielding 400 units on 24.2 acres of land (average density of 17 du/ac).
      7.2.1 - Plaza de Murrieta Specific Plan
               The Plaza de Murrieta Specific Plan area is a comprehensive planned community
               intended to provide housing, recreational and commercial/retail uses within five (5)
               Planning Areas. The Plaza de Murrieta Specific Plan occupies 52.25 acres (46.5 net
               acres) on the east side of Jefferson Avenue, west of Interstate 15, and north of Lemon
               Street in the City of Murrieta. The Specific Plan has five planning areas. The planning
               areas include: 100 single-family homes to be built on about 18 acres, with an average of
               5.54 units per acre; 140 two-story townhouses across 14 acres with an average of 10 units
               per acre; approximately 90 three-story townhouses/live-work units on 6 acres with an
               average density of 15 units per acre, an 80,600-square-foot complex of shops, restaurants
               and neighborhood services on 7.66 acres and 3.8 acres of open space to be preserved. The
               total number of proposed residential units includes up to three hundred thirty (330)
               units. At this time deed restrictions or covenants have not been established and the
               project has been credited toward the City’s above moderate RHNA allocation.
      7.2.2 - Creekside Village Specific Plan
               Creekside Village Specific Plan is a planned residential community located in the
               southeastern section of the City. The Specific Plan was designed to include five
               neighborhoods interconnected by 30 ft. wide greenways running along the collector
               streets. These greenways culminate in a Village Green with an amphitheater, which in
               turn connects to an elementary school. The school district recently discovered that the
               elementary school site is no longer needed as a public facility site and will instead
               accommodate 246 units on 10.14 acres of land yielding a density of approximately 25
               dwelling units per acre at 80 percent capacity. At this time deed restrictions or
               covenants have not been established and the project has also been credited toward the
               City’s above moderate RHNA allocation.
      7.2.3 - Adessa Landing
               Located along the east side of Interstate-215, the Adessa Landing project site includes
               approximately 37.6 acres in the northern quadrant of the City. The project area is

                                                                                      7- Housing Resources
                 currently surrounded by Single-Family residential development, Vista Murrieta High
                 School and the future Loma Linda University Medical Center Murrieta. The site is
                 currently vacant with 28.4 acres zoned Community Commercial and 10.1 acres zoned for
                 residential uses. Upon rezoning the entire site will be zoned Multi-Family 2. The
                 Murrieta City Council recently approved a workforce housing project on the site with
                 approximately 400 units developed on 24.2 acres at an average density of about 17 units
                 per acre. The remaining 13.4 acres will be preserved as open space and utilized for street
                 improvements. It is anticipated that this housing will be affordable to a mix of low,
                 moderate and above moderate-income residents.
        7.2.4 - Remaining RHNA
                 The City has a considerable portion of its RHNA remaining after credits are applied for
                 units approved or constructed since January 1, 2006. With these credits the City has a
                 remaining RHNA of 3,002 housing units, which includes 1,568 units for very low-income
                 households, 1,063 units for low-income households, and 371 units for above moderate-
                 income households. The following section will address potential sites to accommodate
                 the remaining housing need.
7.3 - Zoning Appropriate to Accommodate Lower Income Housing
        Density is a critical factor in the development of affordable housing. In theory, maintaining low
        densities typically increases the cost of construction per unit, while higher density development
        lowers the per-unit land cost and facilitates construction in an economy of scale. In addition to
        potential for density bonus provisions, more intense residential development is achieved through
        a number of mechanisms, including clustering of residential development, and zero lot line
        development, subject to City development standards. Clustering of housing can produce higher
        densities on a portion of land while creating space for amenities, and retaining the overall density
        assignment of the entire property. This method is effective when portions of the property not
        utilized for residential development can be developed with compatible uses, such as open
        space/recreation, parks, schools, public facilities, and support commercial. The City's High-
        Density Residential designation (15-18 du/ac) provides the best opportunity for the development
        of affordable housing.
        The State Housing and Community Development Department (HCD) have deemed affordability
        as correlated with density. Consequently, HCD has established “default densities” that by
        definition are considered sufficient to provide market-based incentives for the development of
        housing for lower-income households. For jurisdictions with a population greater than 25,000,
        and located within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) with a population of more than 2
        million, the default density is 30 dwelling units per acre (or higher). Murrieta has a population
        greater than 25,000 and is within the Riverside MSA. Thus, HCD has determined that
        Murrieta’s default density is 30 dwelling units per acre. However, the City’s Zoning Code does
        not currently allow for the default density of at least 30 dwelling units per acre. Consequently,
        the City’s affordability analysis must demonstrate that the identified zone/densities encourage
        and facilitate the development of housing for lower-income households by considering: (1)
        market demand and trends, (2) financial feasibility, and (3) information based on residential
        project experience within a zone(s) where the densities facilitated the development of housing
        for lower-income households.
        A number of lower income housing developments have been constructed in the City since the
        year 2000. Affordable units have been created in the following three zones: Multi-Family 2 (MF-
        2), Multiple Use-3 (MU-3), and specific plan areas. It is important to note that many of the
City of Murrieta                                                                                        87

   projects with affordable units have utilized the City’s density bonus incentives. The majority of
   the affordable units constructed in the City are zoned MF-2, which allows for a density of up to
   15-18 dwelling units per acre. A total of three (3) projects with 1,046 moderate-income units have
   been created at this density. The MF-2 zone is valuable in that it allows developers to provide
   units that are affordable to moderate-income households without requiring them to establish
   deed restrictions which can be a barrier for some developers. The MU-3 zone which allows up to
   18 dwelling units has also facilitated the creation of affordable housing. Four complexes with a
   total of 118 affordable units with deed restrictions and 770 non deed restricted units have been
   constructed in the MU-3 zone. In addition to the MU-3 and MF-2 zones, specific plan areas (SP)
   have also allowed for the development of affordable units. In the Historic Murrieta Specific Plan
   as well as the Murrieta Highlands Specific Plan, 13 deed restricted units and 183 unrestricted
   units have been constructed. Table 7-2 provides information about the affordable housing
   developments in the City that have been constructed since the year 2000.
   The City of Murrieta, like many jurisdictions in western Riverside County, is in a unique
   situation to be able to provide affordable units in developments that are below the default
   densities established by the State. The cost of land, materials and development has always been
   lower than other counties such as Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego. This, in turn, has resulted
   in a lower median home price that is typically affordable to low and moderate income families.
   The City has formed a strong partnership with Affirmed Housing Group (AHG). AHG was
   established in 1994, and develops and owns affordable apartment communities throughout
   California. Their current portfolio includes 23 apartment communities with over 2,200 units,
   and they currently have more than 600 new units in the development pipeline. In 2005, AHG
   completed the Monte Vista Apartments which includes 64 affordable units and is located on
   Jefferson Avenue in Murrieta. Over the past two years they have been actively pursuing
   development of a second affordable housing project in Murrieta.
   For their second affordable housing project, AHG analyzed multiple sites in Downtown
   Murrieta, in the general vicinity of Jefferson and Juniper, ranging in size from 2 – 6 acres. The
   letter and proforma provided in Appendix B illustrates a potential development recently
   analyzed by AHG. Based on current property values, AHG states that projects can be
   underwritten at Murrieta’s current multifamily zoning (MF-2) density standard of 18 dwelling
   units per acre, and do not necessarily require the 1.35 density bonus allowable by SB1818 to be
   financially viable.
   To the extent property values do not increase significantly, AHG also states that the City’s
   existing maximum density of 18 DU/acre will continue to be sufficient to allow for development
   of affordable apartments, and the available 1.35 density bonus will extend the viability of this
   density restriction even with moderate increases in property acquisition costs. Significant
   increases in property costs will likely require an increase in per-unit contribution by the City.
   For developments on City owned property, affordable developments will remain viable at an
   18DU/acre density.
   Please see Appendix B for the affordable housing density feasibility letter from Affirmed Housing
   Group and their proforma recently completed for a 36 unit proposed development on 2.02 acres
   affordable to extremely low-, very low- and low-income households.
   In the last decade, City Staff has recognized that facilitating higher density developments can
   benefit both the housing developer and low income families if units are constructed.
   Consequently, Staff began to encourage developers by offering incentives, in an effort to assist in
   the development of higher density projects. Staff’s efforts were resisted however; as developers

                                                                                                         7- Housing Resources
                  expressed that the existing densities (up to 18 units per acre in the MF-2 and MU-3 zones) are
                  conditions that are not only feasible, but economically favorable for them to develop housing.
                  The resistance by developers to the build at densities above 18 dwelling units per acre may be
                  explained by the development history of the City. Murrieta only recently experienced a surge in
                  their total population and is still transitioning from a rural to a suburban community. Unlike
                  many existing, older jurisdictions in more densely populated areas, Murrieta still has vacant land
                  available that is relatively inexpensive by comparison. While the City has continued to plan for
                  the future, by encouraging developers to utilize the existing density bonus ordinance and
                  establishing new higher density zones, it is appropriate to allow the densities of the existing MF-
                  2 and MU-3 zone to be considered in order to accommodate the remaining very low- and low-
                  income RHNA allocation.

                  This table reflects that, historically, the City of Murrieta has been successful in the development
                  of affordable housing, including very low- and low-income housing, within its existing zoning
                  designations which currently limit density to a maximum of 18 dwelling units per acre. The City
                  recognizes that in rezoning land to allow for higher densities there is even greater potential for
                  the development of affordable units; however, Table 7-2 reflects that even without increasing the
                  density of the current designations, historically very low- and low-income units have been

      produced with the assistance of the City’s affordable housing development incentives and the
      density bonus ordinance.
7.4 - Availability of Sites for Housing
      State law requires that a community provide an adequate number of sites to allow for, and
      facilitate production of the City’s fair share of regional housing. To determine whether the City
      has sufficient land to accommodate its fair share allocation for each income group, the City must
      identify “adequate sites.” Under State law (California Government Code section 65583 c.l.),
      adequate sites are those with appropriate zoning and development standards, with services, and
      facilities, that allow and encourage the development of a variety of housing for all income levels.
      Land considered suitable for residential development includes:
          Vacant residentially zoned sites;
          Vacant non-residentially zoned sites that allow residential uses (such as mixed-use);
          Underutilized residentially zoned or non-residentially zoned sites that can be rezoned or are
           capable of being developed at a higher density or with greater intensity;
      An important component of the Murrieta Housing Element is the identification of sites and
      future housing development opportunities in the 2008-2014 planning period. The majority of
      sites that are identified in the Sites Inventory section are either vacant residentially zoned sites
      or vacant residentially zoned sites that will be rezoned to accommodate higher density
      development. In calculating their total unit capacity an 80% development potential is assumed
      and applied to the acreage, meaning that for a 5 acre parcel, only 4 acres are considered
      developable with the remaining acre available for infrastructure, right-of-ways and open space.
      Additionally, for each parcel with a density provided as a range, the maximum development
      density was assumed. For example, the Multi-Family 1 designation allows for between 10 and 15
      units per acre, meaning that 15 units per acre will be used to determine the total unit capacity. In
      accordance with the Housing Plan the rezoning of properties identified in the tables below will
      occur within one to two years of the adoption of the Housing Element.
      7.4.1 - Vacant Residentially Zoned Land
                Within the sites inventory the City has determined that vacant residential land zoned
                Single-Family-1 and Single-Family-2 is appropriate to accommodate the remaining
                RHNA allocation of 371 above moderate units. SF-1 allows for a density between 2.1 to 5
                dwelling units per acre and SF-2 allows for between 5.1 and 10 dwelling units an acre.
                These zones typically allow for lower density development including single-family
                homes, condominiums, and town homes that would require significant assistance from
                the City in order to make them affordable to very low and low-income families. The City
                has identified 76 acres of vacant land zoned SF-1 and 15 acres zoned SF-2. This land at 80
                percent development capacity and the maximum allowable densities can accommodate
                over 425 units which is almost double the remaining above moderate allocation of 371.
                In addition to completing the vacant sites inventory, the City has shown, as outlined in
                section 7.3 above, that the Multi-Family 2 and Multiple Use-3 zones, both allowing
                between 15 and 18 dwelling units per acre are appropriate to accommodate a portion of
                the City’s 2,631 remaining very low- and low-income units. The City has identified 30
                acres of vacant land zoned MF-2 and 108 acres of vacant land zoned MU-3. If the land
                zoned MF-2 is developed at 80 percent capacity and the maximum allowable density,
90                                                                          2008-2014 Housing Element

                                                                                                        7- Housing Resources
                approximately 438 units can be accommodated. Vacant land zoned MU-3 was calculated
                at 40 percent capacity, as allowed by the City’s Development Code and the maximum
                allowable density of 18 units per acre, resulting in a total of 780 units. When combined,
                the number of units that can be accommodated on vacant land zoned MF-2 and MU-3
                total 1,218 units. However, legislation passed since adoption of the last Housing Element
                codified as Section 65583.2 of the California Government Code, requires that cities the
                size of Murrieta must permit residential development at a density of at least 30 dwelling
                units per acre to accommodate low and very low income units. There are consequently
                2,631 very low- and low-income units remaining that will be accommodated by rezoning
                three sites and implementing a new Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Overlay
                Program as described below.
                                                             Table 7-3:

                Table 7-3 shows that the City can accommodate its above moderate need of 371 units on
                land that is vacant and already zoned for residential development. Consequently, the
                City has a remaining need of 2,631 very low- and low-income units that will be
                accommodated by rezoning three sites and implementing a new TOD Overlay Program.
                A map showing all vacant residentially zoned sites and a table providing parcel numbers,
                the area of each site and other development information is provided in Appendix A.
        7.4.2 - Vacant Land to be Rezoned
                After analyzing the vacant land available, the City has determined that in order to
                accommodate their remaining RHNA allocation they will create a new high density
                multifamily zone. A minimum density of 30 dwelling units per acre has been established
                for this zone. This zone will be created as outlined in Action 5.1 of the Housing Plan and
                will be referred to as the Multi-Family 3 zone (MF-3). In addition to creating the new
                MF-3 zone, the City has identified three sites that will be rezoned and a Transit Oriented
                Development (TOD) Overlay Program area to accommodate the remaining 2,631 very low
                and low-income units. These sites are described in detail in the following sections.
                In identifying areas available to accommodate their remaining units, the City wants to
                ensure that multifamily units are not concentrated in any one area of the City.
                Consequently, the sites selected are scattered throughout the jurisdiction near existing
                residential uses or services to support new development. The following proposed sites or
                alternative sites of equivalent acreage will be evaluated for rezoning as part of a City of
                Murrieta General Plan update.
City of Murrieta                                                                                                                  91

   7.4.2.A - Site One – Jefferson South Property
      Site One is located in the western half of the City, in close proximity to Interstate - 15. The site
      includes two contiguous vacant parcels totaling approximately 2.09 acres. Site One is bordered
      by Jefferson Avenue to the north with no official street boundaries to the south, west or east.
      The site is located within the Jefferson Avenue multi-modal, retail corridor and is currently
      zoned Multiple Use – 3. The City purchased the site with the intention of developing housing
      where services and jobs are available.
      Following a zone change, both parcels will be rezoned to Multi-Family 3 requiring a minimum 30
      dwelling units per acre. If developed at approximately 100% of its development potential, and at
      a density of 30 dwelling units per acre, Site One could accommodate 62 new units. This site is an
      appropriate area to rezone, as the parcels are located in close proximity to existing multifamily
      homes developed in a Multi-Family 1 zone and retail services. The City anticipates that the
      remaining vacant parcels surrounding this site will also primarily include residential uses;
      consequently rezoning the parcels would simply extend the multifamily zone and create a more
      balanced mix of densities in the area. There is also existing infrastructure that could be extended
      to provide services to the site. The City will offer a density bonus incentive, development
      concessions, site improvement assistance, RDA and/or HOME funding when available and fast
      track processing to encourage the development of affordable units. Funding opportunities and
      development incentive opportunities will be prioritized for projects that include units for
      extremely low- and very-low income households.

    7.4.2.B - Site Two – Monte Vista II
        Site Two is located in the western half of the City, in close proximity to Interstate-15 and is
        adjacent to Murrieta City Hall. Site Two is a 2 acre parcel currently zoned Multiple Use-3,
        owned by the City of Murrieta Redevelopment Agency. The parcel is located at the northeast
        corner of Jefferson Avenue and Juniper Street. Although Site Two is smaller than the
        recommended size site for the development of affordable housing, the parcel is located next to an
        existing multifamily affordable housing complex called Monte Vista. The City purchased the site
        with the intention of developing a second phase of Monte Vista including low- and very low-
        income units. The City is also proposing to develop units with three or more bedrooms for large
        families.
        Following a zone change, Site Two will be zoned Multi-Family 3 with a minimum density of 30
        dwelling units per acre. If developed at approximately 100% of its development potential and at a
        density of 30 dwelling units per acre, Site Two could accommodate 60 new units. This site is
        located in close proximity to downtown Historic Murrieta and close to the Civic center where
        services are offered at City Hall, the library, and the City’s senior center. The site is served by
        infrastructure that can support additional residential development. The City will offer a density
        bonus incentive, development concessions, site improvement assistance, RDA and/or HOME
        funding when available and fast track processing to encourage the development of affordable
        units. Funding opportunities and development incentive opportunities will be prioritized for
        projects that include units for extremely low- and very-low income households.

   7.4.2.C - Site Three – Adams Avenue Property
      Site Three is a 6 acre parcel located in the western half of the City in the Historic Murrieta
      Specific Plan area. The site is located northeast of the intersection of Adams Avenue and Ivy
      Street and is also in close proximity to Civic Center. Site Three is currently zoned Village
      Residential, and is also owned by the City of Murrieta Redevelopment Agency. The City
      purchased the site with the intention of developing an affordable housing development in the
      downtown where services and jobs are available. Site Three is also in close proximity to
      Amberwalk, an existing affordable housing complex, suggesting that affordable housing is
      appropriate and supported by the neighborhood. The site is currently served by infrastructure
      that can support additional residential development.
      Following a zone change, Site Three will be zoned Multi-Family 3 with a minimum density of 30
      dwelling units per acre. If developed at approximately 100% of its development potential and at a
      density of 30 dwelling units per acre, Site Three could accommodate 180 new units. In addition
      to a zone change, the City will also amend the Historic Murrieta Specific Plan to allow for
      residential development up to 30 dwelling units per acre on this parcel. The City will offer a
      density bonus incentive, development concessions, site improvement assistance, RDA and/or
      HOME funding when available and fast track processing to encourage the development of
      affordable units. Funding opportunities and development incentive opportunities will be
      prioritized for projects that include units for extremely low- and very-low income households.

    7.4.2.D - TOD Overlay Program
        To accommodate a portion of the remaining low and very-low RHNA allocation, the City will
        also establish and implement a new, “Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Overlay Program” to
        allow a mixture of residential and non-residential development in close proximity to transit. A
        new TOD Overlay Program area will be established and will consist of approximately 78 acres
        and encompasses land on either side of Interstate 15 (I-15) and will be bounded by Los Alamos
        Road to the north, Jefferson Avenue to the west, Vista Murrieta and Hancock to the east, and
        just north of Guava and Murrieta Hot Springs Road to the south. This area is also uniquely
        situated adjacent to the convergence of two freeways (I-15 and I-215) and along the route of the
        proposed High Speed Rail. The City is working with the cities of Temecula, Lake Elsinore, and
        Wildomar to establish Jefferson Avenue as a multi-modal transit corridor, connecting all the
        cities and provide smart growth opportunities, including a mixture of residential and non-
        residential uses. The area to the west of I-15 includes an older commercial district, which
        provides opportunities for redevelopment. The commercial buildings are showing age and
        properties are underutilized to their full potential. In addition, several vacant parcels exist,
        which are situated along Murrieta Hot Springs Road, a major east/west thoroughfare and a
        connection for I-15 and I-215, and is ideal for TOD and high density housing. The area on the east
        side of I-15 is comprised of vacant and underutilized parcels that include a range of single-family
        home types, sizes, and ages. Development has been gradually encroaching around its perimeters,
        making this section no longer viable as a single-family rural area. The underlying zoning is a mix
        of Multiple-Use 1 and Multiple-Use -3, Multi-Family 2, Community Commercial, and Regional
        Commercial indicating that affordable housing is appropriate and supported by the area. In
        addition, most of the TOD Overlay area is located within a Redevelopment Project Area, which
        provides additional opportunities for redevelopment investment. The TOD Overlay Program will
        permit by right 30 dwelling units per acre, and if developed at 100% of its development potential
        could accommodate approximately 2,340 units.
        The State has determined that most assisted housing developments utilizing State or federal
        financial resources include 50 to 150 units. As indicated in Action 1.6 of the Housing Plan, the
        City will provide incentives and technical assistance through the processing of subdivision or
        larger parcels located in the TOD Overlay Program area to facilitate development of a variety of
        housing types and affordability consistent with typical developments affordable to lower income
        households. The existing infrastructure from Jefferson Avenue and Los Alamos Road can
        support residential development. The City will offer a density bonus incentive, development
        concessions, site improvement assistance, RDA and/or HOME funding when available and fast
        track processing to encourage the development of affordable units. Funding opportunities and
        development incentive opportunities will be prioritized for projects that include units for
        extremely low- and very-low income households.

7.5 - Summary of Available Sites
        After taking into account the number of units approved and constructed since 2006, the City’s
        remaining RHNA allocation is 3,002. As outlined in Section 7.4, the City has identified vacant
        land to accommodate 371 above moderate-income units based on the City’s existing zoning and
        allowable densities. After identifying vacant residentially zoned land the City has a remaining
        RHNA of 2,631 very low- and low-income units. These 2,631 remaining very low- and low-income
        units are accommodated as shown in the sites inventory by rezoning three sites and
        implementing a new TOD Overlay Program to allow for higher density projects to be developed.

        In accordance with Action 5.1 of the Housing Program the three sites identified in the inventory
        will be rezoned from their existing zoning to the newly created Multi-Family 3 zone, which
        allows for densities of 30 dwelling units per acre. Following the implementation of Action 5.1,
        approximately 2,642 lower income units can be accommodated. Table 7-4 shows by site the
        City’s efforts to accommodate their remaining RHNA allocation of 2,631 very low- and low-
        income units, including the acreage and realistic unit capacity for each site. In addition, the City
        will also establish and implement a new “Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Overlay
        Program” which will permit by right 30 dwelling units per acre and will accommodate
        approximately 2,340 units as it will apply to 78 acres. Based on Table 7-5, shown below, the City
        is more than able to accommodate their remaining RHNA of 2,631 units, when Program 5.1 of the
        Housing Plan is completed and the three sites identified above are rezoned to their proposed
        density.

      As discussed previously in Section 7.2, the City of Murrieta has been successful in providing
      affordable housing within their current zoning designations, which currently allows densities up
      to 18 units per acre. The City anticipates that with the creation of a higher density zone, the
      development of affordable housing may be more easily facilitated. Allowing for a variety of units
      in various areas of the City at different densities is crucial to ensuring that affordable units are
      not concentrated in one specific area. It is also necessary to ensure that units of varying sizes,
      product types and styles can be developed. Based on the City’s history of providing affordable
      units and the sites identified in Section 7.4 the City has identified opportunities for the
      production of affordable housing.
7.6 - Constraints
      7.6.1 - Environmental Constraints
               Potential environmental constraints to future development of sites identified include the
               MSHCP and seismic and flooding hazards, which are addressed in the Non-
               Governmental Constraints Section of the Housing Element. Locations identified in the
               Sites Inventory were compared with all hazards maps included in the City’s Safety
               Element; none were found to be within areas that have development restrictions due to
               risk of damage from disasters (such as floods, wildfires, or seismic events). The sites
               inventoried have a land use designation which was determined based on surrounding
               land uses and has already examined potential environmental constraints. Aside from the
               constraints mentioned above, there are little additional constraints that would impede
               the development of new housing units in the future on the identified sites.
      7.6.2 - Infrastructure
               The City’s five year Capital Improvement Plan has identified expenditures of City funds
               used for public improvement projects, including infrastructure. The City understands
               that improvements can be achieved with a comprehensive approach that includes
               reviewing infrastructure plans for each application for discretionary approval of General
               Plan amendments, tentative parcel or tentative tract maps, or development proposals
               that includes extension of an exiting street or construction of a new street. The City
               requires that project applications for new development be reviewed for adequate
               infrastructure. Applications are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure there is the
               capacity to service new developments. Infrastructure requirements and costs are also
               discussed in the Non-Governmental Constraints Section of the Housing Element.

7.7 - Resources
        7.7.1 - Financial Resources
                A variety of Federal, State, and local programs are available to create and/or maintain
                rental and purchase affordability for lower income households and for persons with
                special needs. These programs are also available to other jurisdictions for potential
                acquisition, subsidy, or replacement of units at-risk. The following summarizes financial
                resources available to the City, private, and non-profit parties to preserve/create housing
                that is affordable.
                Programs that may be of use in Murrieta are listed below. Information related to these
                programs will be updated annually and made available by the City of Murrieta.

            By the end of the planning period, the redevelopment set-aside fund is estimated to total
            approximately $9,803,885. As shown in the Housing Plan approximately $7,542,222 in
            redevelopment funding will be spent during the planning period, including $4,800,000 to
            purchase land to be conveyed for affordable housing development, $2,222,222 to
            subsidize the construction of new units, $400,000 to fun the City’s First Time
            Homebuyer Program and $24,000 annually to fund the Foreclosure Prevention Program.
            The remaining funding will be used to develop and post informational materials on
            services and programs available to residents, and to provide fee waivers, on/off-site
            improvements, fast track processing, and other incentives to affordable housing
            developers as projects are presented, and when funding is available.
           Riverside County Mortgage Credit Certificate Program (MCC) – Income tax credits

   The Progress Report reviews the previous Housing Element’s programs, objectives, and actions that were
   to be implemented during the previous planning period. The City of Murrieta’s Housing Element
   identified five programs, labeled “A” through “E”, that the City anticipated to implement during the
   previous planning period. Each program has specific policies that were to be achieved in order to
   facilitate the construction of affordable housing and to maintain the existing affordable housing stock.
   Each policy has specific actions and quantified objectives that were to be implemented to accomplish the
   goal of the program. Each of the actions and objectives had a timeframe for completion along with a
   responsible agency to monitor the program.
   The accomplishments are listed on the right column of the table and display the progress, effectiveness,
   and appropriateness of the program. Pursuant to Government Code Section 65588 local governments
   shall review their Housing Element and evaluate the following:
        1) The progress of the City or County in implementation of the housing element.
        2) The effectiveness of the housing element in attainment of the community’s housing goals and
            objectives.
        3) The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to the
            attainment of the State housing goal.
   The following table reviews the continued progress in implementation, the effectiveness of the Housing
   Element, and the appropriateness of the City’s housing goals since 2001. Table 8-1 provides a summary of
   housing programs that have been achieved, partially achieved or not achieved.

10. Appendix B
  Appendix B includes a letter from Affirmed Housing Group (AHG) addressing densities appropriate to
  develop affordable housing in the City of Murrieta. AHG states that the current maximum density of 18
  dwelling units allowed in the MF-2 and MU-3 zones is sufficient to build not only very low- and low-
  income units but also units for extremely low-income households. The Appendix also includes a sample
  pro forma that was completed for 36 multi-bedroom units on 2 acres of land in Downtown indicating
  that the organization will still make a profit by constructing at 18 dwelling units per acre.
