EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
With a population of 10,1361 persons residing in 5,5302 dwelling units the City of Capitola
is nearly built-out. Capitola’s existing housing is uniquely balanced to meet the diverse
needs of its residents. Though its history, Capitola has served as a vacation destination
with a mixture of summer cottages and fairly high-valued single-family homes with ocean
views.
Capitola’s housing stock is comprised of approximately 60 percent multi-family units. And
of occupied housing units, approximately 54 percent are renter-occupied. Capitola has a
fairly high population density of 6,335 persons per square mile and a housing unit density
of 3,456 units per square mile.3 Multiple family dwellings and mobile home parks are
interspersed within and adjacent to single family neighborhoods. Many of the community’s
major commercial areas are zoned to encourage mixed uses and a more pedestrian
friendly environment.
The City of Capitola has been, and continues to be, a proponent of affordable housing. It
has actively assisted with the construction of new affordable units and the maintenance
and improvement of its existing affordable housing stock. In this 2015-2023 Housing
Element Update, the City of Capitola outlines its plan to identify new opportunities for
expanding affordable housing opportunities. This Housing Element identifies housing
programs:
      Identify adequate sites, with appropriate zoning and development standards;
      Assist in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs of extremely low-,
        very low-, low, and moderate-income households;
      Address and remove governmental constraints, including housing for persons with
        disabilities;
      Conserve and improve the condition of the existing affordable housing stock;
      Preserve assisted housing developments at-risk conversion to market-rate; and
      Promote equal housing opportunities for all persons.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
A. Community Overview
The City of Capitola is a small (1.6 square mile) seaside community, located along
Monterey Bay in Santa Cruz County (Refer to Figure 1, Vicinity Map). Soquel Creek
generally bisects the community in a northwest-southeasterly direction, with residences
and community and regional-serving commercial uses to the west of the creek, and a
mixture of residences and small shops and businesses along the east side of the creek.
Capitola was originally founded in 1869 as California's first seaside resort. Incorporated as
a city in 1949, the village area remains California’s oldest coastal resort and includes one
of the region’s most active beaches. Most of the growth in Capitola occurred in the 1970s
as the community annexed surrounding land and residential growth accelerated.
Today, Capitola, with a population of 10,1364 persons residing in 5,5305 dwelling units, is
nearly built-out. Its housing stock contains a varied and balanced mix of housing types,
including single family houses, multi-family structures and mobile homes. Older Victorian-
era homes and small cottages on small lots characterize its older neighborhoods such as
Depot Hill, the Village and parts of the Jewel Box. Cliffwood Heights, Upper Village and
41st Avenue, located in the northern portions of the City, are newer, more typical suburban
neighborhoods, with most of the housing stock between 30-40 years of age (Refer to
Figure 2, Capitola Neighborhood Map). New housing, constructed during the past decade,
is found on in-fill sites scattered throughout the community.

B. Purpose of the Element
The provision of adequate housing for families and individuals of all economic levels is an
important public goal. It has been a main focus for state and local governments. The
issue has grown in complexity due to rising land and construction costs, as well as
increasing competition for physical and financial resources in both the public and the
private sectors.
In response to this concern, the California Legislature amended the Government Code in
1980. The amendment instituted the requirement that each local community is to include a
specific analysis of its housing needs and a realistic set of programs designed to meet
those needs. This analysis is to be set forth in a Housing Element and incorporated in the
General Plan of each municipality.
                                         Chapter 1-3
The requirements of the law are prefaced by several statements of State policy set forth in
Section 65580 of the Government Code:
 “... The availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the early attainment of
decent housing and a suitable living environment for every California family is a priority of
the highest order.”
“... Local and State governments have a responsibility to use the powers vested in them to
facilitate the improvement and development of housing to make adequate provision for the
housing needs of all economic segments of the community.”
“... The legislature recognizes that in carrying out this responsibility, each local government
also has the responsibility to consider economic, environmental, and fiscal factors and
community goals set forth in the general plan and to cooperate with other local
governments and the State in addressing regional housing needs.”
C. Legislative Requirements
State law requires each municipality to accomplish the following tasks:
        To identify and analyze the current and projected housing needs of all economic
         segments of the community including persons with disabilities.
        To evaluate and remove, as legally feasible and appropriate, the current and
         potential constraints to meeting those needs, including identifying the constraints
         that are due to the marketplace and those imposed by the government.
        To identify adequate sites to facilitate and encourage housing for households of all
         economic levels, including persons with disabilities. To establish a series of goals,
         objectives, policies and programs aimed at responding to the identified housing
         needs, the market and governmental constraints, and the housing opportunities.
This Housing Element addresses the planning period from 2015-2023. It has been
prepared in accordance with applicable state law, and consistent with the City of Capitola
General Plan and the community’s vision of its housing needs and objectives. For more
information regarding compliance with State law please see Chapter 6 of this document.
D. Scope and Content
The Housing Element consists of five major components:
        An analysis of the City’s demographic, housing and special needs characteristics
         and trends.
        Review of potential market, governmental, and environmental constraints which
         impact the City’s ability to address its housing needs.
        Analysis of land, financial and organizational resource available to address the
         community’s housing goals.
                                             Chapter 1-4

       Evaluation of the City’s accomplishments toward meeting the goals and objectives
        of the prior 2007-2014 Housing Element.
       A statement of the Housing Plan for the years 2015-2023 to address the City’s
        identified housing needs, including the housing goals, policies and programs.
E. Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Government Code requires internal consistency among the various elements of a
General Plan. Section 65300.5 of the Government Code states that, “the General Plan,
and the parts and elements thereof, shall comprise an integrated and an internally
consistent and compatible statement of policies”. The Capitola General Plan 2014
contains the following five elements: 1) Land Use; 2) Open Space and Conservation; 3)
Mobility; 4) Safety and Noise; and 5) Economic Development. The Capitola General Plan
is internally consistent. Policy direction introduced in one element is reflected in the other
elements.
Relative to housing, the General Plan identifies both constraints and opportunities to
providing new affordable housing. The Land Use Element is guided by the principle of
sustainable development and supports a pattern of development that protects natural
resources, supports economic development, and promotes access to opportunity for all
residents. The Mobility Element establishes a framework for a balanced transportation
system in Capitola that meets the needs of residents, workers, and visitors and aims to
support a range of transportation choices, including vehicle travel, transit, bicycling, and
walking. The Capitola General Plan 2014 supports a balanced land use pattern that
maintains and enhances Capitola’s distinctive identity and unique sense of place.
Consistent with its Local Coastal Program policies, the Land Use Element protects and
promotes its seashore resources, providing recreational facilities to the community and
visitors. It also promotes commercial and mixed-use districts. The City’s residential and
mixed use densities allow for an adequate diversity and supply of housing to satisfy the
requirements of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) presented in this
Housing Element. This Housing Element builds upon the other General Plan elements. It
is entirely consistent with the policies and proposals set forth by the Plan.
Pursuant to Government Code Section 65400, the City will annually review its progress in
implementing this Housing Element and ensuring consistency between this and the City’s
other General Plan Elements.
F. Public Participation
Section 65583(c)(5) of the Government Code states that:
"The local government shall make a diligent effort to achieve public participation of all the
economic segments of the community in the development of the housing element, and the
program shall describe this effort."
Public workshops and hearings are opportunities for community members to not only learn
about certain plans or projects that may affect them in the future, but to let their voices be
heard by City officials and staff. The City of Capitola recognizes the importance of
                                           Chapter 1-5

community participation in future planning projects such as the Housing Element and
General Plan updates as they have the potential to affect all citizens within the City limits
for years to come. As such, public outreach was an important piece of the Housing
Element update. For the duration of the Housing Element update, various noticing
techniques were used in order to increase public attendance at community workshops and
meetings. The goal of this public participation program was to gather the
opinions/comments of a large percentage of the population.
Public Outreach and Participation Goals
The City of Capitola took several measures in order to comply with the aforementioned
State requirement. All measures were taken in accordance with the Brown Act, which
requires the local government agency to provide the opportunity for the public to access
and participate in public meetings and workshops. As of July 1, 2008 the Brown Act also
requires that the public have access to non-confidential materials at the same time that
they are given or made available to Planning Commission or City Council members from
City staff (Section 54957.5, CA Government Code).
An early goal in the City of Capitola Housing Element update was to meet and exceed the
State requirements for public outreach and participation within the means of the City
budget and the time constraints of staff. Giving members of the community a chance to be
involved in long-range planning is a relatively infrequent opportunity, which is why the City
of Capitola recognizes the importance of public participation in updating the City of
Capitola Housing Element. The following sections describe the methods and strategies
that were used to accomplish the City’s public participation goal for this Housing Element.
Facilitation of Public Meetings
   I.   Capitola Planning Commission
The Capitola City Planning Commission served as the reviewing body for the development
of the Housing Element Update. The existing Commission was used as the venue for
gaining focused input from representatives of the entire City. Commission members
represented long-time residents, local professionals and public servants of Capitola. What
qualified them to serve as the Housing Element Review Board was their knowledge of
Capitola and the needs of the community.
  II.   Public Meetings
Table 1.1 lists the community engagement events that were held for the development of
the Housing Element update.

A community workshop was held on March 4, 2015 at 6:00pm in the City’s Council
Chambers. The community workshopwas widely publicized through newspaper
advertisements, direct mailers, the City’s website, and fliers posted throughout the City.
The meeting was professionally facilitated and involved both a presentation as well as a
hands-on exercise to encourage group participation. Participants identified current and
future housing issues in the City and available opportunities to address housing
challenges. Appendix B summarizes comments provided by community workshop
participants.
 III.   Outreach
The following methods were used to encourage public participation:
       Noticing at City Hall, Capitola Branch Library, and Capitola Branch Office;
       Noticing and posting event information on public access TV, City website, and City’s
        Calendar of Events;
       Press releases in local newspapers;
       Direct emails to 175 individuals who expressed interest in the General Plan Update.
Giving notice of a public hearing via a local newspaper is common practice, as is noticing
on a public cable scroll. Both methods meet the requirements of the State of California for
public outreach.

CHAPTER 2: HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
A successful strategy for improving housing conditions must be preceded by an
assessment of the housing needs of the community and region. This section of the
Housing Element reviews the major components of Capitola's housing need including
trends in population, households, and the type of housing available. These changes
reflect both local and regional conditions. Consequently, the regional context is also
presented.
The analysis that follows is broken down into four major subsections:
       Section A, Population Characteristics, analyzes the City of Capitola in terms of
        individual persons and population trends that may affect future housing needs.
       Section B, Household Characteristics, analyzes Capitola in terms of households, or
        living groups, to see how past and expected household changes will affect housing
        needs.
       Section C, Housing Stock, analyzes the housing units in Capitola in terms of
        availability, affordability, and condition.
       Section D, Assisted Housing At-Risk of Conversion, analyzes housing units that
        have expiring use restrictions. Such projects may be at risk of losing rent restrictions
        within the next few years, which could result in significant rent increases for their
        tenants.
This assessment of Capitola's housing needs was used as the basis for identifying
appropriate policies and programs in this Element.
The most recent demographic data available was from the 2010 U.S. Census report and
the 2009-2013 American Community Survey, 5-Year Estimates. Where more recent data
was available, it was included. The City acknowledges 2010 Census data and 2009-2013
American Community Survey may be outdated. In some cases, the disparate dates for
which data sources were valid resulted in difficulty drawing direct comparisons or
conclusions.
                                            Chapter 2-1

A. Population Characteristics
Capitola's population characteristics are important factors affecting the type and extent of
housing needs in the City. Population growth, age, race/ethnicity and employment
characteristics are discussed in this section.
Population Change
According to the State of California, Department of Finance, the City of Capitola, had a
slight increase in population from 2008 to 2014. During this time frame Santa Cruz County
grew by approximately 2 percent. The fastest growing city within the county, in terms of
percentage growth, was Santa Cruz at 9.1 percent. Table 2.1 indicates population growth
trends for Capitola and surrounding communities.

Although it has the smallest population of all the jurisdictions in Santa Cruz County, the
City of Capitola is among the most densely populated (See Table 2.2). Housing in
Capitola is characterized by a large number of housing units per square mile and a small
household size. Some of this density occurs in the historic areas such as Capitola Village
where small beach bungalows that characterized “Camp Capitola” evolved into permanent
single-family housing. The large percentage of multi-residential developments and mobile
home parks has also contributed to the community’s higher than average density.

Age Characteristics
The age characteristics of a population are important factors in evaluating housing needs
and planning future housing development. For example, if a city is experiencing an
outmigration of young adults (ages 25-34), there may be a shortage of first-time
homebuyer opportunities and/or well-paying employment opportunities. If a city has a
substantial elderly population, special housing types or services may be needed, such as
assisted living facilities, housing rehabilitation programs, paratransit, meals on wheels, and
home health care services, in order to enable seniors to remain in the community. Table
2.3 shows the number of Capitola and Santa Cruz County residents in each age group.
Capitola is a maturing community. Between 2000 and 2009-2013, the median age of
Capitolans increased from 38.4 to 41.5 years (See Table 2.3 below). County-wide during
the same period the median age increased from 35.0 years to 36.9 years and state-wide
the median age increased from 33.3 years to 35.4 years. Median age for the City, as well
as the County and State, is expected to continue to increase as the Baby Boom generation
ages6.

6 The Baby Boom is a defined as the generation of people born between 1946 and 1964, during the post World War II
period, when there was a marked increase in the national birth rate.

As seen in the Figure 2.2 Capitola has a smaller proportional population of children than
the County: 15.9 percent of Capitolans were aged 14 or younger, while 17.2 percent of
County residents were children in this age group. In contrast, 45.3 percent of Capitola’s
residents are aged 45 or older, while that group comprises 39.7 percent of the County’s
population.

These age distributions reflect the local housing stock of Capitola, which has a high
percentage of apartments, small homes, and senior housing developments (including
senior mobilehome parks), and a smaller percentage of family-sized (3 or more bedroom)
units, single-family homes, and owner-occupied units than the county as a whole.
Figure 2.3 shows how the number of people in each age group changed between 2000
and 2009-2013. The size of each age group can change for two basic reasons: natural
aging, birth, and death; or migration (into or out of the City). There were 99 more children
in the 0-4 year range in 2009-2013 than in 2000, indicating an increase in births. The
largest decrease in any single age group was in the group of young adults aged 25-34
years, which decreased by 630 persons over the 2000 to 2009-2013 period. In total, there
were 800 fewer young adults in the combined age ranges of 20 to 44 years in 2009-2013
than there were in 2000. At the same time there was an increase of 858 persons in the
55-64 age groups.

Race and Ethnicity
The population of the City of Capitola in 2009-2013 had similar diversity to Santa Cruz
County, although both the City and the County were less diverse than the State. For
instance, 87.1 percent of Capitola’s population was white, compared to 85.1 percent of the
County and 65.9 percent of the State population. Approximately 22 percent of Capitola’s
residents were Hispanic or Latino. In contrast, approximately 32 percent of Santa Cruz
County’s population was Hispanic or Latino. Capitola’s population had a slightly greater
proportion of African Americans than that of the County, but less than half that of the State.
The percentage of Asian residents was similar for Capitola and Santa Cruz County. Table

This comparatively low degree of racial and ethnic diversity may have resulted in part from
the high cost of housing in the area as compared to the state, combined with a local
employment base comprised of relatively low-wage jobs in the service, retail, and tourism
sectors. This combination of low-paying jobs and high cost housing makes it difficult for
lower and moderate income households to find housing they can afford within Capitola.
This can have a disproportionate effect on those racial/ethnic groups that have lower
median incomes compared to the overall population, just as it affects other types of lower
income households, such as younger workers, single parents and recent immigrants. For
this reason, sufficient affordable housing of all types is needed to ensure fair access to
housing in this region for all racial and ethnic groups and to prevent further housing
segregation, consistent with fair housing goals and laws. The provision of housing that is
affordable to the Capitola workforce would also reduce the need for these workers to
commute from out of the area.
Employment
Capitola has approximately 900 businesses operating within its boundaries. Most of these
businesses are retail and service establishments. The majority of the commercial and
industrial land in the City is already developed. There are some vacant and prospective
commercial parcels with potential to accommodate residential units, in a mixed-use or
higher density residential development pattern. The key housing opportunity sites on
commercial lands are identified in Appendix C. According to the 2009-2013 American
Community Survey, there were appoximately 5,597 residents in the labor force in Capitola.
Within the labor force in the City, appoximately 22 percent worked in place of residence
and 78 percent worked outside place of residence.
According to Table 2.5 below, the highest percentage of Capitola residents worked
educational services, health care and social assistance (23.6%) followed by workers in
arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation and food services (16%), the retail trade
(13.5%), and professional, scientific, management, and administrative (13.3%). It is
important to note that the aforementioned industries and associated jobs are not
necessarily located within the City of Capitola.

Known as the first resort community on the California coast, Capitola still relies heavily on
tourism and retail sales tax. The revenue from tourism increased nearly over the 2006-
2012 planning period (see Table 2.8 below) in Santa Cruz County, illustrating an
opportunity for economic growth in visitor-serving businesses.

   I.     Commuting
According to the 2009-2013 American Community Survey Estimates, 78.4 percent of
Capitola’s working residents worked outside of Capitola and 24.1 percent of Capitola’s
work force worked outside of Santa Cruz County. The average travel time to work was
26.6 minutes.
As to the mode of transportation used, Table 2.9 shows that the majority of commuters in
Capitola drove to work alone (74.3 percent). The least popular means of travel was public
transportation with a share of 2.9 percent of the commuters
.

A heavy reliance on automobile use contributes to air pollution and Carbon Dioxide (CO 2)
emissions, which is a contributor to climate change. Lowering CO2 emissions has been
identified as a State goal through the passage of AB 32, the California Global Warming
Solutions Act and SB 375, the Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act.
                                                           Chapter 2-9

The proximity of housing to jobs is directly related to the amount of CO2 emitted. The
closer affordable housing is located to jobs, the more likely workers will choose alternative
modes of transportation over the automobile or will drive shorter distances. All of the
opportunity sites identified for the 2015-2023 planning period are located on or near major
transportation corridors and are walking distance to amenities and jobs.
The City of Capitola already has infrastructure to support alternative modes of
transportation. The City is serviced by the Santa Cruz Metro buses, which act as the
public transit system for the region. One of the major transit stops is located at the
Capitola Mall, at the heart of the major commercial district in the City. In addition to
encouraging public transit, Capitola offered 14.6 miles of bike paths and bike lanes in 2013
(Table 2.10).
The City’s bike lanes extend along all of the major transportation corridors (Figure 2.4):
41st Avenue, Bay Avenue, Park Avenue and Capitola Road, and connect Capitola to the
immediately surrounding areas of Aptos, Live Oak and Soquel, and beyond to the City of
Santa Cruz. The City will continue to support alternative modes of transportation and their
relation to housing in support of the implementation of SB 375.

B. Household Characteristics
Information on household characteristics is an important indicator of housing needs in a
community. Income and affordability is best measured at the household level, as are the
special housing needs of certain groups such as large families and families with children.
As an example, if a community has a substantial number of young family households
whose incomes combined with local housing costs preclude the option of home purchases,
the city may wish to initiate a home-buyer assistance program or participate in or publicize
the programs that are available elsewhere.
The Bureau of the Census defines a "household" as “all persons who occupy a housing
unit, which may include families, singles, or other." Boarders are included as part of the
primary household by the Census. Families are households related through marriage,
domestic partnership, blood or adoption and includes single-parent households with
children. A single household refers to individuals living alone. "Other" households reflect
unrelated individuals living together (e.g., roommates). Persons living in retirement or
convalescent homes, dormitories, or other group living situations are not considered
households.
Household Type
As shown in Table 2.11, there were a total of 4,308 households in Capitola according to
the 2009-2013 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates. Approximately 54 percent
of total households are family households in Capitola, compared to the approximately 63
percent of family households for Santa Cruz County. Nonfamily housholds made up a
larger share of the total number of households in Capitola (46.3%) than in Santa Cruz
County (37.5%). The City of Capitola also has a smaller average household and family
household size compared to Santa Cruz County.

As evidenced in Table 2.12, just over half (53.2%) of the households in 2009-2013 were
renter-occupied, which is consistent with a high number of nonfamily households and also
attests to the high cost of housing in Capitola (discussed in Section C of this Chapter). The
balance of ownership housing and rental housing remained essentially the same from 200
                                                      Chapter 2-12

These household statistics coincide with the age distribution data presented in Table 2.3
and Figures 2.2 and 2.3 earlier in this chapter: Capitola has a relatively low percentage of
children, and high percentage of single adults and elderly, both of whom are more likely to
be in nonfamily households. The City’s existing pattern of small and/or attached housing
units is expected to continue through the current planning period. Many families prefer
single-family homes, with several bedrooms and a yard. There is very little vacant land
available for single-family development in the City. New housing developments to be built
in Capitola are expected to be mostly medium and higher density dwellings (either
attached or detached), which can also accommodate families comfortably if they are
designed with families in mind.
Overcrowding
Overcrowding is an indicator of housing affordability. Unit overcrowding is caused by the
combined effect of low earnings and high housing costs in a community, and reflects the
inability of households to buy or rent housing that provides sufficient living space for their
needs. The U.S. Census defines overcrowded households as units with greater than 1.01
persons per room, excluding bathrooms, hallways and porches.
According to the 2009-2013 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, the incidence
of overcrowding in Capitola was minimal, with approximately 3.8 percent or 166 of the
City's households defined as overcrowded, compared with 6.1 percent County-wide.
Estimates indicate that 156 renter households were overcrowded, which means that 94
percent of all overcrowded households were renters, and 6.6 percent of all renter
households were overcrowded (Table 2.13).

Household Income
An important factor in housing affordability is household income. While upper income
households have more discretionary income to spend on housing, extremely low-, very
low-, low and moderate-income households are more limited in the range of housing they
can afford.
   I.     State-Defined Income Categories
According to the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the
California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), the area median
income for a four-person household in Santa Cruz County was $87,000 in 2014.7
California law and some federal housing programs define several income categories based
on a percentage of the area median income (AMI) determined by HUD and HCD, as
follows:
         Extremely Low Income – less than 30% of the area median income
         Very Low Income – less than 50% of the area median income
         Lower Income - between 51 and 80% of the area median income
         Moderate Income – between 81 and 120% of the area median income
         Above Moderate Income – over 120% of the area median income
These income ranges are used to determine eligibility for various subsidized housing
programs. The 2014 income limits for these categories by household size are presented in
Table 2.14.

Special Needs Groups
State law recognizes that certain households have more difficulty in finding adequate and
affordable housing due to special circumstances. Special needs populations include the
extremely low-income households, the elderly, large households, persons with disabilities,
female-headed households, farm workers, and the homeless population. In addition, many
often have lower incomes as a result of their condition.
   I.  Extremely Low-Income Households
An extremely low-income household is one that makes less than 30 percent of the Area
Median Income. According to the 2007-2011 CHAS data generated for the City, 17
percent of households were extremely low-income, creating a demand for 800 affordable
housing units (Table 2.15). As of January 2015, there are 197 households receiving
Section 8 Vouchers. Most of these housing units are in multi-family residential
developments.
The 2015-2023 Housing Plan in Chapter 6 addresses the need for more alternative types
of housing that will accommodate groups such as extremely low-income households.
  II.  Elderly
The special housing needs of the elderly are an important concern in Capitola. Many of the
elderly residents in the City are retired and living on a fixed low-income, which puts them at
greater risk for housing overpayment. In addition, the elderly maintain special needs
related to housing construction and location. The elderly often require ramps, handrails,
lower cupboards and counters to allow for greater access and mobility. In terms of
                                                     Chapter 2-15
location, because of limited mobility the elderly typically need acces to public facilities (i.e.
medical and shopping) and public transit facilities.
As reported in the 2010 U.S. Census, 1,539 City residents, or 15.5 percent of the total
population, were 65 years or older. Table 2.17 indicates the number of elderly households
by tenure in Capitola compared to Santa Cruz County. In terms of tenure, 726 owner-
occupied and 342 renter-occupied units were headed by occupants 65 years or older.

The median age for the City, as well as the County and the State, is expected to continue
to increase. According to a projection by AMBAG the percentage of seniors 65 and over in
Santa Cruz County will nearly double between 2000 and 2035.8
According to the 2007-2011 CHAS data, over 67 percent of households ages 62 and over
owned their home. Of the total 830 elderly owner households, 595 (72 percent) of the
households are extremely low-, very low-, and low-income. In comparison, 307 of the 400
(77 percent) elderly renter households are extremely low-, very low-, and low-income
households. Table 2.18 shows the number of elderly householders in Capitola by income
and tenure.

The City has been able to meet the demand for elderly rental housing, and currently has a
number of existing affordable housing projects that rent exclusively or primarily to senior
citizens. These include the Bay Avenue Senior Apartments (formerly known as Silvercrest
Apartments), Loma Vista Mobile Home Park, and the Shorelife Community Church
Neighborhood Manor. In addition, many seniors reside in non-senior restricted mobile
home parks within the City, that are subject to a rent stabilization ordinance limiting space
rents or that have converted to cooperative ownership with income eligibility requirements.
Many elderly persons have limited income potential, as they are most often retired and
have fixed income. While the majority of seniors are homeowners, the number of lower
income senior renters who are overpaying for housing remains a general concern moving
into the 2015-2023 planning period. To address the housing needs of Capitola’s elderly
population the Housing Element establishes policies and programs to rehabilitate existing
senior housing and encourage the development of this type of housing in the future.
 III.     Large Households
Large households are identified in State housing law as a “group with special housing
needs based on the generally limited availability of adequately sized, affordable housing
units.” Large households are defined as those with five or more members. According to
the 2010 U.S. Census estimates, only 5 percent of all households in the City, or 226
households, were large households. Approximately 62 percent of these large households,
or 139 households, were renters, while 38 percent, or 87 households, were homeowners
(Table 2.19). See Figure 2.5 below for detail on household size.

Given the small number of large households in the City, and the relatively low rate of
overcrowding, the need for larger housing units does not appear to be one of the most
pressing special housing needs in the City at this time.
IV.                         Persons with Disabilities
According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, a disability refers to a “physical or mental
impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities.” Physical and
mental disabilities can hinder access to traditionally designed housing units as well as
potentially limit the ability to earn adequate income. As shown in Table 2.20, the 2009-
2013 American Community Survey Estimates indicate that that 6.5 percent of the
population age 18 years and older have some form of work or mobility/self-care disability.
In comparison, nearly 30 percent of the City’s population age 65 years and over has one or
more disability.
Although no current comparisons of disability with income, household size, or
race/ethnicity are available, it is reasonable to assume that a substantial portion of persons
with disabilities would have annual incomes within Federal Section 8 income limits,
especially those households not in the labor foce. Furthermore, many lower-income
epersons with disabilities are likely to require housing assistance. Their housing needs are
further compounded by design issues and location requirements, which can often be
costly. For example, special needs of households with wheelchair-bound or semi-
ambulatory individuals may require ramps, holding bars, special bathroom designs, wider
doorways, lower cabinets, elevators, and other interior and exterior design features.

Housing opportunities for individuals with disabilities can be addressed thrtough the
provision of afforable, barrier-free housing. Rehabilitation assistance can be targeted
toward disabled renters and homeowners for unit modification to improve accessibility.

Housing opportunities for persons with diabilities will continue to be addressed through the
provision of affordable, barrier-free housing. This Housing Element sets forth policies to
implement State standards to encourage development of housing for persons with
diabilities. Recently, the City revised the Zoning Code to provide reasonable
accommodation procedures. Reasonable accommodation provides a basis for residents
with disabilities to request flexibility in the application of land use and zoning regulations or,
income instances, even a waiver of certain restrictions or requirements from the local
governments to ensure equal access to housing opportunities.
One of the obstacles that people with physical disabilities face when seeking accessible
housing is that a large percentage of the accessible units now being developed are
restricted for senior-only occupancy. As new affordable housing projects are developed,
or as existing housing units are rehabilitated and converted to provide affordable and
accessible housing, it will be important that these units be financed and regulated in ways
that allow for occupancy by households of all age groups.
  V.      Persons with Developmental Disabilities
According to Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code a “developmental
disability” means a disability that originates before an individual attains age 18 years,
continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial
disability for that individual which include mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and
autism. This term shall also include disabling conditions found to be closely related to
menal retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for indivduals with mental
retardation, but shall not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in
nature.
Many persons with developmental disabilities can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. Individuals with more severe developmental
disabilities require a group living environment where supervision is provided. The most
                                                        Chapter 2-19

severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical
attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist
before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for persons with developmental
disabilities is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate
level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community
based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their
families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers,
and two community-based facilities. The San Andreas Regional Center is one of 21
regional centers in the State of California that provides point of entry to services for people
with developmental disabilities. The center is a community-based, private nonprofit
corporation that is funded by the State of California to serve people with developmental
disabilities and their families. According to the 2009-2013 American Community Survey,
there are approximately 999 people in Capitola with a disability, which includes hearing,
vision, cognitive, ambulatory, self-care, and independent living difficulties. According to the
California Department of Developmental Services, Santa Cruz County is home to 1,216
people with developmental disabilities ages three and up. The population of the City of
Capitola is approximately 4 percent of the total population in Santa Cruz County, it can
therefore be estimated that there are approximately 48 people in Capitola with
developmental disabilities ages three and up.
There are a number of housing types appropriate for people living with a developmental
disability: rent subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family homes,
inclusionary housing, Section 8 vouchers, special programs for home purchase, HUD
housing, and SB 962 homes. The design of housing-accessibility modifications, the
proximity to services and transit, and the availability of group living opportunities represent
some of the types of considerations that are important in serving this need group.
Incorporating ‘barrier-free’ design in all, new multi-family housing (as required by California
and Federal Fair Housing laws) is especially important to provide the widest range of
choice for disabled residents. Special consideration should also be given to the
affordability of housing, as people with disabilities may be living on a fixed income. There
are no current City programs or funding available that assists persons with disabilities.
 VI.    Female Headed Households
Single-parent households often require special consideration and assistance due to their
greater need for affordable and accessible day care, health care, and other supportive
services. In particular, many female-headed households with children are susceptible to
having lower incomes than similar two-parent households. Single, female mothers also
face social marginalization pressures that often limit their occupational choices, housing
options and acces to supportive services.
According to the 2009-2013 American Community Survey Estimates there were 434
female-headed households in the City of Capitola, of which 225 have children under the
age of 18. These numbers account for appoximately 10 percent and 5 percent,
repectively, of all households in the City. Table 2.21 shows the number of female-headed
households in Captiola. In the County, there are 10,013 female-headed households with
no husband present, of which 5,574 have children under the age of 18. Thse numbers
                                           Chapter 2-20

account for appoximately 11 percent and 6 percent respectively, of all households in the
County. The percentage of female-headed households within the City is lower than that of
the County as a whole.

In households with young children in which the single-parent, or both parents in a two-
parent, work, convenient and affordable childcare is a necessity. According to the Santa
Cruz County Child Care Needs Priorities for 2014, Capitola is a Priority 2 for Santa Cruz
County General Child Care and Development Local Planning Council Priorities. The Santa
Cruz County Child Care Needs Priorities for 2014 also found that no subsidized child care
existed within City limits. Table 2.22 below shows the child care expansion priorities for
Santa Cruz County. Approximately 7 percent of children age 0-12 that are qualified for the
Child Care and Development/California State Preschool Program are served in Capitola.
There are currently two licensed family day care facilities in Capitola with a total capacity of
74. Neither facility take children younger than 2 years of age.While the surrounding areas
of Aptos and Live Oak offer elementary schools, they cannot meet the demand for child
care for children ages 0-23 months. Therefore, there is a definite need for additional child
care facilities to meet the needs of the City’s younger population.

According to the City of Capitola Municipal Code (17.03.242) a “Family day care home” is
a home that regularly provides care, protection, and supervision for fourteen or fewer
children in the provider’s own home, for periods of less than twenty-four hours per day”.
Family day care homes can be large or small providing care for up to 14 children in a large
home, and up to eight children in a small home if certain criteria are met. By State law
small family day care homes are principally permitted in all zones without the need for a
                                                            Chapter 2-21

 use permit or local business license. In Capitola all large family day care homes require a
 Large Family Day Care Home permit from the City. There are no zoning districts that allow
 large family day care homes as a principally permitted use. Child care centers are not
 provided for under Capitola’s current municipal code.
 The Housing Element provides for the needs of this group through policies that promote
 maintenance and construction of affordable housing, specifically in areas close to
 commercial districts and transportation corridors, as well as programs to improve the
 availability of affordable child care. The City’s Density Bonus Ordinance also provides
 specific incentives to encourage the development of child care facilities in conjunction with
 new affordable housing projects.
VII.     Farm Workers
 The special housing needs of many agricultural workers stem from their lower wages and
 the insecure nature of their employment. Estimates of the "farm worker" population in the
 City are extrapolated from individuals who categorize their employment as "Agriculture,
 Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, and Mining” in the 2009-2013 American Community Survey
 Estimates. This category also includes people who work in such non-agricultural fields as
 boating, veterinary services, and landscape and horticultural. Based on these estimates,
 there are 36 persons, approximately 0.7 percent of the City’s population, engaged in this
 broad category of agricultural employment.
 There are no designated agricultural uses in or immediately adjacent to Capitola. Persons
 employed in this broad category are most likely associated with fishing or boating activities
 at the nearby Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor, forestry activities in the nearby state parks,
 or landscape and horticultural jobs. Consequently, farm workers are not expected to be a
 significant special needs group in Capitola.
VIII.    People and Families Who are Homeless
 During the past decade, homelessness has become an increasingly reported problem
 throughout the State. Factors contributing to the rise in homelessness included the
 general lack of housing affordable to low-, very low-, and extremely low-income persons,
 an increased number of persons whose incomes fall below the poverty level, reductions in
 public subsidies to the poor, and the de-institutionalization of people with mental illness
 without adequate support services necessary for independent living.
 The 2013 Santa Cruz County Homeless Census and Survey, completed by Applied Survey
 Research, found that there were approximately 1 homeless person in Capitola (see Table
 2.24). The homeless population in Capitola represents approximately 0.3 percentof the
 total homeless population in Santa Cruz County in 2013. It is unclear from the 2013
 Survey the age, sex or personal needs of the homeless persons in Capitola. Based on the
 results of this survey the City of Capitola has an unmet need for one shelter beds. Five
 supportive housing units have been developed as a part of the Bay Avenue Senior
 Apartments project. These five units have been set aside to serve seniors with mental
 illness who are at risk of homelessness. As defined by State Law, this satisfies the need
                                           Chapter 2-22

for homeless shelter beds in Capitola. The multi-jurisdictional Homeless Action
Partnership – Continuum of Care would address any future needs of homeless residents.

         The Continuum of Care Program9:
The needs of homeless families and individuals are as varied as the reasons for their
homelessness. Homeless people may have insufficient employment and credit history to
obtain housing. Even with employment, the high cost of housing may preclude a homeless
person from obtaining housing or cause them to cycle in and out of homelessness. Taken
from a countywide perspective, the demographic portrait that emerges is one of diversity.
People who are homeless come from a wide range of backgrounds, and require a range of
housing and supportive services. The Continuum of Care Services in Santa Cruz County
are broken down into the following four basic areas of service:
             Prevention
             Emergency Shelter
             Transitional Housing
             Permanent and Supportive Affordable Housing
The following is a listing of the programs currently available in Santa Cruz County under
these basic service areas:
         Prevention:
        Santa Cruz County’s Human Services Department and Santa Cruz AIDS project
         provides people with HIV/AIDS emergency assistance with rent and utilities;
        Santa Cruz Community Action Board’s Shelter Project provides rental and mortgage
         assistance;
        Families in Transition provides rental assistance to potentially homeless individuals
         and families who participate in case management;
        Catholic Charities, The Salvation Army, and Valley Churches United Mission all
         provide emergency rental assistance;
        California Rural Legal Assistance provides legal assistance for low-income housing
         and landlord problems; and
9 Information on the Continuum of Care services was provided by the Santa Cruz County Homeless Action Partnership.
                                                         Chapter 2-23

       Housing Authority of the County of Santa Cruz provides security deposit assistance.
        Emergency Shelter:
The emergency shelter system is comprised of various short-term housing options
including permanent shelters with services and case management, temporary winter
shelters, and motel vouchers for those with medical emergencies. Some shelters serve
special groups, such as families, youth or severely mentally ill adults, while others serve
the general homeless population.
According to the County’s updated 10-Year Plan to End Homelessness (now called “All-In:
Toward a Home for Every County Resident”), the County has 353 year-round emergency
shelter beds and 100 seasonal beds at the National Guard Armory for winter months.
        Transitional Housing:
Transitional housing provides time-limited housing, at least six months as defined in
Housing Element law, to prepare individuals and families to become fully self-sufficient. In
addition to housing, programs typically include comprehensive and intensive supportive
services, case management, housing placement services and aftercare.
Currently the County has approximately 289 transitional housing beds. Interim resources
also include programs for specific populations such as families, single adults, seriously
mentally ill adults, pregnant women, persons fleeing domestic violence, and veterans.
        Permanent and Supportive Affordable Housing:
Availability of permanent affordable housing is critical to the success of a Continuum of
Care system. Unless they can access permanent housing, homeless people cannot reach
their goal of becoming permanently self-sufficient. Because homeless people typically
have extremely low- or non-incomes, those ready for self-sufficient lives often need some
form of affordable subsidized housing. This includes Public Housing, Housing Choice
(Section 8) Vouchers, Single Room Occupancy units and site-based programs often
targeted to disabled individuals or families.
According to the County’s updated 10-Year Plan to End Homelessness, approximately 39
percent of housing resources (406 beds) are permanent, including 99 rapid rehousing
beds and 307 permanent supportive housing beds. Most permanent supportive housing
beds are now set-aside for persons experiencing chronic homelessness, including those
with medical vulnerabilities. Many of the rapid rehousing beds are targeted to rehouse
families with children. A growing number of the permanent housing programs use a
Housing First strategy, which is a best practice program model that provides housing
quickly with minimal preconditions and then provides services as needed.
        Capitola Actions to Assist People Who are Homeless:
Capitola recognizes the diversity of needs of homeless people. Therefore, the City
participates in inter-jurisdictional efforts to comprehensively address the needs of people
                                            Chapter 2-24

who are homeless. Capitola is a participating jurisdiction in the Santa Cruz County
Homeless Action Partnership (HAP) - Continuum of Care, a collaboration of the five
jurisdictions in Santa Cruz County which funds activities that further the goal of addressing
homelessness in the community, including funding winter shelter programs and conducting
a biannual homeless census and survey.
Although there are no homeless shelters or transitional housing projects currently located
in Capitola the City does provide direct financial support to a number of agencies that
provide social services to people and families who are homeless. The City provides
community service grants annually to a number of non-profit organizations who provide
services to homeless individuals. Grant amounts vary by organization and annual City
general fund availability. The majority of grants provided are less than $10,000 per year.
To decrease the frequency of homelessness, the City has also developed of the Bay
Avenue Senior Apartments, which includes 50 units for extremely low-income seniors and
30 very-low income seniors. 39 of these units are set aside for chronically ill seniors and
five of the units, with funding through the Mental Health Services Act, serves extremely
low-income seniors with mental illness who are homeless or who are at risk of becoming
homeless.
In accordance with SB 2 Capitola permits homeless shelters in the Industrial Park (IP)
zoning district. The City has also amended the Zoning Code to treat transitional and
supportive housing as a residential use and only subject to restrictions that apply to other
residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
Capitola requires conditional use permits for many uses in many of its zoning districts. For
example, nearly all uses in the CC Community Commercial zoning districts require
conditional use permits. Although Capitola has not received or processed an application
for a homeless shelter use permit, based on typical use permit requirements, such a use
would likely be reviewed and conditioned similarly to any use that includes group activities.
For example, the adequacy of parking supply, noise, exterior lighting, and other site
considerations would likely be reviewed.
                                          Chapter 2-25
        Homeless Shelters
To meet the requirements of SB 2, the City amended the Zoning Code to permit
emergency shelters by-right in the Industrial Park (IP) zoning district. The IP zone includes
a total of 6.37 acres in eight parcels. Four of the parcels (approximately 2.17 acres) are
vacant or underutilized and demonstrate that sufficient land is available for at least one
emergency shelter to accommodate the City’s identified homeless need. The City may
apply objective development standards to encourage and facilitate the use as provided
under Government Code Section 65583(a)(4)(A).
        Transitional and Supportive Housing Programs
Capitola also amended the Zoning Code to treat transitional and supportive housing a
residential use of property, subject only to the same restricitions that apply to other
residential dwellings of the same type in the same zoning district.

C.       Housing Characteristics
A housing unit is defined as a house, apartment, mobile home, or a single room occupied
as a separate living quarters or, if vacant, intended for occupancy as a separate living
quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately
from any other persons in the building and which have direct access from the outside of
the building or through a common hall. A community's housing stock is the compilation of
all its housing units.
Housing Growth
Most of Capitola’s housing was built between 1970 and 1980. During this decade, the
number of housing units in the City increased by 53 percent, from 2,536 units to 4,794. By
1990, construction rates in the City had begun to slow; there were 5,282 housing units in
1990 according to the Census, a 10 percent increase from 1980. By 2000, Capitola was
nearly built-out. Between 2009 and 2014 an additional 32 units were built, and 16 units
were built that involved the demolition of an existing unit. According to the U.S. Census,
from 2000 to 2010 there was an increase of 155 housing units in Capitola for a total of
5,534 housing units. As seen in Table 2.25, although there has been an increase in the
number of total housing units, the number of occupied housing units has decreased from
2000 to 2010. The slowing rate of construction during the last decade is primarily due to
the fact that most of the vacant, easily developable parcels in the City were built-out during
the prior decades.

Housing Type
The majority of Capitola’s housing units are multi-family attached units. As summarized in
Table 2.26 below, single-family detached homes comprise only 36 percent of the housing
stock, with another 10 percent that is single-family attached (townhomes with independent
exterior walls and utilities). In comparison, 65 percent of the County’s housing units are
single family detached homes, which is due in part to the rural nature of much of the
County’s land area.
In the 2009-2013 American Community Survey Estimates, multi-family developments with
20 or more units in a structure comprised nearly 8 percent of Capitola’s housing stock,
compared to 6 percent for the County and 12 percent statewide. Capitola also has a larger
percentage of mobile home units, 13 percent compared to 6 percent for the County and
only 4 percent statewide. Mobile homes in Capitola are installed in eight mobile home
parks varying in size from 36 to 114 units (Table 2.27). The relative proportion of the
City’s housing units in each type of structure is shown in Figure 2-6 below.

Age and Condition of Housing Stock
Most homes begin to exhibit signs of decay when they approach 30 years of age.
Common repairs needed include new roofs, wall plaster and stucco. Homes 30 years or
over with deferred maintenance require more substantial repairs, such as new siding,
plumbing or multiple repairs to the roof, walls, etc. According to the 2009-2013 American
                                                      Chapter 2-28
Community Survey approximately 77 percent of Capitola’s housing stock is over 30 years
old. (Table 2.27).

Understanding the aging character of its housing stock, the City of Capitola undertook a
comprehensive housing conditions survey in 2002. The survey was funded by a
Community Development Block Grant and conducted by Applied Survey Research (ASR)
under a contract with the City. ASR walked every neighborhood of the City, manually
recording exterior housing conditions observed.
Based on these criteria, ASR found that 94 percent of the traditional wood framed and/or
masonry homes in Capitola are in sound condition, although many homes need minor
improvements or renovation. The most obvious type of needed improvement was exterior
siding and stucco. Homes with minor or moderate repair needs were generally scattered
throughout the community.
The mobile homes in Capitola were found to be generally in good repair, but almost all
were found to need some minor to moderate repairs, such as roof replacement, painting or
window repair. From 2007 to 2014, the City’s rehabilitation loan and grant program has
assisted 10 mobile homes that needed substantial repairs or replacement.
The City’s eight mobile home parks also contain significant infrastructure systems that in
many cases are in need of upgrades. As the parks are subdivided, or purchased by non-
profits or resident controlled cooperatives, the infrastructure needs should be carefully
evaluated so that appropriate upgrades or replacement reserves can be included as a part
of the project’s new financing arrangements.
Capitola has been actively working to maintain its existing housing stock. It operates a
rehabilitation program that offers financial assistance to eligible homeowners for home
maintenance and rehabilitation. Eligible owners of single-family homes and mobile homes
can take advantage of this program. The City’s continued commitment to these programs
is discussed in Chapter 6 of this Element. Between 2007 and 2014, six household were
assisted through the Housing Rehabilitation Program.

Housing Costs
Housing costs are driven by the price of raw land, infrastructure costs (e.g. sewer and
water), construction costs, supply relative to demand, and financing costs. The
diminishing supply of developable land in Capitola, the built-out nature of the community,
its attractive coastal location, and the level of unmet demand for housing in the entire
region have driven up the cost of both ownership and rental housing in Capitola.
Nevertheless, the City has not been immune to the state-wide and national declines in real
estate prices.
Due to the rapid changes in housing prices, and the changes in market dynamics, the
numbers presented in this section may, at times, be difficult to interpret.
   I.    Ownership Housing
According to the 2009-2013 American Community Survey, approximately 45 percent of the
occupied housing units are owner-occupied. In comparison, in Santa Cruz County,
approximately 59 percent of occupied housing units are owner-occupied.
The value of homes in Capitola varies based on the type, size and location. Recent
listings show prices ranging from $235,000 for a 2 bedroom, 2 bath mobile home; to
$7,995,000 for a 4 bedroom, 5.5 bath home with an oceanfront view10. In July 2014, the
median sale price of a single-family home in Capitola was $1,115,000 according to the
Santa Cruz Association of Realtors (SCAR) (Table 2.28).

Median home values in neighboring Santa Cruz County communities are lower than that of
Capitola, $764,000 in Santa Cruz and $818,000 in Scotts Valley.
 II.     Rental Housing
According to the State’s 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan, “Renters generally show a higher
incidence of housing deficiencies than homeowners, in both total numbers and the
percentage of households experiencing housing problems. Renters have median incomes
just over half as high as owners, are predominantly low-income, and represent a majority
of low-income households.”11

The rental housing market in Capitola is comprised of apartments, condominiums, mobile
homes and single-family homes. Some of the rental units are rented on a short-term basis
as vacation lodging. The 2009-2013 American Community Survey estimates that 528
Capitola dwellings (10 percent of the City’s housing stock) were being used as seasonal,
recreational or occasional units. In 2011, Capitola repealed the City’s Mobile Home Park
Rent Stabilization Ordinance. The City currently has eight mobile home parks which have
all been subdivided and converted to resident cooperatives, or have long-term affordability
agreements with tenants.
III.   Vacancy Rates
The residential vacancy rate, a translation of the number of unoccupied housing units on
the market, is a good indicator of the balance between housing supply and demand in a
community. When the demand for housing exceeds the available supply, the vacancy rate
will be low. Concurrently, a low vacancy rate drives the cost of housing upward to the
disadvantage of prospective buyers or renters.
In a healthy housing market, the vacancy rate would be between 5.0 and 8.0 percent.
These vacant units should be distributed across a variety of housing types, sizes, price
ranges and locations within the City. This allows adequate selection opportunities for
households seeking new residences.
According to the 2009-2013 American Community Survey, Capitola’s owner-occupied units
have a vacancy rate of 2.4 percent and rental units have a rate of 6.3 percent. These
rates indicate that the housing market is somewhat tight with little room for buyers or
renters to find a suitable unit or negotiate a lower purchase or rental price. However,
nearly 18 percent of all the housing units in the City were classified as vacant, according to
the 2009-2013 American Community Survey. Of these vacant units, 56 percent (528 units)
were vacant for seasonal use as either vacation homes or vacation rental properties. In
the county as a whole, more than 5,500 units, or approximately 5 percent of the entire
housing stock in the county, including the cities, were vacant for seasonal use as vacation
homes or rentals. Occupancy status of housing units in Capitola and Santa Cruz County
are shown in Table 2.30 below.

IV.    Household Tenure
According to the 2009-2013 American Community Survey, there were 4,308 occupied
housing units in Capitola. Of these, 55 percent were renter-occupied and 45 percent were
owner-occupied. It is important to note that a relatively high number of multi-family rental
housing units exist in Capitola.
 V.    Housing Affordability and Overpayment
State and Federal standards for housing overpayment are based on an income-to-housing
cost ratio of 30 percent and above. The cost of housing includes: rent or mortgage
payments, utilities (e.g. water, sewer, electric, gas), taxes and insurance. Households
spending more than 30 percent of their incomes on housing have limited remaining income
for other necessities such as food, clothing, and health care. Upper income households
are generally capable of spending a larger proportion of their incomes on housing. Figure
2-9 below shows that the many of households in the lower income ranges paid over 30
percent of their incomes on housing.

    Source: 2009-2013 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates
Among lower income households, a greater proportion of renters overpaid than
homeowners. Fewer than half of the higher income households paid over 30 percent of
their incomes on housing, however most of those overpaying in this group were
homeowners.
The prevalence of overpayment among lower income renters indicates a significant need
for more rental housing affordable to the City’s low and very low income households. A
study released in April 2009 by the National Low Income Housing Coalition “Out of Reach
2009” found that Santa Cruz County is the seventh most expensive rental market in the
nation.
The Fair Market Rent (FMR) in Santa Cruz County for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,597
in 2014. In order to afford this level of rent and utilities, without paying more than 30% of
income on housing, a household must earn $5,324 monthly or $63,880 annually.
Assuming a 40-hour work week, 52 weeks per year, this level of income translates into a
Housing Wage of $33.27.
Tables 2.31 and 2.32 summarize the information on housing tenure, median home values,
rent, and housing cost as a percentage of income, for households in Capitola. Cost
Burden Greater than 30 percent means that the cost of rent is over 30 percent of the
renter’s income.

Table 2.33 estimates the maximum sales prices and rents affordable to very low, low, and
moderate income households in Capitola by family size. In each case, the maximum
monthly payment is equal to 30 percent of monthly household income and includes the
cost of utilities. For example, in 2014 a four-person household that is very low-income
could rent a housing unit for no more than $1,164 per month, and would be able to
purchase a unit at a maximum sales price of $162,500. Likewise, a four-person moderate
income household could afford to purchase a $364,800 home or rent a unit for up to
$2,610 per month.

D. Assisted Housing
State law requires the City to identify, analyze, and propose programs to preserve housing
units that are currently deed restricted to low income families and will possibly be lost as
low-income housing as these deed restrictions expire.
Description of At-Risk Projects
No currently assisted housing units in the City of Capitola have been identified as “at-risk”
of converting from low-income use to market rate. The majority of the current assisted
housing units have been built in recent years and have at least 55-years of affordability
required as a part of their original financing agreements.
Capitola Gardens, a 78 unit low-income housing development on 46th Avenue was
restricted to low-income senior households for the first 20 years following its construction.
This project, however, was converted to non-assisted housing once its original federal
funding and affordability requirements expired in December of 1999. This was Capitola’s
only example of an “at-risk” assisted housing project. When the project’s affordability
requirements expired in 1999 the Housing Authority of Santa Cruz County was able to
provide enhanced Section 8 vouchers (tenant-based rental assistance) to all income-
eligible households in the project. These vouchers have allowed the residents to either
stay in place as continuing residents of Capitola Gardens, or to use their voucher to move
to other housing. Since 1999 Capitola Gardens has continued under private ownership.
Although the current residents were provided with Section 8 vouchers to protect their rental
assistance status, as of January, 2000 Capitola, has lost the 78 units of the Capitola
Gardens Apartments as permanently affordable housing units. As of March 2009 only 44
                                                           Chapter 2-35

of the 78 units in the Capitola Gardens project continue to be rented with households
utilizing the Section 8 vouchers that ensure affordability.
Mobile Home Parks in Capitola
Mobile home parks provide another important source of affordable housing for Capitola
and should be discussed as a separate form of “at-risk” housing. As a tourist and
retirement oriented beach community Capitola developed over time with a large number of
small cottage homes and a mobile home parks. The City today continues to host a total of
eight parks serving a total of 681 households. In 1994 the City adopted the Mobile Home
Park Rent Stabilization Program. During the 2009-2014 Planning Period the ordinance
was repealed.
The City currently has eight mobile parks. One park, Pacific Cover, was closed in 2012
due to a flood in 2011 and all of its residents were relocated. All 8 remaining mobile parks
have been subdivided and converted into resident cooperatives or have long-term
affodability agreements with tenants. The City encourage continued affordability with a $2
million loan to the Castle Mobile Home Park in 2011 to assist in the formation of a non-
profit cooperative and to provide rehabilitation assistance.
From past experience, a transition to cooperative/non-profit ownership offers the highest
likelihood of preserving long-term affodability. The subdivision of a park also offers some
protections to the current residents and provides affordable ownership opportunities
consistent with the City’s Inclusionary Housing Policy.
There is a concern that another option would be that one or more of the rental parks could
close in the future and be converted to other uses. The closure of a park could cause the
potential loss of housing stock that currently serves low and moderate-income residents.
In the case of a park closure the City will ensure that :
        - The park closure is consistent with applicable sections of City Municipal Code.
        - The closure is consistent with relevant state law.
Inventory of Affordable Housing Not at-Risk
There are seven other affordable housing developments in the City. The majority of these
projects were constructed with assistance from the City. None of these projects are at risk
during this planning period, and the majority of the projects will remain affordable
indefinitely. A summary of these projects is provided below:
   I.   Shorelife Church Neighborhood Manor
A 20-unit rental property owned by Shorelife Community Church. Rents are below-market
and some units are rented to households who have Section 8 rental assistance. The
church generally fills vacancies with households referred to them by local social agencies,
such as the Housing Authority and the Skills Center, with a preference for disabled,
elderly, or low-income students and church staff. Because these units are owned by a
nonprofit agency, they are expected to remain affordable indefinitely.
                                          Chapter 2-36

  II.   Grace Street Apartments
This 12-unit apartment project built in 1997 is managed and owned by the Housing
Authority of the County of Santa Cruz. Rents are affordable and units are limited to
occupancy by low and very low-income households. Because these units are owned by a
nonprofit agency, they are expected to remain affordable indefinitely.
 III.   Bay Avenue Senior Apartments (750 Bay Avenue)
Until September, 2008 this apartment complex was owned by the Salvation Army and was
know as the Silvercrest Apartments. The 96 unit complex was rented at rates affordable to
low -income senior households but no long-term affordability requirements were recorded
against the property. Having been built in the 1970s the six building complex was nearing
the end of its useful life and was in drastic need of major rehabilitation work.
In September of 2008 the property was purchased by First Community Housing, a non-
profit affordable housing developer. Major rehabilitation and new construction plans have
been approved by the City and construction was begun in January 2009. The $28 million
dollar acquisition, rehabilitation and new construction project will be carried out in four
phases of construction in order to avoid having to relocate any existing residents off site.
The completed project contains a total of 109 units for seniors and has a 55-year
affordability requirement. 50 of the units are restricted to extremely low-income senior
households, 30 units have been restricted to very low-income senior households, 28 units
have been restricted to low-income senior households and one, 2-bedroom unit serves as
the manager’s unit and will not be restricted. 39 units in the development have been set
aside to serve seniors who need assistance with certain activities of daily living and qualify
under the State’s definition of Chronically Ill. During the last planning period, First
Community Housing worked in participation with the County of Santa Cruz to provide
assistance through the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) program to set aside five units
to serve extremely low-income seniors with mental illness who are homeless or at risk of
homelessness.
 IV.    Habitat for Humanity Project (38th and Brommer)
Six very low-income dwellings constructed for very low-income first-time homebuyers in
1999. The Capitola Redevelopment Agency (RDA) provided the land, and a CDBG grant
to help with cost related to infrastructure improvements. These ownership units will remain
affordable in perpetuity and are not at risk of losing their affordability restrictions.
  V.    Dakota Apartments Accessible Housing
The 25 accessible rental unit project located at Clares/Capitola Road was constructed in
2000. The rentals are available for very low-income households with one or more persons
affected by mobility impairment/traumatic brain injury. The project used funding from the
Capitola Redevelopment Agency’s Housing Fund, HOME Program Income Re-Use Funds,
and the HUD 811 program. The development is owned by the National Handicapped
                                          Chapter 2-37

Housing Institute, a nonprofit agency, and restrictions ensure that the units will remain
affordable in perpetuity.
 VI.    Loma Vista Mobile Home Park Resident Acquisition
This project is an existing 90-space mobile home park that was purchased by a resident-
owned cooperative in 2000. The project was funded with assistance from the
Redevelopment Agency’s Housing Fund, CDBG funds and the State’s Mobile home Park
Resident Ownership Project (MPROP). The mobile home park lots are owned by the
cooperative and the homes are owned by the individual residents. These lots are bound
by a covenant which allows the lots to be sold only to senior households with incomes at or
below 120 percent of the Area Median Income.
VII.    Wharf Road Manor Mobile Home Park residents Acquisition
This project is an existing 36-space mobile home park that was purchased by a resident-
owned cooperative in 2006. The project was funding with assistance from the
Redevelopment Agency’s Housing Fund, HOME Program Re-Use funds and the State’s
Mobile home Park Resident Ownership Program (MPROP). The mobile home park lots
are owned by the cooperative and the homes are owned by the individual residents. 34 of
the lots are restricted to moderate income households with incomes at or below 100
percent of the area median income. Two units in the park were newly constructed in 2006
with the assistance of HOME Program Re-use Funds. These two units are regulated
under the City’s Inclusionary Housing Program and are resale restricted to remain
affordable for low-income households.
VIII.   Inclusionary Housing Units
Beginning in 2004 the City passed an Inclusionary Housing Ordinance which requires that
15 percent of the units in any new construction ownership project of seven units or more
be made permanently affordable to low or moderate-income households. During the 2009-
2014 planning period, one inclusionary housing unit was constructed at Pearson Court, a
10-unit single-family development.
The City of Capitola has complemented its Inclusionary Housing Ordinance with its First
Time Homebuyer program as a way to assist the developer with the marketing of the
inclusionary units so that they do not become a burden to the project but actually offer a
marketing advantage.
The City’s Inclusionary Housing Program was designed only to require inclusionary units in
the case of for-sale developments of seven units or more. Rental housing developments
and projects of six units or less do not have an inclusionary requirement. However, as
several projects have been developed since the Inclusionary Ordinance was adopted, the
program has not discouraged housing development or caused a significant overall
increase in the sales prices of the market rate units. Clearly the program has assisted in
the development of permanently affordable housing units that would not have otherwise
been developed in the community.

CHAPTER 3: CONSTRAINTS ON HOUSING PRODUCTION
A variety of factors add to the cost of housing in Capitola and constrain the provision of
affordable units. These factors include: the market, governmental constraints and
environmental considerations. Moreover, housing goals may at times conflict with the
need to promote other important City goals, such as the desire to provide open space and
recreational facilities, protect environmental and historic resources, and maintain current
service levels.
State law requires the housing element to analyze potential and actual governmental and
nongovernmental constraints to the productions, maintenance, and improvement of
housing for all persons of all income levels, including persons with disabilities. This
chapter analyzes the following three potential constraints:
    A. Market Constraints
    B. Governmental Constraints
    C. Environmental Constraints
A. Market Constraints
The high cost of building new housing in Capitola is at least partially due to the scarcity
and high cost of developable land. High materials costs and labor costs also contribute to
the high cost of housing development. Capitola’s beach-front setting and commutable
distance from Silicon Valley has also allowed many existing and new Capitola homes to
sell and rent at higher than average levels. No units affordable to low- or moderate-
income buyers or renters are being developed with the exception of the required
Inclusionary Housing units, and units that are being built by non-profit developers with the
assistance of federal, state and local government programs. The only possible exception
to this would be the development of Secondary Dwelling Units that, by the nature of their
small size, are most likely renting at rates that are affordable to low- and moderate-income
households.

Land Costs
In Capitola the City is mostly built-out with vacant, single-family zoned lots are almost non-
existant. In January 2015 only one substandard-sized lot was listed for sale for $549,000.
Because of the built-out nature of Capitola new development is almost invariably requires
the acquisition and redevelopment of prospective in-fill sites. Developing on prospective
sites is often more expensive and difficult due to increased acquisition costs, demolition or
rehabilitation of existing buildings, and the possible need to remove toxic materials left by
earlier uses on the site. Because most new residential construction is taking place on sites
that contain some existing residential units the net increase of new units is often greatly
reduced.
Utilization of available state and federal funding can counterbalance the constraint of high
land costs to some extent. The involvement of State or Federal funds, however, also
dramatically increases the cost of new development in that the use of these funds triggers
the need to comply with both federal and state relocation laws and prevailing wage
regulations. Relocation costs in some instances can be nearly as high as the original cost
of site acquisition.
Allowing for increased densities through the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance and
Affordable Housing Overlay are important tools to reduce the per unit cost of land in the
case of developments that include affordable housing units. These ordinances are actually
more successful in lowering per unit land costs than are across-the- board zoning changes
that allow density increases. Typical zoning changes that allow increased density often
cause an increase in the sales price of the property in that zone. The Density Bonus and
Affordable Housing Overlay, on the other hand, only allow an increase in density in
exchange for guaranteed levels of affordability and therefore do not tend to cause an
increase in the sales price of the land.
Construction Costs
Development costs for housing can vary significantly, depending on the type of housing,
such as single-family, townhomes, and apartments. Even within a particular building type
construction costs can vary by unit size, amenities, materials used and site conditions.
Estimated construction costs in the City of Capitola is $200 per square foot. The costs
have remained steady since 2007.
Included in the cost of development are the costs of building materials. The cost of building
materials varies tremendously depending on the material, quality, style, scale of
construction and shipping costs related to the particular product.
That being said, there are ways of reducing materials cost in certain development
situations. One way to reduce the cost of a demolition/rebuild is to reuse and recycle
materials from the old (demolished) structure. Not only is this measure cost-effective but it
is one of the Green Building methods suggested in the City of Capitola’s Green Building
program. Selecting materials that are manufactured locally can also help save costs while
also helping to reinvest our development dollars in the local economy.
                                           Chapter 3-2

Lower residential construction costs can also be achieved by reducing amenities, quality
and/or type of building materials and by reducing the actual square footage of the homes
being developed. Since 1950’s the square footage of homes has more than doubled in the
United States, according to the National Association of Home Builders, while average
household size has dropped.
Oversized homes require significantly more construction materials than smaller homes,
require more land and use significantly more energy to operate. Reduced square footage
can also allow for a higher density of development on the site and thus reduced per unit
land costs. The City’s efforts to allow higher density housing construction and to
encourage the development of smaller square footage housing units are illustrated in the
Capitola Green Building Program, the Secondary Dwelling Unit Ordinance, and the City’s
Density Bonus and Affordable Housing Overlay Ordinances. The City has also used the
Planned Development zoning process to allow for the development of small units at higher
densities.
The move toward smaller homes is not new to Capitola. Due to the community’s vacation
cottage history many of the City’s single-family lots are less than 4,000 square feet in size
and can accommodate only fairly modest-sized homes. Capitola’s Jewel Box
neighborhood, for example, averages 14 units per acre and the Upper Village
neighborhood average 15 units per acre. Capitola’s zoning ordinances also help to restrict
the size of homes by imposing fairly strict lot coverage, set-back and height requirements
in the single-family zones. In addition, parking requirements for single family homes vary
by house size, thereby further reducing the incentive to build larger homes.
The City of Capitola also contains a total of eight existing mobile home parks that have
been developed at an average of about 10 units per acre with relatively small individual
units. While the development of new parks is not being pursued the preservation of these
existing parks is seen as an important part of maintaining our existing homes that are
modest in size and higher than average in density. As the older manufactured homes and
mobile homes in the City’s existing parks age we are working to provide financial
assistance to park residents who are interested in upgrading their homes with new
manufactured homes.
                                          Chapter 3-3

Financing
Mortgage interest rates have a large influence over the affordability of housing. Increases
in interest rates decrease the number of persons able to afford a home purchase.
Decreases in interest rates result in more potential homebuyers introduced into the market.
National policies and economic conditions determine interest rates, and there is little that
local governments can do to affect these rates. Jurisdictions can however, “leverage”
funds by offering interest rate write-downs to extend home purchase opportunities to lower
income households. In addition, government insured loan programs may be available to
reduce mortgage down payment requirements.
First time homebuyers are the most impacted by financing requirements. Mortgage interest
rates for new home purchases ranged from 3.5 percent to 5 percent for a fixed 30 year
loan in 2013. Lower initial rates may be available with Graduated Payment Mortgages
(GPMs), Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs), and Buy-Down Mortgages. However,
variable interest rate mortgages on affordable homes may increase to the point that
interest rates exceed the cost of living adjustments, which is a constraint on affordability.
Although interest rates are currently considered low, they can change significantly and
substantially impact the affordability of the housing stock.
Stricter lending standards can pose a constraint to affordable housing. An increase in one
percentage point can make a monthly payment out of reach for many lower income
households.
A critical impediment to homeownership involves both the affordability of the housing stock
and the ability of potential buyers to fulfill down payment requirements. Typically,
conventional home loans will require 80 percent loan-to-value and represents the largest
contraint to homebuyers. Other programs, such as those for first-time homebuyers, can
find downpayment requirements between 5 and 20 percent. However, more recent events
in the housing market have made it more difficulty for prospective home buyers to secure a
home loan.
One of the greatest impediments to homeownership, however, is credit worthiness.
According to the Federal Housing Authority, lenders consider a person’s debt-to-income
ratio, cash available for down payment, and credit history, when determining a maximum
loan amount. Many financial institutions are willing to significantly decrease down payment
requirements and increase loan amounts to persons with good credit rating. Persons with
poor credit ratings may be forced to accept a higher interest rate or a loan amount
insufficient to purchase a house. Poor credit rating can be especially damaging to lower-
income residents, who have fewer financial resources with which to qualify for a loan. The
FHA is generally more flexible than conventional lenders in its qualifying guidelines and
allows many residents to re-establish a good credit history.
Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to
report lending activity by census tract. Table 3.1 below presents the disposition of home
purchase loan applications in 2013 by income of the applicants.

  Notes:
  1 “Originated” refers to loans approved by the lender and accepted by the applicant.
  2 “Other” includes applications approved but not accepted, filed for incompleteness, and applications withdrawn.
The data shown in Table 3.1 is the Santa Cruz – Watsonville SMA, which includes the City
of Capitola. The data includes purchases of one to hour unit homes as manufactured
homes. Over 80 percent of the loan applications were received from middle to upper
income households based on median family income (MFI) standards.
Down Payments and Move-In Costs
The ability to accumulate a down payment remains a formidable barrier to many potential
homebuyers. Low- and moderate-income households find it difficult to make the transition
from rental to ownership units because they cannot accumulate a down payment while
renting. In an effort to make homeownership more possible for buyers, the City received a
Community Development Block Grant to reinstate funding for the Mortgage Assistance
Program (also known as the First-Time Homebuyer Program). The program is designed to
assist low-income Capitola residents with puchasing a home. It is anticipated that the
program will be available for qualifying Capitola households in 2015.
The difficulty is that market rate home sales prices in the Capitola area are so high that the
City’s “gap” financing is not typically able to make up the difference. This means that the
City’s First-Time Homebuyer Program is used almost exclusively to assist in the purchase
of mobile homes and condominiums that already have some level of affordability already
built into the sale price via the City’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance or through other
forms of City involvement such as the provision of financial assistance in the cooperative
conversion of mobile home parks.
Low-income households may also be unable to obtain rental housing because they cannot
accrue the necessary security deposits and first and last months’ rent. The City’s Security
Deposit Program also administered by the Housing Authority provides low-income
households with deposit assistance up to one month’s rent. The funds are considered a
loan during the time that the renter occupies the unit.
                                                                 Chapter 3-5

B. Governmental Constraints
Housing affordability is influenced by factors in both the private and public sectors. Actions
by the City and by the surrounding jurisdictions influence the amount of housing
developed; its type, form, location, and ultimate price. Land use controls, site
improvement requirements, building codes, fees and other local programs intended to
improve the overall quality of housing may have the additional consequence of serving as
a constraint to housing development.
Land Use Controls
The Capitola General Plan and Zoning Ordinance provide for a range of housing types and
densities. Residential uses are permitted in the following zones:
                       Table 3.2: Capitola Development Requirements

  I.    R-1 (Single Family Residence)
Permits one dwelling unit on a lot. The lot shall be a minimum 5,000 square feet in size (or
less if an existing legally created lot), averaging 8.5 units per acre. Floor Area Ratio is on
a sliding scale based on lot size. Front yards for the first floor shall be a minimum of 15’ in
depth; side yards shall be 10 percent of lot width with a minimum of 3 feet and rear yards
shall be equal to not less than 20 percent of the lot depth to a maximum of 25 feet. Height
                                             Chapter 3-6

limit is 25 feet. Single family dwellings and small community care residential and family
day care homes are principally permitted. Architectural and Site Review is required for
new construction and substantial additions. Secondary Dwelling Units are allowed in the
R-1 zoning district on lots of 5,000 square feet or larger.
   II.   R-M (Multiple-Family)
RM-LM (Low-Medium Density) zone permits one unit per a minimum site area of 4,400
square feet; average density is 7.5 units per acre; maximum height is 30 feet. RM-M
(Medium Density) zone permits one unit per a minimum site area of 2,900 square feet;
average density is 12.5 units per acre; maximum height is 30 feet. RM-H (High Density)
permits one unit per a minimum site area of 2,200 square feet; average density is 17.5
units per acre; maximum height is 35 feet. Single family dwellings, multi-family dwelling
and small community-care residential and small family day care homes are principally
permitted. Architectural and Site Review is required for new construction and substantial
additions. Minimum lot size is 5,100 square feet, and maximum lot coverage/ structure
footprint is 40 percent. Minimum setbacks are 15 feet for the front yard, 10 percent of lot
width for side yards, and 15 percent of lot depth for rear yard. Requirements include that
50 percent of the rear yard must be usable open space and that 48 square feet of private
open space be provided for each unit. Secondary Dwelling Units are allowed in the R-M
zoning district where a single-family dwelling exists.
  III.   Affordable Housing Overlay Ordinance
The City has adopted an Affordable Housing Overlay Ordinance which allows additional
densities up to 20 units per acre in all R-M (Multi-Residential) Districts. This increased
density is allowed in on designated Opportunity Sites in the RM zoned districts with the
provision of at least 50 percent affordability. The Affordable Housing Overlay will
encourage rehabilitation and in-fill development on qualified sites in a way that may help
preserve existing affordable but unrestricted housing on the sites and provide long-term
affordability for both the existing homes and the new units developed.
 IV.     TRO-Transient Rental Use Overlay District
Permits transient rental use in the Central Village District and a small portion of Riverview
Avenue which is an R-1 zoned district subject to a conditional use permit. The conditional
use permit establishes parking and occupancy requirements for these facilities.
   V.    C-V Central Village District
This is a mixed use residential/commercial district located in the community’s historic
village district. Residential is principally permitted on the first and second floors. There
are six residential overlay areas within the CV district that allow only residential uses.
Weekly rentals are permitted in the zone; and motels/hotels are permitted with a
conditional use permit. In the CV zone, there is no minimum lot area per unit; density is
only indirectly limited by need to meet parking requirements. In the CV residential overlay
districts, allowable lot coverage/footprints range from 70 percent to 90 percent for building
and parking areas. There are no minimum setback/yard areas, except that 10 percent of
                                            Chapter 3-7

the lot is to be landscaped. Maximum height is 27 feet, and architectural and site review is
required.
 VI.    C-R Commercial Residential District
This is a mixed-use commercial/residential area. Mixed-use development, which includes
a combination of residential with commercial and/or retail uses. Residential is principally
permitted as a single family dwelling. Second Units are allowed on lots developed with a
single family dwelling, subject to design and development standards. This zoning district
has very flexible development standards; there is no specific maximum lot coverage or
minimum lot area per unit, and no minimum front, side or rear setbacks. Any setbacks are
determined through Architectural and Site Review and based on desired relationship to
street and adjacent uses. Maximum height is 27 feet, and parking requirements must be
satisfied. The District allows mixed-use residential development as a conditional use.
VII.    C-N Commercial Neighborhood District
This is a neighborhood commercial district that permits single family residential and
residential/commercial mixed use development as principal permitted uses. Multifamily
residential is permitted with a conditional use permit. Again, this district has permissive
development standards: there is no specific maximum lot coverage or minimum lot area
per unit, density is indirectly controlled by the need to meet parking requirements.
Required setbacks are 15 feet at the front, 10 percent of lot width for the sides and rear set
back requirement is 10 feet for commercial developments and 20 percent of lot depth for
residential projects.
VIII.   CC Community Commercial District
This zoning district accommodates community and regional commercial uses, with most
CC zoning areas located along major transportation corridors. The CC zoning district was
amended to allow for mixed use residential development. Development standards allow a
40-foot maximum height, with no minimum lot area, no density cap, no minimum lot area
per dwelling unit, no maximum lot coverage, and side and rear yard setbacks as
determined through Architectural and Site Review. A minimum landscaped front setback
of 15 feet is required, and parking standards must be met.
 IX.    PO Professional Office District
Residential uses are principally permitted in the PO district, using RM development
standards with density of up to 30 units per acre as a conditional use. Maximum height is
35 feet, and there is no specific minimum lot area required. Maximum lot
coverage/footprint is 40 percent for a one-story structure, 35 percent for two stories, and
30% for three stories. The only required yard is for a front yard at 5 percent of the lot area.
Parking standards must be met, and projects require Architectural and Site Review.
  X.    IP Industrial Park District
Single and multifamily residential uses are conditionally permitted in the IP district.
Maximum height is 30 feet, and there is no specific minimum lot area required. Maximum
                                            Chapter 3-8
lot coverage/footprint is 40 percent for a one-story structure, 35 percent for two stories,
and 30 percent for three stories. The required front yard is 10 percent of the lot area, with
some side setback requirements adjacent to residential uses. Parking standards must be
met, and projects require Architectural and Site Review.
 XI.     PD Planned Development District
This district allows mixed land uses and/or varied dwelling types. Development standards
are flexible, tailored to the constraints of the site and needs of the development. The PD
district approach has proved to be a key tool that has enabled multi-residential developers
to pursue creative, well-designed residential projects with development standards suitable
to the specific site.
XII.     MHE Mobile Home Exclusive District (Chapter 17.12) and Mobile Home Parks
         Ordinance (Chapter 17.90)
The MHE District allows mobilehome parks and related accessory uses as principally
permitted; the only conditionally permitted uses are home occupations, public facilities and
utilities, and single family dwellings located on the mobilehome park parcel or on separate
5,000 square foot parcels. Chapter 17.90 provides specific requirements similar to State
laws that protect the City’s existing mobile home parks from conversion to another use,
through the Relocation Impact Report and other requirements.
XIII.    Condominium Conversion Ordinance
The Condominium Conversion Ordinance regulates the conversion of apartments to
condominiums by requiring conversions involving five or more units to mitigate for the loss
of rental housing through a dedication of on-site affordable units and/or paymment of in-
lieu fees into the City’s Housing Trust Fund.
                                           Chapter 3-9

XIV.     Secondary Dwelling Units
 A Secondary Dwelling Unit Ordinance was approved in 2004. The Ordinance allows
 second units in Single Family Residence District (R-1) on lots of 5,000 square feet or more
 and on lots developed with one single family residential use in the Multiple Family (RM)
 District. Between 2007 and 2014 a total of thirteen (13) Secondary Units have been
 developed. Further modifications to the existing ordinance may need to be considered in
 order to address current parking standards, second story restrictions and set-back
 requirements that may restrain the future development of additional secondary units in
 Capitola.
 XV.     Density Bonus
 The City’s density bonus ordinance permits density bonuses in all residential zones and
 the commercial districts, consistent with Government Code 65915 et sec. The ordinance
 allows density bonuses of up to 35 percent for residential projects consistent with state
 law. In accordance with State law, a density bonus and additional incentives are to be
 provided to those developers who agree to construct a percentage of units affordable to
 very low, lower and moderate income households. The percent of density bonus granted
 is dependent upon the number of affordable units dedicated to the project and the degree
 of affordability of those units.
XVI.     Manufactured Homes
 Manufactured homes offer additional affordable housing opportunities to City residents
 through lowered construction costs. Single-family manufactured housing units and
 modular homes are permitted in all residential districts and manufactured homes are
 allowed in the City’s mobile home parks that are regulated by the State Department of
 Housing and Community Development.
XVII.    Parking
 The City's parking ordinance permits uncovered parking spaces to count toward meeting
 parking requirements. Duplexes and triplexes require a minimum of two parking spaces,
 one which must by covered. Apartments and condominiums of more than four units
 require a minimum of two and one half parking spaces, on which must be covered per unit
 within the site. As a policy of this Housing Element, the City will review the residential
 parking requirements to ensure that they are not excessive nor a constraint to affordable
 housing development. The Planning Commission and City Council have held joint study
 sessions to review residential parking requirements. Current residential parking
 requirements are as follows:
                                          Chapter 3-10

Parking is a constraint on development in Capitola because higher parking requirments
increase develoment costs, and result in more impervious surfaces. The City has taken
steps to reduce the amount of parking requred for certain development, while still
protecting the integrety of existing neighborhoods. Section 17.51.200 of the existing
Capitola Zoning Ordinance allows the Planning Commission to approve “shared parking”
arrangements, upon a determination that the periods of occupancy and use of the
structures/uses in the development(s) are not simultaneous with each other. This sort of
arrangement will likely become more popular in the future as more residential-commercial
mixed-use projects are developed in the CC, CN and CR zoning districts.
Removal of Governmental Constraints
During the 2008-2014 planning period the City adopted a number of different zoning
amendments including procedures for reasonable accommodation and permitting
homeless shelters by-right in the Industrial Park (IP) zoning district. The procedure for
reasonable accommodation removes potential and actual governmental constraints upon
the maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income levels and for
persons with disabilities. Reasonable accommodation provides a basis for residents with
disabilities to request flexibility in the application of land use and zoning regulations or, in
some instances, even a waiver if certain restrictions or requirements from the local
government to ensure equal access to housing opportunities. The emergency shelter
allowance in IP zones gives the opportunity for development of new emergency shelters to
meet the needs of homeless and extrememly low-income residents.
These modifications and additions to the municipal code represent significant actions to
reduce governmental constraints on the development of affordable housing. During the
past planning period the City has also reached the goal of encouraging higher density
residential development through the use of the Planned Development process. These
policies have allowed for the development of new housing units during the past planning
period and will encourage development during the new planning period.
                                            Chapter 3-11

Currently small family child care homes are principally permitted in the R-1, R-M and PO
zoning districts, large family child care homes require a large family day care home permit
(See table below). According to the City of Capitola Municipal Code, Section 17.03.242, a
“small family day care home means a home that provides family day care for up to six
children, or for up to eight children if certain criteria are met.” A “large family day care
home means a home that provides family day care for up to twelve children, or for up to
fourteen children if certain criteria are met.” The permitting of child care centers (defined as
“community care facilities”) is not addressed in Capitola’s current municipal code.

In order to comply with SB 2 the City of Capitola amended the Zoning Code to permit
homeless shelters by-right in the Industrial Park (IP) zoning district and treat transitional
and supportive housing as a residential use only subject to restrictions that apply to other
residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
Development Fees
Development fees that apply to residential development in Capitola are low relative to most
areas in California. There are no parks, transportation, administration, roadside
improvement, childcare, or other infrastructure exactions that apply within the City limits.
In addition to standard planning and building fees, development within the City of Capitola
pays a school impact fee for the Live Oak School District of $2.05 per square foot and the
Soquel Union Elementary School District of $3.20 per square foot. Additionally,
development within the City pays sewer connection, water connection and fire district fees
to other outside agencies. Table 3.6 summarizes the typical fees that would be charged
for a 1,500 square-foot single-family and multi-family dwelling unit.

The City is currently served by two water districts—the Soquel Creek Water District and
the Santa Cruz Water District. The Soquel Water District relies exclusively on available
groundwater while the Santa Cruz Water District partially relies on available groundwater
to serve its customers. In June 2015, the County Board of Supervisors passed strict
restrictions on water use and declared a state of drought emergency. Increases in water
connection fees, which are beyond the City’s control, correlate with the impacts of the
drought and salt water intrusion on the area’s water resources. To support water
conservation, the City of Capitola encourages residents to take advantage of residential
water rebates offered by the Soquel Creek Water District and the Santa Cruz Water
District, including rebates on drip irrigation retrofits, graywater landscaping, turf
replacement, water efficient toilets and washers, and rain catchments.
The Soquel Water District has also implemented the Water Demand Offset (WDO)
Program to allow development to continue while conserving water and minimizing the
impact on the overdrafted groundwater basin. The WDO Policy (Resolution No. 13-17)
requires the development projects to offset 1.6 times the amount of water the project is
projected to use so that there is a "net positive impact" on the District's water supply.The
WDO requirement for a new development is based on the District's water use factor for the
development type (e.g., single-family home, apartment, condominium, office, retail store,
restaurant, etc.) and the size of the new development. A development may reduce the
                                                  Chapter 3-13

WDO requirements by going beyond the water efficiency requirements for toilers,
showerheads, turf, washing machines, etc.
Soquel Creek Water District relies entirely on groundwater for its water supply which is
overpumped and experiencing seawater intrusion, a condition that allows seawater to
enter and contaminate the groundwater supply. The District had been evaluating a joint
Regional Seawater Desalination Project with the City of Santa Cruz since 2007; however,
in August 2013 the City of Santa Cruz "reset" their efforts to gather more community input
on water alternatives. This led the District to initiate looking at back-up supplemental
water supply options should that project no longer be considered. The process was
conducted from September 2013 to August 2014 and included 13 public meetings that
covered Water Supply Planning Objectives and Criteria Selection for Evaluation
(September 2013), Exploration of Various Back-Up Water Supply Options (October 2013-
July 2014) and Alternatives Based Evaluation and Analysis and Selection of Options to
further consider (July -August 2014). At the August 26, 2014 Supply Workshop, the Board
evaluated six supply options and identified groundwater replenishment using recycled
water and water transfer projects to evaluate further. The District is moving forward to
develop additional information related to feasibility, cost, environmental and legal
considerations to determine the best path forward to securing additional water supply.
The Planning Department Fee Schedule reflects a project-by-project cost recovery
approach. Applicants make a deposit at the time of application, and planner time is
charged at a rate of $140 to $160 per hour, which includes overhead and other department
and city staff involvement. Any unused deposit funds are returned to the applicant. This
approach ensures that development fees are fair, based on each project’s processing
requirements, and not excessive.
The City’s approach to development fees usually results in a lower per-unit fee cost for
multi-unit projects. Permits usually required for multiple family developments include
Architectural and Site Review and sometimes a Coastal Permit. Most coastal permits are
issued without conditions and are not appealed to the Coastal Commission; meaning that
the city’s architectural and site review process generally also addresses consistency with
the coastal act and city’s local coastal program.
If an applicant desires exceptions to development standards for constrained sites, then the
Planned Development (PD) approach involves a rezoning, and creation of site-specific
development standards. The PD approach has been used several times in the last few
years to develop higher density detached single family developments on small sites of 1 to
2 acres. In addition the PD process has been used to permit the 55 unit mixed-use
Capitola Beach Villas project on 41st Ave. The PD rezoning fee replaces fees that would
have been paid for needed variances, and thus does not act as a constraint.
Local Processing and Permit Procedures
The evaluation and review process required by City’s procedures contributes to the cost of
housing in that holding costs incurred by developers are ultimately reflected in the unit’s
selling price. The City's goal is to further expedite the processing of all residential
development applications.
                                          Chapter 3-14

   I.   Site Plan Approval Processing
Because Capitola is nearly built-out, most residential projects are small infill or
redevelopment projects. The approval process entails a site review by Community
Development Department staff, an advisory review by the Architectural and Site
Committee, review and approval by the Planning Commission, followed by plan check by
building and planning staff. Total time to process an application typically ranges from 2 to
3 months. For projects that require a Conditional Use Permit, the permitting process will
usually take 2 to 6 months. Most zoning districts in the City allow some type of residential
use (single-family or multi-family) as principally permitted. The Community Comercial and
Commercial/Resitdential zoning districts allow residential-commercial mixed use
development as a conditional use. Because the Conditional Use Permit only adds an
additional two to three months to the permitting process, it is not seen as a constraint to
this sort of development. Coastal permits are processed and approved concurrently for
most projects in the Coastal Zone.
After a project has received a permit from the Planning Department, it must obtain a
building permit before construction begins. The City of Capitola Building Department
provides plan checking and building inspection services to assure compliance with the
California Building Code. The Building Department enforces the provisions of the State
Housing Code and the International Existing Building Code. In addition the Building
Official serves as the City of Capitola’s Americans with Disabilities Act compliance officer.
The Capitola Building Code was based on the International Building Code and Fire Code
as well as the Uniform Plumbing and Mechanical Codes and the National Electrical Code.
  II.   Required On-Site and Off-Site Improvements
The City requirements for on- and off-site improvements are decided on a case to case
basis. However, there are a few required improvements that are standard for most
residential development.
On-Site: Most projects must submit a final Landscaping Plan and Irrigation Plan at the
time of building permit submittal and installed prior to final building occupancy. The utilities
are to be underground to the nearest utility pole in accordance with PG&E. In order to
protect the neighbors, and to remain in compliance with the City Noise Ordinance, the
hours of construction are usually set from 7:30am to 9:00pm, Monday through Friday, and
9:00am to 4:00pm on Saturday. Required on-site improvements are generally not
development or cost-prohibitive.
Off-Site: Required off-site improvements are more costly than on-site improvements,
however, they are necessary to achieve consistency within neighborhoods and contribute
to systems that benefit the entire community such as storm water mitigation. The City
requires that any curb, gutter (concrete swale) and/or sidewalk that are damaged during
construction shall be repaired or replaced and that affordable housing in-lieu fees shall be
paid for projects under 7 units.
                                         Chapter 3-15

  III.  Local Coastal Program and Coastal Permits
The City of Capitola’s Local Coastal Program has been certified by the California Coastal
Commission, and coastal permits are issued by the City. Within the City of Capitola, the
location of a project in the coastal zone generally does not result in a more complex or
time consuming development review process. Because the City requires Architectural and
Site Review (design permit) for nearly all development, the fact that a coastal permit may
also be required does not generally result in a substantively different application review
process or timing. The City of Capitola has a reputation for carrying out development
review in a very timely way, usually completed within 2 to 3 months of application
submittal.
 IV.    General Plan Amendment and Zoning Code Amendment Processing
Applications for amendments to the City General Plan and Zoning Code are reviewed as
discretionary actions. These applications are reviewed by the Community Development
Department, then forwarded to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission
holds a public hearing, reviews the application, and forwards its recommendation to the
City Council. The City Council is the approving body for all General Plan and Zoning Code
amendments. It is the City's goal to process these actions within six months after a
complete application is received, or as required under CEQA and other applicable laws.
Disabled Access (SB 520)
Pursuant to Senate Bill 520-Chesbro (SB520), this section analyzes potential and actual
constraints upon the development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons
with disabilities; discusses local efforts to remove governmental constraints that hinder the
locality from meeting the need for housing of persons with disabilities; and identifies
programs that remove constraints or provide reasonable accommodations for housing
designed for persons with disabilities.
Capitola endeavors to accommodate disabled access within the existing and future
housing stock. The majority of Capitola’s arterial streets are fitted with curb cuts, disabled
access signal controls and seeing impaired crossing signals. The City Building
Department enforces the American Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements on new and
rehabilitated development and provides no cost consultations to assist in the development
of plans for ADA retrofitting upon request. In addition to the requirements of Chapter 11 of
the California Building Code, Section 15.04.040 of the Capitola Municipal Code requires
that residential units have a minimum clear width of 30 inches at all doorways with the
exception of shower doors and closet or pantry doors that are less than 3 feet deep.
In the City Zoning Ordinance, small community care residential facilities for up to 6 clients
are allowed as a principal use in the R-1 and RM districts. Large community care
residential facilities for 7+ clients are allowed as a conditional use in both districts, with
additional requirements of a public hearing and additional application submittals (such as
required state licenses etc.).
                                            Chapter 3-16

Chapter 17.70 of the Capitola Municipal Zoning Code provides a procedure to request
reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities seeking equal access to housing
under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act in
the application of zoning laws and other land use regulations, policies and procedures.
Jobs/Housing Balance
The City of Capitola intends to work toward the implementation of SB 375, the Sustainable
Communities and Climate Protection Act. The City of Capitola is an active participant in
AMBAG’s Regional Blueprint Planning Program funded by Caltrans to help in the
development of preferred land use patterns that will support improved mobility and
reduced dependency on single-occupant vehicle trips. In response to the requirements of
the Federal Clean Air Act, the State of California has formulated a State Implementation
Plan (SIP) that sets forth the measures that are necessary to ensure the attainment and
maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) contained in the Act.
As a means of carrying out the SIP and ensuring that the NAAQS are attained in the
Monterey Bay/Santa Cruz County region, in which Capitola is located, the Mountery Bay
Unified Air Pollution Control District has adopted a Regional Air Quality Management Plan
(AQMP). The AQMP, in turn, requires all jurisdictions within its region revise their general
plans to be consistent with the SIP. A local general plan is consistent with the SIP if the
development allowed by the plan promotes balanced development and traffic management
strategies.
The City of Capitola’s adopted General Plan permits a mix of residential, mixed
commercial-residential, commercial and industrial development. Although a good portion of
its land area is in residential uses, Capitola has a strong regional commercial center and a
commercial tourism industry focused on its seashore location.
The Capitola General Plan also promulgates a traffic level of service “C”, which indicates
that the roadway is operating at 71-80 percent of its design capacity and traffic is moving
at a moderate pace. Increases in residential development that cause traffic to increase
and roadways to exceed level of service “C” would be judged inconsistent with that
standard, and CEQA review/mitigation measures would occur. As a policy of this Housing
Element, the City will locate higher density zoning along transportation corridors and seek
opportunities to expand transit ridership and alternative modes of transportation in the
community.
Each of the key housing development Opportunity Sites identified in Appendix F are
located along major transportation routes that are served by transit buses, bike lanes, and
sidewalks. Many are located in close proximity to job centers. The City plans to work with
nearby jurisdictions in an effort to retain and utilize the rail trail right-of-way, which runs
along Capitola’s entire coastal edge, and which in the short-term will likely mean a
walking/bicycle trail and in the long-term a light-rail system. The City’s opportunity sites
are also oriented to take advantage of this future alternative transportation opportunity.
                                           Chapter 3-17

C. Environmental and Infrastructure Constraints
Environmental conditions can affect development potential. Compliance with regulations
pertaining to the coastal zone, riparian corridors and environmentally sensitive habitat
areas can constrain development potential on certain sites. A few of the opportunity sites
identified in Chapter 4 of this Housing Element are in the Coastal Zone, however, the sites
are already developed or are in a developed area, so are unlikely to cause a significant
environmental impact. As the opportunity sites are already developed, few environmental
and infrastructure constraints are projected to be significant. Parking and traffic
constraints will likely be more significant to the development of the opportunity sites. There
were no residential units demolished in the City’s Coastal Zone.
Traffic congestion throughout the region is a significant constraint. Highway 1 along much
of its length contains only two lanes in each direction, and it operates at level of service F
during peak hours as well as at other times. In 2008 Caltrans completed the construction
of auxiliary lanes at the interchange of Highway 1 and Highway 17. While this work eased
traffic congestion in this area, congestion is still present in the remainder of the corridor.
Within the City of Capitola, traffic congestion along the 41st Avenue corridor remains
problematic. The County of Santa Cruz completed improvements to the 41st Avenue
overcrossing at Highway 1, which include the restriping of the bridge deck to add an
additional southbound lane.
The affordable housing opportunity sites are all located on sites that have been approved
for residential development. All sites covered under the Affordable Housing Overlay allow
densities up to 20 units per acre. All opportunity sites located on commercial zoned sites
are conditionally permitted for residential development with no maximum land use density
If the development creates traffic impacts, then a mitigation measure/condition of approval
is imposed. Traffic impact fees have been used along the main transportation corridors,
which will allow the development to proceed while ensuring that development’s share of
the impact is addressed. The extent of the fee is reasonable and does not act as a
constraint to development.
Water supply to projects in Capitola will become a major hindrance to development in the
near future. Capitola is served by both the Soquel Creek Water District and to a lesser
extent the Santa Cruz Water District. Water supplies for both agencies are failing to meet
demand and the agencies have embarked on a joint project to investigate the feasibility of
constructing a desalination plant to service both agencies. A pilot test program began in
2008 to test several methods of treating the sea water to drinking water standards. With
the successful completion of the pilot program it is anticipated that the two agencies will
collaboratively pursue the construction of a full scale plant with a capacity of 2.5 – 4.5
million gallons per day. In August 2013, in response to comments received on the
desalination project’s Draft Environmental Impact Report, the City of Santa Cruz
recommended that there be no vote on the desalination plant in 2014. The project is
currently on hold. The City and the Soquel Creek Water District are pursuing a community
involvement project and continuing to evaluate water supply options. Under the current
utilization plans, the Santa Cruz Water District would utilize this water during drought
                                          Chapter 3-18

periods to meet their water demands and the Soquel Creek Water District would use the
water at other times to ease the demand on their ground water supplies.
The Soquel Creek Water District has adopted a “zero impact” policy that requires all new
development to offset expected water demand (by a 1.2 to 1 ratio) by retrofitting existing
property with low-water use fixtures. This policy is intended to minimize exacerbation of
the existing overdraft until a new source of supply is developed. Both water districts have
implemented policies that provide priority to affordable housing projects for the allocation
of water credits. The City of Capitola currently water credits that have been set aside for
the exclusive development of future affordable housing unit. Soquel Creek Water has
estimated that the availability of water offset credits may be scarce and development
slowed until the desalination project is completed or other drinking water resources are
identified.
Water quality issues may also impact the developable areas of projects within the City of
Capitola. Federal and State mandated Clean Water programs aimed at removing
pollutants from storm water systems will require on-site treatment and percolation of storm
water from all new and redevelopment projects. This program is being regulated by the
Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board in the City and was adopted in early
2009.
Regulations in the plan limit the amount of area allowed to discharge from a given site to
less that 5 percent of the total project area and also require the runoff volumes and rates to
match predevelopment runoff rates for all projects. The City of Capitola adopted new
stormwater regulations in 2013. Other state mandated storm water program controls will
be put in place in 2009, and these elements must be met on all future projects. It is
anticipated that those management practices may affect future housing projects.

CHAPTER 4: HOUSING NEED AND OPPORTUNITIES
This chapter reviews the State’s Regional Housing Needs Assessment, or “Fair Share”
allocation, that the City must plan for, and the Opportunity Sites that have been identified
to accommodate this need. This chapter also reviews the resources that are available to
assist in the development of affordable housing, including the availability of public services,
facilities and financial resources, as well as opportunities for energy conservation.
    A. REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS
    B. OPPORTUNITIY SITES
    C. RESOURCES AVAILABLE
A. Regional Housing Needs
Housing Element law requires cities to meet both local and regional housing needs.
Capitola’s local housing needs are discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. Capitola’s regional
housing needs are established by the Association of Monterey Area Governments
(AMBAG), and are summarized below.
The Housing Plan, presented in Chapter 6, will establish specific goals, policies and
programs to address these identified housing needs.
Local Housing Assessment
Local housing needs, as discussed in Chapter 2, have been identified based on inputfrom
the Community Development and Building Department, available Census data, information
obtained from other sources and public agencies, and stakeholder input through a
community outreach workshop. Based on this information, the key areas of housing need
and concern in Capitola include:
                                          Chapter 4-1

       Affordable housing for people who live and work in Capitola
       Housing for seniors and people with disabilities
       Opportunities for affordable homeownership
       Affordable rental apartments
       Higher density housing along City’s transit corridors
       Development of additional secondary dwelling units
       Examination of parking requirements necessary to support affordable housing while
        minimizing neighborhood impacts
       Minimize impacts of new housing on local traffic
       Preservation of existing affordable housing
       Preservation of City’s mobile home parks as housing that is market rate but often
        affordable to a wide range of income groups
       Preservation of “small cottage” character of single family neighborhoods
       Repair/weatherization programs to improve energy efficiency of older homes and
        rental apartments
       Programs that offer incentives and assistance with energy efficiency to all income
        groups
       Assistance for renters and owners needing accessibility improvements
       Need for affordable and market rate childcare to assist working families.
Alternative housing types
In order to meet state law, the City needs to encourage and facilitate the development of
alternative housing types in order to accommodate all household income groups,
household sizes and special needs populations. These alternative housing types include
farmworker housing, emergency shelters, transitional and supportive housing, Single
Room Occupancy housing (SRO), co-housing programs, Small Ownership Units (SOU),
Secondary Dwelling Units (SDU), mobilehomes and manufactured housing. A variety of
policies and programs found in Chapter 6 of this Housing Element address the ways in
which the City will encourage and facilitate the aforementioned alternative housing types.
Regional Housing Need Assessment (RHNA)
State law requires jurisdictions to provide for their share of regional housing needs. As
part of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA), the Association of Monterey
Bay Area Governments (AMBAG) determines the housing growth needs by income
category for jurisdictions within Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties. RHNA determinations
for the City of Capitola during this planning period (2015 through 2023) are presented in
Table 4.1.
As illustrated in the table below, Capitola is required to provide adequate sites for the
construction of 143 new dwelling units during this planning period. Of these new units, 17
                                          Chapter 4-2

 should be affordable to extremely low-income households, 17 should be affordable to very
 low- income households, 23 to low-income households, 26 to moderate-income
 households, and 60 to above moderate-income households.

Note: The current Planning Period is calculated by AMBAG over a 10-year period, from 2014-2023.
 Source: AMBAG Adopted Regional Housing Needs Determinations June 11, 2014.
 The City’s RHNA determinations were adopted by AMBAG on June 11, 2014, following a
 lengthy process of meetings, analysis and reporting between AMBAG, California
 Department of Housing and Community Development, Capitola and other Santa Cruz and
 Monterey County jurisdictions.
 Status of 2007-2014 Housing Element Policies and Actions
 The 2007-2014 Housing Element identified a number of polices and action items for the
 City of Capitola to implement to reduce barriers to development and encourage new
 affordable housing units to be built. These policies included: amending the Community
 Commercial zoning district to allow for mixed-use residential development, instituting a
 Secondary Dwelling Unit ordinance, creating a Bonus Density Ordinance to encourage the
 development of affordable housing in exchange for a density increase in residential
 developments, instituting an Affordable Housing Overlay district to provide an incentive to
 develop affordable housing, and the creation of a Housing Trust Fund. The City
 implemented these programs since adoption of the 2007-2014 Housing Element. During
 the past planning period the -City has also reached the goal of encouraging higher density
 residential development through the Planned Development process.
                                                Chapter 4-3

  During the past planning period the City was able to maintain more than adequate
  affordable housing Opportunity Sites. Between 2007-2013, 95 new housing units were
  approved and constructed. Due to the built out nature of the community, new construction
  involved the demolition of 15 existing dwelling units.
Housing Development and Opportunity Sites for the 201-2023 Planning
  Period
  Many of the same policies and programs that were implemented for the 2007-2014
  Housing Element will be continued during the 5th cycle 2015-2023 planning period, and will
  be augmented with additional new policies and programs. More than adequate affordable
  housing Opportunity Sites have been identified to meet Capitola’s current RHNA
  obligation. Capitola’s goal for the 2015-2023 planning period is to meet or exceed the 143
  unit obligation with the Opportunity Sites identified in this chapter.
Housing Units Already Built or Approved for the 2015-2023 Planning
  Period
  For the 5th cycle Housing Element update in the AMBAG region, local jurisdictions may
  take RHNA credit for units approved (entitled or permitted) since the January 1, 2014 start
  date of the RHNA project period. Since January 1, 2014, five new housing units (affordable
  to above moderate-income households) have been approved and built in the City. Taking
  into account units approved and built in 2014, the City’s remaining 2015-2023 RHNA need
  is 138 units, as summarized in Table 4.2.

B. Opportunity Sites
This section evaluates the potential additional residential development that could occur in
Capitola under the existing General Plan and the existing zoning classifications and
regulations. With an extremely limited supply of vacant land, the community is committed
to the preservation of its existing affordable housing stock. and to the creative redesign
and rehabilitation of existing multi-residential housing units
Availability of Sites for Housing
The following sites are available for development, at the densities noted, without the need
for any further zoning changes. These sites also all have infrastructure in place and with
rare exceptions will not be affected by environmental constraints.
  I.    Residential Zoning Districts
The City’s zoning code provides ample opportunity for residential development of varying
types and densities throughout Capitola. In the purely residential zoning districts, densities
range from one housing unit per 5,000 square feet in the R-1 (Single-Family Residential)
district to one housing unit per 2,200 square feet in the RM-H (Multiple-Family High
Density) district (See Table 4.4).
                                           Chapter 4-6

  II.   Mixed-use Zoned Districts
Residential development is also allowed in the CR (Commercial/Residential) District, C-V
(central Village) District, CN (Neighborhood Commercial) District and CC (Community
Commercial) District. (See Table 4.4)

 III.   Single-Family Housing
As discussed above, the City of Capitola is nearly built-out. The bulk of the new single-
family construction that has taken place in the City over the 2007-2014 planning period
involved the demolition and replacement of existing units. In 2008, there were only seven
(7) vacant single-family parcels left in the City.
                                           Chapter 4-7
 IV.    Multiple-Family Housing
Because of the high land costs, construction costs, and relatively strong market demand
for single-family housing in Capitola and surrounding communities, the new single-family
units that will be built on these vacant sites will likely only be affordable to households with
incomes in the above-moderate income category.
There are very few vacant multiple-family or commercial sites that can accommodate new
housing construction, however, there are numerous prospective multiple-family and mixed-
use commercial sites that can accommodate new housing units as infill or redevelopment
projects. Table 4.5 and Appendix F summarize the inventory of vacant and prospective
lands that are zoned appropriately to accommodate housing development.
The City of Capitola recognizes that without an active Housing Plan, only limited housing
development beyond the available single-family lots and the anticipated Secondary
Dwelling Units would likely occur during the 2015-2023 planning period. To augment its
housing supply, the City has undertaken a survey of prospective properties in the multi-
residential and commercial zones (Table 4.5 and Appendix F). From this survey, the City
has identified available housing Opportunity Sites best suited for redevelopment with the
inclusion of multifamily housing units.
  V.    Additional Residential Zoning Opportunities
In addition to the residential and mixed-use zoning that allows residential development the
City has also prepared a number of ordinances that allow for increased densities and other
concessions to be provided above and beyond what is allowed by the underlying zoning.
        Planned Development Permits:
        Planned Development Permits have been used to allow site specific density
        increases. Recent residential PD examples have been approved at 24 and 30
        units/acre.
        Affordable Housing Overlay:
        The City’s Affordable Housing Overlay allows for residential development on
        specific sites in the RM zones at densities of 20 units per acre.
        Density Bonus Ordinance:
        The City’s Density Bonus Ordinance allows for a density increase, in exchange for
        the provision of a percentage of affordable housing, in any zone that allows
        residential development.
        Secondary Dwelling Unit Ordinance:
        The City’s Secondary Dwelling Unit Ordinance allows for the development of
        secondary dwelling units in single-family residential zones that would otherwise
        prohibit a second unit on the parcel.
        Inclusionary Housing Ordinance:
        Although sometimes seen as a barrier to development, the City’s Affordable
        “Inclusionary” Housing Ordinance has actually been helpful in the development of
                                           Chapter 4-8

       affordable housing units. Under the Ordinance all new for sale housing
       developments of seven units or larger must provide at least 15 percent of the
       project’s units as permanently affordable for low or moderate-income households.
       Since 2004 this ordinance has resulted in the development of ten new housing units
       that will remain permanently affordable for low or moderate-income households.
2015 – 2023 Housing Opportunity Sites
As shown in Table 4.5 the City will be able to exceed the RHNA obligations for all income
categories. Due to the City’s actions during the past 2007-2014 Planning Period, zoning
changes, ordinances and appropriate assistance programs have already been placed into
service. All of the following Opportunity Sites shown already have zoning in place that will
allow the proposed development at the appropriate densities required.
The actual development of these sites will depend on the state of the economy and the
interest of non-profit affordable housing developers. The City of Capitola has a positive
history of working with non-profit developers as well as with for-profit developers. The City
of Capitola staff creates an incentive for developers to build in the City by providing
excellent customer service and a speedy and efficient permitting process.
Due to the aging population of Capitola, and the need to locate housing near jobs, goods
and services, and public transportation, it is projected that the need for higher density
development of smaller sized units will increase over the next planning period. To
accommodate this projected need, the following opportunity sites are all located near the
aforementioned amenitites, and will be encouraged to be developed at higher densities
along transportation corridors.
                                          Chapter 4-9

Figure 4-1 below shows the distribution of opportunity sites around the City.
                     Figure 4-1: 2015-2023 Housing Opportunity Sites
  I.    Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) Sites
The City’s Density Bonus Ordinance, Inclusionary Housing Ordinance and zoning revisions
that allow for mixed-use residential development in the commercial zones will all work to
encourage the development of additional higher density and transportation corridor-sited
housing. These ordinances, however, do not meet the State mandated lower-income
RHNA housing density requirements. In order to meet the RHNA requirement for low, very
low and extremely low-income units the City has adopted an Affordable Housing Overlay.
The Overlay was specifically designed for use with multi-residential zoned properties and
requires that at least 50% of the units to be developed will serve lower-income households.
Two sites have currently been identified for inclusion under the Affordable Housing
Overlay. The Overlay could be applied to additional multi-residential zoned sites in the
future.
The two prospective sites described below qualify for higher density development under
the City’s Affordable Housing Overlay Ordinance. Under the Overlay, new residential
development is permitted at 20 units per acre under the condition that 50 percent of the
units be affordable to lower income households. One site has 80 existing lower-density
housing units and can accommodate additional development while the second site is
partially vacant. The purpose of the Affordable Housing Overlay is to encourage the
                                         Chapter 4-10

preservation and rehabilitation of any existing residential units while also allowing for in-fill
units on these two sites for a net increase in units. The Affordable Housing Overlay was
also specifically designed to encourage affordable housing development activities that will
help provide for long-term affordability for any lower-income residents that currently live on
the sites. A zoning change, on the other hand, that allows for increased density without
any affordability requirement would most likely trigger redevelopment of these existing
development sites in a way that would cause the dislocation of the existing residents and
result in the development of housing for above moderate-income households.
These two Afforable Housing Opportunity sites,if developed, would provide for a combined
total of 94 new housing units for low, very low and extremely low-income households.
         Affordable Housing Overlay Opportunity Site #1: 600 Park Avenue
                APN: 036-151-15
                Lot Size: 6.8 acres
                Zoning: AHO/RM-LM (5-10 dwelling units/acre; up to 20 dwelling
                 units/acre with Affordable Housing Overlay)
                General Plan Designation: R-H12 (residential high density) 10-20
                 units/acre.
Using CDBG Planning and Technical Assistance grant funds the City contracted with the
Mid-Peninsula Housing Coalition to complete a feasibility study of the 600 Park Avenue
site to determine whether or not redevelopment of the site would be feasible. The 600
Park Avenue site study was completed in January 2007 by the Mid-Peninsula Housing
Coalition. While the study provided three different redevelopment scenarios the most
conservative development scenario was used to estimate the number of housing units that
might actually be developed between 20015 and 2023.
12 Pending Coastal Commission Certification
                                            Chapter 4-11

This scenario would produce a total of 33 new multi-family housing units while also
preserving the 80 affordable units currently located on the site. Although 600 Park Avenue
is zoned RM-LM which allows 5-10 dwelling units per acre, the site is part of the City’s
Affordable Housing Overlay which will allow redevelopment on the site at up to 20 units per
acre if at least 50 percent of the units developed are affordable. This site is located
immediately adjacent to the New Brighten Middle School, is walking distance to the New
Brighten State Park and is across the street from the proposed rail/bike trail transportation
corridor. The site meets many of the planning criteria for higher density family-oriented
housing.
In an ideal situation the redevelopment of this site would be carried out in a similar manner
to the current redevelopment of the Bay Avenue Senior Housing Project, so that the
existing housing can be preserved and rehabilitated and the existing residents can be
protected from being dislocated. Due to the age and low density design of the current
uses at 600 Park Avenue the existing development is not viewed as a constraint on
additional development. Utilizing the density standards set by the California State
Department of Housing and Community Development, a density of 20 dwelling units/acre
equates to low and very low income affordability. It is anticipated that the 33 new units that
could be developed on this site will serve low and very low-income households. If the
existing 80 units on this site undergo substantial rehabilitation and if they are converted to
long-term affordability it is possible that up to 14 of these units could qualify under the
Adequate Sites Alternative Program to be counted toward the City’s RHNA obligation.
The City has been in contact with the current owners of the 600 Park Avenue site and has
expressed an interest in working with the owner to take advantage of the Affordable
Housing Overlay. The past feasibility study conducted on the site provides an extensive
analysis of alternative development scenarios.
Through the adoption of the Overlay the City has expressed its interest in seeing the
development of an in-fill housing project on this site and is concerned with the long-term
sustainability of the existing affordable housing on the site if an affordable housing project
is not initiated in the near future. As was demonstrated with the Bay Avenue Senior
Apartments project, the City housing staff and Community Development Department will
work closely with the owner/developer to assist in the entitlement process, to prepare a
development agreement and to package possible financial assistance from the City.The
City will also work with the developer to apply for any federal or state housing funds that
may be available for the project. The City currently has water credits with Soquel Creek
Water District for affordable housing that could be provided to this project if needed to help
gain water service for the new units. This project could provide for up to 33 new housing
units for lower-income households.

        Affordable Housing Overlay Opportunity Site #2 : 822 Bay Avenue:
              APN: 036-011-28
              Lot Size: 3.09 acres
              Current Zoning: AHO/AR/RM-L (5-10 units/acre; up to 20 dwelling
               units/acre with Affordable Housing Overlay)
              General Plan Designation: R-H (residential high density) 10-20
               units/acre.
822 Bay Avenue, is a 3.09 acre parcel in the AHO/AR/RM-L(Automatic Review/ Multiple
family residential) District. The Automatic Review district requires that any project obtain a
use permit. The current use on a portion of the site is a hotel, which is a legal non-
conforming use in the RML zoning district. The balance of the site is currently vacant.
This site has been identified as being an appropriate place for higher density affordable
housing due to its proximity to shopping, transit and elementary and middle school sites.
The site is part of the City’s Affordable Housing Overlay which will allow redevelopment on
the site at up to 20 units per acre if at least 50 percent of the units to be developed will be
affordable. It is anticipated that due to the age, condition and limited lot coverage of the
existing structures, that the site may be considered for redevelopment in the current
planning period. Given current zoning and proximity to public services the site is
appropriate for a future mixed residential/commercial development project. With the
Affordable Housing Overlay, the 3.09 acre parcel could accommodate up to 61 residential
units. Going by the standards set by the California State Department of Housing and
Community Development, a density of 20 dwelling units/acre equates to low and very low
income affordability. It is anticipated that the 61 new units that could be developed on this
site will serve low, very low and extremely low-income households.
                                           Chapter 4-13

As was demonstrated with the Bay Avenue Senior Apartments project, the City housing
staff and Community Development Department will work closely with the owner/developer
to assist in the entitlement process, to prepare a development agreement and to package
possible financial assistance from the City. The City will also work with the developer to
apply for any federal or state housing funds that may be available for the project. The City
currently has water credits with Soquel Creek Water District for affordable housing that
could be provided to this project if needed to help gain water service for the new units.
This project could provide for up to 61 new housing units for lower-income households.
Program 1.1 and Program 2.5 are included in the Housing Plan to encourage development
in the identified opportunity sites and monitor the progress of development on these sites.
  II.   Mixed-Use Residential/Commercial Sites
The City of Capitola contracted with Applied Development Economics for the 41st Avenue
Corridor Economic Development/Mixed Use Revitalization Study. The study was
completed in September 2009 and investigated the feasibility of mixed-use residential
development as a development alternative for the City’s important 41 st Avenue commercial
area. The study identified four short and long term mixed-use opportunity sites that would
be appropriate for redevelopment with residential components. These opportunity sites
are larger in scope than the opportunity sites identified in the Housing Element and will
most likely not be able to be redeveloped within the Housing Element’s five-year planning
period. However, this study and its identified mixed-use opportunity sites, point to the
City’s interest in moving toward mixed-use development. The study encourages mixed-
use residential development as a means to encourage transit oriented development,
reinvigorate and enhance retail along 41st Avenue and increase the housing supply, both
market rate and affordable.
Capitola has limited recent experience with the development of mixed-use residential
projects. The City’s only recent mixed-use development is the Capitola Beach Villas
project which is a 55-unit condominium project completed in 2008. The property was
zoned Community Commercial and the development was approved at 30 units per acre for
the residential units. The retail commercial portion of the project was allowed in addition to
the residential density. The City is anticipating that future mixed-use projects will be
approved at the 25 units per acre density allowed in the commercial zones. However,
because of Capitola’s limited recent involvement with mixed-use development, as part of
this Housing Element, the City is anticipating the residential mixed-use development on the
mixed-use opportunity sites at only 50 percent of that maximum density.
There are several prospective commercially zoned properties that are appropriate sites for
development with mixed-commerical/residential redevelopment projects. Zoning changes
made over the past planning period allow mixed-use residential development in the CC-
Community Commercial, CN-Neighborhood Commercial, PO-Professional Office and CR-
Commercial/Residential zones. While mixed-use residential development is allowed on
any CC, CN, PO or CR zoned parcel, the following four sites have been identified as being
particularly appropriate given their current lower-than-typical density of development and
need for economic redevelopment, or because of the site’s location being particularly
advantageous for pedestrian and bicycle oriented residential uses.
                                         Chapter 4-14

        1575 38th Avenue:
               APN: 034-181-18
               Lot Size: 0.7 acres
               Current Zoning: CN
               General Plan Designation: C-LC (Commercial-Shopping Local)
The current use of this parcel (APN # 034-181-18) (not in the coastal zone) is the “Capitola
Freight and Salvage”, a used building materials operation. The site is approximately 0.7
acres in size and is in the Neighborhood Commercial (CN) zoning district and is close to
public transit, shopping and other amenities. The CN zone allows residential-commercial
mixed-use development as a principally permitted or “by-right” use. The current use of the
site is not seen as a barrrier to future development as it signficantly underutilizesthe site,
and will not be continued when redeveloped. Currently there are several dilapidated
buildings on the site that are used for the Capitola Freight and Salvage business. The
buildings do not contain residential units and cover approximately 20 percent of the site.
It is anticipated that due to the age and poor condition of the existing structures, that the
site will be redeveloped in the current planning period. Given current zoning and proximity
to public services the site is appropriate for a future mixed residential/commercial
development project. Taking into consideration the setbacks, parking, and other design
requirements of the CN district, it is possible to build 17 residential units above commercial
on this site or 25 dwelling units per acre. Utilizing the density standards set by the
California State Department of Housing and Community Development, a density of 20
dwelling units/acre equates to low and very low income affordability. Although this site
qualifies under State Housing Element requirements for the development of low-income
housing units, the City of Capitola is choosing to show this site as being developed for
                                          Chapter 4-15

moderate and above moderate income households. While a net of 17 units are possible
on this site, the City has anticipated development at about 50% of the net new units, for a
total of eight units.

3754 and 3780 Capitola Road:
              APN: 034-181-15, 034-181-09
              Lot Size: 0.9 acres
              Current Zoning: CN
              General Plan Designation: C-LC (Commercial-Shopping Local)
This site is comprised of 2 parcels (APN #s 034-181-09 and 034-181-15) in the
Neighborhood Commercial (CN) zoning district (not in the coastal zone). The existing
restaurant takes up approximately 10 percent of the flat, 0.93 acre site. The existing use is
not viewed as a potential constraint on additional development because it takes up such a
small portion of the site. At 25 dwelling units/acre the site can accommodate 22 units.
The site is adjacent to Capitola Road; one of the major transportation corridors in Capitola.
Like the “Freight and Salvage” site, it is in close proximity to a regional shopping center as
well as the largest transit hub in the City. Although this site qualifies under State Housing
Element requirements for the development of low-income housing units, the City of
Capitola is choosing to show this site as being developed for moderate and above
                                          Chapter 4-17

moderate income households. While a net of 22 units are possible on this site, the City has
anticipated development at about 50 percent of the net new units, for a total of 11 units.
                                     Chapter 4-18
       4250-4310 Capitola Road:
             APN: 034-111-43,34,33,&44
             Lot Size: 1.7 acres
             Current Zoning: CN
             General Plan Designation: C-LC (Commercial-Shopping Local)
This 1.7-acre site, made up of four adjacent parcels (APN #s: 034-111-43,34,33,&44)
(located in the coastal zone) is known as the “Anderson/Dharma’s” site. The existing
single-story building has a footprint of approximately 40 percent of the site, with the
remainder primarily used for at-grade parking. This site is located on a key transportation
corridor, near the 41st Avenue transit center, and in an area that contains a mix of
commercial (CC, CN and PO) and residential (R-1, RM-LM, and RM-M) uses. The existing
use is not viewed as a potential constraint on additional development because it is
compatible with residential development. This site is currently zoned C-N. The expected
density range for this site is 25 dwelling units per acre, which translates into a maximum of
37 units. Although this site qualifies under State Housing Element requirements for the
development of low-income housing units, the City of Capitola is choosing to show this site
                                          Chapter 4-19

as being developed for moderate and above moderate income households. While a net of
37 units are possible on this site, the City has anticipated development at about 50 percent
of the net new units, for a total of 19 units.
                                          Chapter 4-20
  III.  Secondary Dwelling Units
In October of 2003 the City adopted a Secondary Dwelling Unit (SDU) Ordinance that
permits second units on all single family
lots of 5,000 square feet or larger. The
ordinance does not contain affordability
restrictions and is in compliance with
State law regarding second units.
Since the Ordinance was passed, a total
of six new Secondary Dwelling Units
have been built. Because of Capitola’s
early days as “Camp Capitola”, many of
its older original lots are smaller than the
5,000 square foot minimum lot size
requirement specified in the City SDU
Ordinance. There are still a total of 654
single-family zoned lots that do meet this
requirement and that could accommodate second units. The City estimates that the
Second Unit ordinance will yield approximately 6 new units during the 2015-2023 planning
period. It is projected that, due to their inherent size limitations and site characteristics,
that all of these secondary units will likely be offered at rents affordable to moderate-
income households. To further encourage the development of second units the City will
review its current ordinance to see if further refinements can help remove any remaining
barriers that have discouraged development in the past.
 IV.    Other Vacant and Prospective Residential Lands
In addition to secondary dwelling units on R-1 lots, there are vacant and prospective
residential lands on which additional housing development can occur. Table 4.5 and
Appendix F show a potential for a net of 7 new units on vacant and prospective multiple-
family lands, and a net of 7 new units on prospective R-1 lands. These numbers do not
reflect any double-counting between categories. No zone changes are required to
accommodate the potential development on these sites. Staff anticipates that these sites
represent the potential for the development of 14 units, 7 of which will serve moderate-
income households with the remaining 7 serving above moderate-income households.
                                           Chapter 4-21

      Comparison of Available Sites with RHNA
      As indicated in Table 4.5, the Regional Housing Need (RHNA) for Capitola is 143 dwelling
      units, ranging in affordability for households from extremely low-income to above
      moderate-income. Since January 1, 2014, five new housing units have been approved
      and contructed in the City, therefore, the City’s remaining RHNA need is 138 new housing
      units. The available Opportunity Sites identified above provide the capacity to meet, and
      exceed, the remaining housing need of 138 units. Further, the identified sites will meet or
      exceed the housing needs for each individual income group. These units will range in
      housing types from subsidized multi-family housing to market-rate single-family homes.
      Table 4.5 demonstrates how the City’s efforts to provide adequate housing sites compares
      to its RHNA allocation. The City has projected the residential development potential based
      on a review of each individual site, local historic development trends, and current demand
      for housing units in the different income groups.
      The City’s projections are conservative, and assume development at the lower end of the
      projected density range. The listed Opportunity Sites allow for the development of a total of

      adequate opportunity sites during the entire planning period and to encourage the
      development of the entire RHNA allocation of 143 units by 2023. New Housing Element
      policies call for City staff to work with property owners to target sources of affordable
                                                 Chapter 4-22

housing funds to achieve goals for the number and affordability of housing units to be
developed.
Table 4.5 shows that the identified sites will meet the RHNA requirement for housing
which will be affordable to all income categories. The sum of the City’s available sites in
all income ranges demonstrates the ability to more than meet the overall allocation of 143
dwelling units. A detailed inventory of sites is provided in Appendix C.
C. Resources Available
Availability of Public Services and Facilities
   I.   Public infrastructure and utilities
Public infrastructure and utilities are generally available to accommodate development
throughout Capitola. Potential impacts on traffic levels of service will be assessed as part
of the review processes for proposed developments. Where appropriate, projects will be
conditioned to implement measures to mitigate traffic impacts. The City’s studies of
congested transportation corridors will identify needed improvements and/or development
fees that can be imposed as conditions of approval.
As mentioned earlier, the City’s strategy is to locate higher density housing and mixed-use
developments along transit corridors. All of the key housing opportunity sites identified are
located directly on existing bus routes, and the majority of them are also in close proximity
to the regional transit center and Capitola Mall. Locating these developments in these
areas should increase transit ridership along these routes, and among the occupants of
the new housing, thereby replacing some of the anticipated car trips with bus rides or
walking/cycling trips.
  II.   Public Transit
Mass transit in Santa Cruz County is provided by the Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit
District (Metro) and is limited to bus service. No passenger train or rapid transit systems
are available in the County. Capitola is serviced by six (6) Metro bus routes that all stop at
the Capitola Mall’s Metro Center on 41st Avenue. The bus routes service Capitola Road,
41st Avenue, Capitola Avenue and a portion of 38th Avenue. During the summer months
the City of Capitola provides a free shuttle service that runs from a remote parking lot on
Bay Avenue to the Capitola Village area. This service runs on weekends only.
 III.   Water Service
Capitola is provided water service from both the Santa Cruz Water District and the Soquel
Creek Water Distinct. Between drought and population growth in Santa Cruz County,
water supply and water quality issues have become of greater concern over the past few
years.
                                          Chapter 4-23

The Soquel Creek Water District is the main water provider for Capitola. The District
serves more than 49,000 customers through 14,540 connections in the mid-Santa Cruz
County area encompassing seven miles of shoreline and extending from one to three
miles inland into the foothills.. The City of Capitola is the only incorporated area in the
District. The Soquel Creek Water District currently supplies approximately 5,400 acre feet
of water annually and receives 100 percent of its water from two groundwater aquifers.
The District operates 17 production wells and maintains 18 water storage tanks with a
capacity of 7.5 million gallons.
Currently the Soquel Creek Water District’s demand is higher than the sustainable yield of
the aquifers. To avoid overdraft and possibly salt water intrusion along the coast a "Water
Demand Offset" (WDO) ordinance was created to avoid a moratorium on development in
the Soquel Creek Water District, and to extend existing supplies until a supplemental water
supply can be obtained. The WDO requires applicants for new water service to offset 1.2
times the amount of water the new development is projected to use so that there is a "zero
impact" on the District’s water supply.
The Santa Cruz Water District serves a geographic area that includes a small portion of
the City of Capitola, the entire City of Santa Cruz, and adjoining unincorporated areas of
Santa Cruz County. The water system draws almost exclusively on local surface water
sources, whose yield varies from year to year depending on the amount of rainfall received
and runoff generated during the winter season. In normal and wet years the water system
is capable of meeting the community’s current total annual water requirements. The Loch
Lomond Reservoir is the systems main storage facility with a capacity of 2.8 billion gallons
of water, which provides sufficient storage after one dry winter to carry the system through
the following summer. The system is highly vulnerable to shortage, however, in extended
dry periods or critically dry years. Moreover the Santa Cruz water system is physically and
geographically isolated. There are no interconnections with other water suppliers in place
to transfer water among adjacent water districts or import emergency supplies from outside
the region.
The Santa Cruz Water District and the Soquel Creek Water District are jointly pursuing
seawater desalination as a supplemental water source. In August 2013, in response to
comments received on the desalination project’s Draft Environmental Impact Report, the
City of Santa Cruz recommended that there be no vote on the desalination plant in 2014.
The project is currently on hold. The City and the Soquel Creek Water District are
pursuing a community involvement project and continuing to evaluate water supply
options.As currently envisioned, this facility would add a 2.5 million gallons/day capacity to
the Santa Cruz Water District, which could provide upwards of 500 million gallons over the
dry season as a backup supply in times of draught. During non-drought years this project
would also enable the Soquel Creek Water District to significantly reduce pumping and
achieve groundwater management objectives of restoring and protecting the Soquel-Aptos
Groundwater Basin.
Both water districts serving Capitola have policies in place that give new water connection
priority to affordable housing developments. Through the water saving upgrades
                                          Chapter 4-24

incorporated into the Bay Avenue Senior Apartments project the City of Capitola has been
issued new water connections from the Soquel Creek Water District for the development of
future affordable housing units.
IV. Sewer Capacity
The City of Capitola’s sewer service is provided by the Santa Cruz County Sanitation
District (SCCSD) who provides collection and transmission of sewage throughout the mid
Santa Cruz County area. The District ultimately sends all sewage to a regional treatment
plant operated by the City of Santa Cruz. The treatment plant has an existing capacity of
17 million gallons per day (mgd) the SCCSD owns capacity rights for 8 mgd. The existing
flow to the plant is 10 mgd of which SCCSD’s portion is 5 mgd. Capitola’s portion of the
SCCSD 5 mgd is approximately .5 mgd. There is sufficient capacity at both the regional
plant and in SCCSD’s share of the plant to implement the housing unit development
identified in this report.
Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Under current law (Government Code Section 65583(a)(7)), this Capitola Housing Element
must include analysis of opportunities for energy conservation with respect to residential
development). In 1974 the Legislature created the California Energy Commission to
address the issue of energy conservation. The Commission, in 1977, adopted Title 24 of
the California Administrative code, conservation standards for new buildings.
   I.   Capitola Green Building Ordinance
In May 2008, the Capitola City Council approved an amendment to the Zoning Code to
include Chapter 17.10 “Green Building Regulations”. The Capitola Green Building
program became effective July 1, 2008. The program is mandatory and requires that
every new development (residential and/or commercial), and major remodels of a specified
size, meet certain Green Building requirements. The Green Building requirements are
intended to improve or achieve: energy efficiency, indoor air quality, water conservation,
reduced waste generation, and reduced carbon emissions. The program has been
effective, due to its flexibility and comprehensible requirements.
In relation to new residential development, and especially affordable housing, construction
of an energy efficient building can add to the original production costs. Over time,
however, the housing with energy conservation features should have reduced occupancy
costs because the consumption of fuel and electricity is decreased. This means the
monthly housing costs may be equal to or less than what they otherwise would have been
if no energy conservation devices were incorporated in the new residential buildings.
Reduced energy consumption in new residential structures is one way of achieving
affordable housing costs when those costs are measured in monthly carrying costs as
contrasted to original sales price or production costs.
Strategies a developer can undertake to achieve energy efficient construction include:
                                          Chapter 4-25

     - Locating the structure on the northern portion of the sunniest area on the site.
     - Designing the structure to admit the maximum amount of sunlight into the building
       and to reduce exposure to extreme weather conditions.
     - Locating indoor areas of maximum usage along the south face of the building and
       placing corridors, closets, laundry rooms, power core, and garages along the north
       face of the building to serve as a buffer between heated spaces and the colder
       north face.
     - Making the main entrance a small, enclosed space that creates an air lock between
       the building and its exterior; orienting the entrance away from prevailing winds; or
       using a windbreak to reduce the wind velocity against the entrance.
     - Locating window openings to the south and keeping east, west and north windows
       small, recessed, and double-glazed.
These and other potential energy efficient opportunities are evaluated and promoted by the
City during the site plan review process.
  II.  Policies which Promote Compact Development
In addition to the Capitola Green Building Program, the City has identified several policies
in the 2014-2023 Housing Plan (Chapter 6) that will conserve energy through high density,
compact and/or mixed-use residential development. These policies are as follows and are
discussed in more detail in Chapter 6 of this housing element.
       -   Program 1.1 Providing Adequate Housing Sites
       -   Program 1.2 Mixed-Use Development
       -   Program 1.3 Alternative Housing
                                          Chapter 4-26
The following sections present information on funds and other resources that are available
to support the City of Capitola housing programs. The City’s housing programs and
projects are funded through a variety of federal, state, and local sources. These funds
actively support the construction of new affordable housing, encourage housing
rehabilitation, assist first time homebuyers, and provide various other housing services to
low- and moderate-income households.
The City of Capitola provide development funding, operating assistance and mortgage
assistance for a variety of affordable housing types throughout the City. The per unit dollar
amount of local assistance required varies greatly depending upon the type of housing
being developed, the economy of scale involved, and the amount of non-local assistance
that can be leveraged. To the extent possible, Capitola seeks to encourage projects that
are able to leverage additional state, local and private investment, including tax exempt
mortgage revenue bonds, low-income housing tax credits and various programs
administered by the State of California and the federal government.
Federal Sources of Funding
   I.   Public Housing
The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) supports the Housing
Authority of Santa Cruz County’s public housing units, new development and rehabilitation
of affordable housing, and special needs housing through the provision of operating
subsidies and capital funding. The Housing Authority owns and operates one, 12-unit
rental housing project in Capitola.
  II.   Housing Choice Vouchers
In addition to public housing, HUD also funds Housing Choice Vouchers formerly known as
Section 8. Unlike public housing, which fixes the tenant’s rent to no more than thirty
percent (30%) of their household income; Housing Choice Vouchers provide a subsidy to
private landlords to pay the difference between what the tenant can afford with thirty
percent (30%) of their family income and the fair market rent. The Housing Authority
administers approximately 197 Housing Choice Vouchers for Capitola residents.
 III.   Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG)
CDBG is a Federal HUD program that can provide funds for a wide range of community
development projects including affordable housing and economic development activities.
As a small jurisdiction Capitola City is not an “entitlement City” under HUD regulations but
can apply for competitive grants on an annual basis through the California Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD).
CDBG funds are subject to certain restrictions and cannot be used for the actual
construction of new housing. The program benefits primarily persons/households with low-
incomes not exceeding 80 percent of the area median income. In the past CDBG grants
                                          Chapter 4-27

have provided funding for infrastructure development for the 6-unit Habitat for Humanity
homeownership project, the Housing Needs Assessment Survey, disabled access retrofits,
membership share loans to Loma Vista Mobile Home Park Cooperative members, and
loans to income-eligible borrowers under the City’s Owner Occupied Rehabilitation
Assistance Program. As CDBG funded loans are repaid, the funds are returned to the
City’s CDBG Reuse account and can be used again for CDBG eligible activities.
In 2014, the City was awarded a $500,000 CDBG grant to reinstate funding for the
Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program and Mortgage Assistance Program (First-Time
Homebuyer Program). The programs are designed to assist low-income Capitola residents
with needed home repairs and purchasing a home. It is anticipated that the programs will
be available for qualifying Capitola households in 2015.
 IV.    Home Investment Partnership (HOME) Program
HOME is a Federal HUD program that can fund a variety of activities to assist either rental
or home ownership projects through acquisition, construction and rehabilitation of
affordable housing. Under the HOME program, smaller jurisdictions with populations
under 50,000 are allowed to apply for competitive grants administered on an annual basis
by the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD). HOME funds
have been used in past years to assist housing projects including the 12-unit Clares Street,
Brookvale Terrace Mobile Home Park purchase and the City’s Mobile Home Rehabilitation
Loan Program. The City no longer receives funding from the HOME program.
  V.    ESG and HOPWA

basic shelter and essential supportive services. ESG funds can be used for a variety of
activities, including rehabilitation or remodeling of a building to be used as a shelter. The
Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS/HIV (HOPWA) program provides grant funds
to help meet the housing needs of low and moderate-income people living with HIV/AIDS
 VI.    HUD 811 and 202 programs
The Section 811 program provides funding for the development of rental housing with the
availability of supportive services for adults with disabilities. The Section 811 program
allows for persons with disabilities to live as independently as possible in the community.
The program also provides project rental assistance. The Section 202 program provides
funds to finance the construction, rehabilitation or acquisition of structures that will serve
as supportive housing for very low-income elderly persons, including the frail elderly, and
provides rent subsidies for the projects to help make them affordable. The 25-unit Dakota
Apartments project on Clares Street was developed in 1996 with assistance from the City’s
CDBG Reuse fund and the HUD 811 program.

bond program. In addition to federal tax credits, California has created a state tax credit
program to be used in conjunction with the federal credits. Low Income Housing Tax
Credits are a major source of funding for Capitola’s $28 million Bay Avenue Senior
Apartments project.
VIII.   Mortgage Credit Certificates

CHAPTER 5: PROGRAM EVALUATION
Chapters one through four establish the housing needs, constraints and opportunities in
Capitola. Chapter five evaluates the accomplishments of the last adopted housing
element covering the planning period from January 1, 2007, through June 30, 2014.
This evaluation quantifies the results where possible, but is also qualitative where
necessary in comparing the results with what was projected or planned in the previous
element. Where significant shortfalls exist between what was planned and what was
achieved, the reasons for such difference are discussed.
A. Progress Towards Implementing the 2007-2014 Housing Element
Programs
The 2007 - 2014 Housing Element established six primary housing goals. Under each
goal, policies were provided that outlined more specifically how these goals could be
carried out. Finally, programs were provided that outlined the actual actions that would be
taken to facilitate the goals and policies. To review progress made during this past
Housing Element, each goal is listed along with implementing programs and a discussion
of the actions that have been accomplished

CHAPTER 6: HOUSING PLAN
Providing for the the diverse housing needs of the community is a fundamental priority for
the City of Capitola. The Housing Plan describes Capitola’s six housing goals and the
policies and programs necessary to implement them. The Housing Plan represents the
city’s official housing policy for the 2015-2023 Housing Element planning period. The
policy program contained in this Chapter was formulated with input from Capitola’s
residents and stakeholders. .
A. Goals, Policies and Programs of the 2015-2023 Housing Element
Goal 1.0: Housing Production
Goal 2.0: Affordable Housing Development
Goal 3.0: Housing for Persons with Special Needs
Goal 4.0: Housing Assistance
Goal 5.0: Neighborhood Vitality
Goal 6.0: Resource Conservation
                                          Chapter 6-1

    Goal 1.0 Housing Production
         Diversity inhousing type and affordability level to
         accommodate the needs of Capitola Residents
    Persons and households of varying ages, types, incomes and lifestyles have a
    variety of housing needs and preferences. Moreover, housing needs evolve
    over time in response to changing life circumstances. Providing an adequate
    supply and diversity of housing accommodates changing housing needs of
    residents, promotes an inclusive community that welcomes all residents, and
    achieves larger social and equity goals in Capitola.
Housing Production Policies and Programs:
Policy 1.1 Provide adequate sites and supporting infrastructure to accommodate present
and future housing needs of Capitola residents.
       Program 1.1a Providing Adequate Housing Sites: Providing new housing to
       accommodate projected employment and population growth and to meet the needs
       of existing residents is a major objective of the City. To that end, the Housing
       Element identifies “adequate” sites to accommodate the City’s share of the regions’
       housing needs from 2015-2023. Adequate sites are those in close proximity to jobs,
       goods and services, have mitigatable or no constraints, and have adequate
       infrastructure.
       Eight-year Objectives:
             Maintain an inventory of available vacant and prospective sites that can
                accommodate new housing.
               Maintain Opportunity Sites identified in the Housing Element to meet any
                outstanding Housing Element RHNA obligation for the 2015-2023 planning
                period.
               Continue to require housing production goals for housing opportunity sites
                remaining in Capitola.
                                         Chapter 6-2

Timing: On-going through December 2023; Update inventory of available vacant and
prospective sites annually.
      Responsibility: City staff
Policy 1.2 Encourage mixed-use developments
      Program 1.2a Mixed-Use Developments: Capitola is nearly built-out, and there
      are very few vacant residentially zoned sites left in the City. In order to protect open
      space, encourage alternative transportation and create opportunities for affordable
      housing, the Housing Element encourages mixed-use developments along major
      transportation corridors. The City Zoning Code identifies commercially zoned areas
      in which mixed-uses are allowed by-right or by conditional use. The City will
      continue to support mixed-use developments in order to expand housing
      opportunities.
      Eight-year Objectives:
              Encourage opportunities for the production of mixed residential-
                 commercial use projects in the CC (Community Commercial), CN
                 (Neighborhood Commercial), CR (Commercial/Residential) and PO
                 (Professional Office) zones.
                Utilize appropriate development standards, design and compatibility
                 review and regulatory and financial incentives to encourage mixed-use
                 development.
                Continue to explore possibilities for mixed use development with current
                 property owners, such as the owners of the opportunity sites identified in
                 the Housing Element and in the 41st Avenue Economic
                 Development/Mixed Use Revitalization Study.
                Continue to monitor and implement the policies in the 41st
                 Avenue/Capitola Mall Re-Visioning Plan that addresses the distribution of
                 land uses, mixed-use parcels, transportation altenatives, and urban
                 design.
                Monitor and include an update in the annual Housing Element Progress
                 Report all mixed-use developments activities to identify unforseen
                 barriers that should be addressed and to evaluate additonal incentives
                 that may be needed.
      Timing: On-going through December 2023 with updates to be provided as a part of
      the annual Housing Element Progress Report

Policy 1.3 Provide opportunities for the development of alternative housing.
        Program 1.3a Alternative Housing: The cost of land and the lack of vacant sites
        for conventional lower-density housing has heightened the need for the
        development of alternative types of housing in Capitola. These alternative housing
        types including Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units, Secondary Housing Units,
        and Co-housing programs may offer alternative housing arrangements that could
        provide for improved affordability, neighborhood interaction and the provision of
        support services for residents. Capitola is already heavily involved and supportive
        of the use of manufactured homes within the community’s eight moble home parks
        and will continue with that effort. Given the demand for a variety of housing, the
        City of Capitola Secondary Dwelling Unit ordinance was adopted in 2004. The
        Secondary Dwelling Unit ordinance allows a second unit on any Single-Family lot
        over 5,000 square feet in size. Secondary Dwelling Units offer an opportunity to
        integrate affordable and special needs housing into existing single-family
        neighborhoods. Capitola is supportive of the development of alternative housing
        types and will take the following actions to reduce barriers and encourage their
        further development:
        Eight-year Objectives:
                Review and monitor the effect of the Secondary Dwelling Unit Ordinance
                   on neighborhood vitality; consider possible modifications to the parking,
                   height and setback requirements to encourage increased participation, if
                   necessary.
                  Review existing zoning codes and the City’s Condominium Conversion
                   Ordinance to determine if modifications to encourage co-housing
                   programs would be appropriate.
                  Continue to work with the local mobile home park residents, owners and
                   the state to improve mobile home park affordability and sustainability.
                  Encourage and facilitate the exploration and possible development of
                   other alternative housing types including farmworker housing,factory built
                   housing, live/work units, and Small Ownership Units (SOUs).
        Timing: Review and monitor effect of the Secondary Dwelling Unit Ordinance
        annually; Review of the City’s Condominium Conversion Ordinance will be
        implemented within one year of adoption; and All other objectives will be ongoing
        through December 2023.

Code development standards and design review annually and address any
standards and requirements identified as potential constraints to the development of
affordable housing. .
Eight-year Objectives:
        Review requirements such as the minimum unit size, setbacks, parking
           requirements, height restrictions, etc. to determine that they are
           necessary and pertinent and does not pose constraints on the
           development of affordable housing.
          Evaluate the feasbility of shared parking for mixed-use developments.
          Evaluate the feasibility of reduced parking standards for senior and
           special needs housing.
          Consider development standard modifications, streamlined processing for
           applications related to the creation of affordable housing, and fee
           modifications for projects proposing affordable units that are required to
           apply for variations to the existing development standards.
Timing: Ongoing through December 2023; Review development standards
annually; Evaluate the feasibility of shared parking and reduced parking standards
for specific types of development within one year of adoption.

         households
         Provision of housing for extremely-low, very-low, low and moderate-income
         households is a City priority. Affordable housing allows persons of all
         economic segments to live in the community, provides housing for the City’s
         workforce, and helps to ensure housing opportunities exist for the elderly and
         diverse racial/ethnic groups. The City’s affordable housing policies encourage

      the two remaining privately-owned parks is currently processing a final subdivision
      map. The City will continue to work with the residents and owners of the remaining
      rental park to identify realistic plans to transition from the rental park model in ways
      that will protect the financial investment of both the existing residents and the park
      owners and help preserve, to the extent possible, the affordable housing stock
      represented by these mobile home units.
      Eight-year Objectives:
              Provide feasibility and technical assistance funding and predevelopment

      the difference between the current fair market rent established by the Housing
      Authority and what a tenant can afford to pay (i.e. 30 percent of household income).
      The voucher allows a tenant to choose housing that costs above the payment
      standard, provided the tenant pays the extra rent above the payment standard. As
      the City has little control over how the County’s programs are administered, the City
      will be responsible for providing information to residents. The City will continue to
      collaborate with the County, State and Federal government to provide and
      disseminate and distribute information to persons in need of rental assistance.

Policy 2.8 Encourage the production of affordable ownership housing through the City’s
Affordable “Inclusionary” Housing Ordinance
       Program 2.8a Inclusionary Housing Ordinance: The Inclusionary Housing
       Ordinance was established as a means to not only develop affordable housing, but
       ensure that affordable units were better integrated into the community. The
       Ordinance requires that 15% of units in a for-sale development of 7 or more units be
       available to lower income households. If the project is smaller than 7 units they
       must pay an in-lieu fee in place of affordable units. The in-lieu fees collected from
       the Inclusionary Housing program are deposited into the City Affordable Housing
       Trust Fund.
       Eight-year Objective:
                 Continue to implement the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance.
                 Monitor and include an update in the annual Housing Element Progress
                  Report to evaluate any possible impacts on the costs and supply of
                  housing and to evaluate additional incentives that may be needed.
       Timing: On-going through December 2023 with an annual progress report on any
       possible impacts on the costs and supply of housing.

      Program 3.3a Emergency Shelters: In compliance with Senate Bill 2, the City of
      Capitola has amended the Zoning Code to allow emergency shelters by-right within
      the Industrial Park (IP) zoning district. This area was selected due to multiple
      opportunities for vacant or underutilized parcels for the development of new
      emergency shelters. The City may apply objective development standards to
      encourage and facilitate the use as provided under Government Code Section
      65583(a)(4)(A).

Program 3.3c Housing for Persons with Developmental Disabilities: The
housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities are typically not
addressed by Title 24 Regulations, and requires in addition to basic affordability,
slight modifications to existing units, and in some instances, a varying range of
supportive housing facilities. The design of housing-accessibility modification, the
proximity to services and transit, and the availability of group living opportunities
represent some of the types of considerations that are important in serving this
need group. Incorporating “barrier-free” design in all, new multi-family housing (as
required by California and Federal Fair Housing laws) is especially imporant to
provide the widest range of choices for residential with disabilities.
Eight-Year Objectives:
          Seek State and Federal monies, as funding becomes available, in support
           of housing construction and rehabilitation targeted for persons with
           developmental disabilities.
          Provide regulatory incentives, such as expedited permit processing, and
           fee waivers and deferrals, to projects targeted for persons with
           developmental disabilities.

income households and households with special needs have limited housing
options in Capitola. Housing types appropriate to these groups include: emergency
shelters, transitional and supportive housing, and single-room occupancy (SRO)
units. To accommodate this population group, the City has amended the Zoning
Code to address these housing types per requriements of SB 2. The City has
amended the City’s Zoning Code to allow emergency shelters by-right in at least
one zoning district, and to permit transitional and supportive housing in all
residential zones by-right without any discretionary action, subject only to those
regulations that apply to other residential dwelling units of the same type in the
same zone.
Eight-Year Objectives:
                                  Chapter 6-15

        Program 3.11a Child Care and Day Care Facilities: Capitola recognizes that
        children represent our future community but also recognizes that existing childcare
        services and facilities may not be adequate to meet today’s demand and that this
        demand is increasing. To ignore this fact jeopardizes the long-term quality of the
        City’s social, physical, and economic well-being. Thus, the City is committed to

    Goal 4.0 Housing Assistance
    Increased Assistance for extremely low, very low, low and
    moderate income residents to rent or purchase homes
    Increases in rents in recent years have placed disproportionate burden on and,
    in some cases, have displaced lower income residents. Due to rising housing
    prices and rent levels, lower income households in Capitola, many of whom
    work and provide critical services in Capitola, may be forced to leave the
    community to seek affordable housing in neighboring communities. Providing
    housing assistance, where feasible, helps maintain an economically and
    socially balanced community.
Housing Assistance Policies and Programs:
Policy 4.1 Maintain the City’s rental and ownership assistance programs.
      Program 4.1a Security Deposit Program: This program is administered by the
      County Housing Authority. The objective of this program is to provide extremely
      low, very low, and low-income households, who may have been homeless or are at
      risk of becoming homeless, with the funds they need to get into decent rental
      housing. Expenses eligible for assistance are the security deposit and last month’s
      rent.
      Eight-Year Objectives:
               Assist 7-10 households per year during the planning period.
                Continue the funding of the City’s Security Deposit Program which offers
                 income-eligible individuals and families assistance to cover the costs of

       by the Community Action Board (CAB). The objective of this program is to provide
       emergency, short-term housing payment assistance to lower-income families to
       prevent eviction or foreclosure leading to homelessness. The assistance granted
       must be used for the household’s rent or mortgage payment in cases where a job
       loss, medical emergency or similar event has precluded the household from making
       their regular housing payment. The household must have no other funds available
       to make this payment, and must be below very low income limits, with either

       Goal 5.0 Neighborhood Vitality
       Maintain, preserve and improve the character of existing
       residential neighborhoods
       Quality of life is shaped, in part, by neighborhood conditions in Capitola. As
       an older established and built-out community, Capitola requires concerted
       effort to encourage the maintenance, rehabilitation, and improvement of
       housing and the promotion of sustainable, livable neighborhoods in the face of
       increasing density. In neighborhoods, a continuing focus is needed on
       upgrading infrastructure, improving community facilities, protecting quality of
       life, and providing public services. City community development policies seek
       to balance the need for accommodating new housing, respecting
       neighborhood character, enhancing infrastructure and public services, and
       promoting vital residential neighborhoods

     Fulfill the City’s housing needs while promoting an
     environmentally sensitive, compact community that is a
     pedestrian oriented, neighborhood-centered community,
     using resources in a sustainable manner
     Capitola residents benefit from a range of natural features, including
     hillsides, rivers and streams, and the coastline. These resources enhance
     quality of life for Capitola residents and make Capitola a popular tourist
     destination. The City remains committed to protecting the beauty and
     integrity of its natural environment particularly in light of the need to transition
     to more energy efficient, pedestrian oriented neighborhoods, continued
     participation as a tourist destination, anticipated population growth, and other
     pressures associated with urban life. Balancing environmental preservation
     and resource conservation with housing goals and the provision of
     infrastructure and services remains a priority.

Policy 6.1 Encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation
       Program 6.1a Alternative Transportation Planning: With the adoption of AB 32
       and SB 375, local jurisdictions are beginning to figure out ways in which they can
       reduce carbon emissions. One of the largest contributors to carbon emissions is
       automobile use. As a means to prepare for the implementation of SB 375, the City
       of Capitola will encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation.
       Eight-year Objectives:

Policy 6.2 Strive to maintain a jobs/housing balance
       Program 6.2a City Jobs/Housing Balance: The quality of life and well being of
       the community depend in part on the economic well-being of the City and job
       opportunities for residents. The 2009-2013 American Community Survey estimated
       that the average commute time for Capitola residents was 26.6 minutes, and that
       most workers commuted via automobile. By promoting a healthy balance of jobs
       and housing, it will be possible to reduce commute time for residents, and increase
       the use of alternative modes of transportation.
       Eight-year Objectives:
               Encourage housing in close proximity to employment through
                  encouraging residential-commercial mixed use development.
                 Encourage the development of housing that will be affordable to the
                  individuals who are employed in locally-centered jobs.
                 Continue the policy to inform and market new affordable housing
                  constructed pursuant to Capitola’s housing programs to households that
                  currently live or work in Capitola.
                 Periodically conduct a jobs/housing balance study to evaluate the current
                  balance and determine which economic and housing strategies are
                  appropriate.

Policy 6.3 Promote Green Building techniques, development and construction standards
that provide for resource conservation
       Program 6.3a City of Capitola Green Building Program: In response to
       community interest in promoting Green Building techniques and sustainable
       construction, the Capitola City Council adopted a Green Building Program in April
       2008. The Green Building Program strives to improve our design and construction
       practices so the buildings we build today will last longer, cost less to operate, and
       contribute to increase productivity and better working environments for workers or
       residents. It is also about protecting natural resources and improving the built
       environment so that ecosystems, people, enterprises and communities can thrive
       and prosper.
                                          Chapter 6-24

       The green building standards apply to all building projects within the City, except for
       residential additions and/or remodels of less than 350 square feet; non-residential
       additions and/or remodels less than 1,000 square feet and non-residential tenant
       improvements.
       A point system modeled after the LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental
       Design) program is used for non-residential projects and a similar point system
       modeled on the Alameda County Waste Management Program is used for
       residential projects. A three-tier compliance approach is used.
       Initially, the Green Building program will serve to set a minimum acceptable
       standard, educate the community on the benefits of green building and promote the
       construction of green buildings in the City of Capitola. Over time the necessary
       number of points and the methods of achieving them can be increased to further
       affect change and improve the built environment while further protecting our natural
       recourses.
       Eight-Year Objectives:
                 Encourage and require sustainable development practices.
                   Continue to implement the mandatory Green Building Program for all
                    major remodels and new construction.
                   Update the Program periodically to reflect and utilize new developments
                    in ecological/sustainable technologies.
       Timing: On-going through December 2023

Policy 6.4 Promote the use of renewable energy technologies (such as solar and wind) in
new and rehabilitated housing when possible.
Policy 6.5 Ensure that adequate water supplies and sewer services continue to be
available for residents and businesses.
       Program 6.5a Adequate Water Supplies and Sewer Services
       Eight-year Objective:

B. Quantified Objectives
Capitola has established quantified objectives for housing production and rehabilitation for
the Housing Element. These objectives are based upon expected availability of resources
to address the City’s housing needs, expectations regarding future housing development,
as well as prior objectives established in earlier housing plans.
Housing Production
The Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG) has prepared a Regional
Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) for the period of 2015-2023. The RHNA determines the
region’s need for housing and allocates a portion to jurisdictions in Monterey and Santa
Cruz counties. AMBAG has assigned a housing production goal of 143 units to the City of
Capitola.
As illustrated in Table 6.1 below, Capitola is required to provide adequate sites for the
construction of 143 new dwelling units during this planning period. Of these new units, 34
shall be affordable to very low- income households, 23 shall be affordable to low-income
households, 26 shall be affordable to moderate-income households, and 60 units shall be
affordable to above moderate-income households. The City has planned for significantly
more than the opportunity sites required by the RHNA Goals knowing that some of the
sites may be developed as market-rate units or for an alternative use during the 2015-2023
planning period. It is expected that new affordable housing will be funded at least in part
by public agencies, and will utilize resources such as the Capitola City’s Affordable
Housing Trust Fund, and federal CDBG and HOME funds among the other funding
sources listed in Chapter 4 of this Housing Element.

Housing Rehabilitation
Housing rehabilitation helps to reduce poor housing conditions, preserve neighborhoods,
and contribute to a higher quality of life for all in the community. An example of a
successful housing rehabilitation is the Bay Avenue Senior Apartments project. This
project is not only the largest affordable housing project in the community, but it has a
major rehabilitation component. The $28 million dollar project will include the rehabilitation
or demolition and replacement of 96 existing multi-family units and the construction of an
additional 13 new units. The redevelopment program will involve phased construction so
that none of the existing residents have to be relocated off-site.
The Bay Avenue Senior Apartments project will undoubtedly serve as a model for future
affordable housing development. Due to the high cost and scarcity of land in the City,
rehabilitation is not an option, but a necessity. Perhaps the most useful rehabilitation
technique used in the Bay Avenue Senior Apartments project was the phased
construction. Relocation costs can be prohibitively expensive and especially hard on
residents with special needs, so it is advantageous to do a phased construction when
working with seniors or persons with disabilities.
                                          Chapter 6-27
In addition to larger acquisition/rehabilitation projects the City will also continue to operate
its housing rehabilitation loan and grant program that will provide services on a smaller
scale to individual homeowners. If additional funding can be found the City would like to
expand this program to include an increased focus on offering energy conservation
upgrades to the owners and renting residents of our older existing single-family homes,
mobile homes and apartments.
The City was recently awarded $500,000 in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
funds to reinstate the Housing Rehabilitation Program. This program is designed to
address basic health and safety issues in owner-occupied housing by providing small
loans to cover the costs of repairs. Eligibility is restricted to low-income households in
Capitola. If possible we would like this program to serve approximately eight to twelve
homes (depending on the type of applications received) during the Housing Element
planning period.

C. Capitola Housing Element Compliance with State Law
Since the 2007-2014 Housing Element, new legislation has been passed that changed the
State law to include new requirements. Table 6.3 summarizes the significant new
legislation and references how these new requirements are addressed by the City of
Capitola. The table is followed by a more detailed description of the legislation, and ways
in which the Capitola Housing Element complies with State law.

    I.   AB1233 Cumulative RHNA (Government Code section 65584.09)
Requires that jurisdictions rezone adequate sites within the first year of the planning
period to address any shortfall in meeting the RHNA during the prior planning period in
addition to meeting the RHNA for the current planning period.
This does not apply to the City of Capitola because there was no shortfall of sites meeting
the RHNA obligation for the last planning period.
   II.   AB1866 Second Units (Government Code section 65852.2; 65583.1)
Requires that jurisdictions with Second Unit ordinances process permits for Second Units
ministerially, without discretionary review. The law also requires clarification of how
second units are utilized to meet a RHNA obligation based on development trends during
the prior planning period.
The City does not require the discretionary review of secondary dwelling units. This said,
even though the permit process for Secondary Dwelling Units has been stream-lined, only
seven (7) units were built in the 2000-2007 planning period. The number of Secondary
Dwelling Units in the 2007-2014 RHNA opportunity site inventory reflects the Secondary
Dwelling Unit development trend from the previous planning period.
  III.   AB2069 Density for non-residential zoned parcels (Government Code section
         65863)
State law prohibits a density reduction to a “lower residential density” without a jurisdiction
counterbalances the reduction by upzoning elsewhere. The State law extends this
requirement to parcels where both residential and non-residential uses are allowed in that
it defines “lower residential density” as 80% or lower than the number of residential units
allowed under the maximum residential density on those parcels.
The City of Capitola is aware of State law and discourages the downzoning of parcels.
The City does not have a history of downzoning, and does not plan to in the future without
requiring the upzoning of a separate parcel or area.
 IV.     AB2280/AB 2222 Density Bonus (Government Code section 65915)
Specifies that jurisdictions that do not adopt density bonus ordinances are still obligated
under the State law to comply with State density bonus law. Also, jurisdictions that provide
initial subsidies for low and very low income housing under the density bonus regulations
may recapture their contribution over 5 rather than 3 years. Concession requests may be
denied if the incentive is contrary to state or federal law. Removes the requirement that a
waiver may only be requested to ensure a project is economically feasible. Now may
request a waiver of any standard that physically precludes construction does not apply to
waivers of development standards where doing so would have an adverse impact on
public health and safety, the environment or a historic property. Waivers do not reduce the
                                          Chapter 6-30

number of incentives that may be requested. For land donations in exchange for density
bonus, the land donated must be zoned at a density that allows for development of low
and very low income housing (20 units per acre in Santa Cruz). As well, funding for
development of the donated land must be identified by the time the project is approved.
The City of Capitola’s Density Bonus Ordinance reflects these changes in State law.
  V.    SB2 Emergency Shelters and Transitional and Supportive Housing
        (Government Code section 65583; 65589.5)
Requires that jurisdictions provide a zone district where emergency shelters are allowed
without a conditional use permit or other discretionary action. Limits denial of emergency
shelters, transitional housing or supportive housing by requiring specific findings. There
must be sufficient capacity for emergency shelters including at least one year-round
emergency shelter. Requires standards for shelters to be written and objective, and to
encourage and facilitate the conversion or development of emergency shelters. Also
requires that transitional and supportive housing be considered a residential use.
The City has amended the Zoning Code to meet the requirements of SB 2.
 VI.    SB375 Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Jurisdictions submitting Housing Elements to HCD after March 31, 2009 must comply with
the following requirements: specify a timeline for completing each program such that there
will be a 'beneficial impact' during the Housing Element planning period; the sites inventory
must identify sites by individual parcel number and other specific reference; counties and
general law cities must prepare an annual report on the progress of meeting housing
element goals, which must be reviewed and discussed at a public hearing.
Timelines for implementation of all programs are included at the end of Chapter 6. The
sites inventory in Appendix F includes specific reference for site identification. Annual
reports on the Housing Element will be prepared by housing staff in future years.
VII.    SB520 Constraints Analysis (Government Code section 65583(a)(4),
        65583(c)(3))
Requires analysis of constraints to development, maintenance and improvement of
housing for persons with disabilities and local efforts to remove such constraints (through
programs) or provide reasonable accommodations for housing designed for persons with
disabilities.
The City has amended the Zoning Code to include formal reasonable accommodation
procedures.
                                          Chapter 6-31

VIII.   SB575 Housing Project Applications (Government Code section 65589.5)
Prohibits disapproval of project applications for housing for farm workers, very low, low and
moderate income households, or conditional approval through the use of design standards
that renders the project infeasible unless written findings are made.
The City complies with this State law.
 IX.    SB1087 Water and Sewer Priority for Affordable Housing (Government Code
        section 65589.7)
Requires jurisdictions to provide a copy of the adopted Housing Element to water and
sewer providers. Also requires that water and sewer providers grant priority for service to
developments that include housing for lower income households.
The City will provide water and sewer providers with a copy of the adopted Housing
Element. Both water districts serving Capitola have policies in place that provide a priority
for water credits to be issued to affordable housing projects.
  X.    SB1818 Density Bonus (Government Code section 65915)
Revised the required affordability percentages for projects to qualify for density bonus.
Creates a sliding scale in which projects with less affordable units qualify for a density
bonus, and the density bonus increases as the percentage of affordable units increases.
Also increases the maximum allowed density bonus to 35%. Jurisdictions must offer one
to three incentives instead of just one.
The City’s Density Bonus Ordinance reflects these changes in State law.
 XI.    SB2348 Clarification of Requirements for Land Inventory (Government Code
        section 65583.2(b))
Identifies specific information to be included in the land inventory such as parcel number,
General Plan and zoning designations, parcel size, availability of services, environmental
constraints and an evaluation of the potential for new development on small sites, a
description of how capacity was determined (such as minimum densities), how affordability
level was calculated, existing uses on non-vacant sites and an analysis of the likelihood of
the use being replaced with housing recent development trends, market conditions, and
incentives for development.
The City includes detailed information in the land inventory in an appendix to the Housing
Element including the assumptions utilized in analysis of the sites. (See Appendix F).

A
Affordable Housing: Housing capable of being purchased or rented by an extremely low,
very low, low or moderate income household, based on the household’s ability to make
monthly payments (of not more than 30% of their gross household income) necessary to
obtain housing. For-sale housing is considered affordable when a household pays no
more than thirty percent (30%) of its gross monthly income for housing including utilities.
Arterial Street: A street that primarily moves traffic rather than providing access to
property and typically has a greater capacity than local and collector streets. Arterial
streets are appropriate for bicycle lanes and transit.
C
CEQA: The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) is “A California law which sets
forth a process for public agencies to make informed decisions on discretionary project
approvals. The process aids decision makers to determine whether any environmental
impacts are associated with a proposed project. It requires environmental impacts
associated with a proposed project to be eliminated or reduced, and that air quality
mitigation measures have been implemented” (California State Energy Commission).

advertisements, direct mailers, the City’s website, and fliers posted at key locations
throughout the City. The meeting was professionally facilitated and involved both a
presentation and an interactive exercise to encourage participation.
Participants identified current and future housing issues in the City and available
opportunities to address housing challenges. Resident and stakeholder comments are
provided in verbatim below.

        * Expected Net units in the R-1 zoning district were determined by assuming that any
        parcel would have a maximum of two units. The units in the RM-M zoning district were
        calculated at roughly 50% development rate.
        ** Secondary Dwelling Units are naturally affordable to moderate income households due
        to the unit size.
        ***600 Park Avenue could be built at 20 units/acre to provide for a net of 56 units.
        However, 33 units are anticipated due to the rehabilitation/phased nature of the project.

1 INTRODUCTIO

INTRODUCTION
The General Plan provides a vision for the future and establishes a framework for maintaining Capitola’s special identity over the next two to three dec-
ades. It establishes goals, policies, and actions that will guide conservation, growth, and enhancement in Capitola over the next 20 to 30 years. This
chapter provides an overview of the purpose and contents of the General Plan, as well as a general description of Capitola and the General Plan Up-
date process.
Purpose
In California, General Plans serve as the “blueprint” for all future development in cities. The General Plan provides the fundamental basis for the City’s
land use and development policy, and represents the basic community values, ideals, and aspirations to govern a shared environment over the life of
the General Plan. The General Plan addresses all aspects of development including land use, environmental management and sustainability, traffic and
circulation, housing, parks and recreation, and other topics. The General Plan’s policies are implemented through the Municipal Code, which includes
the Zoning Code, Buildings and Construction Code, Subdivision Ordinance, and other City regulations.
California Government Code Section 65300 requires that all jurisdictions adopt a General Plan that is comprehensive, internally consistent, and long-
term. Although it is required to address the issues specified by State law, the General Plan is ultimately organized in a way that best suits Capitola. The
Plan should be clearly written, available to all those concerned with the community’s development, and easy to administer. This document supersedes
the previous General Plan, which was adopted in 1989.
The overall role of the General Plan is to:
   ♦ Define a realistic vision of what the City desires to be in 20 to 30 years.
   ♦ Express policy direction in regard to the physical, social, economic, cultural, and environmental character of the city.
   ♦ Serve as a comprehensive guide for making decisions about land use, mobility, protection of environmental resources, housing, safety, and noise.

   ♦ Provide the legal foundation for zoning, subdivision, and public facilities ordinances; other adopted citywide plans; and compliance with the Cali-
     fornia Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
   ♦ Present a clear and easy to understand format that encourages public participation and understanding.
Development and conservation in Capitola’s coastal areas is also regulated by Capitola’s Local Coastal Program (LCP). All development located in Capi-
tola’s coastal zone must be consistent with Capitola’s certified LCP in addition to the General Plan.
While this General Plan establishes a 20-30 year planning horizon, it is intended that periodic updates will occur as needed to reflect changing condi-
tions and to keep the General Plan current with state law and the community’s visions and values.
Organization and Contents
The General Plan includes this Introduction and five separate elements (with the State-required Safety and Noise elements combined into one ele-
ment) that establish goals, policies, and actions for each given topic. The elements cover the topics required by California State Government Code Sec-
tion 65302 as well as topics of particular interest to Capitola.
General Plan Elements
A brief explanation of each General Plan element is provided below:
   ♦ Land Use Element. The Land Use Element designates where lands can be developed for specific uses such as residential, commercial, industrial,
     natural/open spaces, public facilities, and mixed uses. It also provides development regulations for each land use designation and overall land use
     policies.
   ♦ Open Space and Conservation Element. The Open Space and Conservation Element combines two elements required under State law: the
     Open Space Element and the Conservation Element. It addresses general environmental sustainability and stewardship, climate change and
     greenhouse gas reduction, air quality, renewable energy sources and energy conservation, biological resources, water quality and conservation,
     food production, waste reduction, as well as parks and recreation.

                                                                                                                                          capitola general plan

   ♦ Mobility Element. The Mobility Element specifies the general location and extent of existing and proposed major streets and other transportation
       facilities. The Element is correlated with the Land Use Element to provide adequate pedestrian, bicycle, motor vehicle, transit, air transportation,
       and emergency access to serve both new and existing land uses.
   ♦ Safety and Noise Element. The Safety and Noise Element provides information about risks in Capitola due to natural and human-made hazards,
       and contains goals, policies, and actions designed to protect the community and its property from hazards. It specifically addresses risks associated
       with geologic and seismic hazards, bluff erosion, beach erosion, climate change, flooding and inundation, fire hazards, and hazardous materials.
       This Element also addresses noise problems, quantifies current and projected noise levels, and establishes noise compatibility guidelines for differ-
       ent land uses.
   ♦ Economic Development Element. The Economic Development Element addresses Capitola’s local economy, community identity, and the City’s
       fiscal health. It identifies economic challenges and opportunities, discusses the green economy, and sets forth policies to promote economic vitali-
       ty while fulfilling the community’s vision of the City.
The Housing Element is provided under separate cover as it is updated more frequently and on a set schedule as required by State law.
Goals, Policies, and Actions
                                                                                             FIGURE I-1   GENERAL P LAN COMPONENTS
Each element of this General Plan contains background information and a series of
goals, policies, and actions. Figure I-1 illustrates that policies and actions are at the
same level of importance, and are both intended to support goals. In most cases,
goals have both policies and actions. However, it is also possible for a goal to be
supported exclusively by policies or actions. The following provides a description of
goals, policies, and actions and explains the relationship between them:
   ♦ A goal is a description of the general desired result that the City seeks to create
       through the implementation of its General Plan.
   ♦ A policy is a specific statement that regulates activities in the city, guides deci-
       sion-making, and directs on-going efforts as the City works to achieve a goal. A
       policy is on-going and requires no further implementation. The General Plan’s
introduction                                                                                                                                              I-3
capitola general plan

     policies set out the standards that will be used by City staff, the Planning Commission, and City Council in their review of land development pro-
     jects and in decision-making about City actions.
   ♦ An action is a measure, procedure, or technique intended to help reach a specified goal. The City must take additional steps to implement each
     action in the General Plan. An action is something that can and will be completed. Taken together, the actions in this General Plan constitute a
     “to-do list” for the City of Capitola.
These goals, policies, and actions provide guidance to the City on how to direct change and manage its resources over the next 20-30 years.
The City and its Planning Area
Capitola is a small coastal community in Santa Cruz County located east of the City of Santa Cruz along Highway 1. With a land area of 1.7 square
miles, Capitola is home to a population of around 10,000 residents. Capitola’s regional location is shown in Figure I-2.
Figure I-3 shows Capitola’s city limits and Sphere of Influence (SOI). The SOI is a boundary that typically shows areas that jurisdictions may annex in
the future, and for which urban services would be provided. State
planning law requires General Plans to include the jurisdiction’s
sphere of influence. The SOI boundary also signals to the County
and other nearby local and regional authorities that Capitola rec-
ognizes that development within this area may have an impact on
the future of the city.
Community Overview
Capitola is a unique coastal community with its own special sense
of place. The heart of Capitola is the Village, which features an
assortment of single-family and multi-family residences, shops,
restaurants, vacation rentals, and recreational amenities. A variety
of residential neighborhoods contribute to a distinctive identity           Capitola Village, circa 1920

and family-friendly character of the community. Capitola is also home to the Capitola Mall and other region-serving retail establishments along the 41st
Avenue corridor. Capitola’s rich history, beautiful natural setting, and strong community identity help to create a special place that is highly valued by
residents and visitors alike.
Capitola’s History
Capitola’s rich history provides a foundation to plan for the future. Below is a brief summary of Capitola’s history, prepared by former City Historian
Carolyn Swift for the General Plan Update.
Pre-History and the Colonial Period
Capitola’s earliest history evolved around the wetland at the mouth of Soquel Creek. A tribal unit of about 200 native inhabitants, the Uypi, lived here
for thousands of years. The name Soquel derives from these Ohlone people and identifies the range of their settlement along the coast, the creek, and
its tributaries. When the Santa Cruz Mission was established in 1791, the Uypi were taken to the mission compound. Their culture persisted, but their
traditional home sites were lost.
The territory that defines present-day Capitola was awarded in two Mexican land grants. The 1,473 acre Rancho Arroyo del Rodeo took in the west side
of Soquel Creek, including Forty-First Avenue, and was given to Francisco de Sales Rodriguez in 1834. Rancho Soquel, spreading over 1,668 acres, was
received in 1833 by Maria Martina Castro Lodge and her husband, Michael.
Early Development
Intelligent and ambitious, Frederick Augustus Hihn (1829-1913) arrived in California from Germany as the Gold Rush began. Settled in Santa Cruz by
1851, he soon owned sizable portions of the Soquel and Arroyo del Rodeo Ranchos. Among his 1856 acquisitions was a two-mile stretch between
Borregas Creek and Soquel Creek and another parcel nearby that was part of Rancho Arroyo del Rodeo. This land was to become Capitola.
Construction of the 1857 wharf and the 1876 Santa Cruz-Watsonville Railroad was prompted by Hihn’s investments in industry. Freighters made fre-
quent landings at the wharf until the rail line was purchased and improved by Southern Pacific Railroad in 1881. Today, the wharf and trestle border
and identify Capitola Village.

As soon as the wagon route to Capitola was linked to a turnpike over the summit in 1858, inland valley residents came to the beach to escape the
summer heat. Samuel Alonzo Hall, lessee of the beach flat, recognized an opportunity coming with passenger rail service. Lumber for the trestle was
delivered in May 1874, and several weeks later—with Hihn’s approval—Hall opened Camp Capitola. The vacation retreat was named for a heroine in
fictional novels by author E.D.E.N. Southworth.
As Capitola profited, Hihn took direct charge of the camp’s development. Lots between Capitola and Cherry Avenues were subdivided in 1882. The first
privately owned cottages were typically small, without foundations or plumbing.
Few of these early cottages survive. City and fire officials ordered a majority of them torn down in the early 1960s. The Hihn Superintendent’s Building
at the corner of Monterey and Capitola Avenue was spared. Given
a foundation and renovated in 1973, it is now listed on the Na-
tional Register of Historic Places.
Today’s Depot Hill was defined in Hihn’s 1884 subdivision map.
German-American families associated with the Turn Verein, a so-
cial and athletic club, built a cluster of houses on and near Cliff
Avenue. A private family retreat known as the English Cottages
was built in 1897 on the eastern end of the tract, between Rail-
road and Grand Avenues. The resort was renamed El Salto in
1911.
During the 1880s, Hihn invested $5,000 in village improvements.
Vacationers could rent lodgings or stay in the free campground.
As Capitola expanded, the tents and older cabins were moved
upstream. The tract gradually filled in with private homes and is
now listed as the Old Riverview Historic District on the Nation-
                                                                        The Hotel Capitola and Six Sisters

Above the wharf to the west, Hihn owned property halfway up the ridge, where
he had located the railroad and trestle. Hilltop owner Dennis Feeley opened
Camp Fairview in 1888. Hihn soon acquired it but added no amenities. The sur-
rounding neighborhood was named the Jewel Box in the 1970s, its title inspired
by Opal Cliffs.
Between 1894 and 1904, the 160-room Queen Anne/Colonial Revivial-style Hotel
Capitola, the Six Sisters duplexes, and similarly styled concessions along the
ocean front were built. An electric streetcar line was then completed between
Capitola and Santa Cruz, and a modern railroad depot was set at the top of the
hill along Park Avenue. The resort reached a high point when Hihn promoted
“Capitola by-the-Sea” as a setting for annual conferences. Lawn Way was his last
Capitola project in 1911, and is listed in the Six Sisters/Lawn Way National Regis-
ter Historic District.
Rispin Era
After Hihn’s death in 1913, Capitola was left to a daughter, Katherine Cope Hen-
derson. She sold the resort in 1919 to (Henry) Allen Rispin (1872-1947). Backed
by the Capitola Company syndicate of investors, Rispin intended to profit by sub-
dividing and marketing lots on undeveloped tracts. Inside the village, he tore
down many older structures and offered others for sale. Hotel Capitola was sold.

The 250 Coast Artillery’s Camp McQuaide was established in 1926-27 to the east of the resort and along Park Avenue. Adjoining it was an “airdrome”
to become the Santa Cruz-Capitola Municipal Airport in 1934.
Overextended financially, Rispin sold the Hihn water system and began to ignore basic public services. The subdivisions of Riverview Terrace and
Fanmar Terrace took shape in 1928. Rispin left abruptly in 1929, and another Capitola Company investor, Robert Hays Smith, assumed ownership of
his properties. Smith himself was bankrupt within a few years. The Rispin Mansion was sold in 1940. From 1941 to 1959, it was a convent for the Order
of Poor Clares. Purchased by the City in 1985, the mansion was scheduled for renovation when it burned in 2009. The building has been sealed and its
exterior preserved. It remains listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Sewer and street repairs, beach and creek pollution, adequate fire and police protection were all critical issues during the Great Depression. Hotel Capi-
tola burned in 1929. An entire block was destroyed between Stockton and San Jose Avenues in 1933. Civic leaders began to discuss the need for mu-
nicipal services.

After World War II, the Capitola Improvement Club was organized and campaigned for an incorporation election. Capitola became a city in January
1949, by a margin of 54 votes. Just completed, Highway 1 put a physical boundary between the two traditionally close communities of Capitola and
Soquel.
Postwar Era
Postwar growth hastened new construction. Closed in 1954, Capitola Airport property was the City’s first annexation in 1959, preparing for the
Cliffwood Heights subdivision. The 1962 opening of the nearby Cabrillo College campus added pressure for housing. Capitola shifted from a communi-
ty of retirees and vacation homeowners to students and young families.
In the early Sixties, a clover-leaf was built on Highway 1 and Forty-First Avenue, and the roadway was upgraded. King’s Market at the corner of Capitola
Road and Forty-First Avenue, built in 1963 by George Ow, Sr., set in mo-
tion the expansion of retail business along the improved corridor.
Debating the future of the beach flat and adjoining bluffs, the City Council
evaluated benefits of multi-story high rises. Cliff Apartments were built in
1964 on a former City-owned park site at the end of Grand Avenue. That
year, Capitola adopted its first general plan.
Panic set in as the City resort then faced the greatest challenge of its his-
tory. Santa Cruz Harbor construction created a breakwater that blocked
the sand that normally drifted down the coast to replenish the beach.
Waves undercut ocean front building foundations, the storm sewer was
exposed, and cliff erosion accelerated. Capitola’s vacation economy
shrank accordingly. A rock jetty built near the eastern bluff finally helped
restore the shoreline beach after 1969. It cost more than $1 million to
                                                                                 The Elephant Train

During the crisis, Council members investigated ways to keep the tourist re-
sort attractive. A 1965 citizen group submitted ideas supporting a “small, inti-
mate family-scale style of buildings” and a “rustic and individual character”
rather than a “slick, modernistic style.” One quickly adopted suggestion was to
rename the business flat “Capitola Village.”
Before the beach returned, artisans and “long-hairs” settled into empty store-
fronts and opened businesses with counterculture charisma. By the early Sev-
enties, the young entrepreneurs joined the Chamber of Commerce and took a
role in planning and politics.
Capitola’s fortunes improved dramatically as the 1975 General Plan was
drafted. In a controversial move, the city annexed 38 acres of the Forty-First       Sabra bar and restaurant
Avenue Brown Bulb Ranch property. Sutter Hill Development Company
then built a shopping center to be known as the Capitola Mall. Annexation was approved in March 1975, and the mall opened in 1977. Proposition 13
passed in 1976. Capitola benefited as revenue for cities shifted from property taxes to sales taxes.
The Council was able to lower taxes, increase staff, and build a new city hall. Projects over the next fifteen years included a school gym, central parking
lot and metering system, a park-and-ride shuttle, Rispin Mansion and wharf purchases, plans for a new library, construction of the Jade Street Park
complex, and the start of creek habitat protection.
The Capitola General Plan of 1989 followed two disasters. The 1982 flood and 1983 high tide drew attention to coastal hazards and planning develop-
ment in the flood plain. Focus was given to historic preservation as builders increasingly applied to remodel or replace the Village’s older structures. An
architectural survey was completed in 1987 and three National Register Historic Districts were created.
A $35 million mall expansion doubled the retail shopping area in 1988. Forty-First Avenue was widened in the shopping district to a six-lane boulevard,
attracting new businesses and a number of smaller shopping centers. The opening of the Capitola Auto Center further increased tax revenue base, al-
lowing the city to move with confidence toward the new millennium in 2001.
Today Forty-First Avenue is the most traveled street in Santa Cruz County.

The General Plan Update Process
The process to update the Capitola General Plan began in 2010 and continued through 2014. During this period, a range of public input opportunities
occurred to ensure that the updated General Plan reflects the community’s vision for Capitola. The following outreach efforts were undertaken to in-
volve Capitola residents and stakeholders in the process.
General Plan Advisory Committee
The General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC) was comprised of 11 members representing various neighborhood groups, the Planning Commission,
and various City committees. The GPAC’s charge was to review the progress of key project milestones and provide direction at critical decision points.
The GPAC helped to guide the development of the land use alternatives for specific geographic areas, as well as goals, policies, and actions that address
the city as a whole. GPAC meetings were open to the public and allowed all interested community members to voice their opinions regarding the con-
tent and direction of the General Plan. In total, there were 19 GPAC meetings.
Public Workshops and Stakeholder Work Sessions
The following workshops took place to foster community participation in the General Plan Update process:
   ♦ Issues and Opportunities. This was the first formal public outreach event of the General Plan Update, and its goal was to educate Capitola resi-
       dents about the General Plan Update process and solicit feedback from residents on key issues facing the community. Input from the workshop
       participants informed the overall vision, guiding principles, and major goals of the General Plan Update.
   ♦ 41st Avenue/Capitola Mall Re-Visioning Plan. This workshop was focused on the 41st Avenue/Capitola area. Workshop participants provided in-
       put on three conceptual alternatives for the mall properties and the future of the corridor as a whole.
   ♦ Bay Avenue Workshop. This workshop was focused on the Bay Avenue area from Highway 1 to Capitola Avenue. Workshop participants provide
       input on key issues and options for this area of Capitola.
   ♦ Village and Beach Parking Lot/City Hall Area. This workshop was focused on the City and Beach Parking Lot/City Hall area. Workshop partici-
       pants provided input about the vision for the future use of the City and Beach Parking Lot/City Hall site.

   ♦ Draft General Plan Update Review. This workshop provided the public with the opportunity to review and learn about the draft General Plan,
     and provide comments for the final draft.
In addition, work sessions were held with focused groups of residents, property owners, and merchants to obtain more detailed input on specific geo-
graphic areas within the city.
Environmental Review
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) required the City to evaluate potential environmental impacts that could result from adoption of this
General Plan. The results of this evaluation were compiled in a Draft and Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR). Additional technical information
related to the General Plan, including traffic analyses, can be found in the EIR. The City Council officially certified the EIR when it adopted the General
Plan.
Public Review and Adoption
A public review draft of the General Plan was published in December of 2013. The Planning Commission and City Council held three meetings to re-
view and receive public feedback on the General Plan and its Environmental Impact Report between September and December 2013. The General
Plan was ultimately adopted by the City Council on June 26, 2014.

2 GUIDING PRINCIPLE

GUIDING PRINCIPLES
This chapter presents guiding principles for the Capitola General Plan. These guiding principles are a statement of core community values to guide
growth, conservation, and enhancement in Capitola through 2035. Guiding principles served as a benchmark for the preparation of the General Plan,
and help to define the community’s unique identity and key aspirations for the future.
These guiding principles were prepared based on public input from a community workshop on March 3, 2011. At this workshop participants described
what they valued most about living in Capitola, and discussed the following questions:
   ♦ How would you describe the essence of Capitola’s identity?
   ♦ What do you value most about living in Capitola?
   ♦ How can the City best strengthen, protect, and enhance Capitola’s unique character?
   ♦ Are there any threats to Capitola’s character and quality of life? How might the City address these threats?
   ♦ What is your overall vision for Capitola over the next 10 to 20 years?
Following the community workshop, the General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC) crafted a set of General Plan guiding principles. These guiding
principles were based on workshop input as well as GPAC members’ sense of the unique values and aspirations of the community. After several
rounds of revision, a final set of guiding principles were endorsed by the GPAC at a meeting on June 22, 2011.

  Capitola General Plan Guiding Principles
  ♦ Community Identity. Preserve and enhance Capitola’s intimate small-town feel and coastal village charm. Ensure that all are-
     as of Capitola, not just the Village, possess a unique, memorable, and high-quality identity. Promote Capitola’s reputation as a
     community that is sustainable, historic, welcoming, and family-friendly.
  ♦ Community Connections. Provide year-round opportunities for residents of all ages to meet and gather in public places. En-
     hance the ability for residents to engage in civic life. Ensure that all neighborhoods enjoy access to high quality community
     events, services, and amenities that foster community connections.
  ♦ Neighborhoods and Housing. Protect and enhance the quality of life within residential neighborhoods. Strive for neighbor-
     hood improvements that foster identity and build stability, inclusiveness, and interaction. Minimize impacts to neighbor-
     hoods—such as noise, cut-through traffic, and overflow parking. Ensure that infill development and neighborhood improve-
     ments are designed with careful attention to scale, minimized impacts, and community benefits
  ♦ Environmental Resources. Embrace environmental sustainability as a foundation for Capitola’s way of life. Protect and en-
     hance all natural resources—including the beaches, creeks, ocean, and lagoon—that contribute to Capitola’s unique identify
     and scenic beauty. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for the effects of global climate change, including increased
     flooding and coastal erosion caused by sea-level rise.
  ♦ Economy. Support a local economy that is vibrant, diverse, and dynamic. Create a brand identity for Capitola that is grounded
     in the city’s unique identity. Support all local businesses, “green” businesses, and employers that provide jobs for Capitola res-
     idents.
  ♦ Fiscal Responsibility. Practice fiscally responsible municipal decision making to avoid shifting today’s costs to future genera-
     tions.
  ♦ Mobility. Provide a balanced transportation system that accommodates the needs of automobiles, pedestrians, and bicycles.
     Reduce dependence on the automobile with a complete network of sidewalks, trails, and pathways, and support development
     patterns that encourage the use of public transportation. Promote transportation options that are safe and convenient for all
     residents, including youth, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
  ♦ Health and Safety. Promote a safe and healthy community for people of all ages. Ensure that residents, businesses, and visi-
     tors are protected from natural and man-made disasters. Continue to provide excellent public services that support the public
     well-being while enhancing a sense of community.

3 LAND US

INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Element establishes core policies to guide land use and development in Capitola. It identifies permitted land uses within the city and the
allowed intensity of new development. The Land Use Element also describes the desired form and character of development, and how land uses can
best preserve and enhance Capitola’s unique sense of place.
The Land Use Element describes a pattern of development in Capitola consistent with the General Plan Guiding Principles found in Chapter 2. The
Element provides a roadmap for growth, conservation, and enhancement in Capitola consistent with basic community values. Like all elements in this
General Plan, the Land Use Element is guided by the principle of sustainable development. The Land Use Element supports a pattern of development
that protects natural resources, supports economic development, and promotes access to opportunity for all residents.
The Land Use Element is divided into three sections, which cover:
  ♦ Land Use Background. This section provides background information about existing land use patterns, historic resources, natural spaces, and
     parks and recreation, topics addressed in this element.
  ♦ Land Use Map and Designations. This section presents the citywide land use map and describes the land use designations that apply in Capito-
     la. Land use designations identify the permitted land uses and intensity of development allowed in all areas of the city.
  ♦ Goals, Policies, and Actions. This section presents the goals, policies, and actions to guide land use and development in Capitola.

Residential Neighborhoods
Residential uses in Capitola are grouped together in neighborhoods, each with their own special character. The general boundaries of these neighbor-
hoods are shown in Figure LU-1. Each neighborhood has a unique identity defined by its history, design character, land use mix, and natural setting.
  ♦ 41st Avenue/West Capitola. The 41st Avenue/West Capitola neighborhood is comprised of an assortment of detached single-family homes, multi-
      family housing, and three mobile home parks. The area is known by some as the “North Forties” and includes the Trotter Street area. Housing
      constructed in the 1970s and 1980s creates a more modern feel to the neighborhood. The Rispin property, the Shadowbrook property, and the

  ♦ Cliffwood Heights. The Cliffwood Heights neighborhood consists primarily of de-
     tached single-family homes as well as multi-family housing on Monterey Avenue and
     Park Avenue. Homes are typically one or two stories occupying relatively large lots.
     Wider streets with sidewalks and newer homes contribute to a more contemporary feel
     to the neighborhood. Monterey Park, Cortez Park, and New Brighton Middle School
     are also located within the Cliffwood Heights neighborhood.
  ♦ Depot Hill. The Depot Hill neighborhood is nestled along Capitola’s shoreline and
     overlooks Capitola Village. Detached single-family homes on relatively small lots create
     an intimate feel. A high concentration of historic single-family homes, a variety of archi-
     tectural styles, and a sidewalk exemption allowance contributes to the neighborhood’s
     coastal village feel. The Inn at Depot Hill and Monarch Cove Inn (formerly El Salto Re-
     sort) are located in the Depot Hill neighborhood.
  ♦ Jewel Box. The Jewel Box neighborhood is tucked in the northerly cliff, bounded by
     the Prospect bluff overlooking the Wharf and Village, located south of Capitola Road
     and east of 41st Avenue. East of 45th Avenue detached single-family homes occupy
     quaint lots. Vintage beach cottages and bungalows contribute to a coastal village
     feel in this community. Multi-family condominiums line the west side of 45th Ave-
     nue, with lawns between buildings. The Jewel Box neighborhood includes the West
     Cliff neighborhood and also contains two mobile home parks, the 10-acre Jade
     Street Park, School, and Community Center, and a few commercial establishments
     along Capitola Road.                                                                        Residences in the Depot Hill (top) and Jewel Box (bottom)

  ♦ Riverview Terrace. The Riverview Terrace neighborhood is bordered by Soquel
     Creek, Capitola Avenue, Bay Avenue, and Center Street. The neighborhood contains a high concentration of historic homes, including many small-
     er cottages and bungalows. Many homes occupy small lots, with minimal setbacks and structures in close proximity to one another and the street.
     Narrow streets with on-street parking and no sidewalk contribute to a compact and intimate feel.

  ♦ Upper Village. The Upper Village neighborhood contains a variety of housing types, including single-family homes, multi-family apartment com-
     plexes, and three mobile home parks. In many cases these different land uses are adjacent to or facing one another. Homes located closer to the
     Village tend to have a more historic and intimate character than those located closer to Highway 1.
Capitola Village
Capitola Village is the “heart” of Capitola and possesses the charm of an inti-
mate coastal village. The Village is a true mixed-use district with a diversity of
visitor-serving commercial establishments, public amenities, and residential
uses. During the summer months, the Village is a popular tourist destination.
Visitors are attracted by Capitola Beach, unique accommodations, and the
historic village character. Village residents enjoy these amenities year round.
The Village is pedestrian friendly, with human-scale architecture and a diversi-
ty of public gathering places. Capitola Village contains a high concentration of
landmark destinations such as the Esplanade Park, Capitola Beach, the Six
Sisters, the Venetian, and the historic Capitola Wharf.
                                                                                       Capitola Village
Mixed-Use and Commercial Districts
Beyond the Village, commercial areas in Capitola are focused around a number of mixed-use and commercial districts as shown in Figure LU-2. These
districts vary widely in terms of their function, mix of uses, and general character. Some of these districts are primarily resident serving (Capitola Ave-
nue, Bay Avenue), while others are more region serving (41st Avenue north of Capitola Road). All of these districts contribute to the economic vitality
of Capitola and contribute to the community’s unique sense of place.
  ♦ 41st Avenue/Capitola Mall. The 41st Avenue/Capitola Mall commercial district north of Capitola Road contains a number of region-serving shop-
     ping centers, including the Capitola Mall and Kings Plaza shopping center. Other land uses include the Brown Ranch Shopping Center, the Auto
     Plaza at the northern end of the corridor, the Whole Foods Market, the New Leaf Community Market, and a variety of other retail, office, and

     service establishments. South of Capitola Road, 41st Avenue transitions to a smaller
     scale neighborhood serving commercial district which is beach-oriented and reflective
     of its proximity to the ocean. This corridor features the Fairfield Inn and Best Western
     hotels and is home to the O’Neill surf shop.
  ♦ Bay Avenue. The Bay Avenue area is a neighborhood-serving commercial district with
     stores and services for Capitola residents and some regional shopping destinations.
     Land uses include the recently renovated Nob Hill shopping center, a large vacant par-
     cel north of the Nob Hill shopping center, the Capitola Plaza shopping center, the
     Quality Inn hotel, and Gayle’s Bakery.
  ♦ Capitola Avenue. The Capitola Avenue mixed-use district is characterized by an ec-
     lectic assortment of small-scale offices, personal services, retail, multi-family housing, a
     mobile home park, and single-family homes. The Capitola City Hall, police station, fire
     station, and historic museum border the Village at the southern end of this district.
  ♦ Kennedy Drive. The Kennedy Drive industrial district is occupied by light industrial
     and service establishments and the City corporation yard.
Public Facilities
Public facilities, such as schools, libraries, and emergency service facilities, are an important
part of Capitola’s land use pattern. The location of key public facilities is shown in Figure     Mobile Home Park (top) and the Capitola Library (bottom)
LU-3. These facilities serve Capitola residents, visitors, and workers within the community.
Parks and Recreation
As shown in Table LU-2, there are eight City parks in Capitola, totaling over 18 acres. Seven of these parks are smaller neighborhood parks, and one
park (Jade Street) is a larger park with a community center intended to serve the entire community. Although not a City park, New Brighton State
Beach is also located within Capitola. The Soquel Union Elementary School District (SUESD), which owns the Jade Street park property, intends to

Historic Resources
Historic and potentially historic resources in Capitola are de-
scribed in detail in the Capitola Historic Context Statement and
Architectural Survey. Preservation and enhancement of these
resources is an important goal for the City of Capitola.
A significant number of historic places and structures contribute
to Capitola’s unique identity and coastal village charm. Many of
these structures are commercial and visitor-serving buildings
located in the central Village, such as the historic Superintend-
ant’s Building. Capitola also has many historic homes in resi-
dential neighborhoods, and even historically significant public
infrastructure such as the Trestle and Stockton Bridge, and his-
toric Capitola Wharf. Preservation of these resources is essential       Historic trestle crossing Capitola Avenue
to retain Capitola’s community character and historical context.
Preservation of historically significant resources promotes tourism, enhances property values, and defines a community’s sense of place.
Many of the officially designated historic structures are located in four National Register Historic Districts:
  ♦ Old Riverview Historic District. This district is located along the Soquel Creek just north of the Stockton Bridge and contains cottages adjacent to
     the Creek and the Riverview Pathway. The District includes houses on both sides of Riverview Avenue from Stockton Avenue to Bluegum Avenue.
  ♦ Rispin Historic District. The Rispin property is located along Wharf Road and Soquel Creek. The historic Rispin Mansion, currently vacant, is lo-
     cated within this district.
  ♦ Six Sisters and Lawn Way Historic District. The Six Sisters duplexes located on the Esplanade in the Village were originally built in 1903 and pro-
     vide vacationers with oceanfront rental housing. The Lawn Way subdivision, located in the village center, was completed in 1911 and today fea-
     tures a high concentration of historic structures.

  ♦ Venetian Court Historic District. Located at the juncture of the Soquel Creek and the Capitola Beach, the Venetian Court was built in 1924 and
     consists of 24 residential units and a 19-unit hotel.
There are a number of designated historic structures in Capitola. Designated historic structures are historic structures that are listed or eligible for listing
on the National Register of Historic Places, the California Historic Resources Inventory, or the Capitola Register of Historic Features. The majority of des-
ignated historic structures are located in the Village or along the Soquel Creek immediately north of the Trestle. Past surveys also have found many
additional potential historic structures in Capitola. Many of these structures are concentrated in the Village and the Depot Hill neighborhood, in addi-
tion to structures found in the Jewel Box and Upper Village neighborhoods.

Land Use Map and Designations
This section outlines land use designations for land within city limits, as shown in Figure LU-4. All new development in
the city must conform to these designations.
This General Plan defines various land use designations by their allowable uses and maximum densities and intensi-
ties. The land use designations in the Land Use Element establish a range of densities and intensities of use in order
to provide flexibility for development while still maintaining Capitola’s existing character. The development levels
listed here do not create entitlements to a specific number of dwelling units or amount of floor area. Densities on
individual parcels may be lower due to site constraints or other City regulations such as minimum lot sizes as specified
in the zoning code.
In this General Plan, standards of building intensity for residential uses are stated as the allowable range of dwelling
units per gross acre; this means that the number of allowable units on a parcel can be calculated by multiplying the
total number of acres by the allowable density. The zoning code also establishes maximum floor area ratios for resi-
dential uses.
Standards of building intensity for non-residential uses are stated as maximum floor-area ratio (FAR) based on gross
acreage. FAR is a ratio of the gross building square footage permitted on a lot to the gross square footage of the lot.
Generally, FAR decreases as lot size increases. For example, on a site with 10,000 square feet of land area, a FAR of
1.0 will allow 10,000 gross square feet of building floor area to be built. On the same site, a FAR of 2.0 would allow
20,000 square feet of floor area. This could take the form of a two-story building with 100 percent lot coverage, or a
four-story building with 50 percent lot coverage. A FAR of 0.4 would allow 4,000 square feet of floor area.
                                                                                                                         Examples of floor-area ratio

The goals, policies, and actions contained in this Element provide direction on how the
various land use designations should be developed to contribute to the overall charac-
ter of Capitola. Allowed uses are generally characterized within each land use designa-
tion description of this General Plan. Additional use types may be permitted as speci-
fied by the zoning ordinance.
Residential Designations
  ♦ Single-Family Residential (R-SF). The R-SF designation applies to residential
     neighborhoods primarily characterized by detached single-family homes. Permit-
     ted land uses include single-family homes and public facilities such as schools, reli-
     gious institutions, parks, and other community facilities appropriate within a resi-
     dential neighborhood. The maximum permitted residential density in the R-SF
     designation is 10 dwelling units per acre. 1
  ♦ Multi-Family Residential (R-MF). The R-MF designation applies to areas primarily
     intended for multi-family residential development. All residential uses are permit-
     ted in the R-MF designation, including single-family homes, duplex homes, town-
     homes, and multi-family structures. Public facilities, such as schools, religious insti-
     tutions, parks, and other community facilities appropriate within a multi-family res-
     idential setting are also permitted. The maximum permitted residential density in
     the R-MF designation is 20 dwelling units per acre.
  ♦ Mobile Home Park (MH). The MH designation provides areas for use as mobile                                        Jewel Box homes in the R-SF designation (top) and Fanmar Way
     home parks, a valuable source of affordable housing for Capitola residents. Mobile                               homes in the R-MF designation (bottom)

     home coaches and other land uses typically associated with mobile home parks are permitted within the MH designation. A maximum of 20 mo-
     bile homes per acre are permitted in the MH designation.
Mixed-Use Designations
  ♦ Village Mixed-Use (MU-V). The MU-V designation applies to the central Capitola
     Village area and supports a vibrant pedestrian-friendly environment that is the heart
     of Capitola. A fine-grain mixture of commercial, residential, visitor-serving, recrea-
     tional, and public uses are permitted in the MU-V designation. The maximum
     permitted FAR in the MU-V designation is 2.0, with an FAR of 3.0 permitted for a
     hotel if special criteria are met as established in Action LU-7.3.
  ♦ Neighborhood Mixed-Use (MU-N). The MU-N designation applies to pedestrian-
     oriented mixed-use areas with an emphasis on resident-serving stores and services.
     Permitted uses in the MU-N designation include single-family homes, multi-family
     developments, retail, personal services, community facilities, and other uses com-
     patible with an eclectic neighborhood-oriented mixed-use district. The maximum
     permitted FAR in the MU-N designation is 1.0.
Commercial and Industrial Designations
  ♦ Regional Commercial (C-R). The C-R designation provides an area for general re-
     tail and services for Capitola residents and regional visitors. Permitted land uses in-
     clude shopping malls, auto sales, general retail, personal and business services, res-
     taurants, offices, similar commercial uses, and mixed-use residential projects. The
     maximum permitted FAR in the C-R designation is 1.5, with an FAR of 2.0 permitted
     if special criteria are met as established in Action LU-9.3.
  ♦ Community Commercial (C-C). The C-C designation provides an area for com-
     mercial uses primarily serving Capitola residents. Permitted land uses include gen-     Capitola Village in the MU-V designation (top) and Capitola
                                                                                             Produce in the C-C designation (bottom)

              ing — to allow additional development and investment that increases vitality and activity in the Village.
Policy LU-7.5 Hotel Guiding Principles. Require any new hotel proposed on the site of the former Capitola Theatre to be consistent with the fol-
              lowing core principles:
               ♦ The design of the hotel should respect the scale and character of neighboring structures and enhance Capitola’s unique sense of
                 place.

                       ment.
                    ♦ The maximum height of the hotel should remain below the eleva-
                       tion of the bluff behind. The bluff behind the hotel should remain
                       legible as a green edge with existing mature trees maintained on
                       site.
                    ♦ The hotel design should minimize impacts to public views of the
                       beach and Village from Depot Hill.
                    ♦ Parking for the hotel should be provided in a way that minimizes
                       vehicle traffic in the Village and strengthens the Village as a pedes-
                       trian-oriented destination. This could be achieved through remote
                       parking, shuttle services, and valet parking arrangements.

Action LU-7.1      Village Design Guidelines. Update the Village Design Guidelines to
                   reflect current conditions and to encourage new development that will
                   enhance the unique qualities of the Village. These guidelines will help
                   to protect scenic resources, support economic development, and en-
                   hance the Village as an area for both residents and visitors. Guidelines

Policies
Policy LU-8.1 Phased Mall Redevelopment. Encourage a phased approach to redevelopment of the Mall property. Early phases may include im-
              provements to the Mall façade and front entrance, and new retail pads fronting 41st Avenue. These early improvements shall not con-
              flict with the ultimate vision for the property, as represented in the 41st Avenue/Capitola Mall Vision Plan (see Figure LU-6).
Policy LU-8.2 Parking Lot Redevelopment. Encourage the develop-

              Capitola Mall surface parking lots located adjacent to 41st
              Avenue and Capitola Road including both sides of 41st Av-
              enue. New pad development along 41st Avenue should
              enhance the design character of 41st Avenue and support
              the long-term vision for the Mall as a pedestrian-friendly
              commercial destination. Ensure that parking lot redevel-
              opment does not result in an inadequate supply of on-site
              parking that results in overflow parking in adjacent residen-
              tial neighborhoods.
Policy LU-8.3 Metro Center Relocation. Support the relocation of the

Enhancing Capitola’s Commercial and Mixed-Use Districts
The General Plan envisions commercial and mixed-use districts to be vibrant and inviting areas that contribute to a high quality
of life. To achieve this vision, these areas will need to become attractive destinations with a design character that is safe and
inviting for pedestrians. New development in these areas, when it occurs, will need to be carefully designed to enhance Capi-
tola’s unique identity, minimize impacts to neighboring properties, promote transportation alternatives, and create a safe and
welcoming environment for pedestrians. Mixed-use districts in Capitola include the Village and areas along Capitola Avenue
and Capitola Road east of 41st Avenue. Below are general strategies that can be used in these areas to achieve these goals.
  ♦ Compatibility. The height, massing, setbacks, and design
     character of buildings should be sensitive to impacts on sur-
     rounding development.
  ♦ Unique Identity. Buildings should be designed to reinforce
     Capitola’s unique identity in a way that complements the
     community’s historic character.
  ♦ Visual Interest. New development should incorporate finely
     detailed building façades that contribute visual interest to the
     streetscape.
  ♦ Pedestrian Orientation. Buildings should be oriented to-
     wards the pedestrian realm with active ground floor uses and
     inviting storefronts facing the sidewalk.
  ♦ Plazas and Open Space. Semi-public outdoor spaces, such
                                                                      Windows, landscaping, and architectural detail add visual interest to the Nob Hill shopping

capitola general plan

  ♦ Connections to Adjacent Properties. Shared facilities such as driveways, parking areas, plazas, and walkways should be used to improve con-
     nections and integration of adjacent properties.
  ♦ Parking Location and Design. Surface parking areas should not
     be located adjacent to a public street. If unavoidable, surface park-
     ing areas should be visually screened with buildings, landscaping,
     or low walls and fencing along the edge to the sidewalk. Parking
     should be designed in clusters, encouraging walking between mul-
     tiple destinations. Parking lots should incorporate safe pedestrian
     walkways between buildings.
  ♦ Vehicle Access. Points of vehicle access (curb cuts) from the
     street to the property should be limited to the minimum number
     necessary to serve the property.
  ♦ Pedestrian and Bicycle Access and Circulation. Clear, safe
     points of access to sites should be provided for pedestrians and bi-
     cyclists as well as vehicles.                                         Buildings oriented towards the sidewalk support a pedestrian-friendly environment in
                                                                           the Village
  ♦ Public Transit Access. Bus stops should be evaluated for conven-
     ience, safety, visibility, and covered shelter.
  ♦ Sustainable Design. Sustainable design practices should be incorporated into new development, including climate-appropriate plant materials,
     sustainable stormwater solutions, and solar orientation.

4 OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATIO

INTRODUCTION
State law requires that a General Plan include both an Open Space Element and a Conservation Element. This General Plan combines these two ele-
ments into a single Open Space and Conservation Element that addresses their similar and overlapping concerns, and satisfies the legal requirements
for both.
State law identifies a series of topics that must be addressed in the Open Space and Conservation Elements. The Conservation Element is required to
address the conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources, including forests, rivers and other waters, fisheries, plants and wildlife,
minerals, and soils. The Open Space Element must address a range of open space types, including six major categories of open space. Most of these
types of open space are covered in this Open Space and Conservation Element while a few are covered elsewhere in this General Plan. Table OSC-1
lists all six types of open space and identifies where they are addressed in this General Plan.
Not all required topics are discussed in this Element because either they are included elsewhere in the General Plan or such resources do not exist in
Capitola. For example, areas important for the preservation of historic and cultural resources are addressed in the Land Use Element, and open space
for public health and safety is primarily discussed in the Safety Element. Meanwhile, Capitola does not have agricultural, forest, or mineral resources, so
they are not addressed at all in this General Plan. Other federal and State laws require communities to address the community production of green-
house gas (GHG) emissions, air quality, and solid waste and to develop impact reduction strategies. To this end, the Open Space and Conservation
Element addresses the topics of GHG emissions reduction, air quality, and waste reduction.
This Element addresses the following topics:
   ♦ General environmental sustainability and stewardship
   ♦ Climate change and greenhouse gas reduction
   ♦ Air quality
   ♦ Renewable energy sources and energy conservation
   ♦ Biological resources
   ♦ Water quality and conservation
   ♦ Food production
   ♦ Waste reduction

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
General Environmental Sustainability and Stewardship
The World Commission on Environment and Development defines sus-
tainable as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs. One of the guid-
ing principles of this General Plan is to embrace environmental sustain-
ability as a foundation for Capitola’s way of life. This principle recogniz-
es that Capitola’s environmental resources, including the beaches,
creeks, ocean, and lagoon, are a fundamental part of the city’s character.
Community involvement is a key aspect of a sustainable community,
and the City of Capitola is committed to working with residents and
businesses to promote environmental sustainability.
The City of Capitola has a strong track record of environmental sustain-
ability objectives. In recent years, Capitola has undertaken the following
sustainability initiatives:
                                                                              Capitola’s Coastal Setting
  ♦ Urban Environmental Accords. The City has adopted the United
     Nations’ Urban Environmental Accords, committing the City to work to achieve a set of 21 accords addressing the topics of energy, waste reduction,
     urban design, urban nature, transportation, and water.
  ♦ Green Building Ordinance. The City adopted a Green Building Ordinance, reducing energy demands, strain on infrastructure, and waste in new
     construction and redevelopment.
  ♦ Community Tree and Forest Management Ordinance. The City adopted a Community Tree and Forest Management Ordinance to protect and
     enhance the existing tree cover on public and private lands in Capitola.

   ♦ Leaf Blower Ordinance. The City adopted a Leaf Blower Ordinance, restricting leaf blower use on residential property, which reduces noise and
       public health impacts, as well as fuel consumption.
   ♦ Light Brown Apple Moth Resolution. The City adopted a resolution opposing aerial spraying to eradicate light brown apple moth populations.
   ♦ Plastics Ordinance. The City adopted ordinances to ban the use of plastic bags and polystyrene foam food service ware.
   ♦ Stormwater Ordinance. The City adopted a Stormwater Pollution Prevention and Protection Ordinance to improve water quality.
Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Reduction
Climate change affects all communities in California, particularly in regard to water supply, flooding, air pollution, heat waves, and sea level rise. Due to
its coastal location, sea level rise and related flooding and coastal erosion are critical issues in Capitola. Unless adequately mitigated, the effects of sea
level rise could impact Capitola’s economy, public safety, and overall quality of life.
The City is taking a proactive approach in addressing greenhouse gas emissions reduction by developing a Climate Action Plan (CAP) in concert with
this General Plan. Key components of the CAP are integrated into the General Plan, and General Plan goals, policies, and actions reinforce the CAP.
The CAP is intended to be updated more frequently than the General Plan,
                                                                                     TABLE OSC- 2 C APITOLA C OMMUNITYWIDE EMISSIONS BY SECTOR, 2005

ured in terms of their global warming potential, expressed as metric tons
of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e). In 2005, approximately 76,020
MTCO2e were emitted within the community of Capitola. As shown in
Table OSC-2, which presents a summary of the findings of AMBAG’s in-
ventory for Capitola, AMBAG measured GHG emissions by sector. Trans-
portation (mainly diesel and gasoline use) contributes the majority of the
community’s GHG emissions, divided between travel on local roads (34
percent) and travel on State highways (19 percent). GHG emissions as a
result of City government operations comprised approximately one per-
cent of the community’s total emissions, or 838 MTCO2e.
Air Quality
Capitola is located within the North Central Coast Air Basin (NCCAB),         Highway 1
which consists of Santa Cruz, San Benito, and Monterey Counties. The Monte-
rey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District (MBUAPCD) is the local agen-
cy responsible for air quality control and monitoring. The MBUAPCD
shares responsibility with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) for
ensuring that State and national ambient air quality standards are met with-
in Santa Cruz County and the NCCAB. State law assigns local air districts
the primary responsibility for controlling air pollution from stationary
sources (i.e. non-moving, fixed-site sources, such as industrial facilities),
while the CARB controls mobile sources (e.g. cars and construction equip-
ment). The MBUAPCD is responsible for regulating air pollution, permitting
and inspecting stationary sources, monitoring air quality, and air quality
planning activities.
                                                                              Highway 1 (top) and Historic Capitola Wharf (bottom)

                                                                                                                                                 capitola general plan

In this portion of the NCCAB, marine breezes from Monterey Bay dominate the climate. These westerly winds predominate in all seasons, but are
strongest and most persistent during the spring and summer months. In general, the air pollution potential of the coastal portion of the NCCAB, in-
cluding Capitola, is relatively low due to these persistent winds. The NCCAB is considered in attainment for most air pollutants, which means that the
Basin meets the State and national standards. However, the NCCAB is in non-attainment for ozone (O3) and course particulate matter (PM10). Vehicles
are a significant source of these pollutants, both directly by combustion and indirectly by the interaction of combustion byproducts with one another
and with ultraviolet (UV) light.
Sensitive receptors include those segments of the population that are most susceptible to poor air quality, such as children, elderly people, and sick
people, as well as sensitive land uses, such as schools, parks, and residential communities. Air quality problems intensify when sources of air pollutants
and sensitive receptors are located near one another. Since schools, parks, and residential areas are located throughout the city, the consideration of
sensitive receptors is an important aspect of the General Plan.
Renewable Energy Sources and Energy Conservation
The residential sector’s energy demands constitute approximately 52 percent of the electricity and natural gas use within Capitola. Typically, the most
important factors influencing residential energy consumption are the size of the house, the type of house (detached single-family or multi-family struc-
ture), the number of major appliances, and the construction and siting of the structure. Residential energy needs are often fulfilled by electricity or a
combination of gas and electricity; the majority (73 percent) of energy used by Capitola homes is natural gas. Space heating is the most energy-
consuming activity in residential structures.
The State of California requires local governments to address energy conservation and efficiency in new construction. The State Building Standard
Code, including Title 24, requires energy conservation and efficiency measures for any new structures, additions to existing structures, changes to the
footprint of structures, or changes to water and heating systems. In Capitola, the Building Department is responsible for enforcing all the provisions of
Title 24.

Biological Resources
There are several significant natural resource areas in the city of Capitola, shown in Figure OSC-1. As a coastal city, Capitola maintains a Local Coastal
Plan, which provides detailed information about Monterey Bay’s natural resources, as well as policies to conserve those resources that complement
those in this General Plan.
Significant natural resource areas in Capitola include:
  ♦ Monterey Bay. The southeastern portion of the city is fronted
     by the Monterey Bay waters. The Monterey Bay, its kelp beds
     and its shoreline provide an important habitat area for marine
     life of all varieties, including the endangered sea otter and en-
     dangered California Brown Pelican. In addition, the Bay pro-
     vides opportunities for public recreation and enjoyment as well
     as commercial operations and ventures.
  ♦ Soquel Creek and Lagoon. Soquel Creek runs through the
     middle of the city into the Monterey Bay. The creek is a year
     round water source for the wildlife in the adjoining riparian cor-
     ridor as well as an important wetland habitat. The lagoon area            Soquel Lagoon
     of the creek is the only significant habitat for migratory non-
     marine waterbirds within the Capitola city limits. In addition, the Creek supports steelhead with resident trout and non-sport species. In recent
     years, Soquel Creek has faced significant problems such as decreased downstream water flows and a decline in water quality. To address these
     and other problems, the City continues to implement its Soquel Creek Lagoon Management Plan and work with the California Department of Fish
     and Wildlife.
  ♦ Riparian Corridors. Riparian corridors in the city include the woodland along the west side of Soquel Creek from the Stockton Avenue Bridge to
     the Highway One overpass (Soquel Creek Riparian corridor), the Noble Gulch Riparian corridor, and the Tannery Gulch Riparian corridor. Wood-
     land in these areas include Black Cottonwood trees, California Sycamores, Coast Live Oaks, Eucalyptus, Monterey Pine, Acacia and Willow trees.
     These corridors provide important natural resources, visual relief and support for numerous wildlife and native vegetation.

  ♦ Monarch Butterfly Habitats. Monarch butterfly habitats are located along Soquel Creek and in the Escalona Gulch area. These areas provide
     overwintering sites for the migrating Monarch butterfly. Each fall, the Monarchs arrive to spend the winter on the branches of the eucalyptus trees.
     The orientation of the groves to wind and sun, the size and density of the trees, and the quiet, undisturbed setting are among the factors that make
     these sites among the few in the County suitable for the butterflies.
Water Quality and Conservation
Soquel Creek is the primary water body in Capitola that flows year round; it flows from the Santa Cruz Mountains to Capitola and discharges to Monte-
rey Bay. Soquel Creek is the primary drainage that makes up the Soquel watershed, which, as shown in Figure OSC-2, constitutes the majority of Capi-
tola. There are also several other smaller drainages that drain into Soquel Creek or seasonally drain directly into Monterey Bay. The Arana-Rodeo wa-
tershed is located in the western third of Capitola, draining Arana Gulch and Rodeo Creek Gulch, which are located west of Capitola.
Historically, Soquel Creek was allowed to flow freely into Monterey Bay. Since the 1990's the City has implemented a Soquel Creek Lagoon Manage-
ment Plan to construct a levee and develop a deep water lagoon with
flows directed into a pipe beneath the beach to maintain fish passage.
This plan addresses concerns for wildlife habitat and water quality issues.
Water Quality
Urban runoff is a major factor that determines water quality in urbanized
communities like Capitola. When stormwater flows over impervious
surfaces, it can carry non-point source pollutants like oil, grease, solvents,
and petroleum products from roadways and parking lots into creeks and
other water bodies into which the stormwater is eventually discharged.
In Capitola, five storm drain outfalls discharge stormwater into Soquel

The City has prepared stormwater management plans to address water quality, among other goals, including a storm drain master plan for the Village
and a citywide Stormwater Management Program that describes best management practices related to its drainage infrastructure, including zero dis-
charge sidewalk cleaning. On July 25, 2013 the City adopted the Stormwater Pollution Prevention and Protection Ordinance which establishes regula-
tions regarding illicit discharges to protect water quality.
Periodically, the waters at Capitola Beach are posted as being unsafe for body contact. From 2001 to 2004, and again in 2009, Capitola Beach was
listed by the non-profit volunteer group Heal the Bay as being one of the 20 worst beaches in California due to high fecal coliform counts. As with all
coastal lagoons in Santa Cruz County, Soquel Lagoon is permanently posted as unsafe for human contact. The waters off the beach are monitored by
Santa Cruz County and posted when bacteria levels are high.
During summer months the Soquel Lagoon is created by closing a flume that prevents Soquel Creek from flowing into the ocean. This practice has
enables expansion of Capitola Beach and been occurring since the 1920’s.
Bacterial contamination on Capitola Beach and Soquel Lagoon is attributed to many factors, including high numbers of birds roosting around the La-
goon and beach, urban runoff in the upper and lower watershed, leaky sewer lines, and manholes. Gulls and other birds are the major source of con-
tamination, contributing up to 77 percent of the bacterial load at Capitola Beach. In 2008, the City constructed a biofiltration treatment wetland on ¼-
acre of City-owned property adjacent to Soquel Lagoon to treat stormwater to assist with water quality improvement in the Lagoon.
Water Conservation
Water for the City of Capitola is provided by the Soquel Creek Water District (SqCWD) for areas primarily east of 41st Avenue, and by the City of Santa
Cruz Water Department (SCWD) for areas primarily west of 41st Avenue. The SqCWD provides approximately 90 percent of the total water used in
Capitola.
Both the SqCWD and the SCWD are facing a number of critical constraints in their ability to provide enough water to meet current and future demands.
The SqCWD relies entirely on groundwater for their water supply. Public and private groundwater users have and continue to exceed the estimated
sustainable yield of the Soquel-Aptos Groundwater Basin, thus increasing the potential for seawater intrusion (i.e. the movement of salt water into
freshwater supplies, which can contaminate drinking water supplies). Salt water-intruded reservoirs are rendered unusable and are estimated to re-
quire centuries to rejuvenate for continued use. In addition, the sustainable yield of the Soquel-Aptos Groundwater Basin may be less than currently

estimated. The SCWD relies almost entirely on surface water sources, and during drought conditions does not have sufficient supply to meet demand.
To help address their respective supply issues, the two water purveyors have instituted a number of water conservation programs and have studied a
possible desalination plant. Although there are no immediate plans to construct a desalination facility, such a plant could provide needed water supply
during droughts, protect groundwater aquifers, and improve water supply reliability for regional users.
Food Production
Because the majority of Capitola is developed, there are no commercial farming operations within the city limits. However, the surrounding Monterey
Bay area is home to many small and organic farms that provide local food to the region. Capitola’s climate is conducive to growing food; many resi-
dents have small gardens in their yards, and there are opportunities for community gardens in Capitola.
Waste Reduction
The City of Capitola has a franchise agreement with Green Waste Recovery for the collection of refuse, recycling, and yard waste. Solid waste collected
in Capitola is transferred to the Monterey Peninsula Class III Landfill located in the City of Marina, which is operated by the Monterey Regional Waste
Management District. The landfill has a remaining waste capacity of approximately 40 million tons and an anticipated life capacity of 100 years.
The City of Capitola is very committed to recycling and sponsors recycling collection service through its Refuse, Recycling, and Yard Waste Collection
Franchise Agreement with Green Waste Recovery. Currently, 51 percent of the city’s waste is diverted from the landfill. Recycling collection is part of a
comprehensive service package available to any resident or business of the city. Unlimited recycling collection is included in the cost of refuse collec-
tion, and recycling bins are “single stream,” allowing all recyclable material to go into one bin; Green Waste Recovery sorts the materials at their Castro-
ville facility.

5 MOBILIT

INTRODUCTION
The Mobility Element establishes a framework for a balanced transportation system in Capitola that meets the needs of residents, workers, and visitors.
It aims to support a range of transportation choices, including vehicle travel, transit, bicycling, and walking. The Mobility Element envisions a transporta-
tion system that enhances resident’s quality of life, supports a vibrant local economy, and promotes environmental sustainability goals. The Element
also addresses the unique mobility needs of Capitola Village and residential neighborhoods that contribute to Capitola’s unique sense of place.
State law requires that the Mobility Element include “the general location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation
routes, (and) terminals…, all correlated with the Land Use Element of the Plan” (Govt. Code, Sec. 65302[b]). In addition, the California Complete
Streets Act (AB 1358), passed in 2008, requires all General Plan updates after January 1, 2011 to “plan for a balanced, multimodal transportation net-
work that meets the needs of all users of streets, roads, and highways for safe and convenient travel” and defines “users of streets, roads, and high-
ways” to include pedestrians, bicyclists, users of public transportation, motorists, children, persons with disabilities, and seniors.
In addition to this Introduction, the Mobility Element is divided into two sections:
   ♦ Mobility Background. This section describes the existing transportation system in Capitola, including roadways, transit service, rail service, and bi-
     cycle and pedestrian facilities.
   ♦ Goals, Policies, and Actions. Provides goals, policies, and actions to address the mobility needs of the City of Capitola.

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Roadway Network
The roadway network in Capitola consists of freeways, arterials, col-
lectors, and local streets as classified by their function, commonly
referred to as the functional roadway classification system (FCS).
This traditional FCS is based on the mobility and access functions of
roads for motor vehicle, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic and
allows the City to properly design and manage roads to ensure safe-
ty and ease of maneuverability.
Street classifications are described in Table MO-1 and are illustrated Highway 1 along Capitola’s northern boundary
in Figure MO-1.
Existing Traffic Volumes
Figure MO-2 shows estimated average daily trips (ADTs) of vehicles on selected roads in and around Capitola. The ADTs are illustrated using color-
coded lines, with red being the highest volumes, followed by orange and then yellow. Specific count data and the year of the count (shown in paren-
theses) is shown numerically at designated intersections and along roadway segments. ADT estimations were derived from data collected by the City
of Capitola, the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission, and Caltrans. This data represents the most current information available at
the time this General Plan was prepared.

Capitola Village Parking
Parking is a key issue in Capitola Village. This is largely because Capitola Village is a higher density developed area and a desirable destination for a
variety of local and regional users, particularly during peak summer, holiday, and weekend periods. Routine and predictable users include those des-
tined for retail, restaurant, beach, and residential uses.
Parking Supply and Demand
A 2008 Village parking study found a supply of 1,036 parking spaces in the Village. Of these spaces, 682 are off-street with the remaining 354 on-street
(RBF Consulting, 2008). During peak summer, holiday, and weekend periods, parking demand often exceeds this supply. The 2008 study found park-
ing demand on summer weekends to exceed supply by 176 spaces, and recommended increasing parking supply by 390 spaces for optimal circulation
to accommodate existing land uses. In 2014 the new Village and Beach Parking Lot #2 opened, adding an additional 233 new spaces to serve the Vil-
lage.
Parking Management
Parking meters and pay stations are currently utilized in core areas of the Village as a strategy to manage the limited parking supply. The remainder of
the parking supply is managed through the use of permits. A limited number of Village parking permits are provided to Village residents and employ-
ees.
Capitola also provides a Village shuttle bus service to reduce visitor parking in residential neighborhoods. The Village shuttle bus service is provided on
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays during the summer (Memorial Day weekend through mid-September). This service transports riders from parking lot
near the Highway 1/Bay Avenue interchange to the Village. The shuttle bus service is required by the California Coastal Commission as a condition of
the City’s residential parking program.
Truck Routes
The City of Capitola does not have an ordinance that establishes designated truck routes. Truck routes restrict vehicles that are within a gross vehicle
weight, licensed commercially as a truck, and used for carrying goods for pickup and delivery. Such an ordinance would require trucks to only drive on

truck-designated streets, except when necessary for egress and ingress by direct route to and from a restricted street for the purposes of loading or un-
loading.

A majority of the existing truck traffic travels along the existing arterial roads, particularly 41 Avenue, Clares Street, Capitola Road, Bay Avenue, Capitola
Avenue and Cliff Drive in and out of the Village. However, cut-through traffic on residential streets is an issue. For instance, trucks delivering materials
to stores at Kings Plaza, located on the southwest corner of 41st Avenue and Capitola Road, often use 38th Avenue and travel east to Brommer Street,
                         st
and then north onto 41 Avenue.
Transit Service
Bus transit service and paratransit service for people with disabilities in Capito-
la is provided by Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit (Metro). Metro serves all of
Santa Cruz County and the cities of Scotts Valley, Santa Cruz, Capitola, and
Watsonville. Metro partners with the Regional Transportation Commission
(SCCRTC), the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG), UC
Santa Cruz Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS), and the Santa Clara
Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) in overall transportation improvement
planning and transit services.
As shown in Figure MO-3, there are ten Metro transit lines that service Capito-
la. With the exception of Line 91x, all public transit lines stop at the Capitola
Mall, which serves as the primary mid-county transit hub. Three bus lines (53

with light service, 54, and 55) also serve Capitola Village. The primary transit
routes overlap with arterials and collectors in the City. Arterial routes that also
serve as transit routes include 41st Avenue, Capitola Road, Capitola Avenue,
Bay Avenue, and Park Avenue.

Bicycle Network
In February 2011, Capitola adopted an updated Bicycle Transportation Plan
(BTP). The BTP sets goals and objectives for the purpose of increasing the
safety and convenience of bicycle commuting in and around Capitola.
According to the BTP, roughly one-third of all commuters in Capitola in 2000
had a less than 15-minute trip to work, which suggests that the distance trav-
eled was likely less than 9 miles if driving at 35 mph, 2.5 miles if bicycling, or
1.25 miles if walking. All of these trips are achievable on a bicycle in less than
one hour. By breaking down barriers to bicycle commuting, especially for
those who live within 9 miles of work, the BTP identifies ways to improve bike
ridership and achieve the BTP’s goal of 5 percent of total trips and 20 percent
of commuter trips by bicycle by the year 2020.
                                                                                                          st
The BTP identifies a number of existing and proposed bikeways for Capitola,            Bicycle lanes on 41 Avenue
as shown in Figure MO-4. In addition to the bikeways shown in Figure MO-4,
a multi-use trail for bicycles and pedestrians is planned along the The Santa Cruz Branch rail line corridor. The long term plan is for the multi-use trail
to cross Soquel Creek along the trestle. In the short term, the rail trail will cross Soquel Creek over Stockton Bridge in the Village until sufficient funds
are available to retrofit the trestle to accomodate bicycles and pedestrians.

Pedestrian Circulation
Pedestrian mobility is accomodated primarily through sidewalks and dedicated pathways. Capitola has about 26 miles of roadways, of which about 50
percent have sidewalks. The City relies on the State Streets and Highways Code, which requires property owners to maintain sidewalks fronting their
property, with the exception of some sidewalks in the Village. Dedicated pedestrian pathways, such as along Prospect Bluff, also enable pedestrians to
reach destinations in Capitola where roadways do not permit direct walking access.
As shown in Figure MO-5, there are many areas throughout Capitola that do not have adequate or complete sidewalk facilities. Most notably, this in-
cludes a variety of streets between 41st Avenue and Wharf Road, a small neighborhood west of 41st Avenue and north of Clares Street, various streets
north and south of Bay Avenue, residential areas north of Capitola Village, a portion of Park Avenue, and the associated residential streets north of Park
Avenue along McCormick Avenue.
Rail Corridor
The Santa Cruz Branch rail line corridor parallels Highway 1
extending almost 32 miles from the community of Pajaro in
Monterey County, to Davenport in Santa Cruz County. This line
extends generally east to west through Capitola. As shown in Fig-
ure MO-6, within Capitola there are four at-grade crossings and
two tressles, including a major crossing over Soquel Creek. The
right-of-way is generally 50 to 60 feet wide.
The Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission
(RTC) acquired the Santa Cruz Branch Rail Line right-of-way in
the Fall of 2012 for recreational rail, preservation, and future
transportation uses. Planned transportation uses within this right-      Freight rail service crossing the trestle
of-way include passenger rail service, bicycle and pedestrian
facilities, and freight rail service. In 2013, the RTC adopted plans for a new multi-use bicycle and pedestrian trail parallel to the rail tracks as part of a

INTRODUCTION
The Safety and Noise Element combines two elements required by State law, the Safety Element and the Noise Element. The Safety and Noise Element
addresses risks in Capitola to the community’s health and safety, identifying potential hazards and providing policies to protect against and mitigate
those hazards.
The Safety and Noise element is closely related to Capitola’s Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (LHMP). The LHMP documents and plans for mitigation of
hazards in Capitola, and it makes the City eligible for federal financial assistance related to natural hazards. The specific hazards covered in Capitola’s
LHMP are earthquakes and liquefaction, coastal storms and flooding, sea level rise, drought, windstorms, coastal erosion and bluff failure, tsunami, haz-
ardous materials, wildfire, and landslides and mudflows.
The Safety section of this element complements the LHMP, providing information about risks in Capitola due to natural and human-made hazards. It
addresses the protection of the community from risks associated with the effects of:
   ♦ Flooding and tsunami inundation
   ♦ Seismic and geologic hazards
   ♦ Fire
   ♦ Hazardous materials
The Safety section also contains information and policies regarding general emergency preparedness, emergency response and public safety.
The Noise section of this element identifies sources of noise in Capitola and defines strategies for reducing the negative impact of noise to the commu-
nity. Noise is an environmental pollutant that can threaten the quality of life and human health by causing annoyance or disrupting sleep and everyday
activities.
State law requires that the General Plan include a Noise Element, which is to be prepared according to guidelines adopted by the California Office of
Noise Control. In accordance with State law requirements, this Noise Element aims to limit community exposure to unwanted, unhealthy, and disrup-
tive sources of noise.

In addition to this Introduction, the Safety and Noise Element is divided into two sections:
  ♦ Background Information: Provides information about current risks due to natural and human-made hazards, existing sources of noise, sensitive
     receptors, existing and future noise conditions, and noise and land use compatibility guidelines.
  ♦ Goals, Policies, and Actions: Provides policy guidance for reducing the risks to health and property due to natural and human-made hazards,
     and reducing community exposure to existing and projected noise sources.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
Flooding and Inundation
Flood Hazards
Flooding is a high priority safety issue in Capitola, particularly in the Village. During a
heavy storm in March 2011, major flooding in the Village occurred when Noble Gulch
overwhelmed its drainage pipe that extends under Village and Beach Parking Lot #2,
causing significant damage to homes and businesses. This storm event and the failed
drainage pipe vividly demonstrate the potential risks and vulnerability of flooding in
the Village. Storm events such as this occur relatively frequently and create flooding
risks for the Village. Flows associated with large storm events often result in signifi-
cant amounts of vegetation debris, including trees and limbs, blocking flows, particu-
                                                                                            Recreational amenities within the tsunami inundation area
larly at the Stockton Bridge, further exacerbating flood conditions.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is responsible for mapping areas subject to flooding during a 100-year flood event (i.e. an event
with a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year). As shown in Figure SN-1, nearly all of Capitola Village, all of Soquel Creek, and a portion of
Noble Gulch are within the 100-year flood zone. FEMA also manages the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which provides insurance to
communities that participate in the program, and works with State and local agencies to adopt floodplain management policies and flood mitigation
measures. The Community Rating System (CRS) is part of the NFIP; this voluntary incentive program encourages floodplain management that exceeds
the minimum NFIP requirements by providing discounted flood insurance premium rates.

Flood Protection and Stormwater Drainage
The Santa Cruz County Flood Control, the Water Conservation District, and the City of Capitola provide flood protection and stormwater drainage for
Capitola. The City of Capitola maintains its street drainage systems and relies on the County to provide major storm drain services. The infrastructure
associated with flood protection and stormwater drainage includes underground systems, above ground drainage ditches and water courses, pump
stations, catch basins, and outfalls.
Tsunami Inundation Hazards
A tsunami is a series of traveling ocean waves generated by some kind of rare, catastrophic event, including earthquakes, submarine landslides, and
volcanic eruptions. Tsunamis can travel over the ocean surface at speeds of 400 to 500 miles per hour or more, and wave heights at the shore can
range from inches to in excess of 50 feet. Factors influencing the size and speed of a tsunami include the source and magnitude of the triggering
event, as well as off-shore and on-shore topography.
As shown in Figure SN-2, nearly all of Capitola Village is located within the tsunami inundation area, as mapped by the California Emergency Manage-
ment Agency. 1 Other inundation areas include Soquel Creek, a ¼-mile portion of Noble Gulch, and the Capitola shoreline. While the coastal cliffs
would block inland flows, substantial erosion would likely occur as the result of a tsunami. In the event of a tsunami, people or structures within these
areas could be exposed to a significant risk of loss, injury, or death due to flooding.
Seismic and Geologic Hazards
Capitola’s geologic characteristics are heavily influenced by its coastal setting. The land is considered a marine terrace, a flat section of coastline that is
terraced, like a staircase. Coastal streams, such as Soquel Creek, carve the landscape. Siltstone and sandstone make up the underlying geologic for-
mation, with outcrops of severely weathered, soft, light grayish-brown sandstone in coastal bluff areas.
           1
             The tsunami inundation area is considered a maximum estimate (i.e. based upon the maximum tsunami runup), taking into consideration a number of extreme, yet realistic, tsunami sources.

Seismicity and Faults
Capitola is located in one of the most seismically active areas of the country. Although there are no known active faults running through Capitola, there
are several significant faults in the region, including the San Andreas, Zayante, and Palo Colorado-San Gregorio Faults. The San Andreas Fault, which is
located in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and the Zayante Fault, which is located north of the city, pose the most probable seismic hazards to Capitola.
Figure SN-3 shows the locations of the San Andreas and Zayante Faults.
The main trace of the San Andreas Fault is approximately 9 miles northeast of Capitola. One of the largest earthquakes in the Santa Cruz area, the Lo-
ma Prieta earthquake occurred on October 17, 1989 due to movement on this fault, measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale and causing significant ground
shaking in Capitola. The epicenter of the Loma Prieta earthquake was approximately 5 miles northeast of Capitola.
The Zayante Fault is located approximately 5 miles northeast of Capitola, and the Palo Colorado-San Gregorio Fault is located approximately 14 miles
southwest of Capitola. The California Division of Mines and Geology considers the Zayante Fault active, although it has not caused any significant
earthquakes historically—only some aftershocks after the Loma Prieta earthquake. The Palo Colorado-San Gregorio Fault is not well understood, but is
considered potentially active.
Liquefaction
Earthquakes can cause soil liquefaction, in which loose, saturated sandy soils lose internal strength and transform from a solid to a liquefied state. This
happens in sandy-type soils that are relatively free of silt and clay and that are saturated; liquefaction is also affected by the characteristics of the earth-
quake event, the proximity of the soil to groundwater, and human-made structures. As shown in Figure SN-4, significant portions of Capitola are sus-
ceptible to liquefaction.

Landslides and Mudflows
Because the majority of Capitola is flat, landslides and mudflows are not a
significant concern throughout much of the city. However, there are some
areas of steep slopes, especially along creeks, gulches, and coastal bluffs,
which are susceptible to landslides and mudflows. In particular, the areas
above Soquel Creek, below Wharf Road, and along coastal bluffs, pose land-
slide risks.
Fire
Based on available fire mapping for Santa Cruz County, there are no wildland
fire hazard areas in Capitola, although there are fire hazard areas nearby in the
foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. In addition, there have been no signifi-
cant wildland fire events in Capitola. However, parts of Capitola with signifi-
cant vegetation, such as along creeks and in and near the New Brighton Beach
State Park, are susceptible to fire from natural or human-made causes. In par-
ticular, the Eucalyptus groves in Capitola, which are an invasive species, are
highly flammable due to the large amounts of leaf litter on the ground and the
oil content of the leaves.
Urban fires pose a greater threat to Capitola than wildland fires due to the
urbanized nature of the city. Fire protection services for Capitola are provided
by the Central Fire Protection District of Santa Cruz County (CFPD), which was
formed in 1987 as a result of the consolidation of the Capitola, Soquel, and
Live Oak Fire Districts. CFPD has four fire stations, one of which is located on
                                                                                   Property on bluffs impacted by erosion and landslides (top) and CFPD fire station
405 Capitola Avenue across from City Hall. The other stations are located in       on Capitola Avenue (bottom)
Soquel (one station) and Live Oak (two stations). CFPD has a response time
goal of eight minutes or less from the time a call is placed for a fire emergency.

Hazardous Materials
A “hazardous material” is defined by California Health and Safety Code Section 25501 as “any material that, because of its quantity, concentration, or
physical or chemical characteristics, poses a significant present or potential hazard to human health and safety or to the environment if released into
the workplace or the environment.” Improper handling of hazardous materials or waste may result in significant impacts on human health and the
environment. Many businesses and residents in Capitola use hazardous materials and generate some amount of hazardous waste. Common hazard-
ous waste is generated from gasoline service stations, dry cleaners, automotive mechanics, auto body repair shops, machine shops, printers and photo
processors, and agriculture.
The Santa Cruz County Department of Environmental Health Services is the agency responsible for enforcing State hazardous materials and waste regu-
lations in Capitola. Household hazardous waste is collected, free of charge, by the Santa Cruz County Hazardous Waste Program. The closest hazard-
ous waste collection facility to Capitola is the Buena Vista Landfill, which is located approximately 15 miles south of Capitola off Buena Vista Drive.
Emergency Response
The Santa Cruz County Operational Area Emergency Management Plan establishes a comprehensive approach to managing emergency situations in
Santa Cruz County, including prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. The Operational Area Emergency Management Plan also identifies the
organizational structure for emergency management responsibilities in the Santa Cruz County Operational Area. In addition, this Plan contains a threat
summary for Santa Cruz County, which addresses the potential for natural, technological, and domestic security threats, including major transportation
system related incidents. The potential for an automobile related threat exists primarily along Highway 1. No train service currently operates in Capitola,
but were the train to become operational again, train derailment could become a potential hazard.
Capitola is also within the region covered by the Bay Area Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI), which provides federal financial assistance for terrorism
preparedness planning.

Public Safety
Police protection services in Capitola are provided by the Capitola Police Department. Their main station is located on Capitola Avenue, adjacent to City
Hall. The Police Department also operates a Community Outreach Center located in the Capitola Mall. Based on police data between 2008 and 2010,
the largest numbers of infractions in Capitola were for larceny and vandalism/graffiti. The Police Department’s average response times are well within
comparable regional and State standards. In 2013, on-duty coverage rate was sufficient for both special events and normal day-to-day operations.
Noise
Capitola’s most significant noise concerns stem from roadway noise, particu-
larly along well-traveled corridors such as Highway 1 and local arterials.
Noise is generally defined as unwanted sound, and may produce physiologi-
cal or psychological damage and/or interfere with communication, work, rest,
recreation, or sleep. Noise is especially a concern in the vicinity of noise-
sensitive uses, which are generally defined as locations where people reside
or where the presence of unwanted sound could adversely affect the use of
land, such as residences, schools, and hospitals.
Noise Measurements
                                                                                   Roadway traffic causes noise in Capitola
Noise intensity is measured on a decibel (dB) scale. On this scale, noise at
zero decibels is not audible, while noise at 120 to 140 decibels is painful and can cause ear damage. There are several different ways to measure
noise. Community noise is typically measured in decibels with A-weighting (dBA). The dBA scale provides compensation for human sensitivity by dis-
criminating against frequencies to approximate the sensitivity of the human ear. For evaluating noise over extended periods, the “Day-Night Noise Lev-
el” scale (Ldn) and the “Community Noise Equivalent Level” (CNEL) are measures of the average equivalent sound level (Leq) during a 24-hour peri-
od. These measurements of noise account for greater sensitivity of noise receptors at night by adding 5 decibels (for evening hours between 7:00 pm
and 10:00 pm) and 10 decibels (for evening hours between 10:00 pm and 7:00 am) to nighttime noise levels, and averaging the noise over a full day.

Existing Noise Sources
The primary noise source in Capitola is largely from automobile traffic (cars and trucks) traveling on local roadways. As a general rule, peak pass-by
noise levels for passenger vehicles on local streets are 60 to 70 dBA at 25 feet. Buses, trucks, motorcycles, and poorly muffled cars produce pass-by
noise level 5 to 15 dBA higher. The sound level of noise from traffic in decibels is related to the amount of traffic. Noise intensity increases as the prox-
imity of the noise source physically approaches the listener to a greater degree. A doubling or halving of traffic volume typically results in a 3-dB in-
crease or decrease, respectively, in the traffic sound level. A change of 3 dB is generally considered to be the threshold for a perceptive change in
sound. In general, a 10-dB increase in noise level is perceived as a doubling in loudness.
Primary roadways that generate the most noise in Capitola include Highway 1, 41st Avenue, Capitola Avenue, Capitola Road, Bay Avenue, Monterey
Avenue, Wharf Road, and Park Avenue. Trains are not currently operating in Capitola, but were operations to resume, trains along the railroad could
become an intermittent source of noise, depending on their source of locomotion. Aircraft flying overhead is occasionally audible in Capitola, but is not
a significant noise source relative to traffic noise. Other noise sources typical in this urban location include dogs barking, leaf blowers, and children play-
ing. These sources are not significant compared to the noise produced by the dominant transportation sources.
Sensitive Receptors
Noise sensitive land uses are typically given special attention to achieve protection from excessive noise. Noise sensitive land uses include residential
areas, hospitals, libraries, schools, parks, and retirement homes. Highways and major arterials such as Highway 1, 41st Avenue, Bay Avenue, Capitola
Avenue, Capitola Road, and Clares Avenue could have an effect on some sensitive land uses.
Existing and Future Noise Conditions
Figure SN-5 shows the general level of noise conditions resulting from traffic traveling on roadways in Capitola, rated on a scale from Moderate to High
to Very High. As would be expected, the highest noise levels are generated along Highway 1 and the northerly portion of 41st Avenue, where traffic
volumes are the greatest. High levels of traffic-generated noise also occur along the city’s arterial roads including the southern portion of 41st Avenue
(where the roadway narrows from four to two lanes), Capitola Road, Clares Street, Wharf Road, and the four-lane sections of Bay Avenue and Park Av-
enue.

Figure SN-6 shows the projected future noise conditions resulting from anticipated traffic in 2035. These projected noise conditions are based on pro-
jected land uses, and this figure uses the same scale as the existing noise conditions figure described above.
Noise and Land Use Compatibility Guidelines
The objective of the noise and land use compatibility guidelines is to provide the community with a means of judging the noise environment that it
deems to be generally acceptable and to minimize noise-related complaints from residents. The compatibility policies shown in Table SN-1 should be
used in conjunction with the future noise intensity levels in Figure SN-6 to identify locations that may require special treatment to minimize noise expo-
sure.
If ambient noise levels in the area of a proposed project would exceed “normally acceptable” thresholds for the proposed land use category as shown
in Table SN-1, the City will require a detailed analysis of feasible noise reduction requirements. As needed, noise insulation features must be included

7 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMEN

INTRODUCTION
The Economic Development Element aims to maintain and grow the
Capitola economy. Capitola’s long-term economic health will deter-
mine whether residents and visitors will be able to enjoy a high quality
of life and find opportunities for work and recreation. The Economic
Development Element identifies economic challenges and opportuni-
ties, and sets forth policies that will guide the economy toward ful-
filling the community’s vision and maintain the economic strength of
the city.
In addition to this Introduction, the Economic Development Element is
divided into two main sections:
   ♦ Economic Development Background. This section describes the
       existing economy in Capitola, its competitive position and em-
                                                                             Beachfront dining on Capitola Beach

BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The Capitola economy is unique, yet firmly integrated into the larger regional economies encompassing Santa Cruz County and the Monterey Bay Area
region. According to the Association of Monterey Bay Governments (AMBAG), the city’s 9,918 residents and 6,170 jobs comprised about 4 percent and
6 percent of the respective totals in Santa Cruz County.
Despite its relatively small size, Capitola is a major shopping and tourism destination, offering a regional mall, a cluster of large-scale regional retailers,
boutique retail, and beachfront tourist destinations. The remainder of the economy is primarily focused on retail that serves residents’ daily needs, and
professional services, with limited industrial or office space beyond those needs.
Capitola is a relatively small city located in a competitive region. In order for the city’s retail and tourism attractions to succeed, its image is key to its
ongoing success in continuing to attract shoppers and visitors and generating sales tax and transient-occupancy (TOT) tax revenue. These shoppers
and visitors are drawn to the city’s reputation as a family-friendly, accessible, historic, and ecologically-minded community.
Commercial and Industrial Concentrations
Capitola contains the following major commercial and industrial concen-
trations:
  ♦ 41st Avenue is a regional destination for retail needs and generates
     over 80 percent of sales in Capitola. The area features a regional
     mall, several large-format retailers, grocery stores, automobile deal-
     erships, and numerous smaller businesses.
  ♦ Capitola Village is a an attractive seaside tourist destination. The ar-
     ea is small in scale and features locally owned restaurants and spe-
     cialized boutiques selling clothes, jewelry, accessories, crafts, and
     similar goods.                                                                Light industrial uses on Kennedy Drive

                                                                                                                                                   capitola general plan

   ♦ Bay Avenue is a small retail concentration serving local and visitor needs, such
       as groceries and dining.
   ♦ Kennedy Drive features approximately three blocks of heavy commercial and
       light industrial uses.
Local Independent Businesses
Local businesses contribute to Capitola’s unique identity and sense of community,
which serves visitors and residents alike. They meet the daily needs of residents,
provide jobs, and contribute to the city’s tax base and economic diversity. Inde-
pendent local businesses are concentrated on Bay Avenue, in Capitola Village, and
in other Commercial areas of the city.
Employment Composition
Capitola’s focus on retail and tourism is reflected in its employment mix. As shown
in Figure ED-1, retail trade jobs account for nearly 25 percent of employment in the
city, followed by hotel and restaurant jobs, which constitute 15 percent of the city’s
employment. The remaining employment sectors represent a largely resident-
serving economy, including health care, education, and professional services.

Sustainable Jobs
The Capitola community has expressed a strong interest in growing a
“sustainable” economy, i.e. businesses and services that enhance envi-
ronmental sustainability through efficient use of resources. Though
Capitola includes few businesses that produce the types of products
and breakthroughs associated with the sustainable economy, there are
opportunities for the city’s residents, businesses, and government to
grow demand for efficiency-related products and services. Their collec-
tive purchasing decisions when renovating properties, buying goods, or
choosing transportation can spur demand for a homegrown base of
businesses that service and develop sustainable technologies and tech-
niques, while also expanding the city’s reputation for ecological aware-
ness. A growing “sustainable” economy would also provide jobs for
residents. This benefit is particularly important because only 9 percent        Local-serving retail and service at Bay Avenue and Capitola Avenue
of the city’s employed residents are employed within the city, according
to the 2010 U.S. Census.
Retail Sales
As a regional retail destination, Capitola captures sales five to six times beyond what the city’s residents could generate on their own, and sales taxes
provide over 40 percent of the city’s annual revenues. The city’s fiscal well-being is therefore significantly dependent on healthy retail performance.
Sales in the 41st Avenue area, which comprise over 80 percent of citywide sales, suffered a slow decline from 2000 to 2010 as several large stores and
an automobile dealership closed, while new competing retail locations opened elsewhere in the region. Fortunately, the 41st Avenue corridor has
shown resiliency, and these vacancies have since been filled. 41st Avenue stays competitive thanks to its central location and excellent highway access,
but its older structures and retail formats may require long-term reinvestment to maintain ongoing success.

Tourism and Lodging
Tourists are drawn to Capitola for its attractive beachfront, charming Capitola Village, family-
friendly atmosphere, and easy highway access. Currently, most tourists are day-trippers, but
additional high-quality hotels could help expand Capitola’s appeal to longer-term visitors to the
Santa Cruz region. At the same time, new hotels will increase the city’s transient-occupancy tax
revenue, which generated approximately 5 percent of city revenues in 2010.
Competitive Position
Capitola has numerous competitive advantages:
   ♦ Existing, well-located concentrations of regional retail
   ♦ Easy highway access
   ♦ Attractiveness to tourists
   ♦ Identity as a charming and family-friendly beach town
   ♦ Natural resources suited for recreation
   ♦ A strong base of locally-owned businesses
   ♦ Small-town character
   ♦ Community emphasis on ecological awareness
The goals, policies, and actions that follow are intended to capitalize on these advantages to
meet the city’s long-term economic goals.

non-transient use.
National Register of Historic Places. A list prepared by the National Park Services of places worthy of preservation throughout the United States.
Noise Contour. A line connecting points of equal noise level as measured on the same scale. Noise levels greater than the 60 Ldn contour (meas-
ured in dBA) require noise attenuation in residential development.
Noise-Sensitive Use. A location where people reside or where the presence of unwanted sound could adversely affect the use of land, such as resi-
dences, schools, and hospitals.
Open Space. Open Space encompasses lands that essentially are unimproved and that have limited development potential due to the physical char-
acteristics of the land, due to the land being restricted to agricultural production, due to the location of the land as a buffer between urban areas, or
due to the scenic value of the land and its role in maintaining a community's sense of character or heritage.
Overlay. A land use designation or zoning designation that modifies the basic underlying designation or designations in some specific manner.
Ozone. An oxidant, O3, that at ground level makes up the largest single portion of smog. In the upper atmosphere, the presence of ozone acts as a
protectant against harmful ultraviolet rays.
Parcel. A lot, or contiguous group of lots, in single ownership or under single control, usually considered a unit for purposes of development.

Safe Routes to Schools. Pedestrian and bicycling routes that provide safe access to and from schools.
Sensitive Receptors. Members of the population who are most sensitive to air quality, including children, the elderly, the acutely ill, and the chronical-
ly ill. The term “sensitive receptors” can also refer to the land use categories where these people live or spend a significant amount of time. Such areas
include residences, schools, playgrounds, childcare centers, hospitals, retirement homes, and convalescent homes.
Sharrow. A sharrow or ‘shared lane marking (SLM)’ is a pavement marking installed on streets popular with bicyclists but too narrow for conventional
bike lanes.
Slope, 30 percent. A slope defined by 30 units of vertical elevation per 100 units of horizontal distance, measured on a line perpendicular to contours
of equal elevation.
Solid Waste. Unwanted or discarded material, including garbage, with insufficient liquid content to be free flowing.
