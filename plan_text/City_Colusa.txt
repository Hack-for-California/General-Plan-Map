9.1 INTRODUCTION
This Housing Element embodies the City’s plan for addressing the housing needs of residents of the City
through June 2014. The element was prepared by the City of Colusa, with vital assistance from the State

         residents, as well as addressing energy conservation and equal housing opportunity in providing for
         the identified need. While goal and policy statements are general, the housing programs spell out
         the specific actions necessary to achieve the goal and policy objectives adopted in principle.
         Specific actions and programs identified in this document are aimed at meeting the city’s affordable
         housing needs over the 2009-2014 planning period of this document. Specific implementing
         actions are identified for each policy (Note: the RHNA planning period is different than that of the
         Housing Element by statute).
        Section 9.8: Implementing Actions Defined provides a detailed description of the Implementing
         Actions, including programs that will implement the City’s policies. It assigns Responsibility,
         Timeframe, and Funding Source for each of the Implementing Actions.
DATA AND METHODOLOGY
To sufficiently understand the context of local housing, a review and analysis of the community's population
characteristics and housing stock was performed. In preparing the analysis for this updated Housing
Element, every effort has been made to use the most current socioeconomic and building data available.
Data sources used in preparing this document are the 2000 U.S. Census report, data sets available from
the State Department of Finance (DOF), and local and regional data collected from private industry groups
and public and private organizations. The State of California Department of Housing and Community
Development’s (HCD) Colusa County Local Governments Regional Housing Need Allocation Plan January
1, 2007 through June 30, 2014, which is referred to throughout the document as the Regional Housing
Needs Plan (RHNAP) was relied on to determine the share of the regional housing needs allocated to the
City of Colusa.
HCD provided Information on methodology for analysis and guidance in preparing this document. In
addition to online sources, HCD’s housing element preparation workshop and materials on recent
legislation were helpful for the Housing Element update.
Much of the data provided in this document is from the 2000 U.S. Census. The U.S. Census is a
comprehensive program of data-gathering by the federal government conducted once every 10 years. The
next U.S. Census will be conducted in 2010. The 2000 U.S. Census data relied upon in preparing this
document may not reflect current conditions, but is considered among the most comprehensive and reliable
data available. In instances where conditions have likely drastically changed from those reported by the
2000 U.S. Census data, every effort has been made to update the data if reliable and more current data
sources can be identified.
Finally, data were collected from numerous sources for the purposes of updating this element.
Consequently, some data sets may not agree numerically with others. However, the data sets used are
intended to illustrate and identify trends related to housing. Therefore, agreement among data collected
from different sources is, in most cases, not as significant as the trends illustrated. Wherever possible, an
City of Colusa                                                                             Housing Element

attempt was made to minimize data inconsistencies by using the most current and reliable information
available.
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Public participation in preparation of the Housing Element is required under Government Code Section
65588(c). This housing element was developed through the combined efforts of City staff, the City's
Planning Commission, the City Council, and the City's consultants. Public input was received through
workshops conducted on April 22, 2009 and on May 18, 2009.
Subsequently, a public hearing was conducted by the City Council on August 4, 2009.
The notices for all workshops and hearings were published in the Colusa County Sun-Herald and
prominently posted at City Hall. Notices were both e-mailed and sent through the U.S. mail to public
agencies, including Colusa County Department of Health and Human Services, as well private and non-
profit stakeholders, including CFY Development, Mercy Housing California, Eskaton Properties, Inc.,
Christian Church Homes of Northern California, Inc., and Area 3 Agency on Aging. Additional housing
developers who have shown interest in homebuilding in Colusa were notified as well.
Notices were published in both English and Spanish in order to provide outreach to the City's Hispanic
population. In addition, organizations that represent the interests of low-income and special needs
households, or are otherwise involved in the development of affordable housing, were consulted during the
preparation of this element as specified above.
The draft Housing Element has been available in City Hall and has been posted on the City’s website for
review and comments. No comments were received at any of the public hearings and none have been
received either verbally or in writing. However, Colusa will continue to engage the community through the
adoption and implementation of the element. As part of Action H-30 (Monitoring Program), the City will
make diligent efforts to engage the community in the progress of the housing element implementation,
including specifically contacting developers, service providers and other community interests to gather
comments, consider them and revise or adjust the housing element and programs as appropriate.

Section 65302(c) of the California Government Code requires every county and city in the State to include a
housing element as part of its adopted general plan. In stipulating the content of this element, Article 10.6
of the Government Code indicates that the element shall consist of “identification and analysis of existing
and projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, and scheduled
programs for the preservation, improvement and development of housing.” This legislation further states
that the element “shall identify adequate sites for housing, including rental housing, factory-built housing,
and mobile homes, and shall make adequate provision for the existing and projected needs of all economic
segments of the community.”
The 2003 State of California, Office of Planning and Research’s (OPR) General Plan Guidelines and the
California Department of Housing and Community Development’s online resource Building Blocks for
Effective Housing Elements were used as the guiding principles for this document.
RECENT LEGISLATION
Recent legislation pertinent to the preparation of the housing element and housing element law includes AB
1866 (Second Units), SB 1087 (Water and Sewer Service Priority for Affordable Housing), SB 2 (Local
Planning and Approval for Emergency Shelters), AB 2348 (Land Inventory Requirements), and AB 1233

(Provision of Adequate Sites for RHNA). This updated Housing Element has been prepared to respond to
all of these recent changes in legislation
GENERAL PLAN INTERNAL CONSISTENCY
The California Government Code requires internal consistency among the various elements of a general
plan. Section 65300.5 of the Government Code states that the general plan and the parts and elements
thereof shall comprise an integrated and internally consistent and compatible statement of goals. An update
to the Colusa General Plan, excluding the Housing Element, was adopted by the City Council on October
30, 2007. In preparing this Housing Element, a review of the other elements of the General Plan was
undertaken to ensure the consistency of this Housing Element with the content of all other elements of the
General Plan.
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION PLAN
The housing element process begins with the California Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) allocating a region's share of the statewide housing need to Councils of Governments
(COG) based on Department of Finance population projections and regional population forecasts used in
preparing regional transportation plans. The COG is then charged with developing a Regional Housing
Needs Allocation Plan (RHNAP) to allocate the region’s share of the statewide need to the cities and
counties that are member jurisdictions of the COG. This allocation to each community is known as the
community’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). The Tri-County Area Planning Council (TCAPC)
has served in the past as the COG for the Counties of Colusa, Glenn, and Tehama, but has recently
become inactive. Per California Government Code Section 65584.06, HCD is required to develop a plan to
distribute the final determination of regional housing need to each local government not represented by a
council of governments. Due to inactivity on the part of the TCAPC, HCD has prepared the RHNAP for the
Counties of Colusa, Glenn, and Tehama, including the City of Colusa for the planning period including
January 2008 through June 2014. The RHNAP is required to promote the following objectives to:
          1) Increase the housing supply and the mix of housing types, tenure, and affordability in all cities
              and counties within the region in an equitable manner;
          2) Promote infill development and socioeconomic equity, the protection of environmental and
              agricultural resources, and the encouragement of efficient development patterns; and
          3) Promote an improved intraregional relationship between jobs and housing.
The Housing Element details a five-year schedule of actions the community is undertaking or plans to
undertake to achieve its housing goals and objectives, based upon the community’s RHNA, as given in the
RHNAP. To comply with State law in addressing the jurisdiction’s RHNAP, the updated housing element
must identify adequate sites and program actions to accommodate the total RHNAP for each of four (4)
income categories; very-low, low, moderate, and above-moderate. The City’s Housing Element is required
to be updated by August 31, 2009 and sent to HCD for determination of compliance with State law. In
updating the housing element, a jurisdiction may count toward their RHNAP any new units permitted since
the beginning of the RHNP planning period (January 1, 2008). Upon its adoption by the Colusa City
Council, this updated Housing Element will serve as a comprehensive statement of the City’s housing
policies and as a specific guide for program actions to be taken in support of those policies.
State law recognizes that housing needs may exceed available resources and, therefore, does not require
that the City’s quantified objectives be identical to the identified housing needs.        This recognition of
limitations is critical during this period of uncertainties in both the public and private sectors. Fiscal
resources at all governmental levels are limited and uncertain and the private marketplace is currently
facing a challenging economic climate. As a result, the ability of the City and private industry to achieve the
City’s objectives, as stated in this document, may be affected. Therefore, it is intended that this Housing
City of Colusa                                                                              Housing Element

Element be reviewed annually and updated no less than every five years in order to remain relevant and
useful to decision makers, the private sector, and the residents of the City of Colusa.
California Government Code Section 65589(a)(1) states that a city is not expected to spend local revenue
for the construction of housing, housing subsidies, or land acquisition as may be identified as objectives of
this element. It is not the City’s responsibility to guarantee or ensure that the housing units that are needed
to accommodate anticipated population growth are constructed. Instead, the City’s obligations under State
law are to:
         1) Provide adequate, appropriately zoned sites to meet the existing and projected housing needs
             of all economic segments of the community.
         2) Eliminate constraints to the private development of a supply of housing to meet the needs of all
             economic segments of the community.
         3) Facilitate the actions required of the development industry in providing an adequate supply of
             housing.
9.3      POPULATION, HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS, AND HOUSING NEEDS
The City of Colusa’s location along State Route (SR) 20 and 45 along the Sacramento River, its proximity to
the Sacramento metropolitan area, the relatively low cost of housing and land in Colusa County, and the
“small-town” feel of the community are primary reasons for a growing demand for housing within the City of
Colusa.     While many residents are employed in farm-supporting businesses that continue to service
agricultural production in the surrounding unincorporated lands, many residents also find Colusa to be an
ideal community to live in while commuting to jobs in larger and more urban employment centers such as
Yuba City and Sacramento. This section provides a data snapshot of population and housing trends that
allow an assessment of the housing needs unique to the City of Colusa.
POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS AND HISTORIC TRENDS
Historic Population Growth
According to the Department of Finance, population of the City of Colusa in January 2008 was estimated at
5,727 persons. As shown in Table 9.3-1, the annual growth rate between 1990 and 2008 averaged 0.84
percent per year with a high of 2.56 percent between 1996 and 1997 and a low of -1.84 percent between
1999 and 2000.
Table 9.3-2 provides a look at the City’s growth rate by decade since 1970. At 1.9 percent, the City
experienced its largest growth spurt between 1980 and 1990, largely as a result of government-assisted
housing projects in the southeast portion of the City. Then between 1990 and 2000, the population in
Colusa increased from 4,934 to 5,402; at a rate of 9.5 percent, this growth rate was less than that for the
state as a whole (13.8 percent) during the same period. Finally, between 2000 and 2008, the City added
approximately 325 residents, or ±6 percent, to its population. This compares to approximately 7.6 percent
for Colusa County, 44.7 percent for the City of Williams, 16.9 percent for City of Sacramento, and 12.33
percent for the State of California during the 2000-2008 period (see Table 9.3-3).

Projected Population Growth
To provide a current picture of immediate population growth trends, it is important to consider the 81-unit
Colusa Del Rey affordable housing project that was completed in 2008. With an average household size in
the City of 2.83 persons, the Colusa Del Rey project could add approximately 231 people, or 4 percent to
the City’s population in 2008. This assumes that the new residents will either come from other
communities, or will vacate units in Colusa that will, in turn, be occupied by new residents.
The affordable housing developer responsible for Colusa Del Rey is currently working with City staff on
preliminary plans to bring another similar housing project to the City. Implementation of a second project of
this type over the planning period is likely and could result in a similar increase in the City’s population, and
thereby reverse a slowing population growth trend that is otherwise likely to occur.
The recent credit and financial market turmoil has slowed or halted progress on three large housing
development projects in the last year—the proposed 434-unit (including 105 units affordable to very low-
income tenants) Colusa Riverbend (Phase I) located within the city limits; the 101-unit Tennant Estates
which was approved by the City in October 2005 but has not proceeded with final map and construction;
and the 600-unit Brookins Ranch, which proposed annexation into the City but has withdrawn its proposal.
Developers are reassessing market conditions and evaluating the profitability of constructing homes on
these sites (two within the City and one proposed for annexation). These three projects total more than
1,000 housing units, which could produce a population increase of up to 2,850 persons if the homes were
built.
Since Colusa’s growth has closely mirrored the addition of residential units, this market downturn is
anticipated to substantially slow population growth for the next several years or until the market recovers.
Therefore, while historic growth over the last decade has been relatively robust, assumptions made in this
Housing Element reflect this significant slowing in residential homebuilding. The City anticipates
substantially lower population growth rates for the elements five-year planning period than the 3-4 percent
average annual growth rate projected in the General Plan Land Use Element (adopted October 2007). The
growth rate assumption for the planning period of this Housing Element will be 0.95%, which is consistent
with State Department of Finance estimates.
General Household Characteristics
Census 2000 reported that, of the 1,919 households in Colusa, 1,356 (or 70.7 percent) are families, 734 (or
38.2 percent) have children under 18 living at home; 1,039 (or 54.1 percent) households are headed by
married couples. Of the married couples, 557 have children living at home.

Age
The most recent reliable age classification information for Colusa is provided by Census 2000. Although
the data was collected nearly ten years ago, it is considered representative of the age distribution within the
City’s population. Census 2000 indicates that Colusa had a median age of only 32 years, which compares
to 33.3 years for the state overall for the same period.
As indicated in Table 9.3-4, in 1999, the largest age cohort fell within the 0-19 year age bracket, which
constituted 33.6 percent of Colusa’s total population, while 20-24 years constituted the smallest at 6.8
percent. The 25-44 year-old age group was the second largest group, with 28.2 percent of the City’s total
population; while persons 45-64 years of age made up 20 percent of the population. Persons 65 and older
comprised 11.4 percent of the City’s population.
The 2007 American Community Survey indicates that the median age in the State increased to 34.7 years,
while the median age in Colusa County had decreased from 31.5 years in 2000 to 31.1 years in 2007.

Ethnicity
The City of Colusa is a community with a predominately Caucasian population, as indicated by Census
2000. Caucasians constitute approximately 68.7 percent of the total population within the City, which is
comparable to that of other rural communities in the region. Between 1990 and 2000, the U.S. Census
reported a decrease in the percentage of those identifying themselves as white; with an increase in those
identifying themselves as some other race or of mixed race (the 1990 Census did not include a multiple
race category).
Due to the manner in which the census was conducted, however, the City's Hispanic (or Latino) population
is included as Caucasian and the “some other race” category. When broken out separately, Hispanics
constitute approximately 41.7 percent of Colusa’s population. This percentage is a subset of the 68.7
percent Caucasian and 23.3 percent “some other race” designation. The percentage of the City’s
population identifying themselves as persons of Hispanic origin increased from 32.0 percent to 41.7 percent
between 1990 and 2000. Due to the City’s economic emphasis on agriculture and related services, the
Hispanic population within and around Colusa has continued to grow in recent years.
Other major ethnic groups have remained relatively stable as a percentage of the City's total population,
and reflect the State average for rural areas. Both the Black and Asian/Pacific Islander populations have
slightly declined as a percentage of the overall population within the City of Colusa between1990 and 2000.
The ethnic breakdown for the City in 1990 and 2000 is detailed in Table 9.3-5.

 Gender
 The City of Colusa is well-balanced in terms of gender distribution, with nearly 50 percent males and 50
 percent females and similar age distribution of the two sexes (Census, 2000). This trend reflects a
 negligible change in the male-to-female ratio in the City population due death and/or migration. A
 comparison of change by gender is shown in Table 9.3-6.

 Household Size
 A city’s households can increase or decrease even in periods of static population growth, as a result of
 adult children leaving home, divorce, economic conditions, and through birth and death within the general
 population.
 The average number of persons occupying each household is known as household size and is expressed
 in terms of the number of persons per household. Typically, the number of persons per household is
 slightly higher in owner-occupied households than in renter households.
 As shown in Table 9.3-7, between 1990 and 2000 the number of persons per household in the City
 increased slightly, but has remained stable. As shown in Table 9.3-7, the City’s average household
 population is lower than the State’s for owner-occupied households, and about the same for households

increasing household size over the 10-year period from 1990 to 2000.
The Department of Finance (DOF) provides estimated household size for 2008 for the City and the State.
DOF data indicates a continuing trend toward larger households, with households in the City of Colusa
expected to grow to 2.83 persons per household, while the projection is 2.94 persons per household for the
State overall (DOF, 2008).

INCOME, EDUCATION, AND EMPLOYMENT
Household Income
Historical Census data indicates that household incomes for Colusa have generally been slightly higher
compared to those for Colusa County, but lower than the State overall. According to the Census 2000, the
household median income for Colusa was $35,250, while the median household income for the County was
$35,062 and was $47,493 for the State overall. Approximately 22.7 percent of the City’s population lived
below the poverty level at the time of data collection.
1999 income ranges and the percentages and numbers of households falling within each income level are
shown below in Table 9.3-8. While income levels have likely changed significantly since 1999, this is the
most recent income data available for the City, and although inaccurate in actual figures, the data provides
a valid representation of income distribution within the City of Colusa.
Standard income groups have been established by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) and are based on the median income by county. In the case of Colusa County, the current median
income is based on income data from the Census 2000 and observed statewide income trends based on
data available from the Census Bureau’s 2006 American Community Survey. Income groups are defined as
follows:
              Extremely Low                         Households earning 30% or less of County median income
              Very Low                              Households earning 31% - 50% of County median income

Education
The education level of a city’s population can serve as an indicator of its educational and employment
opportunities, as well as the earning potential of its population. Data collected for the Census 2000
indicates nearly 70 percent of Colusa’s residents graduated from high school and that over 13 percent
possessed a Bachelor’s degree. The education level was slightly higher than Colusa County’s overall, as
shown in Table 9.3-9, below. Both City and County resident education levels are lower than that of the
state overall (76.8 percent graduated from high school and 26.6 percent held a bachelor’s degree or
higher).

Employment
Labor Force
Labor force is the sum of employment and unemployment, excluding people in the armed forces. Table
9.3-10 includes people working in the private and public sectors, people who are unemployed but actively
seeking work, and laid off workers who are waiting to be called back to work. Labor force population does
not include those in institutions such as prisons, mental hospitals, or nursing homes, or those less than 16
years of age.
Data from the California Employment Development Department (EDD) indicate that in September 2008 the
City of Colusa had a labor force of 3,370, of which 3,180 were employed. The labor force in the City of
Colusa has seen an approximately 16.2 percent increase between 2000 and 2008, nearly identical to the
16.0 percent increase in the labor force for the County overall during the same period.

Unemployment
According to EDD data, the unemployment rate in the City was 18.7 percent in February 2009. This was
higher than the statewide unemployment rate of 10.5 percent and lower than the 26.6 percent
unemployment rate for Colusa County for the same period. Other cities in the region have a higher
unemployment rate than the City of Colusa, with Williams at 36.4 percent and Arbuckle at 37.5 percent.
Historically the City has had a lower rate of unemployment than surrounding cities and the County overall,
which may reflect a higher population of agricultural workers living in neighboring cities and the
unincorporated county.

According to the California Employment Development Department (EDD), “civilian employment includes all
individuals who worked at least one hour for a wage or salary, or were self-employed, or were working at
least fifteen unpaid hours in a family business or on a family farm.” As indicated by Table 9.3-11, the City of
Colusa has seen an 11.5 percent increase in total employment between 2000 and 2007 compared to a 13.4
percent increase in employment in the County overall for the same period.
Employment by Industry
Employment by industry is a measure of economic diversity. Having a diverse economy is important for a
community to maintain economic stability. Concentration of jobs in a single industry indicates that a local
economy is exposed to the boom and bust cycles within the overly concentrated sector and indicates a
fragile local economy. A healthy economy typically has a relatively high degree of industry sector
diversification. Census 2000 data for employment by industry in the City is provided in Table 9.3-12 below.
More recent data for employment by industry is not available. However, it is expected that the data
provided reflects the general distribution of employment within the City today.

Agriculture, Forestry, and Mining, which employed 18.0 percent of the working population, and Educational,
Health, and Social Services, which accounted for 15.3 percent of the city’s jobs, were the largest
employment sectors in Colusa in 1999. Information constituted the least populated employment sector at
only 0.3 percent of total employment. Other major employment sectors in the city are Retail Trade (12.5
percent of total employment); Public Administration (7.8 percent of total employment); Arts, Entertainment,
Recreation, Accommodations, and Food Services (7.7 percent of total employment); and professional,
scientific, management, administrative, and Waste Management Services (7.5 percent of total
employment).
The City of Colusa serves as the county seat of Colusa County. It is therefore anticipated that the City will
see further growth in employment in the Public Administration sector as both the city and the County add
population resulting in an increased need for governmental services. Further growth is also anticipated in
the educational and health services sectors, as increased population in the City will increase the demand
for education and health care professionals as well.
Major Employers
Table 9.3-13 shows the major employers in the City of Colusa. While many residents work locally, some
commute to other cities in Colusa County, the Yuba City area, and the Yolo-Sacramento area for work. The
list of major employers is derived from the Employment Development Department’s Labor Market
Information, as well as information included in the Land Use Element of the Colusa General Plan.

Jobs-Housing Balance
Government Code §65890.1 states that, “State land use patterns should be encouraged that balance the
location of employment-generating uses with residential uses so that employment-related commuting is
minimized.” This type of balance is normally measured by a jobs-to-housing ratio, which must take into
account the location, intensity, nature, and relationship of jobs and housing; housing demand; housing
costs; and transportation systems. According to the state General Plan Guidelines, a jobs-to-housing ratio
of 1.5:1 is considered “balanced.”
City of Colusa                                                                                            Housing Element

According to 2008 DOF and EDD data, there were 3,150 jobs available in the City of Colusa for 2,000
occupied housing units (DOF, 2008, EDD 2008). This equates to a jobs-to-housing ration of 1.56 jobs for
each housing unit, indicating a balanced jobs to housing relationship.
Although the job-to-housing ratio is balanced for the city, employment data indicates that many of the jobs
are in agriculture, which is a typically low-paying employment sector. As such many of the jobs available in
the local economy would not pay adequately to support rental or home-ownership within the city. The result
is that many city residents commute out of the city for better paying jobs. This is reflected in commute time
data collected for the 2000 Census, which indicates that the mean travel time to work for those living in the
City of Colusa was 17.8 minutes in 1999 (Census 2000). Census 2000 data indicate that more than 46
percent of the city’s work force commuted more than 15 minutes to work. This suggests that many
individuals commute into the Yuba City area for employment, choosing to have their place of residence in
Colusa.
Economic Trends
Colusa has three highway ingresses, all of which funnel traffic through the downtown. The highway layouts,
combined with the historic small town commercial sites, provide a distinct advantage to the City’s
opportunity for economic development. Colusa’s retail sector is the predominant influence on its economy,
as well as the major generator of tax revenues to the City.
In the past 20 years, Colusa has experienced fluctuations in its total taxable sales, with the highest average
annual increase of 26.4 percent between 1983 and 1984 and, more recently, an 18.4 percent increase
between 1998 and 1999. Although these increases in taxable sales are encouraging, the City saw average
annual decreases of between 9.2 and 14.7 percent in the consecutive years of 1990 to 1991 and 1991 to
1992. Data from the California State Board of Equalization suggests that between 1996 and 2001 (the
most complete recent data set), the City experienced an average annual increase of 8.1 percent in total
taxable sales. The increased taxable sales represent growth in the economic base in Colusa, as well as
increased commercial growth.
As with many cities in the State of California, the City of Colusa currently faces serious economic
challenges related primarily to the recent turmoil in the financial markets and the precipitous drop in
residential property values. The recent market conditions have resulted in a reduced interest in
development in the city and, consequently, fewer employment opportunities for local residents. While it is
not likely the City can create jobs for every Colusa resident, it can take steps in this General Plan to
address employment by creating more job opportunities through General Plan land use policies, economic
strategies, and programs that will enable Colusa’s local economy to improve.
The City is currently working to establish a Redevelopment Agency and identify a redevelopment area in an
effort to revitalize the downtown area. The updated General Plan includes land use designations to
encourage residential and commercial mixed-use development and conversion of existing commercial
buildings to mixed uses to bring more people into the downtown area and create a better climate for local
downtown businesses. This effort could lead to employment growth in the retail, restaurant and real-estate
management sectors.
                                            th
A recent renovation of a building along 5 Street to create more office/professional building space points to
continued interest in locating government offices and government-serving professional services in close
proximity to County government offices. Additional population growth in Colusa County will require growth
in the ranks of County employees to provide services to the growing population. This expansion of
workforce and additional office space indicates a trend toward increased professional and clerical
employment opportunities in the city.
 The 137.5-acre Colusa Industrial Park (CIP) is located outside the City limits, but within the SOI.
Businesses located within CIP already provide many jobs to city residents, primarily in agriculture-serving
industries, business, medical, and government. Additional development within CIP is proposed and includes

the potential for a hotel, restaurant, and other highway commercial services in addition to residential
development. Current tenants within the CIP complex range from county government and business offices
to medical and dental facilities. Further development within CIP and future annexation of this area could
result in the addition of substantial employment in diverse industries.CIP has submitted a development
proposal to rezone an additional 575 acres for industrial uses, which is currently being processed by the
County of Colusa.
Over the 20-year planning period, job growth in the Planning Area is anticipated to increase by an
estimated 3,000 to 8,300 new jobs (based on additional square feet that will be available for a variety of
non-residential uses). Coupled with the square-footage that could be constructed under buildout of the
1994 General Plan, which could generate up to 2,900 jobs, at build-out, the non-residential land uses
identified in this plan could generate between approximately 5,900 and 11,200 new jobs. Based on a 1.3
percent average annual job growth rate from 2000 to 2007, Colusa will likely see the creation of nearly 200
jobs over the life of this Housing Element.
HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
Vacancy Rate
The residential vacancy rate is a good indicator of the balance between housing supply and demand in a
community, and constitutes one measure of the health of a community’s housing market. HUD has
determined that five percent is a healthy rate for rental units and considers two percent for ownership units
an acceptable rate. If vacant units are distributed across a variety of housing types, sizes, price ranges, and
locations throughout the City, there should be an adequate selection for all income levels.
When the demand for housing exceeds the available supply, the vacancy rate will be low. However, a low
vacancy rate sometimes drives the cost of housing upward and increases tolerance for substandard units.
According to Census 2000, there were a total of 2,016 housing units as compared with 1,903 in 1990.
Table 9.3-14 shows the City’s overall vacancy rate in 1999 was near six percent, a desirable range. By
comparison, Colusa County had an overall housing vacancy rate in 2000 of 10 percent, which is considered
high.
Department of Finance 2007 estimates indicate that vacancy rates for both the City and County have
declined slightly since 2000, but do not indicate any significant changes. Due to the small population of the
City and Colusa County, the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey does not include recent data
for vacancy rates for the area.

Housing Tenure
Although 2008 housing tenure data is not available for the City, there is no evidence showing that a
substantial change in household tenure has occurred in the City since Census 2000. These data indicate
that 62 percent of the households in the City were owner-occupied, while 38 percent of the households
were occupied by renter households. Table 9.3-15 below provides a breakdown of households by tenure
for 1990 and 2000 and Table 9.3-16 provides a countywide comparison.
The percentage of renter-occupied units decreased approximately 1.0 percent between 1990 and 2000. In
2000, the percentage of renter households in Colusa was nearly the same as the City of Williams, 37.9 and
38.1 percent, respectively; and it was slightly more than one percent higher than the 36.8 percent renter
household rate in Colusa County.
A greater increase occurred in the number of owner-occupied housing units in the City of Colusa. From
1990 to 2000, there was an increase of over 100 owner-occupied units, an approximately 2.0 percent
increase in the total occupied housing units in the City over this period. Similarly, Colusa’s and Williams’
owner-occupied rates were very similar in 2000, at 62.1 and 61.9, respectively, while homeownership in
Colusa County was slightly more than one percent higher than in the City of Colusa.

This trend toward owner-occupied housing has likely continued through 2008, based on higher home-
ownership rates throughout the nation, reflected in Census data (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008b). Recently,
the rate of home ownership in California has been adversely affected by a high number of foreclosures due
to current economic conditions. Since no large scale subdivisions were built in the City during the last
several years, Colusa has largely avoided the effects of wide-range foreclosures.

Housing Type
Table 9.3-17 outlines the housing characteristics for the City of Colusa and their percentage represented by
each category, based on Department of Finance 2008 estimates. A review of the housing characteristics
shows that single-family units comprise 79.7 percent of the housing stock in the City, or 81.7 percent of the
housing stock when including mobile homes. Approximately 8.6 percent of the City’s housing units are in
multifamily housing developments containing five or more residential units on one property. Units within
duplexes, triplexes, and four-plexes constitute 9.3 percent of the City’s housing stock.

Housing Costs
For-Purchase Housing
A survey of single-family residential properties sold since January 2008 in the City of Colusa shows that
single-family homes 900 square-feet or greater in size have sold for between $70,000 and $320,000 (see
Table 9.3-19). Data for single-family home sales since January 2008 indicate a median sales price of
$195,000 (average $132 per square foot). A median home sales price of $195,000 represents a 72 percent
increase since 2000.
Although these recent home sales prices in the City and the trends in neighboring Sutter County indicate
that housing values in the City have increased dramatically from 1990-2008, home values remain below
those of the greater Sacramento region, which in August of 2008 had a median value of $220,890
(California Association of Realtors, 2008).
Current economic conditions with tightening credit markets and more conservative lending practices have
further accelerated the drop in home values from the higher values observed in 2005. Real estate listings
show that home prices throughout California continued to decrease throughout 2008. Recent data from
August 2008 indicate that median home prices in the Sacramento region have fallen to $220,890 from a
median price of $332,510 in August 2007, representing a 34 percent decline (California Association of
Realtors, 2008). This downward trend is similarly reflected in Colusa’s residential real estate market
(Reische, Pers. Comm. 2008).
Rental Housing

Overpayment
In its 2007 report California’s Deepening Housing Crisis, HCD indicates that, statewide, 35 percent of
California homeowner households and 40 percent of renters overpay for housing. According to current
public standards, overpayment occurs when a household spends more than 30 percent of gross household
income on housing expenses (rent, taxes insurance). Of those households that overpay, many are low-
income, although housing affordability in many areas is also affecting moderate-income households. As the
current historic high foreclosure rates indicate, substantial overpayment is not a sustainable condition for
housing.
Overpayment is a significant problem for lower-income, renter households as the proportion of their income
going toward housing costs leaves less for other basic necessities. Housing overpayment can also have
adverse affects on the local economy, since money going toward living expenses could otherwise support
local businesses. While some higher-income households may choose to spend greater portions of their
income for housing, the cost burden for low-income households, especially large households, reflects
choices limited by a lack of adequate affordable housing supply.
According to the most recent data available for the City from the 2000 Census, 28.9 percent of all
households in the City of Colusa spent more than 30 percent of their gross income for housing.
Approximately 34.4 percent of all renter-occupied households and 23.1 percent of all owner-occupied
households in the City were overpaying at the time data was collected for the 2000 Census (see Table 9.3-
20).
Based on Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data from 2000, overpayment for housing
in the City disproportionately affects large families and the elderly. CHAS data indicates that 9.7 percent of
all households in the City were paying more than 50 percent of their household income in housing costs
(CHAS, 2000).

Census 2000 showed that overpayment was most pronounced among renter households earning less than
$19,999, which would correspond generally with those households with incomes in the extremely low- to
the middle range of very low-income households (those earning less than $26,900 annually). Almost 76
percent of the 144 households in the City with incomes less than $10,000 a year were paying more than 30
percent of their income for shelter. In the $10,000 to $20,000 range, over 47 percent of these households
were paying 30 percent or more. Approximately 22.4 percent (427) of all households that earned $35,000 or
less were overpaying for housing at that time.

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND BLIGHT
Housing Age
The housing stock in Colusa is considered relatively old, with many historical homes in evidence. As shown
in Table 9.3-21 above, there are up to 1,548 housing units in the City that are over 30 years old, which
represented 76.4 percent of the City’s entire housing stock in 1999. Of that, 450 dwelling units (22.2
percent of total units), were constructed in 1939 or earlier—more than 69 years old.

Housing Conditions
With funding assistance through HCD’s Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, the City of
Colusa contracted with Mercy Housing California (MHC) in 2002 to conduct a “windshield” housing survey
to assess housing conditions in Colusa. The data taken from that survey are used in this section to
evaluate the need for rehabilitation of Colusa’s housing stock. The City’s 2008 Feasibility Study – The Use
of Redevelopment as a Tool in the City of Colusa, prepared by Rosenow Spevacek Group, Inc., more
recently substantiated the findings of the Housing Conditions Survey.
The condition of each unit was evaluated based upon HCD’s adopted criteria, which rate the condition of
the following five exterior components: 1) foundation, 2) roofing, 3) siding, 4) windows and 5) electrical.
Units were evaluated from the outside only. While the survey could not determine whether plumbing
needed to be replaced or if the electrical system was unsafe, the status of items evaluated does suggest
the condition of the overall structure (e.g., a wood frame structure without a foundation will likely have an
old electrical system). Mercy Housing’s complete Exterior Housing Condition Survey and Analysis (April
2003), including the methodology, data and analysis, is available for review upon request at City Hall.
MHC evaluated and recorded a total of 1,230 housing units in the City of Colusa. Multifamily housing
structures represent four percent of the total housing stock. Each apartment building was counted as one
whole unit in the calculation regardless of the number of units in each apartment structure. (Note: The
survey appears to have not reviewed or counted mobile homes within the City.)
Nearly 60 percent of the homes surveyed need some type of repair. However, 78 percent of these units
need only minor repairs. Table 9.3-22 shows that 41 percent of the housing units were found to be in
standard condition, while 59 percent (725 housing units) of the units were in substandard condition and in
need of rehabilitation. The housing condition survey identified six (6) dilapidated housing units.
A recent survey conducted by City staff of homes requiring substantial repair indicates that there are
currently six (6) homes in abandoned or seriously dilapidated and unlivable condition in the City. During
2007 and 2008 these homes were the subject of nuisance abatement letters issues by the City Building
Department to the property owners. Programs that address rehabilitation and replacement are discussed in
greater detail in Section 9.6 Housing Resources and Opportunities.

                   that the Mercy Housing survey counted multi-unit apartment complexes as one total unit
                   and did not rate each unit in the structure. At the time of this update the data from the
                   Mercy Housing survey were inconsistent with all other data sources used in this
                   document. These numbers should be considered only as a general representation of
                   housing conditions in the City.

As indicated above, 49.9 percent of the total housing units in the city of Colusa were constructed prior to
1960, with 450 houses, or 22.2 percent of the housing stock in 1999, constructed in 1939 or earlier. Only
484 (24.0 percent of the 1999 housing stock) homes were built after 1980. This indicates that many homes
in the community could have age-related deficiencies and be in need of repair.
Multifamily housing structures constitute only 3.5 percent of the total housing stock in the City. Seventy-two
(72) percent of these multifamily units were rated as substandard.
All but 0.5 percent of the housing stock was judged suitable by Mercy Housing for rehabilitation, with
needed repairs ranging from minor maintenance to substantial rehabilitation. Of the 59 percent in need of
moderate to major repairs, 146 units (11.9 percent of 1999 housing stock) were in need of moderate repair
and 6 units (1.9 percent of 1999 housing stock) were in need of major repair, and 6 were rated as
dilapidated.
With the advent of the current nationwide mortgage crisis, many homeowners are experiencing housing
foreclosures, including Colusa. This could substantially increase the rate of deterioration for homes in
Colusa. However, due to the relatively small numbers in the city, any increase could substantially change
percentages and not accurately reflect an actual trend.
HOUSING NEEDS
Special Housing Needs
Within the overall housing need estimates are segments of the population which require special
consideration. These are generally made up of people who face special life challenges and are within low-
income groups and therefore have limited housing choices. For the City of Colusa, these groups include
seniors, the disabled, large households, female-headed households, farm workers, and the homeless.

Seniors
Because seniors tend to live on fixed incomes dictated by Social Security and other retirement benefits,
those who do not own their homes are significantly affected by rising housing rental costs. Also, while some
seniors may prefer to live in single-family detached homes, others may desire smaller, more affordable
homes with less upkeep, such as condominiums, townhouses, apartments, or mobile homes. As of 2000,
nearly 75 percent of the City’s housing stock was made up of single-family detached homes, leaving 25
percent of the housing stock for those who choose to or must live in other forms of housing.
The 2000 Census identified a total of 618 persons living in 439 households, over the age of 65 in the City of
Colusa (Table 9.3-23). This represents 11.4 percent of the total population and 21.7 percent of all
households in the City. It should be noted that The City has recognized that the elderly have special access
and affordability limitations and has set forth specific programs and policies in Section 9.7 of this document
that address issues unique to elderly households.
The Eskaton Senior Housing Development on East Carson Street provides 30 units of housing affordable to
low-income senior citizens. The rents for these units are based on tenant income. In addition, two Rural
Housing Service apartment projects in the City, Colusa Greens and Colusa Gardens, have 18 rental-
assisted units for very low-income senior citizens.

The Colusa Senior Center provides the foundation for many of the resources, programs, and other
organizations and support groups available to seniors in the City and Colusa County overall. The resources
available to seniors in the City assist seniors in meeting the challenges associated with the increasing cost
of living, the limited availability of affordable housing for seniors, and limited access to affordable in-home
and visitation care. Programs also assist seniors in meeting the challenges of limited mobility by providing
transportation on a limited basis. Section 9.7 of this element provides goals, policies, and implementing
actions to help facilitate the construction of additional senior housing in the community.
Persons with Disabilities
Housing needs of disabled persons vary depending on the nature and severity of the disability. Physically
disabled persons generally require modifications to the housing units such as wheelchair ramps, elevators
or lifts, wide doorways, accessible cabinetry, modified fixtures and appliances. If the disability prevents the
person from operating a vehicle, then access to services and public transportation are also important.
People with severe physical or mental disabilities may also require supportive housing, nursing facilities, or
care facilities. Because disabilities vary, this group does not congregate toward a single service
organization, making it difficult to estimate the number of individuals and their specific needs.
Census 2000 found that 20.5 percent of Colusa’s population, or 1,110 persons, were living with a disability,
compared to 17.7 percent, or 3,343 in Colusa County. A breakdown of age groups with disabilities in the
City of Colusa and Colusa County is shown in Table 9.3-24 below.

Severe physical or mental disability often prevents individuals from working, limits their opportunities for job
advancement, and thereby limits their income, which results in the cost of housing being a greater concern.
Many of the disabled rely solely on Social Security Income, which would typically place them within
extremely low- to very low-income categories with market-rate housing unaffordable to these households.
As demonstrated in Table 9.3-25, below, a majority of disabled persons are not employed or are of
retirement age. It should also be pointed out that many of those who are employed are low wage earners.
Therefore, the disabled and the elderly represent a large proportion of those in need of affordable housing.

Table 9.3-26 breaks down the disabled population by disability types. They are broad categories and
represent disabilities suffered by only 22.62 percent of the disabled population. Several of the disabilities
listed would indicate severely restricted physical mobility.

New multi-family housing is subject to state and federal design requirements for disabled accessibility and
is required to provide some units specifically designed to be accessible by those with disabilities. The two
existing apartment projects each have units accessible to those with disabilities (a total of five units). The
newly constructed (2008) Colusa Del Rey affordable housing development contains 81 units overall and
includes 40 ground-floor units that are accessible to those with disabilities and have been built to allow the
interior to be easily adapted to serve the living needs of those with disabilities.
Senate Bill 520 (SB 520) prohibits any local governmental agency from enacting ordinances that prohibit or
discriminate against any residential development or emergency shelter because of the method of financing
or the race, sex, color, religion, ethnicity, national origin, ancestry, lawful occupation, familial status,
disability, or age of owners or intended occupants of the residential development of the emergency shelter.

accessible housing. By providing programs that facilitate supportive multifamily or single-family housing for
the disabled in any residential zone, the City of Colusa will be in compliance with SB 520.
Large Households
The Census Bureau defines large households as those containing five or more persons. Housing issues
commonly faced by large households include overcrowding and affordability. City programs to address the
issue of large households and overcrowding are discussed in the programs section of this Housing
Element.
According to the 2000 Census data, 281 households, or 14.7 percent of the total number of occupied
households in the City of Colusa in 2000 contained five or more persons. By comparison, and as shown in
Table 9.3-27, large households made up 18.5 percent of all households in Colusa County overall in 2000.
The percentage of households with 5 or more persons has grown significantly as a percentage of the total
number of households in both the County and the City since the 1990 Census. Based on data available for
the State of California, it is assumed that this trend toward a higher percentage of large households has
continued since the 2000 Census and that the proportion of large households in the City is even greater
today.

Female Heads of Household
Of the 1,907 occupied households surveyed in the City of Colusa for the 2000 U.S. Census, 495 (26.0
percent) were headed by females. Of that total, 65 households, or approximately 3.4 percent of all
households in the city, were headed by females aged 65 years or older. Table 9.3-28 provides a summary
of this information.
The 2007 American Community Survey indicates that female-headed households make up approximately
12.8 percent of all households in the State, which is down from 16.2 percent indicated by 2000 Census
data, and would indicate a downward trend in female-headed households for the state overall. This data
shows that the City of Colusa has a substantially higher percentage of female-headed households than the
state overall, indicating the need for programs that focus on meeting the housing needs of this special
needs group.

Section 9.7 of this element address the childcare needs of single female-headed households by providing
implementing actions and programs that can facilitate the construction of rental units that include daycare
facilities and are affordable to low- and very low-income single, female heads of household. Additionally,
the City’s Zoning Ordinance provides no particular constraints to opening small day care centers within the
City, which helps to ensure that adequate day care choices are available and reasonably priced. The City
has encouraged and facilitated construction of affordable housing during 2007 and 2008, adding 81 units to
the housing stock, and continues to foster a relationship with firms specializing in the construction of
affordable housing in hopes of obtaining more high-quality affordable housing projects in the City.
Farmworkers
The agricultural area around the City of Colusa creates a demand for both permanent agriculture workers
and seasonal farm workers. The State of California defines seasonal farm laborers as those who are
employed fewer than 150 consecutive days by the same employer. The State differentiates between local
and migrant seasonal farm laborers in terms of their residence—whether they reside close enough to the
job sites so that they can return to their permanent homes each night. Farms with a year-round operation
have historically provided on-site housing for their employees. The peak-growing season in Colusa is May
through October and many of the migrant workers live in the various migrant worker camps in Colusa
County.
The 2002 Census of Agriculture reported that there were 2,233 seasonal (worked less than 150 days a
year) and 1,451 permanent (worked over 150 days a year) workers employed on farms in Colusa County.
Table 9.3-29 provides the number of seasonal and permanent farm workers employed in the County as
reported by the 1992, 1997, and 2002 Census of Agriculture (Note: 2007 Census of Agriculture data are not
yet available). The numbers reflect a trend of lower numbers of permanent farm workers from 1992 to 1997
and overall farm workers from 1997 to 2002 in the County, which could reflect decreased production or
higher productivity per worker due to more efficient means of farm production.

Farm Worker Housing Needs The housing needs of permanent farm workers are no different from those of
other employment groups and consist of housing that is affordable in relation to income, meets acceptable
housing standards, and is reasonably accessible to the site of employment. Seasonal or part-time farm

workers who do not leave the area and have to seek year-round residency in the area have similar needs;
but their income is likely to be considerably less than year-round employees, and these individuals may
require subsidized housing or employer-based housing. Seasonal migrant workers typically have even less
income available for housing because of their need to minimize expenses to meet off-season needs. As a
result, migrant farm workers may seek housing in a labor camp or may rent an available and inexpensive
unit (which may be shared among several workers). If such housing is not available, migrant farm workers
may resort to substandard shelters—ranging from vehicles to tents or other forms of temporary shelter.
Because migrant farm workers desire to reside near the work sites, most farm worker housing should be
provided in these unincorporated areas; farm workers with reliable transportation could reside within the
City limits.
Farm Worker Housing In Colusa According to the Colusa County Planning Department there are four
privately operated farm labor camps in the County. The largest of these camps is located in the City of
Williams and consist of 100 units. The Colusa County Agricultural Commissioner stated that there are
plans to expand this facility by 10 more units for migrant workers and 50 more units for permanent farm
workers in the near future. Additionally, there is State and Federal operated camps in the surrounding
communities of Williams, Maxwell, Gridley, and Yuba City. These facilities are generally seasonal units,
operating from May until the end of October. It should be noted that, in the case of the migrant farm labor
camps, the persons seeking residence must supply verification that they do in fact permanently reside in
excess of 15 miles from the labor site.
The City of Colusa provides for the construction of farm worker housing through its Zoning Ordinance and
Building Codes in the same way that affordable, single-family or multifamily housing is provided, since the
needs of farm workers are substantially the same as for other low-income households. This would include
permanent housing for farm workers and their families.
Homeless and Other Persons in Need of Emergency Shelter
Homeless individuals in Colusa County include, but are not limited to: victims of domestic violence, persons
with mental illness, persons suffering from addiction, those with inadequate incomes, families with single
heads-of-household, and unaccompanied minors. Homeless also include individuals who have purchased
parcels of land, but are unable to afford site improvements or a home (and are often found living year-round
in tents, small trailers, or other permanent camp-type arrangements). The homeless do not include
individuals imprisoned or otherwise detained pursuant to an Act of Congress or a State law (U.S. Code
Section 11302).
For the purposes of the housing needs analysis, a person is considered homeless who lacks a fixed,
regular and adequate nighttime residence; and an individual who has a primary nighttime residence that is:
    A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living
     accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, and transitional housing;
    An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized; or
    A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for
     people.
The City of Colusa does not have a homeless problem in the sense of people living “on the streets.”
Periodically, there are a few individuals who are homeless in the City of Colusa who call this City the
location of their last permanent residence.
The County Department of Health and Human Services reports a significant reduction in funds to address
this problem while experiencing a recent increase in the numbers requesting services. Although the
homeless population is not considered an immediate problem in Colusa, the City’s zoning ordinance allows
for transitional housing or homeless shelters to be established in residential zones to facilitate the needs of
persons or families lacking shelter.

The Colusa County Department of Health and Human Services provides assistance for eligible persons
who are in need of emergency shelter. The Department receives funds as a delegate agency of the Glenn
County Human Resources Agency’s Community Action Division, with the latter contracting with the
California State Department of Housing and Community Development on behalf of Glenn, Colusa, and
Trinity Counties.
As a member of the Colusa-Glenn-Trinity Community Action Agency, the Colusa County Department of
Health and Human Services is able to provide homeless assistance through several funding sources,
including eviction assistance and motel vouchers through the Emergency Housing and Assistance Program
(EHAP) and First Month’s Rent Assistance and Motel Vouchers through the Federal Emergency Shelter
Grant (FESG) program. A homeless individual’s eligibility for these resources includes an income under the
Federal Poverty Level, Colusa County residence for at least 14 days, and either being homeless or at
imminent risk of being homeless. Motel voucher assistance is limited to 30 days in any 24-month period.
To be eligible for Rental Assistance or Eviction Assistance, individuals must establish that they have
sufficient resources to maintain rent payments.
Because Colusa County does not have an emergency shelter, emergency housing needs are met through
the motel voucher program. Beginning in 2008, however, Colusa County established two transitional
houses, one of which is in the City of Colusa and one of which is in the unincorporated area of Colusa.
These are considered “scattered sites,” which means they are residential houses located in residential
neighborhoods, not a transitional living “facility.” Funding for these is through HUD’s Supportive Housing
Program (SHP). Colusa County, Glenn County, and Tehama County each have scatter sites, and SHP
funding flows through Tehama County’s Poor and The Homeless program, or “PATH.” Individuals residing
in transitional housing must participate in services, such as job counseling or behavioral health services.
Residence in a transitional housing unit is limited to 18 months.
In 2007, the Colusa County Board of Supervisors entered into a Standard Agreement with the State of
California’s Department of Housing and Community Development for a $1,000,000 loan to proceed with a
19-bed transitional housing facility, Colusa Independence. The loan requires no payments and will revert to
a grant after Colusa Independence has been in successful operation for ten years. Colusa Independence
will be located on a county-owned parcel which is located within City of Colusa limits. As with the scattered
site program, residents must participate in services; residence is limited to 18 months. The City of Colusa is
participating financially with the County on this project.
Overcrowded Households
According to the 2000 Census, 12.6 percent of all occupied households in the City of Colusa are classified
as overcrowded. The Bureau of Census defines overcrowding as households with more than 1.01 persons
per room (excluding bathrooms and kitchens), and those with more than 1.5 persons per room as severely
overcrowded. Overcrowding increases health and safety concerns and stresses the condition of the
housing stock and infrastructure. Between 1980 and 1990, the percentage of overcrowded households in
California nearly doubled from 6.9 percent to 12.3 percent. Census 2000 reports more than 15 percent of
California households were overcrowded with overcrowding most common among low-income households,
and most prevalent in renter housing. Roughly 24 percent of renter households statewide were
overcrowded based on 2000 Census data; in some counties, nearly a third of renter households were
overcrowded. American Community Survey 2007 data indicates a substantial decrease in overcrowding for
the State overall, to approximately 7.7 percent of all occupied housing units.
Census 2000 data indicate that 141 of the 1,184 (11.9 percent) homeowner households n the City were
overcrowded and 99 of the 723 (13.7 percent) renter households in the City were overcrowded. These
percentages are considerably lower than those for occupied households in Colusa County overall, which
had a 17.6 percent overcrowded rate for all occupied units in 2000. As shown in Table 9.3-30, 544 of the
3,889 (14.0 percent) homeowner households in the City were overcrowded and 547 of the 2,280 (24.0
percent) renter households in the City were considered overcrowded, based on 2000 Census data.
City of Colusa                                                                             Housing Element

As demonstrated by the data, the number of overcrowded owner-occupied housing units in the City more
than doubled and the percentage of these units that is overcrowded rose from 6.1 percent in 1990 to 11.9
percent in 2000. However, from 1990 to 2000 the number of overcrowded rental-occupied units decreased,
going from 15.2 percent of these units in 1990 to 13.7 percent of the units in 2000, which represents 10
fewer overcrowded renter-occupied units in the City.
It is unknown precisely what factors have influenced this change in overcrowded rental units in the City over
this ten year time period. As noted above, the rate of overcrowding for the state overall has declined since
2000. It is reasonable to assume that some of this recent reduction in overcrowding in the State is reflected
in current overcrowding conditions within the City of Colusa, although more recent data for the City is
unavailable to verify this assumption. It is presently unknown if the trend toward fewer overcrowded rental
units will continue. Current challenges facing the economy and rising unemployment would likely result in a
return to larger household sizes and more overcrowding, although recent data is not available to confirm
that this shift is occurring.

AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING
Housing Affordability
Housing affordability, for the purpose of housing element analysis, is a function of two primary factors:
      1. The proportion of total income a household is able to reasonably be expected to expend on housing
          costs and still meet other essential needs (e. g., the “overpayment” threshold); and
      2. The cost of available housing, in the form of mortgage payments and taxes for owner occupants or
          monthly rent.
Since the determination of housing need often is discussed in terms of household income categories, it is
important to define the categories used in this Housing element at the outset. HUD has established
household income categories—very low, low, moderate, and above moderate—based on a household’s
earnings relative to the County’s median household income as defined below:
              Very-low income                           50% of median County income or below
              Low income                                51–80% of median County income

August 2009

             Moderate income                         81–120% of median County income
             Above-moderate income                   More than 120% of median County income
         Note: Although not included among the income categories as part of the RHNA Plan, the Housing Element
         addresses the needs of “extremely low” income households (those earning 30% or less of the County median
         income) in other sections of this element.
For over a decade, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has used the 30%-of-
gross-income figure to determine the affordable rent or housing cost for Section 8 and other direct
assistance programs for very low-income households. The 30% figure also is thought to be the most
reasonable figure for the low-income group (up to 80% of median income) that rents, rather than owns, their
homes. In recent years, the Legislature has indicated some recognition that a higher percentage is realistic
for at least the moderate-income group, as well as those households in the low-income group that can
manage to qualify for home ownership.
Affordability, as defined in Section 50052.5 of the State Health and Safety Code allows a higher-than-30%
level—generally set at 35%—for owner-occupied housing, in recognition of the willingness of homeowners
to sacrifice other disposable income for the benefits of home ownership. This criterion applies only to the
upper third of the low-income households that earn 70% or more of the median income and to owner-
occupants.
This analysis considers the affordability level for all very low-income and low-income households as 30% of
gross income. The affordability level for moderate- and above-moderate income households was assumed
to be 35% of gross income.
The determination of housing affordability within each defined income category is based on a household’s
annual income and the number of persons in that household. Table 9.3-31 provides the annual income
limits for each income category for households of various sizes. Affordability of housing for each income
category is typically based on income limits for a four-person household. (Note: These income levels have
been established by the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) as limits for
qualification for certain state programs and do not reflect household incomes within the City of Colusa.)

Table 9.3-19 provides typical costs for rental and for-purchase housing in the City of Colusa, based on data
collected from local real estate professionals. The data indicate a median sales price of $195,000. Based
on a median sales price of $195,000 a household with a 10 percent down payment would pay a monthly
mortgage of about $1,300, and would therefore need to have annual income of around $52,000, based on a
30 percent front-end or loan-to-income ratio and a conventional 30-year mortgage taken out at a 6.25
percent interest rate, with 1.25% property tax and 0.5% mortgage insurance. This income requirement
would make housing affordable to households in the Moderate Income category. This calculation does not

take into account property taxes or Homeowner’s Association fees and assumes that the household could
provide a 10 percent down payment and does not have a large outstanding consumer debt (i.e. credit
cards, revolving loans, or car loans).
It should be noted that home prices throughout California have continued to decrease throughout 2008 and
into 2009, increasing affordability for home purchasers. This downward trend is evident in Colusa’s
residential real estate market (L. Reische, Pers. Comm. 2008). Further discussion of housing price trends
is provided in the Housing Characteristics section of this Housing Element.
Renters
Based on the monthly rental rates given in Table 9.3-19 and the HUD affordability standard of rent plus
utilities being equal to 30 percent of gross income, a household would need to earn approximately $30,500
a year to afford a mid-range three-bedroom apartment. This translates into an hourly wage of $14.66 per
hour, assuming 2,080 hours per year are worked. This would put market rate rentals within the affordability
range of some households within the Low income level group, but out of the affordability range of
households within the Very Low and Extremely Low income level groups.
Although Census Bureau data does not provide 2007 rental rates for the City of Colusa, HUD Fair Market
Rent values for Colusa County indicate rates comparable to those identified in Table 9.3-19 for the City.
HUD 2008 Fair Market Rents for Colusa County are given in Table 9.3-34 below for different unit sizes.
Based on HUD data, a 2-bedroom rental unit is affordable to households earning $31,160 a year or $14.98
hourly. For comparison, the City of Sacramento’s median gross monthly rent for 2007 was $923 and would
be affordable to households earning $36,920 a year (American Community Survey, 2007).

New Construction – Market Rate Affordability
For Purchase Housing Current home prices and real estate market trends are discussed under the
Housing Costs and Housing Affordability sections of this Housing Element and shown in Table 9.3-19. No
large-scale residential development has occurred in the City on which an analysis of new construction
affordability could be based. Additionally, the current rapid and continued decline in housing values in the
region and the State overall are an obstacle to obtaining an accurate representation of new construction
residential affordability. The most current residential subdivision to have homes constructed was a four lot
subdivision on 5th Street. Two homes have been constructed and one remains for sale in the $340,000
range. This home is 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and is 1,900 square feet in size. This price would be
affordable to households in the Above Moderate income category. However, it is noted that the home has
been on the market since August 2008 at this asking price. It is difficult to make broad assumptions from
these data, however, since there are a very small number of homes on the market.
Multi-family Construction One large multifamily development project has been constructed in Colusa
since 2000. The Colusa Del Rey affordable housing apartment project was finished during 2008 and
includes 81 units offered at rents affordable to Very Low to Low income households. This multi-family

housing project consists of 40 two-bedroom units, 33 three-bedroom units, 8 four-bedroom units, and one
manager’s dwelling. The Colusa Del Rey project was initiated through tax incentives provided under the
California Tax Credit Allocation Committee’s Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program, which provides tax
credits to private investors constructing affordable housing in the state. A discussion of the City’s previous,
current, and anticipated future efforts at facilitating the conservation of existing multi-family affordable units
and construction of new affordable housing is included in Section 9.6 of this element.
Highstreet Trailer Court currently has plans to add an additional eight spaces to the 30 existing in the
mobile home park (MHP). At the time this housing element was written, spaces in the Highstreet Trailer
Court were renting for $275 per month including water, trash, and sewer. Each tenant is responsible for
paying for electrical service. This monthly payment would be affordable to those in the Extremely Low
income category. Current residents of this and other MHPs in the City include many retired individuals and
physically disabled persons (Daly, Pers. Comm. 2008).
Mixed Use The City’s recently updated General Plan has changed the land use designation to allow for a
mix of commercial and residential uses on properties within the Riverfront District and along segments of
Fremont Street and Bridge Street. This change is intended to facilitate new development of a mix of
commercial uses and residential dwelling units within these areas and conversion into residential
apartments of upstairs spaces in existing multi-story commercial buildings within the Riverfront district.
Many of the older buildings within the Riverfront District have upper stories that were historically used as
residential living space. There has recently been renewed interest in refurbishing and converting these
upstairs spaces back into residential dwelling units and at least one property owner on Market Street has
converted the upstairs space into above-street apartments, adding four new units to the City’s housing
stock. These new units rent at prices affordable to low- and very low-income groups.
Potential mixed-use living units in the downtown area were likely not included in the vacancy data collected
by the 2000 Census, since the properties were designated for commercial uses at the time. However,
conversion and use of presently unused upstairs space in existing buildings made possible by recent
changes in the General Plan represents a potentially significant source of new affordable housing units in
the City. Currently, the City’s Zoning Ordinance designates these areas for commercial uses and requires
a Use Permit for any proposed residential uses. Forthcoming changes to the Zoning Ordinance will make it
consistent with the General Plan land use designations for these areas and is expected to reduce
constraints to permitting residential use of properties within the mixed use districts.
Assisted Housing Developments
Table 9.3-35 below identifies affordable housing developments in Colusa that receive public subsidy. At
present, all-but one are under long-term contracts and not at-risk of conversion to market-rate units during
the 2008-2013 period. The single at-risk complex, Devonshire Apartments, is discussed in the section
below.

Estimated Cost of Replacement vs. Rehabilitation
Depending on size, location (e.g., historic district), extent of repairs and funding sources (i.e., could trigger
relocation costs for temporary or permanent displacement) associated with an affordable housing
development, the cost of rehabilitation could exceed the cost of demolition and replacement. Through the
City’s early consultation process with its Project Development Review (PDR) Committee, City staff will work
with the property owners to determine which approach will achieve the housing objectives, while minimizing
costs, as well as displacement/relocation of current residents.
Financial Resources Available
The City will continue to apply for CDBG and HOME funds, as well as for other appropriate state and
federal funds to assist in conserving at-risk units. At this time, there are no dedicated City funds to assist in
this effort.
Assisted Housing Developments “At Risk” of Conversion
The California Government Code (Section 65583) requires that this element evaluate all low-income rental-
housing units which may, at some future time, be lost to the affordable inventory by the expiration of some
type of affordability restrictions, typically through government housing subsidy. This analysis must address
a ten-year period, which is divided into two five-year segments coinciding with the updating of the housing
element. The analysis must contain the following components as required by HCD:
        A comprehensive inventory of all subsidized rental housing units
        A cost comparison of replacing or preserving any units, which will become at-risk in the ten-year
         period.
        Identification of non-profit entities qualified to acquire and manage rental housing
        Identification of possible sources and potential funds for preserving housing units.
        Inventory of existing and proposed City programs for preserving at-risk units.
An inventory of all assisted projects within the City is shown in Table 9.3-35, above. Over time, this will
serve as a list to be regularly monitored, to evaluate the possible loss of affordable units and also as
planning information for use in analyzing the distribution and concentrations of low income units in the City.
Communications with California Housing Partnership Corporation staff confirmed which assisted projects
were considered at-risk for the planning period. All of the housing developments, when contacted by the
Planning Department, have indicated that they will be continuing in the various assistance programs and
will continue to be affordable to very low and low-income tenants.
The 30-unit Devonshire Apartments were financed through the HUD 236 program in 1972. Prior to the 1992
termination date, the owners of the complex filed a plan of action with HUD under the Emergency Low
Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987. The owners are currently completing the Title II process, which
will result in selling the project to Rural Communities Housing Development Corporation of Ukiah and the
establishment of a Section 8 contract to assure the continuation of rental assistance to very low and low-
income tenants. This contract will be for twenty years and, therefore, will effectively assure that the complex
will not be removed from the affordable housing stock in Colusa.

          Affordability Restrictions: The Devonshire Apartments are on a year to year Section 236 contract
          with HUD. This contract is due to expire in August 2009, at which time the contract will be
          renewed. The Devonshire Apartments are in good standing to continue to remain an affordable
          multi-family housing complex, although the complex is considered to be at-risk due to the year to
          year status of their Section 236 contract. The owners are eligible to renew the contract each year.
Rural Communities Housing Development Corporation will become the new owners under the provisions of
the agreement that is in the process of being completed with HUD. A twenty-year Section 8 contract will be
issued to provide continued rental assistance to existing and future low and very low-income tenants. This
complex may be at-risk because they are having a problem finding insurance according to the owner. This
is a recent change in their carrier’s rates and is solely due to the fact that they take Section 8 tenants. The
owner reported that if they cannot find reasonable insurance they will be forced to move out of the Section 8
Program.
Overall, the apartment complex is reported to be in good repair. Recently completed repairs/improvements
include: New parking lot, New roof on one of three buildings, New refrigerators in all units, Repair or
replacement of balconies and patio fences, New garbage enclosure, Fencing has been repaired or
replaced. Repairs planned for the near future include replacement of remaining two roofs.
Resources for Preservation of At-Risk Affordable Housing
Efforts by the City to retain low income housing in the future must be able to draw upon two basic types of
resources: organizational and financial. Firstly, qualified non-profit entities need to be made aware of the
future possibilities of units becoming at-risk. Demonstrated management and, perhaps, development
abilities should be assessed. Groups with whom the City has an ongoing association are the logical entities
for future participation. The non-profits, which have an established association with the City or have sought
the right of first refusal status with the California Department of Housing and Community Development, are:

At-Risk Cost Analysis
In order to provide a cost analysis of preserving at-risk units, costs must be determined for rehabilitation,
new construction or tenant-based rental assistance.
Rehabilitation– The primary factors used to analyze the cost of preserving housing for lower income
households include: acquisition, rehabilitation and financing. Actual acquisition costs depend on several
variables such as condition, size, location, existing financing and availability of financing (governmental and
market). The following are estimated per unit preservation costs for the City, according to a market survey
of similar projects within the region and private developers.
                                                 TABLE 9.3-35.1

Acquisition                                               $70,000
Rehabilitation                                            $40,000
Financing/Other                                           $35,000
Total Cost per Unit                                       $145,000
New Construction/Replacement – New construction implies construction of a new property with the same
number of units and similar amenities as the one removed from the affordable housing stock. Cost
estimates were prepared by using local information and data. The construction of new housing can vary
greatly depend on factors such as location, density, unit sizes, construction materials and on-site and off-
site improvements. The following table describes new construction costs for a typical garden style
apartment in Colusa
                                                 TABLE 9.3-35.2

Land Acquisition                                            $20,000
Construction                                                $135,000
Financing/Other                                             $60,000
Total Cost per Unit                                         $215,000
The rehabilitation of existing units instead of new construction is the most cost effective approach toward
the preservation of at-risk units. It should be noted however, that at-risk units may also be preserved
through tenant-based rental assistance.

Tenant-based Rental Assistance – This type of preservation largely depends on the income of the family,
the shelter costs of the apartment and the number of years the assistance is provided. If the typical family
that requires rental assistance earns $18,450, then the family could afford approximately $461 per month
for shelter costs. The difference between the $461 and the typical rent for a two bedroom apartment of
$981 would in necessary monthly assistance of $520 a month or $6,240 per year. For comparison
purposes, typical affordable housing developments carry an affordability term of at least 20 years, which
would bring the total cost to $124,800 per family. For the 7-year period of this housing element, a total of
30 units are considered at-risk units in Devonshire Apartment complex. The total cost of producing new and
comparable units is estimated at $6,450,000, while rehabilitation is estimated at $4,350,000. Providing
tenant-based rental assistance is estimated at $3,744,000 for a 20-year period.
PROJECTED HOUSING NEED – REGIONAL FAIR SHARE
The housing element process begins with the California Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) allocating a region's share of the statewide housing need to Councils of Governments
(COG) based on Department of Finance population projections and regional population forecasts used in
preparing regional transportation plans. The COG is then charged with developing a Regional Housing
Needs Allocation Plan (RHNAP) to allocate the region’s share of the statewide need to the cities and
counties that are member jurisdictions of the COG. This allocation to each community is known as the
community’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA).
The Tri-County Area Planning Council (TCAPC) has served in the past as the COG for the Counties of
Colusa, Glenn, and Tehama, but has recently become inactive. Per California Government Code Section
65584.06, HCD is required to develop a plan to distribute the final determination of regional housing need to
each local government not represented by a council of governments. Due to inactivity on the part of the
TCAPC, HCD has prepared the RHNAP for the Counties of Colusa, Glenn, and Tehama, including the City
of Colusa for the planning period including January 2007 through June 2014. The RHNAP is required to
promote the following objectives to:
         1) Increase the housing supply and the mix of housing types, tenure, and affordability in all cities

         2) Promote infill development and socioeconomic equity, the protection of environmental and
              agricultural resources, and the encouragement of efficient development patterns; and
         3) Promote an improved intraregional relationship between jobs and housing.
The RHNA Plan identifies the number of dwelling units, including the number of affordable dwelling units, by
income group, that each jurisdiction in Colusa County must accommodate January 1, 2007 through June
30, 2014 (a 7½-year planning period). According to the RHNA Plan, 523 new housing units are allocated to
the City of Colusa (Table 9.3-36 below). Approximately 39% of the City of Colusa’s housing allocation, or
204 units, are intended to be developed at densities and prices affordable to very low- and low-income
households.
Colusa’s Housing Element must demonstrate how it will accommodate the production of these units—the
City must show that there is adequate land properly zoned to accommodate its allocation of units and that
barriers to the production of dwelling units are minimized or eliminated.

QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
The City of Colusa has established quantified (numerical) objectives for several program categories to
provide measurable standards for monitoring and evaluating program achievements. As shown in Table
9.3-37, Quantified objectives have been established for accommodating the City’s share of Colusa County’s
future housing needs, new housing construction, housing rehabilitation, the preservation of existing
affordable housing, and homebuyer assistance.
The quantified objectives for the City’s share of Colusa County’s future housing needs and housing
construction differ because the housing objective is based on the City’s estimate of the number homes that
will actually be constructed, rehabilitated, etc. and affordable to each income group. The future housing
needs objective addresses the City’s ability to accommodate housing based on the availability of
appropriately zoned vacant and underutilized land, with public services and facilities. These homes may or
may not be built depending on market trends and the availability of funding assistance to developers of
affordable housing.

1. Quantified Objectives are for the 2007 – 2014 Colusa County Regional Housing Need Allocation Plan. RHNAP assumes ½ of
   very low income need will be allocated to extremely low income households
2. Quantified Objectives cover 2007 – 2014, including housing units constructed 2007-2008, based on anticipated market rate
   housing production (for moderate-and above moderate-income), availability of financial resources to assist in the construction of
   very low- and low-income housing, and the City’s past track record of producing affordable housing
3. Based on historic level of performance under the housing rehabilitation program
4. Based on the conservation of 30 at-risk subsidized rental housing units—the City does not have specific information on the
   number of very low-income versus low-income units.
5. Based on the number of mobile homes in parks with 50 or more spaces; although the majority of mobile home park residents are
   likely to have very low- or low-incomes, the City does not have specific information on the income levels of mobile home park
   residents. Conservation of units will occur through various programs, including CDBG, Section 8 and weatherization, as
   described in Chapter 9.6 of this Housing Element.
6. RHNAP assumes ½ of very low income need will be for extremely low income households
Quantified Objectives for "At Risk" Analysis
As discussed in the “At Risk” analysis above, since the 30-unit Devonshire Apartments is being sold to
Rural Communities Housing Development Corporation of Ukiah and will establish a Section 8 contract that
assures the continuation of rental assistance to very low and low-income tenants for the next 20 years,
there are no at-risk units expected to become market rate during the 7.5-year planning period. The City's
focus during the 2008-2014 planning period will be to establish programs for monitoring the status of future
potential at-risk units. During this period possible funding sources for preservation will be investigated or
developed, as described in Chapter 9.7 of this element—Implementing Actions Defined.
The process of monitoring, negotiating, and possibly financially assisting the preservation of affordable units
in Colusa will be an ongoing program function for City staff. A successful plan for dealing with the future
need for affordable rental housing should include: 1) continuous monitoring of any and all existing
complexes with some type of affordability restrictions; 2) the development of new programs and incentives
to entice the construction of additional units: and 3) designating potential resources for operating as well as
financing the preservation of units.
9.4         REVIEW OF PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
The measure of effectiveness of the Housing Element in attainment of the community’s housing goals is in
how well the element guides the decision makers and staff in the development of housing programs. As
part of its housing element update, each local government is required to evaluate its progress toward
achieving the goals contained in the previous Housing Element. This evaluation should include a
discussion of the following:
            1. The effectiveness of the Housing Element in the attainment of the State housing goal.
            2. An analysis of the significant differences between what was projected and what was achieved.
            3. A description of how the goals, policies, programs, and quantifiable objectives of the updated
                 element incorporate what has been learned from the results of the previous element.
For a small city, the programs in Colusa’s 2003-2008 Housing Element have served this purpose well by
describing and providing direction for programs to increase housing availability to households at all income
levels. While many of the actions described in the 2003-2008 programs were successfully implemented,
City of Colusa                                                                                                   Housing Element

others were not. An analysis of the degree of success for each program identified in the previous housing
element is provided below, along with an update on the current status of the program and a projection of
each program’s future under this updated housing element. Despite the accomplishments during this
period, the City’s RHNA construction needs for very low- and low-income units were not met. This is not
due to Colusa’s inability to provide new housing, particularly affordable housing — the Colusa Del Rey
apartment complex has recently (2008) produced 81 new affordable multifamily units. Rather, actual
population growth in the City did not meet the RHNAP’s population growth projections and the anticipated
need for additional housing during the 2003 - 2008 planning period did not materialize.
The current Colusa Housing Element was adopted on March 24, 2004. This element identified numerous
programs to address the affordable housing needs of the City in addition to the creation of new housing on
vacant land. While the element was not certified by HCD and required some modifications, this effort was
postponed due to a comprehensive General Plan update that was formally undertaken between November
2004 and October 2007. The updated General Plan was adopted by the City Council in October of 2007.
2003-2008 REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS OBJECTIVES
The Element’s regional housing objectives encompassed the 2003-2008 period. The Tri-County Area
Planning Council determined that 290 new housing units would be needed in Colusa by 2008. Of these,
the affordability breakdown was as follows:
     65 units for very low-income households (less than 50 percent of County median income);
     49 units for low-income households (50 to 80 percent of median);
     55 units for moderate-income households (80 to 120 percent of median); and
     121 units for above moderate-income households (120 percent or more of median).
2003-2008 ACCOMPLISHMENTS
As shown in Table 9.4-1, a total of 168 new housing units were constructed in the City between 2003 and
2008, or approximately 34 units per year.
While detailed information regarding the cost of each of the units constructed is not readily available,
estimates of the affordability of the units constructed were made based on square footage and type of unit
built. It is estimated that 41 of the units constructed over the planning period were affordable to very-low
income households, and that 43 of the units constructed are affordable to low income households. It is
estimated that 54 of the units are affordable to moderate income households, and that approximately 30 of
the units constructed are affordable to above moderate income households.
With regard to the rehabilitation or conservation of units that are affordable to low income households,
neither the City nor the City’s grants administrator has a record of the number of units that were conserved
rehabilitated between 2003 and 2008. The City can report, however, that housing rehabilitation loans were
made using a combination of Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), State DHRPO Program, and
USDA Rural Housing Services (RHS) funds. Rehabilitation involved the repair or retrofit of dilapidated or
substandard housing units. Conservation involved the preservation of existing affordable housing units
subject to conversion to market rate rental or for-sale units. To remedy the lack of a reliable record-keeping,
Implementation Program H-5 (Administrative Record Keeping) will be developed to ensure that more
accurate reporting occurs during the next Housing Element update
In making the existing housing stock more affordable to low income residents, 181 households in the City
received rental assistance during this period. The sources of funding for this assistance were the Section 8
Certificate and Housing Voucher programs of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD), locally administered by the Mercy Housing California. Additional affordable housing was provided
for 196 low income households through the continued availability of privately owned low income rental
housing that was constructed using HUD and RHS financing.

As shown in Table 9.4-1, the total number of new housing units constructed in the City over the prior
planning period largely met or exceeded the City’s expectations. The table also reflects a lack of data
showing the number of units that were rehabilitated or conserved during this period.
As mentioned above, the City is in need of a better record-keeping system to track its progress with regard
to rehabilitation and conservation units, as well as new construction.                        The Housing Element’s
Implementation Program includes Implementing Action H-5 (Administrative Record Keeping), which will
enable the Planning Department to work closely with Administration to identify appropriate software and the
necessary funding to purchase, install and maintain a more efficient tracking of construction activity.
While the City has been active in pursuing the use of State and Federal housing assistance programs for
housing rehabilitation and new construction, the funds that are available have been limited and the
competition among agencies for those funds has been intense. At the same time, the limited City staff
available to focus on overseeing local housing needs has affected the City’s capacity to do outreach for
affordable housing development.
That being said, the quantified objectives presented in the Housing Program section of this element, the
City expects an increase in the production of affordable housing units over the next 7.5 years. In fact, one

81 unit multifamily development—Colusa del Rey— has been constructed in the current planning period
(2008-2014) and the City is working with the developer to bring another affordable housing development to
the City.
REVIEW OF PREVIOUS ELEMENT’S PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS
The following Table 9.4-2 provides a review and analysis of housing programs contained in the 2004
Housing Element. For each program, the action is defined, the responsibility and target date for completing
the action is identified, as well as the funding source. This is followed by the results produced by the
program, an analysis of its effectiveness, and what corrective action is required, if any. (Note: the
lettering/numbering of these programs is taken directly from the previous Housing Element; HP=Housing
Availability and Production; HC=Housing Conservation and Improvement; EC=Energy Conservation;
EH=Equal Housing; RC=Removing Constraints; HA=Housing Affordability; PH=Preserving Affordable
Housing).

                      STATUS OF HOUSING PROGRAMS CONTAINED IN 2004 ELEMENT
  HP1:     Continue to utilize the City's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance to provide adequate, suitable
           sites for the construction of new housing, reflecting a variety of housing types and densities.
  Responsibility: Planning Department
  Target Date: Ongoing
  Funding Source: General Fund
  Results: The 2007 General Plan update accomplished this with a range of densities, including mixed-
  use that will allow for multi-family housing. However, the zoning ordinance is now in need of an update
  to be consistent with this change in designated land uses
  Analysis: The GP Land Use Map update provides adequate, appropriately designated sites within the
  city and entire Sphere of Influence for the construction of a range of new residential units, including
  above moderate, moderate, low-income, and very low-income units.
  Update: The Housing Element update includes Implementing Action H-2, which will update the zoning
  ordinance to increase the amount of R-4 vacant land that permits this range of uses consistent with the
  General Plan.
  HP 2:   Provision of adequate, appropriately zoned sites for the construction of 523 residential units,
          including 173 above moderate, 110 moderate, 100 low income, and 140 very low income units.
  Responsibility: Planning Department
  Target Date: Ongoing
  Funding Source: General Fund
  Results: The 2007 General Plan update accomplished this with a range of densities, including mixed-
  use that will allow for multi-family housing. However, the zoning ordinance must be revised to be
  consistent with this change in designated land uses
  Analysis: The GP Land Use Map update provides adequate, appropriately zoned sites within the city
  and entire Sphere of Influence for the construction of a range of new residential units, including above
  moderate, moderate, low-income, and very low-income units.
 Update: The Housing Element update includes Implementing Action H-2, which will increase the
  amount of R-4 vacant land that permits this range of uses consistent with the General Plan.
  Specifically, the zoning ordinance update will include provisions to prohibit down-zoning.
  HP 3: Explore incentives, e.g., reduction in development fees, relaxation of development standards,

          etc., for the more intensive use of underutilized, residentially zoned land, particularly within
          walking distance of downtown Colusa. (See Figure 4.10 on page 4.49 for the Downtown Core
          Area boundary)
 Responsibility: Planning Department
 Target Date: Ongoing
 Funding Source: General Fund, CDBG P/TA grant funds
 Results: Incentives were explored for the 101-unit Tennant Estates subdivision, but no development
 agreement was ever finalized and the project has not moved ahead to the construction phase.
 Tennant Estates is “dead” for now. By contrast, while there was no DA for Colusa del Rey, the density
 for this R-4 site was more fully realized with the construction of 81 units.
 Analysis: Anticipated results were more efficient and productive use of land zoned for residential
 purposes. Underutilized or small vacant lots in or adjacent to the downtown area can support the
 development of additional dwelling units, which, in turn, would enhance the market for downtown
 businesses.
 Update: The Housing Element update includes Implementing Action H-19 (Public/Private
 Partnerships), under which the City with will work with the Colusa del Rey affordable housing
 developer, CFY, to see if it can assist with the next “Del Rey” by using City-available grant funds to
 help facilitate infrastructure repairs and upgrades to remove those potential constraints.
 HP 4: Continue to conditionally allow residences above or to the rear of ground floor commercial uses
          in downtown.
 Responsibility: Planning Department
 Target Date: Ongoing
 Funding Source: General Fund
 Results: Four residential units were approved above commercial buildings in the historic downtown
 core. The units were rehabilitated, converted to living quarters, and are occupied.
 Analysis: The City needs to revise its downtown parking requirements. This was problematic in getting
 the project approved without sufficient “onsite” parking.
 Update: Parking requirements will be revisited and likely be relaxed with Implementing Action H-2,
 Zoning Ordinance Review and Update, under which the zoning code will allow for mixed use with
 residential in the downtown core and possibly include relaxed parking standards.
 HP 5: Continue to utilize environmental and other development review procedures to ensure that all
 new residential developments are provided with adequate public facilities and services. Documentation
 that adequate services and facilities are or will be provided shall be a condition for their approval.
 Responsibility: Planning, Building and Safety, and Public Works Departments
 Target Date: Ongoing
 Funding Source: General Fund
 Results: This is a routine part of the City’s development review and the CEQA process.
 Analysis: This process is implemented as a part of the CEQA requirement and the City’s General Plan
 goals and policies intended to ensure that all new residential developments are provided with adequate
 public facilities and services.
 Update: The City will continue with Implementing Action H-10 (Development Review). This process
 will ensure adequate public services and facilities are provided.
 HP 6: Apprise housing developers of the criteria to be used in selecting sites for the construction of low
 income housing. Criteria are listed under Policy HP-8 in the Housing Goals/Objectives/Policies section
 beginning on page 4.69.

 requested and funded by developer.
 Analysis: Anticipated results would be the dissemination of information to private developers and non-
 profit corporations to facilitate housing production.
 Update: GIS system needs to be installed for use by City planning and building staff. This is proposed
 with Implementing Action H-5 (Administrative Record Keeping). Once this is done, the City will be able
 to provide better information about land uses and residential vacancies. The City will seek out various
 funding programs to acquire GIS capabilities for tracking housing trends as well.

 HC 6: Continue to provide information and technical assistance to local property owners regarding
 housing maintenance through brochures distributed by Mercy Housing and the First Time Home
 Buyers Program and other outreach agencies.
 Responsibility: Planning and Building and Safety Departments
 Target Date: Annually for the life of the program
 Funding Source: General Fund
 Results: Not accomplished.
 Analysis: Anticipated result was the proper, continued maintenance of currently sound housing,
 thereby preventing deterioration and avoiding the need for rehabilitation assistance, but due to lack of
 staff and time resources, the coordination did not occur.
 Update: Under Implementing Action H-18 (Public Awareness/Education Program), the City will work

 to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).
 Responsibility: Planning Department
 Target Date: Biennial review of HMDAICRA statements
 Funding Source: General Fund
 Results: No record that this was done.
 Analysis: Intent was to assure that conventional financing was available to all economic segments of
 the community.
 Update: The ability of the City to affect the performance of local lending institutions with regard to
 lending practices is little to none. This program will be discontinued.
 RC 3: Periodically survey (i.e., every two years) other cities in the Tri-County area to ensure that local

 to help defray, or otherwise defer development fees for all proposed affordable housing projects.
 HA 1: Explore the possibility of establishing a City Housing Authority or other City sponsored Non-
 Profit Housing Corporation to take advantage of any available funding for new construction of
 affordable housing.
 Responsibility: City Council and Planning Department
 Target Date: 2005
 Funding Source: General Fund
 Results: Not done.
 Analysis: Intent was to improve the ability of the City to obtain funding for the construction,
 rehabilitation and/or purchase of low and moderate-income housing.
 Update: At this time, the City is able to take advantage of funding through various state and federal
 programs through direct application. The City already works directly with non-profits and private
 affordable housing developers. Therefore, it is not anticipated that resources will be required to
 establish a Housing Authority this during the next planning period. This program will be discontinued.
 HA 2: Explore with local lending institutions their possible participation in the creation of a loan pool for
 the construction, rehabilitation and/or purchase of housing affordable to low and moderate-income

 Funding Source: General Fund
 Results: This was not done.
 Analysis: Anticipated outcome of creating an additional source of funding for the construction,
 rehabilitation and/or purchase of low and moderate income housing did not occur.
 Update: With the recent economic downturn, it is not anticipated that local lending institutions will do
 more than the standard lending for these purposes. This program will be replaced by H-18 (Public
 Awareness/Education Program) to provide brochures about what lending options are available through
 private institutions for construction, rehabilitation and/or purchase of affordable housing.
 HA 3: Continue to allocate funds to defray, or otherwise waive development fees for all proposed
          housing units affordable to low income households.

 of units, density transfers, zero lot line development, etc., by design review, planned unit
 developments, and by density bonuses to minimize housing development costs.
 Responsibility: Planning Department
 Target Date: Ongoing
 Funding Source: General Fund
 Results: These land use techniques were called out in the form of policies and programs as part of the
 2007 comprehensive General Plan update. The City conveys clearly through the General Plan’s Land
 Use and Community Character & Design Elements its commitment to innovated land use planning,
 design, and construction principles.
 Analysis: Anticipated result was the reduction in housing development costs without compromising

 and other incentives. This action was initiated in response to Section 65915 et. seq. of the Government
 Code. This legislation, which was amended in 1990, requires that a density bonus and at least one
 other incentive be granted for any project consisting of five or more units in which at least either 20
 percent of the units will be available to low income households, or 10 percent will be available to very
 low income households.
 Update: The adoption of a Density Bonus Ordinance is included as Implementing Action H-11 in this
 Housing Element update. The ordinance will apply to all residential zones within the City.
 HA 6: Inform private developers of the below market interest rate mortgage programs operated by the
 California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA) and direct interested developers to CHFA, as a means to
 facilitate the construction of new, affordable housing for moderate income households. The information
 will be distributed to developers through service organizations and outreach agencies.
 Responsibility: Planning Department
 Target Date: Ongoing
 Funding Source: CHFA Home Mortgage Purchase Program
 Results: This information may have been made available to inquiring developers, although no records
 were kept of this.
 Analysis: Anticipated impact was the production of new, affordable housing for purchase by moderate
 income, first-time homebuyers. This objective was not achieved through CHFA.
 Update: Implementing Action H-18 (Public Awareness/Education Program) and H-19 (Public/Private
 Partnerships) as described in Section 9.8 of this Housing Element update will help meet the objectives
 described in this program.
 HA 8: Consider amending the City's Zoning Ordinance to require the inclusion of a stipulated
 percentage of low and moderate-income units in all new multi-family housing developments containing

 Results: The City continues to have Section 8 housing that is not at risk of conversion to market rate.
 Analysis: Anticipated result was continued rental assistance to low income households in the form of
 Section 8 Certificates and Housing Vouchers,
 Update: The City will be more proactive during the next planning period to make sure that it is assisting
 non-profits to the extent possible to maximize Section 8 housing opportunities.
 PH 4: Consider amending the City's Municipal Code, expanding preservation activities in response to
 notices, to establish procedures to prevent the displacement of low income residents from assisted
 housing units that may convert to market rate housing in the future.
 Responsibility: Planning Department
 Target Date: Semi-annually (complete study of need for and possible content of anti-displacement
 ordinance).
 Funding Source: General Fund
 Results: This was not completed
 Analysis: Anticipated result was the preservation of rental units that could convert to market rate
 housing in the future.
 Update: The City will move forward with this action during the 2007-2014 planning period.

9.5 CONSTRAINTS TO HOUSING PRODUCTION
The provision of adequate safe, comfortable and affordable housing for all economic and social segments
of the City of Colusa is presently constrained by infrastructure capabilities, particularly in areas of potential
residential development that are proposed for annexation to the City, as well as by a combination of
economic, and governmental factors. At the time of the writing of this Housing Element the most significant
constraints to development of affordable housing are the unfavorable economic and real estate
environment and the lack of land within the City zoned for high density residential development.
Governmental constraints, constraints related to the environment, and lack of infrastructure/public facilities,
as well as non-governmental constraints to the housing supply are discussed in greater detail below.
GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Governmental policies and regulations can constrain future residential development to varying degrees by
imposing requirements and limitations on such development. These policies and regulations, when
imposed, may act to increase the cost of development and act as a barrier to housing construction or result
in higher asking prices for homes once built. Generally, governmental constraints include land
development controls, development processing procedures, timeframes, and fees, the amount of vacant
land designated or zoned by the jurisdiction for residential use at appropriate development densities, and
requirements for the provision of services, infrastructure, and facilities.
Compliance with state and federal regulatory requirements (e.g., Air Quality Management Plans and
Congestion Management Plans, California Department of Fish and Game requirements, CEQA/NEPA
environmental review, etc.) can also increase costs of housing construction, but would typically have a
greater impact on development within more metropolitan areas than the City of Colusa. Ideally, the free
market would act to provide some type of housing for everyone in need of shelter; however, state and local
standards for health, safety, and development patterns require that housing must meet certain standards for
construction.
These standards, expressed in the form of governmental regulations, act to protect the health and safety
and property values and are generally thought to be in the best interest of the community. Although these
governmental controls on housing increase the cost of housing for those with limited resources, it is not in
the best interest of the community to disregard these standards. Therefore, housing programs are often
required to subsidize or otherwise provide housing to those with limited financial resources so that housing
can meet a community’s minimum standards. Such programs are discussed throughout this Housing
Element. The governmental controls unique to Colusa that affect housing development are discussed
further below.
Land Use Controls
Land development controls include policies and regulations contained in the City’s General Plan, Zoning
Ordinances, Subdivision Ordinance, and building codes.
General Plan
In October 2007 the City of Colusa adopted a comprehensive update to its General Plan. The Colusa
General Plan guides residential development in the City by identifying land use designations and
corresponding densities. Residential land use designations in the General Plan call for development
densities ranging from 1 to 20 dwelling units per acre (see Table 9.5-1 below). The updated General Plan
has added a mixed-use land use designation for areas of the City in which projects with both commercial
and residential components may be combined. The addition of this land use designation is intended to
promote construction and conversion of residential units within the historic commercial district. Please refer
to the Land Use Map (Figure 2.3) in the 2007 General Plan for the location of all land use designations.

                  Medium Density                                    8-12 du/ac
                  High Density                                     12-20 du/ac
The General Plan also guides development of residential land uses by identifying comprehensive goals,
policies, and standards to address community issues such as noise, affordable housing, circulation, safety,
and the provision of municipal services and development—these also act as criteria for development within
the City.
Zoning Ordinance
The City of Colusa Zoning Ordinance prescribes allowable land uses, height, bulk, density and parking
standards for each zone district in the City. The Zoning Ordinance was adopted in its present form in 1999,
although numerous amendments have occurred over the years. However, amendments needed to bring
the zoning ordinance in compliance with the General Plan update have yet to be made. Therefore, in its
current form, the Zoning Ordinance is partially inconsistent with the General Plan. A Zoning Ordinance
review and update (Housing Element Implementing Action H-2) is a high priority of the City and part of the
General Plan’s overall implementation program. Table 9.5-2 identifies types of residential development
permitted within each zone district currently, as well as types of residential uses permitted with issuance of
use permits.

Conditional Use Permits A Conditional Use Permit (CUP) is not required for multi-family developments
within existing R-3 and R-4 multi-family zone districts so long as the project is in compliance with
development standards set forth in the Zoning Ordinance. The Zoning Ordinance allows residential
development within commercial and industrial zone district with approval of a major use permit. The reason
for a CUP in these zone districts is to ensure compatibility with surrounding land uses and to ensure the
public health, safety and welfare in areas of the City that are not typically intended for residential
development. This is not considered an onerous requirement.
City of Colusa                                                                                                Housing Element

Parking Requirements          The City’s parking requirements for residential districts vary by housing type.
Table 9.5-3, above, identifies the City’s parking requirements for different housing types. Locations and
access to spaces are approved by the Planning Director in consultation with other City staff. The Planning
Director, in consultation with the City Engineer, may waive some of the parking requirements for affordable
housing if affordability covenants provide for a minimum of 25 years of affordability.
The requirement for one covered space does not require an enclosed or garage space, but does require
that some structure be provided to allow a car to be within a sheltered space. Many municipalities require
two parking spaces per single-family residential units and have further requirements for parking spaces to
be within an enclosed garage. The City’s parking standards for single-family and multi-family residential
development are therefore not considered an onerous requirement that would unnecessarily increase the
cost of residential development or push residential development into other jurisdictions with lesser
requirements.
Density Bonus        The Zoning Ordinance is in need of an update, and is presently limited in its ability to
facilitate diverse housing types through flexibility in development standards. One tool that could be made
available is the Density Bonus, as provided by California Government Code Section 65915. This state law
requires cities to grant a density bonus of up to 25 percent, or provide other incentives of equivalent
financial value, if the developer agrees to construct at least 25 percent of the total units of a housing
development for low- and moderate-income families. However, the City has not received an application.
Therefore, the State density bonus legislation has not provided a sufficient incentive for the construction of
affordable housing. This is partly due to the fact that, because of lower land costs in Colusa, higher
densities do not increase the affordability of housing as much as in more urbanized locations with higher
land prices and larger minimum lot sizes. The Housing Element includes adoption of a density bonus
ordinance among its implementing actions as described in Implementing Action H-11 (see Section 9.8 -
Implementing Actions Defined).
Improvement Standards
The City adopted revised Improvement Standards in November 2007. Presently, the City Engineer
determines compliance with on and offsite Improvement Standards and Construction Specifications for
design and construction of streets, curb & gutter, water, wastewater, and drainage. Compliance with the
City’s Improvement standards ensures that public improvements, such as onsite and offsite water, sewer,
roadways, and other infrastructure required to serve new development, are constructed to minimum
standards and specifications to provide for proper function and an acceptable service life. Project
Development Review (PDR) meetings are also encouraged to provide an opportunity for City staff to
discuss with the developer what site improvements would be needed and what specific performance
standards will be acceptable based on project characteristics.
For large subdivisions the City requires the construction of reasonable on and off-site improvements as
permitted by the Subdivision Map Act. Typical improvements required of a developer include grading and
improvement of public and private streets including surfacing, curbs, gutters, sidewalks street lighting, street
names and necessary traffic safety devices. The City of Colusa Improvement Standards describe roadway
design criteria for various curb-to-curb widths based on the following standard street types and design
widths. These standards are typical throughout the community and are not seen as constraint to affordable
housing.

Implementing Action H-4 in Chapter 6 commits the City to revising these standards as necessary to
facilitate affordable housing construction and ensure appropriate engineering standards are met for new
developments.
Development Review
Plans for individual single-family homes or for multi-family projects that are proposed within appropriate
zones (R-3 & R-4) are reviewed for compliance with zoning standards by Planning Department staff and
then forwarded to the Building Department where they are reviewed for compliance with applicable building
codes prior to issuance of a building permit. Any residential project proposed in an appropriate residential
zone that is not subject to a use permit is considered to be a ministerial approval. Residential projects, both
single-family and multi-family, proposed in a commercial or industrial zone (except for emergency shelters)
may be subject to obtaining a use permit. Residential projects proposed in conjunction with commercial or
industrial projects in commercial or industrial zones (Mixed Use) can be approved ministerially. All
proposed projects requiring issuance of a conditional use permit require review and approval by the City’s
Planning Commission at a public hearing.
The permitting and review process for all project types in Colusa includes:
         An optional pre-development review (PDR) meeting to identify issues early on, thereby expediting
          application processing;
         Submittal of the application;
         Review for completeness by Planning staff;
         A letter to the applicant specifying in detail what additional information is needed to complete the
          application—this would include information about the project and environmental background
          reports, if applicable (i.e., traffic & noise studies, soils reports, etc.)
         Internal review of all application materials, site plan, maps, and design by Planning staff, City
          Engineer, Public Works, Fire Chief and Police Chief;

           Additional meetings (phone and/or in person) with the applicant, if necessary; and
           Public hearing by the Planning Commission for review and approval and, if necessary, by the City
            Council. Planning Commission approval is required for all Conditional Use Permit requests and City
            Council approval is required for all subdivision or parcel map requests.
Time in Review
Table 9.5-4 identifies the approximate time necessary to process residential development applications. In
general, it is expected that small developments would be processed in 9-12 weeks. Larger development
applications may take between 6 and 24 months to process (up to 12 months for an environmental impact
report (EIR), depending on the complexity of the project and environmental issues. However, the time
necessary for review largely depends on the size and complexity of the project overall, the degree to which
it complies with adopted City standards, and the initial completeness of the development application. The
timeframes are considered reasonable and the City has been successful in efficiently processing
development applications to accommodate timelines for development projects.

     Statutory time begins on date the application is deemed complete by Planning staff in accordance with the State of California’s

   Review of residential projects typically involves the determination of conformance with the City’s General Plan, site improvement
   standards, development standards, and design guidelines, and environmental compliance in accordance with the California
   Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and CEQA Guidelines. The timeframes for these processes are largely dictated by State
   Planning Law and CEQA; the time period necessary for environmental review may vary substantially depending on whether an
   EIR, Negative Declaration, or Categorical Exemption is required. The CEQA environmental review process represents significant
   additional costs and development processing delays that must be paid for by the developer and negatively affect the profitability
   of development. By processing many environmental documents in-house and maintaining a list of qualified environmental
   consultants, the City is well prepared to efficiently manage preparation of environmental review documentation and analysis for
   projects for which it is required and minimize the constraint to housing production represented by environmental review
   requirements.

Proposed subdivisions are reviewed for compliance with zoning standards such as circulation, orientation of
buildings, location and visibility of common areas, and landscaping. Currently, City staff conducts an
informal review of the proposed building architecture proposed using the General Plan’s Community
Character and Design Element.
Design Review
The establishment of Design Guidelines and a Design Review process are proposed as two of the
Implementing Actions in the Community Character and Design Element of the 2007 Colusa General Plan.
However, they have yet to be drafted and adopted. Once they are in place, the Design Guidelines will
enable developers to more efficiently and predictably move through the development review process by
providing a clear set of criteria and a defined path for approval. The process is anticipated to reduce
uncertainty in the project review process, resulting in shorter review timeframes and development products
consistent with the vision set forth in the Community Character and Design Element of the General Plan.
By resulting in greater processing efficiency, Design Review is expected to reduce constraints to

Implementing Action H-16.
Impact and Application Processing Fees
Impact Fees
The City requires developers to pay impact fees to cover the City’s costs to provide services and utility
infrastructure to new development. Current impact fees are based on a fee study prepared by the City in
2006, which determine the real costs to the City of providing adequate city services to new development.
The impact fee structure is currently under review and will be updated in 2009/2010. The City has a policy
of allowing affordable projects to apply for fee deferrals or waivers for some impact fees. Final approval is
granted by City Council. Impact fees are collected for streets, capital facilities, storm drainage, parks
facilities, water system, and sewer facilities, as shown in Table 9.5-5.

Additionally, for any project requiring subdivision of land, the city collects fees to provide for park
improvements as authorized under the Quimby Act (California Government Code §66477). This requires a
developer to set aside land, donate conservation easements, or pay in-lieu fees to accommodate a
minimum of four acres of park land per 1,000 residents. Revenues generated through the Quimby Act
cannot be used for the operation and maintenance of park facilities, but only for the purchase of parkland or
park improvements. The amount of land required to be dedicated and/or the amount of the in-lieu fee is
determine by the proposed density of the residential project, with higher density projects required to pay a
higher per-acre fee or provide parkland dedication at a higher ratio than lower density development. This is
a typical fee that is assessed to developers by most municipalities. The City of Colusa’s dedication or in-
lieu ratio requirement of five acres to 1,000 residents is the same as that required by many municipalities in
the Sacramento region.
Development Processing Fees
The City of Colusa collects development fees and fee processing deposits to ensure reimbursement of the
City for time spent by staff and consultants in processing requested development permits. Colusa also
requires developer funding and/or construction of offsite extension of utilities and storm drain infrastructure,
and requires the developer to construct all internal streets, curb, and gutter, and to improve segments of off-
site roadways to accommodate increased traffic resulting from project development. Improvements are
typically required as conditions of project approval or as a condition of the Development Agreement entered
into by the City and the developer.

Development processing and permit fees and exactions can add to housing construction costs. In general,
permit fees are typically high in rapidly growing communities or in areas of new development that expand
the developed core, as supporting infrastructure is not in place and must be provided by new development.
Development processing fees and application fees for a typical residential project, including multifamily
required by the City of Colusa are shown in Tables 9.5-6 and 9.5-6.1, respectively below. Development
fees for multifamily development are similar to single family development. Permit processing and
development fees assessed by the City of Colusa are generally lower than comparable jurisdictions. In
some cases, the fees do not fully cover the cost of providing services and facilities.

As shown in Table 9.5-6, above, many of the fees assessed are based on project characteristics, such as
valuation or grading quantities and therefore no standard amount can be provided. An example of
development costs for a 1,600 square-foot single -family home are given in Table 9.5-7 below.
Development fees in the City of Colusa are comparable to those assessed by Yuba City. The fees charged
by both Colusa and Yuba City are lower than fees typically assessed by larger metropolitan cities in
California. These fees are not considered onerous by comparison with other similar jurisdictions and do not
represent a constraint on the production of a range of housing types. As indicated by Table 9.5-7, impact
fees and development processing fees represent less than 10% of the overall cost of development for the
example single-family dwelling, and a large portion of this cost is represented by school impact fees, over
which the City has no authority. On the contrary, the fees that are charged by the City represent only partial
reimbursement for the effort that must be expended by City staff in order to properly review development
plans. The City will continue to conduct surveys (both formal and informal) of other communities in the
region to ensure that local processing fees do not inhibit housing construction.
Governmental Constraints on Special Needs Housing
Persons with special needs include those who are disabled, persons in residential care facilities, farm
workers, persons in need of transitional shelter or transitional living arrangements, and single room
occupancy units. The Housing Element must analyze potential and actual constraints upon the
development, maintenance, and improvement of housing for these groups. The County must also
demonstrate efforts to remove constraints to housing for these groups, and provide reasonable
accommodations for housing designed for those with special needs. The County’s provisions for these
housing types are discussed below.
Housing for Person with Disabilities
SB 520 – Government Constraints and Persons with Disabilities
State Planning and Zoning Law requires a housing element to make adequate provision for the housing
needs of all economic segments of the community, to include, among other things, an analysis of the
special housing needs of the handicapped, and a program to address, remove constraints to, and promote
housing to accommodate the disabled. The following is a discussion that supplements the governmental
constraints section above.
Siting and Concentration Requirements
As discussed above, the City has analyzed its land use, zoning and building code provisions and processes
to determine what accommodations and constraints exist to housing production for persons with disabilities.
Individuals within this special needs group may reside in residential or community care facilities units in any
zoning district that allows residential uses. Some may choose to reside in a licensed residential community
care facility designed for occupancy by or with supportive services for persons with disabilities. The zoning
ordinance does not differentiate between related and unrelated persons in the occupancy of residential
units. Pursuant to state law, the zoning ordinance allows group homes of six or fewer persons by right in all
residential zoning districts that permit single-family residences and provides for larger group homes to be
established by right in the R-4 zone district. The zoning ordinance includes no restriction as to minimum
distances between residential care facilities.

Special Accommodations for Persons with Disabilities
The City recognizes that access to a residence can require special accommodations for persons with
physical disabilities that limit their mobility, particularly when the access features are retrofitted to existing
units. A zoning ordinance provision, which allows open porches, platforms or landing places and the
associated ramps to encroach into setback areas facilitates external retrofits for access. (Note: a building
permit is not required for access ramps when the platform or landing height does not exceed 30 inches.)
Americans with Disabilities Act Requirements
The City has adopted and enforces the current California Building Codes (CBC), including Chapter 11
pertaining to accessibility. This chapter incorporates provisions from the Americans with Disabilities Act (42
U.S.C. § 12101 et seq), which specifies that a number of the residential units in new multifamily
construction of three or more apartments or four or more condominiums must be accessible or adaptable.
The recently constructed Colusa Del Rey multi-family apartment project provides several units both
accessible and adaptable ground floor units. Building officials and Planning Department staff are
encouraged to keep current with accessibility requirements for the construction and remodel of residential
structures to ensure that accessibility requirements are met for all projects.
Residential Care Facilities
Pursuant to state law, the City allows group homes for six or fewer individuals by right in all residential zone
districts. Group homes of seven individuals or more are allowed in the General Apartment (R-4) zone
district with issuance of a conditional use permit. Further discussion of residential care facilities for persons
with disabilities is provided above under Housing for Persons with Disabilities.
Emergency Shelters and Transitional Housing
Pursuant to state law, the City allows licensed group homes for six or fewer individuals, including those
providing a residence for those in a transitional housing situation, by right in all residential zone districts.
The zoning ordinance provides for larger boarding houses in the R-4 district with issuance of a conditional
use permit. Homeless shelters and transitional and supportive housing, though not specifically called out in
the Zoning Ordinance, may be defined as a boarding house or a community care facility. Pursuant to SB 2,
zoning must permit supportive and transitional housing as a residential use and only subject to those
restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. Action H-2 has been
added consistent with this requirement.
California Health and Safety Code (Section 50801) defines an emergency shelter as “housing with minimal
supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless
person. No individual or household may be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay.” The
Colusa Zoning Code currently allows emergency shelters in the commercial and industrial zones, subject to
a CUP.
Pursuant to recent changes in State law (SB 2), jurisdictions with an unmet need for emergency shelters
are now required to identify a zone(s) where emergency shelters will be allowed as a permitted use without
a conditional use permit or other discretionary permit. The identified zone must have sufficient capacity to
accommodate the shelter need, and at a minimum provide capacity for at least one year-round shelter.
Permit processing, development and management standards for emergency shelters must be objective and
facilitate the development of, or conversion to, emergency shelters.
Pursuant to SB 2, conducted has conducted a staff level review of its zoning districts and determined
commercial zones are most conducive to provision of an emergency homeless shelter by right (the City
currently also allows shelters in Industrial zones via a conditional use permit).
City of Colusa                                                                               Housing Element

Parcels with commercial zoning are characterized by locations that lie generally on or within a block of the
major access routes through town (Highways SR45 and SR20). This location provides access to existing
transit routes as well as close walking distance to services and shopping. A review of potential sites with
the commercial zoning classification identifies few vacant parcels other than several indicated on the 4.85
acres indicated on Figure 9.1 (Vacant Land Inventory) but there are many underutilized parcels including
parcels zoned commercial but currently being used as warehouses or other more typically light-industrial
uses along Main Street and Market Street. The rehabilitation or upgrading of these parcel, especially in
conjunction with the newly-formed redevelopment district will provide adequate capacity for provision of an
emergency shelter. In addition, many existing structures could be adapted for emergency sheltersThe
City’s commercial zone development standards are appropriate to facilitate emergency shelters, and can be
summarized as follows:
        Front yard setback: no front setback is required, properties are encouraged to develop to the
         sidewalk
        Side yard setback: No side setbacks are required, other than as required due to fire and safety
         standards.
        Rear Yard Setback: no rear yard setbacks are required. Alley access is a common featuyre of
         commercial property in Colusa and most services are provided via the alley system.
        Height: the height limit in Colusa is 35 feet. This is common throughout the city and, so, this is not
         viewed as an impediment to development.
The newly-formed redevelopment district (2009) will be soon be generating funds that are targeted towards
affordable housing as well as upgrading the infrastructure in the commercial areas of Colusa and provides
an ideal opportunity to encourage the re-use of under-utilized commercial structures in the downtown and
historic districts
The City has included a program within the Housing Element to modify the Zoning Ordinance to permit
shelters in the commerical zones subject to the same development and management standards as other
permitted uses in the zone.
Farm Worker Housing
The City has no zone district specifically for the development of agricultural employee housing, although the
city continues to make efforts to attract affordable housing developments, which in some cases provide
homes to agricultural employees. For information regarding affordable housing developments in the City,
please refer to Housing Cost and Affordability in Section 2 of this element.
Single Room Occupancy
Single room occupancy units are small studio-type efficiency living units designed to provide living facilities
for one person. A building providing single room occupancy units would qualify as an apartment building
under the zoning ordinance and is allowed by right in the R-4 zone district and with securing of a conditional
use permit within all commercial and industrial zone districts.
NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Non-governmental constraints on the provision of affordable housing include the availability of financing and
interest rates, land costs, construction costs and the cost of rental housing.
Availability of Financing and Interest Rates
The availability of money or capital is a significant factor that can control both the cost and supply of
housing. Two types of capital affect the housing market: 1) capital used by developers for site preparation
and construction, and 2) capital for financing the purchase of units by homeowners and investors.
City of Colusa                                                                             Housing Element

In recent years, home builders and home buyers have enjoyed historically low interest rates and easily
available traditional and non-traditional financing. However, the real estate speculation coupled with liberal
lending practices and creative financing options have resulted in a high rate of foreclosures for under-
qualified and overextended borrowers. The result has been a drastic tightening of the credit markets and
lending practices. In 2003, the interest rate for a 30-year home loan in the State of California was 5.62
percent. Currently, the interest rate for a 30-year home loan is around 6.0 percent, but due to increased
scrutiny of the credit-worthiness of borrowers and the uncertainty in the real-estate market, it has become
far more difficult for prospective borrowers to qualify for a home loan.
The availability and cost of financing to local residents and/or developers in the City of Colusa is similar to
most other areas, as potential borrowers have access to many different local and non-local financing
institutions. As such, interest rates for loans taken out to purchase homes in the City of Colusa, and the
availability of such loans, depends largely on the credit-worthiness of the borrow. The tightening of lending
practices has reduced the availability of loans to persons less credit-worthy by the more conservative
lenders. While this can be viewed as a constraint to housing production, it may also be viewed as a return
to more responsible lending practices.
Under the current lending and economic environment, it can be challenging for Very Low, Low, and in some
cases even Moderate income first-time homebuyers to acquire sufficient savings and income to obtain to
provide for a down payment, qualify for a loan, pay closing costs, and make monthly mortgage, and tax and
insurance payments.
The city administers several financing programs to assist qualified low-income residents in financing home
purchases and housing rehabilitation. Currently, a consultant manages the CDBG Homebuyer Assistance
Program and the First Time Homebuyer Program (FTHB) for the City. These programs offer financing
assistance through deferred-payment loans for owner and investor purchase and rehabilitation of affordable
housing units. These programs have been particularly successful in rehabilitation and purchase of
affordable housing in the City and are discussed in greater detail in Section 9.7 of this element.
Land Costs
The approximate land cost for a 0.22-acre single-family residential lot in the downtown core area of the City
of Colusa in 2008 was approximately $40,000 to $50,000, based on estimates obtained from the Colusa
County Assessor’s Office (Cerney, 2008). This average figure is approximately 15 percent of the total land
and construction costs to build the example single-family home for which a cost estimate is given in Table
9.5-7. It should be noted that due to the economic situation of 2008, land values have decreased
consistent with the drop in home values throughout the region and it is unknown when the housing and
residential land market values will stabilize or rebound. It should also be noted that residential lot values
within the newer Country Club Estates subdivision are significantly higher than those in the downtown core.
The figures from the survey indicate that the costs for raw land in Colusa are relatively low when compared
to the average statewide figures. While land values are relatively low, a comparison of the example
development costs given in Table 9.5-7 below, with current market sales prices in the City indicates that
building homes in the City is currently unlikely to generate an acceptable return on investment. At the
present time, construction of traditional single-family housing in the City is unlikely to be pursued by for-
profit builders. The cost of raw land itself, coupled building labor and materials costs, the current weakness
in the economy, and the lack of availability of financing for construction are all factors contributing to
reduced profitability in residential property development in the City and the region. These factors combined
represent a significant constraint to new housing production in the City of Colusa.
Construction Costs
Construction data available from the US Census Bureau indicates that the average per square-foot contract
price in 2007 to construct a single family home in the western United States was $131.70. This is the price
to build the structure only and does not include land costs. According to local builders and building

department officials, this is considered a reasonable estimate of costs for construction of an average single-
family home in the City, although the cost per-square foot can vary widely depending on the quality of the
materials and craftsmanship used in construction.
U.S. Census data demonstrates an upward trend in construction costs from 2002 to 2007, with a single
year drop in construction costs from 2001 to 2002, which coincides with the brief recession experienced
during this time frame. It is anticipated that a similar downward correction in construction costs will occur
due to the current challenging economic climate. Discussions with local developers indicate that both the
cost of labor and materials for construction in the region have decreased in recent months. This is largely
the result of a decrease in prices for commodities used to manufacture construction materials as a result of
a reduction in global demand. The fall off in the pace of construction has resulted in increased competition
for contracts, leading to overall lower contract prices. The direct construction costs will continue to reflect
the economic situation of the day and, therefore, have a direct effect on the production of new housing.

     Represents costs to construct one single family residences. Economies of scale may be realized and substantially reduce
       overall per-unit project costs for multiple unit projects.
While no exact figures for multifamily construction costs in the City are readily available, a 39 unit, 92,347
square foot apartment complex constructed in Yuba City in 2007 had an estimated construction cost of
$8,709,818. This is equivalent to a per-unit cost of $223,329.Without subsidies, new single-family detached
residences are not considered affordable to low income households, but may be affordable to some households
in the moderate income category. Some new multifamily rental and purchase condominiums may also be
affordable to moderate income households. Reduction in amenities and use of low-quality building materials
can reduce the cost of construction and affect sales prices, but minimum building and safety standards must be
maintained. In certain cases, greater density can increase the affordability of residential projects by reducing
per-unit costs and associated land costs per unit.
In the current slumping economy and weak real estate market construction costs represent a real constraint
on the improvement and purchase of housing within the City of Colusa by affecting the ability for a builder to
profit from selling the units constructed or for a prospective home purchaser to bear the costs. This
constraint, however, lies largely outside the jurisdiction of the local government, being that it is largely
dependent on global demand for materials, labor market conditions, and the overall vigor of the real estate
market.

Environmental, Infrastructure, and Public Facilities Constraints
Environmental factors and a lack of necessary infrastructure or public facilities (e.g., water, sewer, roads,
etc.) can constrain residential development in a community by increasing costs and reducing the amount of
land suitable for housing construction. Environmental constraints such as flooding, sensitive biological
resources, and seismicity can also affect the costs associated with the maintenance, improvement, and
development of housing. Fortunately, no hazardous materials sites exist in the City that would constrain
residential development. This section discusses the most relevant of these constraints to housing
production in Colusa. It should be noted that Senate Bill 1087 requires water and sewer providers, in this
case the City of Colusa, to grant priority service to developments that include housing units affordable to
low income households.
Water Supply
The projected new housing in the City will not adversely affect the service capabilities for providing water to
Colusa residents. At present, the city’s water supply and treatment capacity are sufficient to meet the needs
of buildout within the city limits consistent with the General Plan. Water availability is not a constraint to
production of new housing units to meet the housing needs of the community identified by this element.
The City’s recently completed Water Master Plan (2009) has identified several deficiencies in the system
that could limit new development until additional capacity is added. An additional water well and treatment
system (or additional storage capacity) are required for any new development to be able to meet adequate
flow requirements.
Wastewater Facilities
The wastewater treatment system in the City of Colusa has been expanded and is no longer at its design
capacities, as indicated in the previous housing element. During the last planning period the modification of
the City’s wastewater treatment infrastructure was completed. With the new upgrades to the City’s
wastewater infrastructure, the capacities of this systems is not considered a constraint to the production of
housing in Colusa; however old six-inch clay collector lines in the old town proper (area bounded by Market,
Fremont, Bridge, and Tenth Streets) that are on a relatively flat slope and need replacement could as a
constraint to the development of new housing in that area of the City. The Wastewater Master Plan (2009)
has identified several possible constraints due to limited lift station capacity. All of the larger vacant sites
identified by the Land Inventory are affected by possible wastewater collection infrastructure deficiencies.
Drainage and Flooding
The Safety Element of the General Plan provides an expanded discussion of flooding and drainage issues
in the City. The Federal Emergency Management Agency designates the majority of the General Plan as
within Flood Zone X. Flood Zone X designates areas that are subject to flooding during a 500-year storm
event, or areas protected by levees from flooding during a 100-year storm event, and therefore exposed to
minimal danger from flooding.
Figure 5.1 of the Safety Element demonstrates that only land in the far southwestern portion of the City is
within the 100-year floodplain. This portion of the City is designated for Office Professional and Light
Industrial uses and is zoned light industrial (M-1) and public facilities (P-F). Residential uses are not
permitted within the P-F zone district and are permitted with issuance of a conditional use permit within the
M-1 district. This area is intended for non-residential uses and is not anticipated to be desirable for
residential development. The majority of the area is currently developed with an abandoned manufacturing
facility that was constructed on a raised building pad to avoid flooding issues. However, if residential
development were proposed within the identified portion of the 100-year floodplain, additional drainage and
flood-control measures would be required to ensure flood protection. Policies related to mitigating the risks
of flooding may be found in the Safety Element of the General Plan. This would represent a financial and
technical constraint to development of residential uses in this portion of the City.

The City of Colusa has historically had localized drainage and flooding problems on the east side of the City
during and immediately following high-intensity storm events; primarily due to antiquated surface drainage
systems. Large-scale new residential development within this area could therefore be subject to on and
offsite requirements to mitigate potential drainage and flooding impacts, although smaller scale projects
would be subject to standard drainage impact fees. Potential for increased design and construction costs
associated with drainage and flooding issues in the eastern portion of the downtown core residential area
could represent a constraint to housing production in this portion of the city.
As one of the proposed programs, the City will comply with AB 162 requires Colusa to update the flood
hazard information in the General Plan Safety Element, as well as related policies and programs in the
Safety, Conservation and Land Use elements, with this revision of the Housing Element.
Fair Housing Constraints
The provision of equal housing opportunities for all persons is an important goal of the Housing Element.
The City addresses complaints regarding fair housing issues through its Planning Department. City staff
monitors complaints and if necessary, refers fair housing matters to California Rural Legal Assistance, U. S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and/or the California Department of Fair
Employment and Housing in order to ensure that housing opportunities are open to all without regard to
race, color, age, sex, religion, national origin, family status, or physical handicap and to apprise the general
population regarding State and federal laws related to the provision of fair and equal housing opportunities
for all. In late 2007 a licensed community care facility was established in a single-family residential zone
district in the City to provide transitional housing to six or fewer adults. The City received several
complaints and the issue was placed as an information item on the agenda for a publicly noticed City
Council hearing. At hearing the operator of the facility and city staff explained to the interested public state
laws relating to the protection of such community care facilities and the obligation of the City to provide for
such uses within residential districts. This is one example of City action to ensure fair housing opportunities
within the City. Housing discrimination is not considered a significant constraint to the availability and
production of affordable housing in the City.
9.6 RESOURCES TO MEET HOUSING NEEDS
This section provides an analysis of the land and program resources available to facilitate the development,
rehabilitation, and preservation of affordable housing in the City of Colusa. Included is an evaluation of the
availability of land resources and financial and administrative resources available to support housing
activities. This section also identifies opportunities for energy conservation which can contribute to lower
overall housing costs by reducing utility expenses for all households.
LAND RESOURCES
Land Resources provides a discussion of the land available to provide for housing production in the City.
This includes an inventory of vacant sites available, including identification of the land use controls
applicable to each site, and a calculation of the capacity of the site for housing production.
Methodology
As part of the Housing Element update process, City staff inventoried all vacant and underdeveloped lands
within the City limits suitable for future residential development. Aerial photography and windshield surveys
were used to identify vacant parcels within the City limits that would provide opportunities for residential
housing development. Geographic information software and assessor’s parcel data was consulted to
determine the size of each parcel. The Zoning Ordinance and General Plan were then consulted to
determine the residential development potential of each parcel identified, based on applicable development
standards, general plan unit densities, and the size and potential development constraints of each parcel.

Residential Land Inventory
State law requires that the community provide an adequate number of sites to allow for and facilitate
production of the City’s regional share of housing. To determine whether the City has sufficient land to
accommodate its share of regional housing needs for all income groups, the City must identify “adequate
sites.” Under state law (California Government Code section 65583[c][1]), adequate sites are those with
appropriate zoning and development standards, with services and facilities, needed to facilitate and
encourage the development of a variety of housing for all income levels. The California Department of
Housing and Community Development, in its guidelines that interpret state law states that:
The locality’s sites are adequate if the land inventory demonstrates sufficient realistic capacity at
appropriate densities and development standards to permit development of a range of housing types and
prices to accommodate the community's share of the regional housing need by income level. A two-part
analysis is necessary to make this determination:
      1. Can the realistic development capacity of suitable land, which is or will be served by facilities and
          infrastructure, accommodate the locality’s total new construction need by income group over the
          next five years?
      2. Are these available sites appropriately zoned (considering local development standards and land
          costs) for a variety of housing types (single-family, multifamily, mobile homes, etc.) and at
          appropriate densities to facilitate the development of housing to meet the locality’s regional housing
          need by income level category, including the need for very low- and low-income households?
Residential sites identified in this chapter meet the criteria listed above, and are within the definition of
“adequate sites,” as provided under State law. Figure 9-1 illustrates the vacant land inventory within Colusa
city limits. The corresponding sites are identified in Table 9.6-1. These sites are considered available
vacant land because they have access to public facilities over the next five years.
The Residential Land Inventory section quantifies the amount of vacant land available in the City for future
development of all housing types; it provides an analysis of whether the inventory would be adequate to
meet the City’s identified housing need for the 2007-2014 planning period; and it identifies what actions will
be required by the City to help ensure adequate capacity is maintained.
As shown in Table 9.6-1, most of the vacant residential land is within the single-family residential zone
district (R-1). Primary development within the R-1 zone district would be single-family homes. Based on the
current single-family home prices in the City, it is assumed that single-family homes developed on these
lots would be affordable to households in the Moderate income category. With over 170 acres of R-1 zoned
vacant land available, it is clear that the City has sufficient vacant land available to meet the demand for
single-family homes over the planning period of this housing element.
The land inventory identified only a little over one (1) acre of land and three parcels within the Two-family
Residential zone district (R-2). This could provide for the construction of up to six units, assuming two units
per parcel identified. Although some of these may be available to those in the upper Low income category,
it is assumed that development on the R-2 zoned parcels would also be geared toward moderate income
households.
The land inventory identified no vacant land within the Neighborhood Apartment District (R-3) and only a
single 4-acre parcel (owned by the County) in the General Apartment District (R-4). This County-owned
parcel is tentatively being proposed as a site for a Transitional Housing shelter. Therefore there is no land
available in which a multi-family residential development would be permitted by right. This lack of
appropriately zoned land for multi-family development severely limits the potential for affordable housing
development within the City to meet the projected need for housing affordable to low and very low income
households as identified by the City’s RHNA housing allocation. Revision of the City’s zoning ordinance to
City of Colusa                                                                                Housing Element

element as a program that must be implemented to meet the city’s RHNA allocation.

The land inventory also identified 4.85 acres of vacant land within commercial zone districts. While some of
this land is identified for mixed residential and commercial land use by the General Plan, the zoning
ordinance still calls for a conditional use permit for any residential uses within the Commercial zone district.
Until the zoning ordinance is revised, commercially zoned land can not be dependably relied upon to
represent likely sites for affordable housing development. However, it should be noted that multi-family
residential development is permitted within all commercial and industrial zone districts with the approval of a
conditional use permit by the Planning Commission. As such, parcels within commercial zone districts were
identified by the land inventory as potential sites for housing development.

  002-280-002 may be rezoned to R-4 if City can work with the developers.
Pending Projects
Three residential subdivisions are currently being processed or have been approved within the existing City
limits. These three projects are discussed briefly below.
           Tennant Estates
A tentative subdivision map was approved in October 2005 for the proposed Tennant Estates subdivision,
which is located within the Colusa city limits, south of the downtown core, west of Wescott Road. The
project would divide the approximate 31.9-acre assessor’s parcel number 002-280-002 into 101-lot
residential lots. The lots, ranging in size from 8,000 to 16,087 square feet, are currently proposed to be
developed with single-family homes. Homes constructed are anticipated to be affordable to moderate to
above-moderate income groups. At the time of the writing of this housing element public improvement
plans for the project were under review by the City Engineer. No final map has been approved or
submitted for the Tennant Estates project. The City is working with an applicant to possibly make this an
multi-family affordable housing project.

August 2009

         White Parcel
The White Tentative Parcel Map was approved by the Planning Commission in 2006 and an extension of
the map was granted by the Planning Commission in 2008 to extend the life of the tentative parcel map to
July 25, 2009. The tentative parcel map proposes to divide assessor’s parcel number 001-183-007 into two
smaller parcels to allow for construction of two single-family homes. The homes would be expected to be
affordable to those in the moderate to above moderate income groups. A final subdivision map has been
approved for the property division and development.
Adequate Sites Analysis
The 2007 Colusa General Plan designates five Special Planning Areas (SPA) within the City’s Sphere of
Influence that have been identified as unique planning areas that could provide substantial new growth and
redevelopment opportunities for the City (the boundaries of these SPAs are shown in Figure 2.4 General
Plan). However, with the recent downturn in the economy, three development proposals that were
considered active housing projects within these SPAs are now dormant and not expected to be developed
within the timeframe of this Housing Element update.            The only potentially viable project is Colusa
Riverbend (Phase I) in SPA 4 – the only proposal that is currently within the City limits. This 77-acre
development proposes up to 397 single-family homes within the City’s designation of 3-8 units per acre for
this property. The western portion of the site contains a smaller area of land designated for medium-density
residential development consistent with the General Plan’s density range of 8-12 units per acre. The City is
currently working with an affordable housing developer to determine the potential for a multi-family housing
development similar to Colusa Del Rey apartment project.
Emergency Shelters and Transitional Housing
The City’s zoning ordinance allows for transitional housing or homeless shelters to be established in
residential zones to facilitate the needs of persons or families lacking shelter. In 2008, Colusa County
began a project in partnership with the City to construct one 19-bed transitional housing facility in a single-
family residential zone district in the City of Colusa. Pursuant to state law, the City allows licensed group
homes for six or fewer individuals, including those providing a residence for those in a transitional housing
situation, by right in all residential zone districts. The City has an abundance of vacant and developed
single-family property to provide sites to satisfy any need for emergency or transitional housing. The City
currently allows group homes for seven or more individuals in residential districts subject to obtaining a use
permit. Implementation Program H-2 (Zoning Ordinance Review and Update) will focus on specifying the
appropriate zone, such as R-4, and moving toward performance-based standards that can facilitate
construction of this type of special needs housing.
Affordable Housing for all Income Groups
The land inventory identified no vacant land within the Neighborhood Apartment District (R-3) or the
General Apartment District (R-4). This lack of land zoned to accommodate multi-family development by
right severely limits the potential for affordable housing to be constructed in the City to assist in meeting the
City’s RHNA allocation for very low and low income units. The City’s recently adopted General Plan
identifies an area for high density residential development east of Highway 20/45 on the east side of the
City. While designated by the General Plan for high density development, this area is within a Single-
Family residential zone district. Revision of the City’s zoning ordinance to correct this inconsistency
between the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance is a top city priority and will provide nearly 30 acres of
additional land appropriately zoned to permit multifamily development by right.
The City also intends to include new zone districts in the revised Zoning Ordinance that would allow for
smaller residential lots. The provision of smaller residential lots would provide for increased residential
densities to accommodate single family residential development affordable to low to moderate income
City of Colusa                                                                                Housing Element

households. Update to the Zoning Ordinance is identified in this housing element as Implementing Action
H-2 to meet the city’s RHNA allocation.
The City currently has no adopted ordinance relating specifically to the permitting of Second Residential
Units and relies on liberal criteria for approval of second units provided in California Government Code
§65852.2. State law dictates that second units within residential zone districts must be approved
ministerially and without a formal hearing. The City of Colusa reviews applications for second units for
compliance with setbacks, lot coverage, and other development standards set forth in the Zoning
Ordinance. If development standards are met, the second unit is approved. The City of Colusa has many
larger residential lots that could provide adequate area for the construction of second units in compliance
with Zoning Ordinance development standards. Although second units are not an easily quantifiable source
of new affordable housing stock, construction of second units could provide some of the affordable housing
needs within the City. Programs within this Housing Element serve to make property owners aware of the
potential investment opportunity of second units and in turn promote construction of more second units
within the City.
Adequate Sites Determination
Housing element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made available through
appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the development of various types of housing
for all economic segments of the population. This includes single-family housing, multifamily housing,
manufactured housing, mobile homes, emergency shelters, transitional housing, and farm worker housing,
among others. Table 9.5-2 identifies the housing types permitted, by right and through issuance of a use
permit, within each zoning district within the City. General Plan land use designations and densities, as well
as zone districts were considered in determining the availability of sites suitable for production of housing
types to satisfy the need for a variety of housing types to meet the needs within each income category, as
identified in the City’s RHNA allocation for the planning period.
The City of Colusa did not identify adequate sites available to accommodate the regional housing need in
the prior planning period. Pursuant to Chapter 614, Statutes of 2005 (AB 1233), the City must, within the
first year of the planning period of the new housing element, zone or rezone adequate sites to
accommodate the unaccommodated portion of the regional housing need allocation (RHNA) from the prior
planning period. Although the City could credit units built in the previous planning period, conservatively,
the unaccommodated need from the previous planning period is a total of 290 units with 114 for lower
income households. :
As shown in Table 9.6-1, the City has an abundance of sites available for single-family and two-family
(duplex) residential development. These sites would adequately meet the unaccommodated need and
projected need for housing affordable to moderate and above moderate income households, as specified
by the City’s RHNA allocation.
The land inventory identified no vacant land within the Neighborhood Apartment District (R-3) or the
General Apartment District (R-4). These districts represent the appropriate zoning district for the
development of multifamily housing that would be affordable to lower income households. With no
available land within these zoning districts, there is effectively no land in the City on which a multi-family
residential development would be permitted by right. Existing zoning precludes the City from meeting the
projected need for housing affordable to low and very low income households, as identified by the City’s
RHNA housing allocation, without issuance of a Conditional Use Permit for multifamily development within
Commercial or Industrial zone districts. Presently, the City can not demonstrate adequate sites to meet the
City’s unaccommodated need and RHNA allocation for low income housing. In the absence of multifamily
housing on the Colusa Riverbend Phase I site, or the Tennant Estates site, a rezone to R-4 must occur
order for the City’s to identify adequate sites to meet its RHNA allocation. Therefore, revision of the City’s
zoning ordinance to provide sufficient land that is appropriately zoned to permit multifamily development by
right is identified in Section 9.8 of this housing element (see Implementing Action H-2).

The primary focus for potential rezoning will be land that has been identified in the General Plan Land Use
Diagram map as being appropriate for higher density, either medium density residential or high density
residential, but that is currently zoned for single family residential. These lands include approximately 8
acres of the proposed Riverbend project (portion of 002-270-008) and 8 parcels listed on Table 9.6-1
“Inventory of Vacant Parcels and Unit Development Capacity.” In total, if all of these parcels were to be
rezoned to R-3 or R-4 there would be approximately 88 acres of land zoned for higher density development.
At a mid-point density of 12 gross units per acre, this would translate to a total of over 1,000 units that could
be available for lower-income households.
PROGRAM RESOURCES
City Efforts to Meet Housing Needs
The City maintains existing programs and intends to implement new programs to facilitate production of
housing units to meet the needs identified in the City’s RHNA allocation. These programs are identified
below. The discussion below describes local, State, and federal programs, as well as private programs,
that are available to promote the production of housing affordable to all income levels within the City.
Implementation Programs H-6 (State and Federal Programs) and H-7 (Local Finance Programs) in Section
9.8 of this Housing Element commits to the City to pursue these programs for the purpose of assisting
affordable housing development.
Local Resources
Redevelopment Agency
At present the City has no Redevelopment Agency established to take advantage of tax-increment
financing that is made available through provisions of the State Community Redevelopment Law, although
it is actively investigating creation of a Redevelopment Agency and identifying a redevelopment area. The
City recently completed a redevelopment feasibility study to determine whether the establishment of a
redevelopment agency and plan area could be viable. If so, the City plans to prepare and implement a
Redevelopment Plan to rehabilitate and revitalize the commercial and residential structures in Colusa. The
City will use all potential sources of public and private housing funding for repairs and upgrades. With
implementation, 20 percent of the tax increment generated by the Redevelopment Agency’s program will go
into a Redevelopment Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Fund.
Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) Compliance
Federal law requires that lending institutions reinvest in their communities. Such reinvestment is often done
in the form of low-income loans for housing construction or rehabilitation, participation in activities of the
Redevelopment Agency, or other investment in housing. The City may seek to establish programs for
financing of construction or lending for home purchase to help lending institutions to meet their
requirements under CRA.

assistance to eligible homebuyers in purchasing homes in the City by providing deferred payment second
mortgages at 2% simple interest to provide for financing of appropriate down payments and closing costs of
affordable housing units that will be occupied by the homebuyers. The primary loan is required to be a
fixed interest rate loan with a term of no more than 30 years. The deferred program loan is due upon sale
of the purchase property, although the borrower has the option to pre-pay the loan amount at any time.
First-Time Homebuyer Assistance and Owner Occupied Housing Rehabilitation
The First Time Homebuyer Program (FTHB) is administered by the City and is a special low-interest,
deferred-payment loan program designed to provide second mortgages of up to 50% of the purchase price
or maximum subsidy limit, whichever is lower. This program is funded through the State of California’s
HOME Program. Applicants for funding must demonstrate financial need and obtain pre-approval for a first
mortgage; the second mortgage is then financed on a shared net appreciation basis with repayment due
upon sale or transfer of title or when borrower no longer occupies the home as his/her principal residence.
The City’s Housing Rehabilitation Program, funded through the Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG) and State HOME Funds (grant and program income) has been successful in rehabilitating existing
housing. The program distributes loans to qualifying low-income owner- and tenant-occupied households
to achieve cost-effective repairs. Priority is accorded to health and safety needs, followed by energy
conservation needs, extension of the unit’s useful life, and making the unit compliant with the Uniform
Building Code. For non-mobile units the maximum loan amount is up to 90% of owner’s equity in the home
or maximum subsidy limits, whichever is lower. For mobile homes, the maximum loan amount is $7,500.
Loans for single-family owner-occupied costs can be deferred or financed as a three-percent-interest
amortized loan; loans for mobile homes are finances at two-percent. Owner-investors are offered three-
percent fixed amortized loans for rehabilitation contingent on a recorded rental affordability agreement.
While lending practices have tightened considerably in the past year, loans are still available to credit-
worthy individuals for home purchase. Additionally, recent action by the federal government to encourage a
loosening in the credit markets is expected to result in increased loan availability. The availability of
financing to all income groups within the community at market interest rates is therefore not considered a
constraint to housing purchase or production.
To ensure that lack of housing for California’s work force does not derail economic activity in the State, the
Department of Housing and Community Development offers several housing programs. These programs
would be available to persons in the City of Colusa who meet the eligibility requirements of each program.
State programs include the following:
Infill Incentive Grant (IIG) Program
The IIG Program provides funds for infrastructure improvements necessary to facilitate new infill housing
development.
Housing Related Parks (Parks) Program
The Housing Related Parks Program creates incentives and rewards cities and counties with documented
housing starts for newly constructed units affordable to very low- or low-income households with grant
funds, which can be used to create new parks or rehabilitate or improve existing parks.
Local Housing and Trust (LHTF) Program
The LHTF helps finance local housing trust funds dedicated to the creation or preservation of affordable
housing. The program provides matching grants (dollar-for-dollar) to local housing trust funds that are
funded on an ongoing basis from private contributions or public sources that are not otherwise restricted in
use for housing programs.

and a local homeless advocate. The group is working to secure funding for additional homeless shelter and
meals through the ARRA grant program.
RESIDENTIAL ENERGY CONSERVATION
The cost of energy for home heating and cooling and appliances contributes to the total cost of housing
borne by each household, whether renters or owners. Promotion of greater energy efficiency for housing is
therefore one way that a local government can effectively contribute to a lowering of housing costs. As
energy costs have risen, energy conservation has come to be an integral part of housing policy. Local
agencies can promote energy efficiency through accommodating passive an active solar design, diligently
enforcing energy efficiency measures contained in the building code, promoting energy efficiency
awareness, and through the design and environmental review process for new projects.
The City’s Building Department enforces the recently adopted 2007 California Energy Building Code (Title
24) through its plan-checking and building inspection procedure. These regulations ensure minimum levels
of wall, ceiling, and floor insulation, maximum glazing area, minimum glazing U-values, and air conditioner
and water heating system efficiencies to reduce energy consumption.
The City’s Planning Department encourages passive solar measures, such as strategic tree placement, by
providing comments in response to site and building plans submitted. Other measures include using CDBG
or other grant funded housing rehabilitation, which includes measures to bring homes to current building
code standards for weatherization and energy efficiency of appliances and insulation for low-income
households. It should also be noted that photovoltaic arrays for active solar electricity generation are
treated no differently than any other structures by the City’s zoning ordinance, thereby promoting ease of
permitting this energy saving technology.
The Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the City’s primary energy provider, also has a number of programs
to provide home energy audits, as well as monetary incentives for installation and retrofit of energy
conserving home improvements. Information about these programs is distributed in monthly billing
statements from PG&E.
Energy conservation is also addressed through the City’s environmental review process. The Negative
Declaration or Environmental Impact Report for a development project would identify impacts associated
with inefficient energy use and require mitigation measures as necessary to reduce the impacts identified.
The opportunities for energy conservation discussed above have been incorporated into programs that are
identified in this element. The California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) is an energy discount program
and the primary sources of monetary savings to Colusa customers. A detailed description of the CARE
Program is given in Chapter 9.7, Implementing Actions Defined.

9.8        IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS DEFINED
Each of the following actions would be used, wherever appropriate, to implement the goals and policies of
Colusa’s Housing Element. As a requirement of State Housing Law, each of the implementing actions
would be assigned “Responsibility, Time Frame, and Funding Source(s)” within the Housing Element. Also
included would be the City’s Quantified Objectives for each implementing action, as appropriate.
H-1        General Plan Implementation
(PROPOSED)
The City will ensure that residential development projects are consistent with the goals and policies of its
General Plan and that there is internal consistency between the Housing Element and the rest of the
General Plan. An annual evaluation of the General Plan will comprise the City’s monitoring program for the
Housing Element. This will include a review of the progress toward achieving Housing Element objectives
by the City and other responsible agencies and departments—meeting timing and funding commitments for
implementing actions, as well as the number of housing units provided or other measurable indicators
achieved for each measure that has been put into place.
            Responsible Agency:                      City Manager, Planning, Public Works,
                                                     Engineering and Finance Departments,
                                                     Planning Commission and City Council
            Time Frame:                              Annually, beginning October 2008
            Funding Source(s):                       General Fund, Developer Fees
H-2        Zoning Ordinance Review and Update
(PROPOSED)
To ensure that the Zoning Ordinance works in conjunction with General Plan policies to achieve housing
and other City objectives, the City will review and update its Zoning Ordinance immediately and at least
once every two years after 2010. During this cycle, particular attention will be paid to rezoning land from
low- or medium-density (R-1 and R-2) to higher density (R-3 and R-4) in order to bring the General Plan
Land Use designations into conformance with the zoning map and to increase the amount of adequate
sites available for affordable housing development to address a shortfall of capacity for 204 units and
unaccommodated need of 114 units affordable to lower income households. The City will rezone parcels
referenced in Table 9.6-1, ensure rezoned sites permit at least 16 units per site and seek to rezone 3-10
acre sites to facilitate the development of housing affordable to lower income households. Further,
rezoned sites will permit owner-occupied or rental multifamily residential use without a CUP, planned unit
development permit or other discretionary review and require a minimum density of 16 units per acre.
The Zoning Ordinance will be amended to encourage that a stipulated percentage of the units in proposed
multi-family developments containing 20 or more units, excluding elderly housing, be three or four bedroom
units, in order to provide for the housing needs of large families. Multi-family developments will be reviewed
on a project-by-project basis and the City will apply conditions of approval where warranted.
Revisions will also be made to the Zoning Ordinance’s development standards, as appropriate, to promote
flexibility in densities and uses, along with incentives for affordable housing production with attention given
to senior housing; this will include relaxation of parking standards for residential units in the downtown
mixed use area and incorporate State requirements according to the City’s objectives regarding the

production of affordable housing in the form of mobile homes and other manufactured dwellings. The
ordinance update will also ensure that quasi-public housing (e.g., nursing homes) can be accommodated in
the City. Additionally, the ordinance will be revised to ensure that zoning accommodates housing to meet
farmworker households’ needs,, including amending zoning as appropriate consistent with Health and
Safety Code Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6. The revision will also include adoption of a Second Unit
Ordinance in accordance with AB 1866 .
SB 2 Requirements
        Add transitional housing and supportive housing within the codes definition section, and list as
         permitted uses within residential zone districts subject only to those restrictions that apply to other
         residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
        Identification of emergency shelters as a permitted use without a conditional use permit or other
         discretionary action in commercial zones and only subject shelters to the same development and
         management standards that apply to other allowed uses within the identified zone.
Emergency shelters will be subject to the same development and management standards as other
permitted uses in commercial zones. In addition, the City will develop written, objective standards for
emergency shelters to regulate the following, as permitted under SB 2:
        The maximum number of beds/persons permitted to be served nightly;
        Off-street parking based on demonstrated need, but not to exceed parking requirements for other
         residential or commercial uses in the same zone;
        The size/location of exterior and interior onsite waiting and client intake areas;
        The provision of onsite management;
        The proximity of other emergency shelters, provided that emergency shelters are not required to be
         more than 300 feet apart;
        The length of stay;
        Lighting;
        Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation.

H-3      Subdivision Ordinance Review and Update
(PROPOSED)
The City is presently undertaking a review and update of the Subdivision Ordinance. Along with updated
subdivision standards, the review will consider regulatory concessions that can help reduce the costs of
affordable housing development while balancing basic environmental, health, and safety needs. While
reducing allowable lot sizes can contribute substantially to a reduction in total housing costs (i.e., lower per-
unit land and infrastructure improvement costs due to higher densities), the vast majority of single-family
residential lots are already at a minimum size to allow single-family residential units. The Subdivision
Ordinance should be reviewed and revised, if necessary with regard to multi-family unit conversion for
rental to for-purchase housing (i.e., condominiums).

H-4      Public Works Improvement Standards
(EXISTING)
In 2007, the City adopted a set of Public Works Improvement Standards for the purpose of establishing
minimum standards for the design and construction of public works improvements. These standards would
apply to and regulate all improvements to be dedicated to the public and/or accepted by the City for
operation and maintenance, as well as improvements constructed in accordance with an agreement
between the City and a developer, including improvements that may be associated with entitlements
approved by the City. These standards, addressing street improvements, grading/erosion control
requirements, tree removal, water supply, sewage disposal, on- and offsite drainage and flooding, main
sizes for fire hydrants, and utilities, will be established in a manner that encourages the creation of housing,
minimizes impacts on the cost and supply of housing, and maximizes land resources.

The City will pursue installing an electronic record-keeping system for the purpose of tracking new
construction housing rehabilitation, and reconstruction. There are multiple software options that are
available. Identification of funding and staff resources for maintenance and update of electronic records will
provide easier access to data by staff and the public.

H-6      State and Federal Programs
(EXISTING)
The City will actively pursue funding through various state and federal programs. The City will submit grant
applications at every available cycle or when NOFA’s are published, depending on the availability of
funding, Colusa’s eligibility for such funding, and the applicability of the programs for use in Colusa projects
according to its housing needs. State and federal programs include:
             BEGIN (federal)
             CalHome Program (federal)
             Community Development Block Grant (federal)

The City will seek and pursue funding opportunities and prioritize local resources as available to assist in
the development and rehabilitation of housing for extremely low-income households. As part of seeking
funding and working with stakeholders, the City will at least annually evaluate funding and alternatives for
incentives such as fee waivers, priority processing and facilitating entitlements to assist in the development
of housing for extremely low-income households.

H-8      Capital Improvement Program
(PROPOSED)
The City will develop a five-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) for all City public capital projects. The
CIP will identify priorities, funding sources, and timing for design, construction, and operations. The City will
use the CIP to ensure that adequate public facilities are provided in order to accommodate the projected
housing production anticipated in all elements of the General Plan. The CIP will be developed in
conjunction with the City budget, and will cover a period of five years from its inception. The CIP will be
reviewed, amended, and adopted with the budget on an annual or biannual basis, as applicable. The CIP
will include Redevelopment and grant-funded projects, as funds become available, as well as projects
funded from local revenue sources.

H-9      Development Agreements
(EXISTING)
The City will use development agreements as a means of ensuring compliance for those development
projects that are subject to affordability requirements. These agreements will identify (1) the number of
affordable units to be constructed, (2) the unit sales or rental price, (3) the income group to whom the units
will be affordable, and (4) the length of time the units will remain affordable. It is anticipated that these
development agreements will be a key tool to foster affordable housing in future projects, particularly for the
undeveloped lands in large property holdings. Annual monitoring will be critical to ensure that the
requirements of the agreements are being met as these developments proceed. The monitoring should take
place as a part of the development process; for example, final maps should reflect phasing schedules
spelled out in the agreements for a variety of housing types and lot sizes.
                             Unit size                     Household size

                   Two bedrooms                 4.0 persons  per household
                   Three bedrooms               6.0 persons  per household
                   Four bedrooms                8.0 persons  per household
If adequate subsidies are not available to assist in achieving the 10% affordable housing requirement at the
time of project construction, additional time may be given for the City and the developer to assemble the
necessary financing.
In all cases where in-lieu fees are used as an alternative to producing affordable units, the Planning
Department will review the projects based on (1) good faith effort by the owner to use all available
subsidies, and (2) the type of project and its ability to absorb the affordable units.
The City will annually review all development agreements for compliance with affordability provisions. Any
property owner who fails to comply with the requirements of a development agreement may be found by the
City Council to be in default of the agreement.

H-10     Development Review
(PROPOSED UPDATE)
The City will use the development review and environmental review processes, in accordance with the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA, to ensure that development projects comply with affordable
housing policies and are consistent with proposed development agreements, ordinance revisions, and other
applicable regulations. Early consultation between project applicants and the Project Development Review
(PDR) committee, followed by recommendations to the Planning Commission, of projects that are proposed
to meet special housing needs (e.g., elderly, large families, persons with disabilities, etc.) will incorporate
special housing needs guidelines (see H-21 below) by examining zoning and permit procedures, as well as
the appropriateness of applicable site development standards, and whether they may need to be relaxed
(e.g., parking requirements) to facilitate development, if determined not to be detrimental to the public
health and safety.
Since a conditional use permit is not required in the R-3 or R-4 zone districts, the City’s Development
Review process would be limited to review by the Planning Department as long as it meets the City’s
zoning requirements, site development standards, and design guidelines for a multi-family project of this
size.
The Development Review process will also replace the variance application process when considering
approval of special accommodations for persons with disabilities, as determined necessary by City staff and
demonstrated by the property owner or project developer. The result will be a streamlining of multi-family
project approval and special housing accommodations for persons with disabilities—the time required for
application processing will be shortened and the more complex discretionary findings that are typically
required for a conditional use permit or variance will be removed. Affordable multi-family housing projects
may be reviewed and approved ministerially by the Planning Director in order to streamline the approval
process and eliminate delays caused by typical CUP approval timelines. Market-Rate projects proposing
more than six units would continue to be reviewed under the conditional use permit process.

provide a property owner with the ability to increase the income and, therefore, the value of a property by
allowing the developer to build a few more income-producing units than allowed under the base zoning.
This increased income then can be used to help subsidize below-market rental rates for very low- and low-
income households and to purchase housing for middle-income households.

H-12     Development Impact Fees
(TO BE UPDATED)
The City will continue to collect and adjust all of the City’s development impact fees, including sewer and
water equalization fees for water and wastewater facilities; and Quimby park fees. The fee schedule will
identify conditions under which affordable housing impact fees may be waived, deferred or reduced with the
affordable housing development projects. As part of a Fee Structure review (H-22), affordable housing
impact fees will be waived, deferred or reduced, as compared with the development of standard housing so
as to provide incentive for affordable housing development. An in-lieu fee program for affordable housing
will be established. This program will provide an alternative to onsite construction of (inclusionary)
affordable units, as deemed appropriate by the City. Other fees will be reviewed and brought current, as
determined necessary.

H-13     Specific Plans/Planned Developments
(PROPOSED)
The City may require specific plans and/or Planned Development Implementation Plans (PDIPs) that
consist of Development Standards, Design Guidelines and an Implementation/Phasing Plan to ensure
consistency with the goals and policies of the General Plan, particularly with regard to the Community
Character and Design Element. Specific Plans and PDIPs, along with development agreements, will
identify programs to be implemented to meet the 10% affordable housing requirement. Development
Agreements will provide for mixed-use development, wherever feasible, to help achieve the City’s
affordable housing objectives. The agreements will specify types of units, income ranges, and parcel-by-
parcel obligations. The agreements will describe strategies, including landowner obligations, funding, and
subsidies. A provision for payment of in-lieu fees may be included, if appropriate.
An adjunct component of this program would be Specific Plans for the historic downtown and Highway
20/45, designated a Scenic Corridor in the General Plan. These plans will provide developers with intended
land uses, design guidelines, development standards and possible financing mechanisms for these two key
commercial corridors within the City limits.

(PROPOSED)
The City recently completed a redevelopment feasibility study to determine whether the establishment of a
redevelopment agency and plan area could be viable. If so, the City plans to prepare and implement a
Redevelopment Plan to rehabilitate and revitalize the commercial and residential structures in Colusa. The
City will use all potential sources of public and private housing funding for repairs and upgrades. With
implementation, 20 percent of the tax increment generated by the Redevelopment Agency’s program will go
into a Redevelopment Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Fund.

The City will adopt Design Guidelines for development of duplexes and small-scale multi-family units in
addition to other flexible housing designs. The guidelines will consider building orientation, ceiling height,
street layout, lot design, landscaping, and street tree configuration in subdivision review for the purposes of
solar access and energy/water conservation. Particular attention will be paid to avoiding architectural
barriers that could adversely affect disabled persons. The Design Guidelines will incorporate those

recommended in the proposed Riverfront District Master Plan (see H-17 below) and any future specific
plans, as proposed in H-13 above.
The design review process, as a component of project review, will be carried out either as ministerial or
discretionary review, according to project type. The process will encourage innovative housing types and
design, and to allow mobile homes and factory-built housing with permanent foundations that also meet all
design review requirements to be placed on residentially zoned parcels, pursuant to zoning and design
review requirements.
Finally, design reviews will be used to ensure that historic structures are retained. The Planning
Commission will create a historic district so that the design review process can be applied to the identified
structures and to allow for the application of the State’s Historic Building Code.

institutions for construction, rehabilitation and/or purchase of affordable housing.
The City will promote and publicize the availability of funding for housing rehabilitation loans and grants
(when additional CDBG/HOME funds are acquired) through the local media, mailings to property owners
within targeted areas, and mailings to local contractors and developers. Section 8 information and other
housing information and referral services offered by Mercy Housing California and Colusa County
Department of Health and Human Services for persons seeking affordable rental and purchase housing will
be made available at City Hall.
The City, in conjunction with Colusa County Department of Health and Human Services, will publicize
information on fair housing laws, including tenant and landlord rights, and refer all complaints to the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the California Department of Fair Employment
and Housing. Information on state and federal fair housing laws will be made available at City Hall and will
be mailed to rental property owners, lenders, and real estate agents in the community.
The above information will be distributed through the City (written brochures in English/Spanish at City Hall
and on the City’s website), as well as service and outreach agencies, as appropriate. In some cases,
education may occur as part of public meetings, presentations to the community, and/or articles published
in the local newspaper, particularly efforts to target community opposition to affordable housing projects and
remove negative perceptions..

H-19      Public/Private Partnerships
(EXISTING)
The City will continue to work closely with the business and development communities toward achieving the
City’s affordable housing goal. The City has identified the following specific roles in this partnership to
provide affordable housing:
          City of Colusa - The City will maximize potential funds available through existing state, federal,
          and local programs for its affordable housing program.
          Development Community - The City will encourage private developers and property owners to
          cooperate in financing water and sewer facilities expansion as a means of facilitating development.
          Local Lending Institutions – The City will work with local lending institutions to maximize private
          financing for the construction of new low- and moderate-income housing.
          Housing Development Corporations - The City will work with non-profit and for-profit housing
          development corporations specializing in housing for various special needs groups to
          accommodate housing that meets the needs of these groups. This includes CFY Development, the
          builder of Colusa Del Rey Apartments, and Mercy Housing California. The City will identify the
          needs of these housing groups that can be met by the City to facilitate development of units
          affordable to low- and very low-income households. If there is for facilities that provide a continuum
          of care for senior residents of Colusa such as those provided by Eskaton (e.g., independent living

          units with common dining facilities, assisted care facilities, and skilled nursing facilities), the City will
          work closely with affordable housing groups to eliminate governmental constraints (e.g., reduce
          fees, provide flexibility in development standards, etc.) to ensure that this type of housing can be

operators. Furthermore, the City of Colusa will cooperate with Colusa County in the 1) development of
transportation options that better meet the needs of seniors; 2) study of in-home & visitation care issues for
seniors; 3) exploration of demand for a continuum of care facility (i.e., independent living, assisted living,
and skilled nursing) in Colusa and/or nearby communities; 4) and provision of opportunities for cooperative
housing.
The City will also work with other jurisdictions in the region to identify the need for homeless shelters.

H-21      Special Housing Needs Guidelines
(PROPOSED)
The City will conduct an assessment of its special housing needs based on its current housing stock and
the number of persons with special housing needs as identified in Census 2000. This assessment will
serve as the basis for development of Special Housing Needs Guidelines to assist with the development, as
determined by need, of senior housing that includes a continuum of care, group homes for persons with
disabilities, rental units for large families (3+ bedrooms), and housing for seasonal and permanent farm
worker households. The Guidelines program will ensure necessary review and revision to the Zoning
Ordinance (H-2) to promote and facilitate a variety of housing types to meet these needs, including modular
units, mobile homes, group quarters, seasonal cottages, multi-family units and small single-family dwellings.
The citywide goal will be based on the percentage of special housing needs groups as reported by Census
2000 and the proposed assessment.
Review and revision of the zoning ordinance will specifically address the development, maintenance and
improvement of housing for persons with disabilities. The City will adopt site improvement standards that

do not constrain housing for persons with disabilities (H-4), including provisions to reduce parking
requirements, if reduced need is demonstrated. The City will review and revise its permit procedures and
participate in housing programs (H-5, H-6, and H-18). The City will also include applicable provisions in the
Special Housing Needs Guidelines. All of these actions will facilitate the construction and/or conservation of
special needs housing. The guidelines will be applied, as appropriate, during the development review
process.
The City will formalize a process for reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities (and their
designated representatives) to ensure the process facilitates the development, maintenance, and
improvement of housing for persons with disabilities, including minimizing public hearings, and reviewing
and revising decision-making criteria to ensure consistency with fair housing regulations. The City will
make information available to the public about its formal reasonable-accommodation process.
The City’s proposed public/private partnerships (H-19) and interagency coordination (H-20) will also be
integrated into these guidelines. To make the construction of these units financially feasible, the City will
assist private developers, non-profit housing corporations, and farm worker housing developers, wherever
possible.     This assistance would include efforts to identify potential developers, assist with site
identification, facilitate the approval process, and support funding applications to provide development
subsidies (low-cost financing, land write-downs, or other incentives).

2) fees and revenues are adequate but not more costly than necessary. Development impact fees may be
waived, deferred or reduced, as compared with the development of standard housing, to the greatest extent
feasible, so as to provide incentive for affordable housing development. This will include an informal survey
of comparable jurisdictions in the region.

requirements, including energy conservation and handicapped accessibility. This will include periodically
review of the codes, in light of technological advances and changing public attitude, for possible
amendments to reduce housing construction costs, without sacrificing basic health and safety
considerations.
The update would incorporate the provisions of the State Historical Building Code, a statute within the
Health and Safety Code. The California Historical Building Code consists of regulations adopted pursuant
to Building Standards law—Part 8 of Title 24 of California's Code of Regulations, and Chapter 34, Division II
of the California Building Code. Such standards and regulations will facilitate the restoration or change of
occupancy so as to preserve their original or restored elements and historical features, to encourage
energy conservation and a cost effective approach to preservation, and to provide for reasonable safety
from fire or other hazards for occupants and users of these buildings and to remove physical barriers that
can facilitate reasonable availability and usability by the persons with disabilities.

H-26     Government Code Section 65853
(ENACTED BY STATUTE)
As provided for in Government Code Section 65853, the City will allow the installation of manufactured
homes certified under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974
on a foundation system, pursuant to Section 18551 of the Health and Safety Code, on lots zoned for
conventional single-family residential dwellings. While the project will be subject to architectural review, the
manufactured home and the lot on which it is placed will be held to the same development standards as
those for a conventional single-family residential dwelling on the same lot.

H-27     Assisting “At-Risk” Units
(PROPOSED)
To protect its at-risk units, the City will contact all state and federal agencies that might provide affordable
housing funds to determine whether any funding is available for future preservation of assisted housing
developments. The City will work with non-profit housing providers to apply for affordable housing subsidies
that may be available for this use, if necessary in the future. The City will also establish procedures (see
below) to prevent the displacement of low income residents from assisted housing units that may convert to
market rate housing in the future.
    a) Regularly monitor the complexes, which are on State or Federal inventories of at- risk units, and
         any other new units, which are built in the future.
    b) Coordinate informational meetings with public agencies, non-profit organizations, and other entities
         with previous experience or chartered responsibilities, to deal with housing related issues.
    c) Establish review procedures for determining adequacy, and selecting designated groups to
         collaborate with the City in addressing the preservation of units that might become at-risk.
    d) Develop a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) format, which solicits the background as well as
         organizational structure of interested entities with no previous experience with the City in other
         community programs.
    e) Adopt a Preservation Strategies Plan, which will focus on the methods of evaluation and processes
         to address in retaining various types of affordable housing.
    f)   Review, and amend if necessary, the City's active housing programs, with the intention of further
         expanding the effort and dedication to maintaining the existing affordable housing stock as a source
         of continuing low income housing in the City.

H-29     Unfair Housing Practices Grievance Procedure/Equal Housing Opportunity
(PROPOSED)
The protection of equal housing opportunities for all persons is an essential component of the City’s
housing program. As a small jurisdiction with limited staffing resources, the City’s Planning Department
would typically be alerted to issues related to equal housing through receipt of complaints. Depending on
the complaint, Planning Department staff may contact property owners via letter or telephone, or refer the
complainant to the California Rural Legal Assistance, U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) and/or the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. City staff also makes an effort to
post information regarding fair housing issues in City Hall and educate those facing equal-housing issues
on a case by case basis as complaints are received.
The City will adopt a formal policy statement prohibiting discriminatory and unfair housing practices within
the City. The City will establish a procedure by which aggrieved parties can notify the City of unfair housing
practices and the City can follow through by contacting the appropriate local, state, or federal agencies.

H-30     Monitoring Program
(PROPOSED)
The City does not currently have a formal monitoring program to review progress toward meeting the
housing goals identified in the housing element. Implementing action H-30 will establish a formal annual
monitoring program in Colusa to report to the Planning Commission and City Council on progress toward
meeting the goals identified in the Housing Element. The monitoring program also calls for City staff to
conduct an annual analysis of governmental constraints (e.g., land use controls, building codes, site
improvement requirements, fees, and permit processing procedures) to determine the extent to which they
may be affecting housing production in the City. Staff recommendations will be made to the Planning
Commission and/or City Council on measures that may be taken to lessen or remove any identified
constraints. As part of Action H-30 (Monitoring Program), the City will make diligent efforts to engage the
community in the progress of the housing element implementation, including specifically contacting
developers, service providers and other community interests to gather comments, consider them and revise
or adjust the housing element and programs as appropriate.

H-32     Historic Preservation Ordinance
(ADOPTION PENDING)
The City of Colusa is currently undergoing hearings on its draft Historic Preservation Ordinance. The
purpose of this ordinance is to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of Colusa
and to implement the historic preservation goals and policies set forth in the City’s General Plan. It is
recognized that where historic preservation is supported by local government policies, programs to
designate and preserve historic resources can increase housing opportunities, and add to property values
and pride of place. Through implementation of this ordinance, revitalization of historic downtowns and
City of Colusa                                                                             Housing Element

adaptive reuse of historic districts and buildings will conserve the City’s resources, will use existing
infrastructure, will generate local jobs and purchasing, will support small business development and
heritage tourism, and will enhance the quality of life and community character. It is further anticipated that
implementation of this ordinance will prevent the needless destruction and impairment of valuable historic
sites, structures, and areas as well as discourage the decay, disuse, and neglect of the same and to
promote economic vitality in the City of Colusa.

H-33     Farmworker Housing
(Proposed)
Objective: To permit and encourage the development of housing for seasonal and permanent farmworkers by
providing adequate sites with zoning and development standards that encourage and facilitate a variety of
housing types, including single family, multifamily single room occupancy, manufactures homes, mobile homes,
second units and any other applicable housing types for farmworkers.
Specific Action Required: The City will ensure zoning and development standards comply with current State
requirements under the Employee Housing Act, specifically Health and Safety Codes Sections 17021.5 and
17021.6, which ensures the City permits and encourages employee housing facilities. The City will investigate
and take action to encourage and facilitate the production of farmworker housing, such as seeking and applying
for funding, identifying developers, maintaining an inventory of sites, assisting with site development, etcetera
and ensuring zoning and development standards facilitate a variety of housing types for farmworker housing
needs. The City will review the zoning code to determine that zoning and development standards facilitate a
variety of housing types for farmworker housing needs, including multifamily, manufactured housing, mobile
homes, single room occupancy and second units. The City will encourage the development of housing for
farmworkers by assisting interested developers with applications for funding and assisting in development
application processing to mitigate any potential processing constraints. The City will develop an informational
brochure illustrating the possible funding sources and other City incentives for the development of farmworker
housing and provide this brochure at the Planning and Public Works Department and on the City web site.
         Funding Sources: General Fund.
         Responsible Agencies/Departments: Planning and Building Departments
         Implementation Schedule: Ongoing – continuation of existing zoning. Evaluate Zoning Code by 2010.

H-34     Extremely Low Income Households Working Group
(PROPOSED)
The City will establish a working group by mid-2010 consisting of developers, including nonprofits and service
providers, community stakeholders and other applicable organizations to establish a strategy for promoting and
assisting in the development of housing for extremely low-income households. As part of the working group
and strategy, the City will consider a variety of housing types (SROs, motel conversions, adaptive reuse,
multifamily, etc) and local, state and federal resources (administrative and financial). The City will seek to bi-
annually identify potential projects/developers to partner and pursue the development or rehabilitation of
housing for extremely low-income households. The City will consider a variety of ways to assist in the
development such as facilitating the identification of suitable sites, priority processing, fee waivers or deferrals
and facilitating entitlements and incentives beyond density bonuses pursuant to Government Code Section

1.0 INTRODUCTIO
                                                                             1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1      SCOPE AND ROLE OF THE GENERAL PLAN
This General Plan, through implementation of its comprehensive goals, policies, and
implementing actions, will serve as the framework for the City’s growth over the next 20 years,
while striving to maintain and enhance the existing quality of life in the City of Colusa. Often
referred to as the local government “constitution,” the General Plan is the single most important
document a local government can adopt. This General Plan will govern decisions relating to
land use, circulation, housing, community design, parks & recreation, conservation and open
space, noise, safety, and municipal facilities.
1.2      HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Founded in 1850, the City of Colusa was briefly known as Salmon Bend. Prior to its incorporation,
the City was the site of an Indian village inhabited by a subgroup of the Wintun Indian Nation.
One of the first Anglo-Saxon settlers was the Semple family. This group settled along the
Sacramento River at present day Colusa and established a trading center for gold mining
activities farther north in Trinity and Shasta Counties. River steamers could travel as far north as
Red Bluff in the winter but could navigate only up to Colusa in the summer due to low water
levels. Because Colusa was at the upper end of navigable waters during summer months, the
town became a year-round center of commerce.
In the 1860s, the economy of Colusa County changed from primarily stock-raising to the farming
of wheat, barley, and other crops. Wheat production eventually became the predominant
land use and economic activity. However, the market for wheat eventually declined when
Argentina and Canada became major exporters of the product in the 1890s. Following the
decline of the wheat industry, rice was introduced to the area and became the dominant crop
in the County. Rice required a large amount of water compared to other crops produced in the
area. The need for additional water was addressed with the construction of the Glenn-Colusa
Irrigation Canal.
Colusa was incorporated in 1868, during an expansion of farming and a growth in population in
the region. The City grew to a population of 2,000 in the prosperous 1870s, distinguished by
broad, level streets, numerous brick business buildings, and stately residences. As the county
seat, Colusa counted among its residents an unusually large complement of judges, attorneys,
assessors, and governing officials, many of who also earned their livelihoods as farmers and
merchants.
Vestiges of Colusa’s 19th century traditional life continue to the present day. Stately Italianate
and Queen Anne dwellings, intermingled with Craftsman bungalows and clusters of Tudor
Revival homes, provide residences for a new generation of Colusans. Farm-supporting
businesses continue to service agricultural production in the surrounding unincorporated lands.
1.3      COMMUNITY PROFILE
The City of Colusa is located near the geographic center of the Sacramento Valley. The nearest
major metropolitan city is Sacramento, approximately 60 miles to the south. The City of Chico,
located approximately 50 miles northeast of Colusa, and Yuba City, 22 miles east, are other
nearby urban areas. Unique features of the Colusa community include its location next to the
Sacramento River and historic character in the downtown core.
The population of the City of Colusa in 2005 was 5,582, according to State Department of
Finance population estimates. The growth rate since 1990 has averaged 0.95 percent per year,

October 2007                                                                                    Final

1.0 INTRODUCTION
with a high of 2.56 percent between 1996 and 1997 and a low of negative 1.84 percent from the
year 1999 to 2000. The State Department of Finance’s 20-year projections show the City of
Colusa with a population of 10,317 by 2020.
The City’s proximity to the Sutter Buttes, nearby wildlife refuges, and active agriculture offer a
panorama of open landscapes surrounding the City. Transportation to parts of the Sacramento
Valley and beyond is readily available by state highways and from the Colusa Airport. Figure 1.1
shows the location of the City of Colusa in relation to the surrounding region.
Few small communities located within the influence of a major metropolitan region have
managed to retain the same basic physical and community character that was present several
decades ago through the beginning of the 21st century. Colusa represents what was once the
“typical” small town across California and the nation. Some of the most striking features of
present-day Colusa are the things one does not find here – characteristics all too common
elsewhere in the Sacramento region. Missing from Colusa are large chain “superstores” on the
edge of town, a struggling or downtrodden downtown core, and an unending series of housing
developments with little to distinguish one from the other.
Colusa still relies in large part on the same economic base that has sustained it for more than a
century – agriculture and its related businesses. Most of the residents in Colusa work in Colusa or
the surrounding area, within a 30-minute commute or less from their homes. Unlike many other
cities of equal distance from Sacramento, it has not become a “bedroom” community where
most working residents face hours of daily commute to work.
Traditional settlement patterns of the community have not significantly changed over the past
several decades. Unlike the neighboring counties of Yolo and Sutter, growth in Colusa has
developed slowly. For the most part, new neighborhoods have been located contiguous to the
existing built areas and in a relatively compact form, with new residential subdivisions within the
community located primarily to the south between Highway 20/45 and Wescott Road. The
Downtown area is still active and healthy despite the presence of various franchise and service
commercial uses along Highways 20 and 45. For all of these reasons, Colusa has generated a
level of interest in growth and development that it hasn’t seen in the past. As a result, Colusa is
at a crossroads, and recent trends now point to the potential for dramatic change over the next
two decades. It is the intent of this Plan to assist the City in making the choices that may be
presented to the City in the coming years.
1.4      PURPOSE OF THE GENERAL PLAN
The City of Colusa General Plan serves as a long-term policy guide for physical and economic
growth and environmental sustainability. The General Plan will be used to inform citizens,
developers, agencies, interest groups and others of the ground rules that will guide
development-related decisions in the community. The General Plan will provide the long-term
vision for the community, and, through its goals, policies and implementation programs, indicate
how that vision may be achieved over time.               The City of Colusa General Plan addresses
planning through the year 2025. The City of Colusa General Plan has four fundamental purposes:
•    To enable the Planning Commission and the City Council to make informed land use
     decisions that affect the City’s quality of life.
•    To inform the public of the City’s policy approaches and to serve as a vehicle to invite public
     participation in the City’s decision-making process.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
•   To provide a basis for evaluating whether private and public development proposals and
    public programs are in harmony with Colusa’s short-term objectives and long-term vision.
•   To provide private developers and public agencies with clear expectations of new
    development proposals to ensure their consistency with Colusa’s development priorities.
1.5     GENERAL PLAN THEMES
COMMUNITY IDENTITY
The City of Colusa strives to enhance its identity as a rural community with small-town character
and a pleasant quality of life. In addition, the City recognizes its historical identity and considers
the Downtown and Riverfront areas as the focal point of the community.
COMMUNITY-BUILDING
Implementation of the General Plan will help to ensure physical connectivity between existing
and new development areas and enhance the “livability” of the community. Key elements of
community livability include an attractive pedestrian- and bicycle-oriented public realm;
affordable, well-designed, and appropriately located housing; convenient public transit,
services, and shops; effective and efficient community services; accessible parks and open
space; a clean and safe natural environment; an abundance of historical and natural features;
and friendly, community-oriented social environments.
ENHANCEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES
Surrounding the City are many natural resources in preserves and open space, including the
Colusa National Wildlife Refuge, one-half mile west of the City, and the Colusa-Sacramento River
State Recreation Area to the north. In the future, the City of Colusa intends to promote these
natural resources through increased awareness and improved public access.
COMMUNITY SUSTAINABILITY
Given that Colusa has development opportunities remaining in its planning area, the community
recognizes the importance and opportunity to enhance sustainability while managing growth.
Elements of the City’s sustainable community include:
•   Environmental Integrity: satisfying basic human needs such as clean air and water,
    protecting ecosystems and biodiversity (including sensitive marshlands, open space, and the
    Sacramento River), and implementing pollution prevention strategies
•   Economic Security: local reinvestment in neighborhood commercial and employment
    centers, creating job opportunities for City residents, and promoting local business ownership
•   Empowerment and Responsibility: respect and tolerance for diverse views and values, equal
    opportunity to participate in decision-making, and access to City government
•   Social Well-Being: quality health services, housing, and education opportunities for all,
    creative expression, safety from crime, respect for public spaces and historic resources, and
    emphasis on the City’s quality of life.

1.6      RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING PLANS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
The City of Colusa has various planning tools, documents, and programs in addition to the
General Plan. As required by law, all of the following plans and policies are consistent with the
General Plan or will be upon amendment as described in the General Plan implementation
measures.
CITY OF COLUSA ZONING ORDINANCE
The Zoning Ordinance of the City of Colusa (Ordinance 403) zones property and prescribes
development standards and processes within the City limits. Adoption of the General Plan will
require amendments to the Zoning Ordinance for consistency with the updated General Plan.
Government Code §65860 requires municipalities to maintain consistency between their Zoning
Ordinance and their adopted General Plan. The relationship between the Zoning Districts
established in the Zoning Ordinance and the General Plan Land Use designations are discussed
throughout this document.
1.7      DOCUMENT ORGANIZATION
The Colusa General Plan is organized into nine chapters. The Introduction provides background
information on the City of Colusa, its General Plan update process, and the organization of the
General Plan. The remaining eight chapters contain both the required elements (as discussed in
Section 1.7) and optional elements of importance to the City – specifically Community
Character and Design (Chapter 3) and Municipal Facilities and Services (Chapter 8). The
Housing Element, which is a component of the General Plan, was adopted in March 2004 and is
incorporated under separate cover.
Each General Plan element is structured as follows:
•   “Introduction” section addresses the need for and purpose of the individual element, and
    summarizes its key components.
•   “Setting” section describes the existing conditions, including plans, regulations, and
    standards currently in place, and current issues for the key topic areas of the specific
    element.
•   “Outlook” section provides the City’s vision for the future during the 20-year timeframe of the
    General Plan. This section sets the direction and context for the goals and policies that
    follow.
•   “Goals, Policies, and Implementing Actions” section provides the specific language that
    serves as a “road map” for future development within the City and its sphere of influence:
         −   Goals state the overall desired conditions that the City would like to achieve as part
             of its vision; goal statements are general.
         −   Policies indicate an action or direction that the City must take as a step toward
             achieving the desired condition or goal; policies are more specific statements of how
             a goal will be implemented.
         −   Implementing Actions identify programs and actions that will be required to
             implement the stated policies.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.8        LEGALITY OF THE GENERAL PLAN
California Government Code (GC) §65300 requires the legislative body of every planning
agency in the state – in this case, the City of Colusa—to adopt a comprehensive, long-term
general plan for its physical development. GC §65301(a) further requires that a municipality’s
General Plan address “any land outside its boundaries which in the planning agency’s judgment
bears relation to its planning.” This area is referred to as the Sphere of Influence –a boundary
that typically includes lands around the city which may ultimately be annexed and/or provided
with city services.
To be effective, a General Plan must remain current. While State law does not specify rigid
requirements or timing for updating a General Plan (other than for the Housing Element which
must be updated every five years), it does establish that the responsibility for determining
whether a General Plan is up-to-date and accurate rests with each jurisdiction.
The City Council adopted the last General Plan in October 1994. Since that time, the City has
experienced minimal population growth, economic development, residential development,
and other changes, in part because of limitations on the City’s sewer treatment plant. Recently,
however, there has been considerable interest in developing a substantial amount of residential
and commercial acreage within the City’s Planning Area. To ensure adherence to the City’s
comprehensive and long-term approach to planning, these new development proposals have
been considered in this General Plan and will be guided by its goals, policies, and implementing
actions once adopted by the City.
REQUIRED ELEMENTS
The Colusa General Plan covers all of the seven elements required by the California
Government Code as well as optional elements which address issues of concern that are
specific to this community. Table 1.1 identifies the title of each General Plan element and its
relationship to State law requirements.

Land Use Element
California Government Code §65302(a) requires that the General Plan include a land use
element, which addresses:
         “The proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses of
         the land for housing, business, industry, open space, including agriculture, natural
         resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public
         buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and other
         categories of public and private uses of land. The land use element shall include
         a statement of the standards of population density and building intensity
         recommended for the various districts and other territory covered by the plan…”
Community Character and Design Element
Community character and design are critical to the decisions that determine the shape and
form of growth and development. The element is not one of the seven “mandatory” elements
under California law governing general plans. However, many general plans statewide contain
design elements and policies. Aesthetics and design have long been recognized by California
law and upheld by the courts as legitimate public policy issues within the regulatory authority of
municipalities.
Circulation Element
California Government Code §65302(b) requires that the General Plan include a circulation
element that describes plans and measures to provide for the City’s transportation and
circulation system as follows:
         “The circulation element consists of the general location and extent of existing
         and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, any military
         airports and ports, and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated with
         the land use element of the plan.”
Safety Element
California Government Code §65302(g) requires that the General Plan include a safety element.
A safety element is to protect the community from any unreasonable risks associated with the
following:
         “Effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure,
         tsunami, seiche, and dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and
         landslides; subsidence, liquefaction and other seismic hazards identified pursuant
         to Chapter 7.8 (commencing with Section 2690) of the Public Resources Code,
         and other geologic hazards known to the legislative body; flooding; and wild
         land and urban fires. The safety element shall include mapping of known seismic
         and other geologic hazards. It shall also address evacuation routes, military
         installations, peak load water supply requirements, and minimum road widths and
         clearances around structures, as those items relate to identified fire and geologic
         hazards.”

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element
The City of Colusa General Plan update has combined two state-required elements—open
space and conservation—into a single Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation element.
An optional parks component is included in this chapter as well.
California Government Code §65302(e) requires that the General Plan include an open space
element that describes plans and measures for preserving open space for:
•   Natural resources;
•   Managed production of resources;
•   Outdoor recreation;
•   Protect public health and safety;
•   Support military uses, and
•   Protect identified places, features, and objects.
Furthermore, California Government Code §65302(d) requires that the General Plan include a
conservation element for the conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources.
The parks, recreation and resource conservation element provides for:
        “the conservation, development, and use of natural resources; details, plans and
        measures for the preservation of open space; and provides for outdoor
        recreation facilities. The overall goal of the element is to preserve a
        comprehensive interconnected system of open space, encompassing
        preservation and enhancement of natural habitat areas, for the use and
        enjoyment of the community. The element also integrates related land use,
        transportation and circulation, transit, and energy issues.”
Noise Element
California Government Code § 65302 (f) requires that the General Plan include a noise element
to be used as a guide for establishing a pattern of land uses that minimizes the exposure of
community residents to excessive noise. The noise element “shall identify and appraise noise
problems in the community. The noise element will recognize the guidelines established by the
Office of Noise Control in the State Department of Health Services and shall analyze and
quantify, to the extent practicable, as determined by the legislative body, current and
projected noise levels for all of the following sources:
•   Highways and freeways.
•   Primary arterials and major local streets.
•   Passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and ground rapid transit systems.
•   Commercial, general aviation, heliport, helistop, and military airport operations, aircraft
    overflights, jet engine test stands, all other ground facilities and maintenance functions
    related to airport operation.

•    Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad classification yards.
•    Other ground stationary noise sources, including, but not limited to, military installations,
     identified by local agencies as contributing to the community noise environment.
Noise contours shall be shown for all of these sources and stated in terms of community noise
equivalent level (CNEL) or day-night average level (Ldn).”
Municipal Facilities and Services Element
Municipal Facilities and Services is an optional element that discusses public facility and service
needs within Colusa and the remainder of the Planning Area. The element discusses civic and
community facilities, including administration, public works, police, fire, and solid waste disposal;
facilities provided by other public agencies, including library, schools, and airport facilities;
services provided by the private sector, including electric, gas, and communication utilities; and
water, wastewater, and stormwater drainage systems. Goals and policies emphasize the timing
of facilities construction and services provision in relation to new development approvals, and
they recognize the need for fair-share contribution from new development toward the provision
of these facilities and services.
Housing Element
California Government Code §65302(c) requires every county and city in the State to include a
housing element as part of its adopted general plan. In stipulating the content of this element,
Article 10.6 of the Government Code indicates that the element shall consist of “identification
and analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies,
quantified objectives, and scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement and
development of housing.” This legislation further states that the element “shall identify adequate
sites for housing, including rental housing, factory-built housing, and mobile homes, and shall
make adequate provision for the existing and projected needs of all economic segments of the
community.”
Colusa’s housing element identifies existing and projected housing needs. The element also
establishes goals, policies, and implementing actions for the preservation, improvement, and
development of housing to meet the needs of all economic sectors of the community. This
element was previously prepared and adopted by the City Council in March 2004 to fulfill the
requirements of State housing law.
REQUIRED CHARACTERISTICS
In addition to addressing the required elements, a General Plan must also have the following
functions:
Long-Range in Scope
The General Plan must have a long-term perspective, establishing durable policies upon which
daily decisions can be made for a period of many years.                 Although the Housing Element
requires an update every five years, goals and objectives for other sections may consider
community values or needs over a period of 15 to 20 years. This General Plan establishes goals,
policies, and implementation measures for a period from 2005-2025.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Comprehensiveness
Geographically Comprehensive
The General Plan must consider all areas within the City Limits, as well as “any land outside its
boundaries which in the planning agency’s judgment bears relation to its planning” (California
Government Code §65300). This area includes the City’s Sphere of Influence and any adjacent
lands that may be affected by implementation of the General Plan.
Topically Comprehensive
The General Plan must cover a broad range of issues relevant to the planning area. Land use
designations in the City’s General Plan consider impacts on environmental, social, and
economic concerns.
Internal Consistency
Government Code §65300.5 requires that the General Plan be internally consistent through all of
its elements. In other words, no policy conflicts may exist within the document. The requirement
for internal consistency is reflected in five ways:
•    Equal status among elements: policies of one element are not legally superior to policies of
     any other element.
•    Consistency between elements: every element of the General Plan must be consistent with
     all other elements.
•    Consistency within elements: each element’s analysis and                goals,   policies,   and
     implementation measures must be consistent and complementary.
•    Area plan consistency: all goals, policies, and implementation measures in an area plan
     must be consistent with the General Plan.
•    Text and diagram consistency: figures and tables must be consistent with the text supporting
     them.
1.9       PROCESS USED IN PREPARING THE GENERAL PLAN
This General Plan is the culmination of an effort that began in 2000. The first part of the process
was to research and acquire information to support the establishment of a resource inventory of
the planning area. The resource inventory provided data on the physical aspects of the
planning area, such as soils, biological resources, traffic, and air quality. Analysis of the public
service aspects of the planning area included schools, solid waste, police and fire protection,
and water service. The data provided a baseline against which the effects of future
development could be evaluated, and goals and policies formulated.
As part of the second phase of the process, the City held a series of public workshops and
hearings before the Planning Commission and City Council. Input received at these meetings
from the Commission, the Council, other public agencies, and community residents has been
incorporated into this document. The goals, policies, and implementing actions of this General
Plan are the culmination of these meetings and hearings.

1.10     DEFINING USE OF GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
The Colusa General Plan is supported by Goals, Policies, and Implementing Actions that set forth
the guiding principles upon which future decisions are to be made. These components of the
General Plan are defined and organized as shown in the following diagram. In descending
order, each of the components provides more detail about how the City will achieve the
components above it. The goals, policies, and implementing actions for each General Plan
Element are located within each Element according to the sequence below.
                        Goal:
                        A broad statement reflecting community values and
                        ideal future vision.
                            •   Policy:
                                A clear and specific statement that guides
                                decision making in order to promote the
                                achievement of a goal.
                                     -   Implementing Action:
                                         An action or procedure that carries out
                                         a General Plan Policy. Each Policy
                                         typically has one or more corresponding
                                         Implementing Actions.
An example of this format is provided below, using the Land Use Element:
Goal LU – 1:
To provide a comprehensive, logical land use planning process.
Policy LU-1.1:
The City shall ensure that annexation areas demonstrate comprehensive and logical growth,
particularly where significant changes in land use are being considered.
         Implementing Action LU-1.1.a: Prepare Annexation Phasing Plan
         The City shall prepare and adopt an Annexation Phasing Plan to ensure a logical
         progression of annexations that meet the City’s economic and planning needs and does
         not strain City services, resources, and infrastructure. The plan shall include criteria that
         promote the preservation of open space and agricultural lands; benefit the local
         economy; and ensure a development pattern that is complementary and contiguous to
         existing development; include adequate infrastructure and services; and will enhance
         the City economy.

2.1       INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Element establishes the framework for community development through a Land
Use Map accompanied by goals, policies, and implementing actions that will guide the City’s
physical form and growth over the next 20 years. The Land Use Map is an illustrative expression
of the City’s land use policies and development priorities.
In addition to addressing the types and distribution of land uses, this chapter defines the densities
and intensities of development throughout the City for all land uses. This Land Use Element will
serve to inform elected and appointed officials, City staff, and the public in guiding, managing,
and coordinating land use decisions that will affect the future physical development and quality
of life in the City of Colusa.
2.2       SETTING
For the most part, Colusa has not experienced the level of outward urban expansion that has
occurred in many small California communities and, as a result, the City has largely retained its
compact 19th century urban form.              This
compact urban form results in the City having
a wide range of land uses, including a mixture
of low- and medium-density residential
development; residential and commercial
development in the historic downtown area;
newer commercial uses up and down Bridge
Street; community parks and open space;
and a variety of public uses within the urban
core. Professional offices, industrial uses, and
agricultural-supporting businesses are also
located throughout the City.
Vacant lands in and around the City present
opportunities for new commercial and residential development. The downtown and Riverfront
District provide excellent redevelopment opportunities for a mix of uses.
The physical characteristics of the City of Colusa and the surrounding areas offer a variety of
contrasting and complimentary landscapes. These include extensive agricultural lands at the
perimeter of the City; riparian habitat along the Sacramento River; tree-lined streetscapes that
help define the City’s urban core and key entries to the City along SR 20 and SR 20/45; and
Colusa National Wildlife Refuge, which serves as a winter refuge for migrating waterfowl. This
diversity of landscape in the built and natural environments helps to shape the unique character
of Colusa.
PLANNING BOUNDARIES
City Limits
As shown in Figure 2.1, the City of Colusa is approximately 1,174 acres in size. During the
planning period of the last General Plan, the City experienced slow to moderate growth and
grew by approximately 88 acres due in part to seven annexation actions that occurred
between 1997 and 2001. These annexations accounted for an overall increase to the City’s size
of approximately eight percent.
City of Colusa                                                                           General Plan

                                                   2-1

2.0 LAND USE
Generally Speaking, the City of Colusa has land use and development authority over all
property within its boundaries. Exceptions to this include the Colusa County Fairgrounds, owned
by the State of California; rights-of-way for State Highways (SR) 20 and 45, which are under the
jurisdiction of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans); and lands along the banks
of the Sacramento River, which are controlled by the State Lands Commission. While state
agencies generally have land use authority on state-owned lands, opportunities for City input
and involvement on State of California projects is expected and generally provided.
Sphere of Influence
The Cortese-Knox (CKH) Act (commencing with Government Code §56000) establishes a Local
Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) within each county of California. Each LAFCO is made
up of elected officials of the county, cities, and, in some cases, special districts in each county.
LAFCOs establish the spheres of influence (SOI) for all the cities and special districts within the
county. These decision-making government entities are charged with the responsibility of land
use decisions within a city’s SOI, such as annexation, special district formation, and the
incorporation of new cities.
The city of Colusa’s current sphere of influence (SOI), shown in Figure 2.1, totals approximately
2,842 acres. This includes all land within the City limits and an additional 1,668 acres outside the
City limits. Unincorporated land represents approximately 59 percent of the City’s total SOI area.
This SOI was adopted by the City and approved by LAFCO as part of its General Plan Land Use
Map on November 8, 1984. At the time the SOI was adopted, the City anticipated there would
be an ultimate need to provide development within the SOI with public facilities and services
over a 20-year timeframe. Since then, the City has concluded that urban development could
reasonably be expected to extend beyond its current SOI. As part of the proposed update to
the General Plan land use map, the City will make application to LAFCO to request an update
of the SOI in accordance with the CKH Reorganization Act of 2000.
While the City does not have direct jurisdiction over land use decisions made within the
unincorporated SOI, state law requires that Colusa County consult with the City on all
discretionary development proposals that occur within this planning boundary.
Planning Area
The effective Planning Area boundary for the General Plan is coterminous with the City’s
Proposed Sphere of Influence. Policy documents from the County of Colusa that address areas
beyond the Sphere of Influence were considered in preparing this General Plan. As shown in
Figure 2.3, the Colusa County General Plan Land Use Element designates lands beyond the City
of Colusa’s Sphere of Influence as Agriculture-General (A-G), Agriculture-Transition (A-T), and
Industrial (I). The Colusa County General Plan also designates land that is within the City’s
proposed SOI as Agriculture-Transition (A-T), Agriculture-General (A-G), Rural Residential (RR),
Urban Residential (UR), and Industrial (I). These designations generally permit rural or very low-
density residential development.
The City of Colusa has no existing adopted area plans. Special Planning Areas (SPAs) that are
proposed with this General Plan update, which may be developed under Specific Plans or as
part of a planned development adopted by the City, are discussed in Section 2.3 Outlook.

2.0 LAND USE
EXISTING LAND USES
Residential
                                      Approximately 2,000 housing units are located within the City
                                      of Colusa (2004 Housing Element). Approximately 79 percent
                                      are single-family homes and 21 percent are multi-family units
                                      and mobile homes. This percentage is similar to many rural
                                      cities and towns in northern California where single-family
                                      housing is the predominant residential land use. The current
                                      inventory of vacant residential land zoned for single-family
                                      units indicates that there are approximately 21 lots consisting
                                      of approximately 130 acres with a build-out capacity of a
                                      projected 645 housing units within the existing City limits.
Colusa has grown radially outward from its historic commercial and residential core, centered
generally around Market and 5th Streets. As Colusa grew during and after the 1880s and 1890s,
additional homes were constructed in new, undeveloped neighborhoods and as infill on vacant
lots within the developed core of the city, creating a mix of home sizes and types in central
neighborhoods.
Residential development in the southern area of the City, which generally extends south from
the downtown core and Fremont Street, is contiguous and similar in land use composition to the
historic residential neighborhoods of the City. This area generally extends south and east to the
City limits along Wescott Road and SR 20/45. In this area, neighborhoods have developed in a
pattern that is different from the historic area of the City, which is based on a grid pattern of lots
and blocks with alleys. Newer development in the southern area consists of small subdivisions
with curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, and rolled curbs. These subdivisions, including Country Club
Estates, Cornerstone, Traditions, Colusa Meadows, and Colusa Meadows West, comprise
approximately 165 single-family homes. In this general area, the Hoblit subdivision has also been
approved for 12 units with one home built to date; and Tennant Estates was recently approved
for development of 101 residential units on 37.9 acres.
Residential development outside the unincorporated boundaries, but within the City’s SOI, is
limited primarily to single-family rural residences. Walnut Ranch Estates, consisting of a 101-unit
large-lot residential subdivision, is situated south of the City and borders the southern portion of
the Tennant Estates projects. Much of the unincorporated land west of 13th Street and north of
Lurline Avenue are also developed with small-, medium-, and large-lot single-family residences.
Commercial
Commercial development in Colusa occurs primarily along the Bridge Street (SR 20/45) corridor
and along Market and Main Streets in the core downtown area. The City’s commerce has
traditionally been conducted in the historic central business district (CBD) and has been focused
primarily on local services and agriculture-supporting businesses. While newer commercial land
uses are being developed outside of this area, downtown Colusa remains the hub of
commercial activity in the community.
Bridge Street from Sioc Street to the east end of Market Street has developed with a mix of
residential and commercial uses over the past decades. Fast food restaurants, gasoline stations,
a shopping center, and convenience retail are interspersed with medium-density residential
development along this segment of Bridge Street.

The 137.5-acre Colusa Industrial Park (CIP) is located outside the City limits, but within the SOI.
Within this industrial park complex, commercial office sites are located on the north end,
adjacent to the Colusa Golf Club on Highway 20. Office buildings in this area generally range
from 2,000 square feet to 15,000 square feet with additional development proposed that
includes the potential for a hotel, restaurant, and other highway commercial services. Current
tenants within the CIP complex range from county government and business offices to medical
and dental facilities.
Over the past 20 years, overall commercial growth inside the City limits has been slow,
averaging 3,400 square feet of new commercial construction per year. That trend shifted with
the construction of the Town and Country Shopping Center, which created 55,000 square feet of
new commercial space at the corner of Carson and Bridge Streets. While the Town and Country
Shopping Center contains significant commercial square footage, underutilized commercial
space remains around the shopping center, as well as along J Street and parcels north of
Market Street extending to the Sacramento River.
To address concerns regarding the potential deterioration of the historic downtown area and to
preserve valuable historical assets, the City commissioned a Downtown Improvement and
Preservation Plan prepared by Zephyr Urban Management Associates in 1988. The Preservation
Plan made various recommendations with one option recommending the establishment of a
Redevelopment Agency (RDA) to assist in City efforts to revitalize and strengthen the historic
downtown area. To date, no RDA has been established in the City. However, the formation of
such an agency and preparation and implementation of a redevelopment plan is discussed in
the Outlook and Policy/Implementation sections of this element.
Industrial
Twenty acres of land within Colusa city limits are designated Industrial (I), with this type of use
constituting the second largest land use in the City (after single-family residential). Industrial uses
include a trailer manufacturer near the Colusa-Sacramento River State Recreation Area (SRA)
and the City corporation yards between Main and Market Streets. Additional underutilized
industrial land includes the Pirelli site south of the Fairgrounds.
Adjacent to, but outside of, the City limits, are a variety of industrial uses that include agriculture-
support businesses, farm equipment rental and sales businesses, a petroleum supplier located
along 14th Street, historic warehouses along the west end of Main Street, a rice mill at Main and
Bridge Streets, and the Sunsweet fruit drying plant on SR 20/45 north of Moonbend Drive.
The vast majority of industrial property in Colusa’s planning area, however, is situated on
unincorporated lands located south of the City around the Colusa County Airport and along the
SR 20/45 corridor southwest of the City. Approximately 1,049 acres of land are owned by Colusa
Industrial Properties (CIP). This expansive area is comprised of an industrial park, which houses
light and heavy industrial uses, grain and food processing facilities, building material facilities,
and a wastewater treatment facility. CIP has submitted a development proposal to rezone an
additional 575 acres for industrial uses, which is currently being processed by the County of
Colusa.
Airport
The Colusa County Airport, located adjacent to and west of SR 20/45, is the only airport within
the Planning Area and the only public airport in Colusa County. It is located on approximately
81 acres about one-half mile southeast of the City of Colusa. The airport is located within the
City of Colusa                                                                              General Plan

jurisdiction of and is managed by the County of Colusa. The airport was established in 1961 and
received a permit from the State’s Division of Aeronautics the same year.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) classifies Colusa County Airport as a Basic Utility Stage
II airport. This airport can serve single-engine airplanes used for agricultural, personal, and
business purposes, as well as high-performance single-engine aircraft and light twin-engine
aircraft typically used for business and air-taxi purposes. It has one paved runway 3,000 feet
long and 60 feet wide and is laid out in a northwest-southeast orientation parallel with the
adjacent SR 20/45. The approved traffic pattern for the runway keeps all arriving and departing
aircraft to the east of the airport, where primarily agricultural land exists. There are 22 airport-
owned T-hangars, five privately-owned hangars, 42 open tie-downs, one large hangar, two
agricultural operation hangars, and a caretaker’s residence. Services available at the airport
include transit and taxi service, fuel sales, and crop dusting service.
Recreation
Colusa has approximately 15.5 acres of parkland and recreational areas within the City
boundaries. This does not include acreage at the high school or the Colusa County Fairgrounds,
a combined area of more than 75 acres, much of which could be defined as recreational in
nature. The city’s recreational facilities include ten City parks that offer a community pool,
softball fields, grassy play areas, picnic tables, barbecue facilities, playground equipment,
restrooms, a rock-climbing wall, tennis and volleyball courts, and horseshoe pits. A privately-
owned nine-hole golf course (open to the public) is located outside the city limits but is within
the SOI/Planning Area.
The Colusa-Sacramento River State Recreation Area (SRA) provides a passive recreation and
boat launch facility. However, siltation problems often make the boat launch unusable for most
of the year and available only during high water periods. The City is exploring an alternative site
for a more reliable boat launch facility and is currently pursuing grant funding for the project
through the Department of Boats and Waterways.
Open Space
There is no land currently designated as open space within the City or the city SOI. Any open
space in the City is limited to parks and recreational areas described above.
Public Facilities
Public facility uses include City Hall, Colusa County offices (the City of Colusa is the County seat),
public safety offices, the library, a post office, and other public offices currently located in and
around the historic downtown area. The County Sheriff’s office is located outside of the historic
downtown core at the corner of Bridge and Carson Streets on the SR 20/45 corridor. Additional
public facility uses in and around the City of Colusa include various school facilities, the hospital,
Holy Cross Cemetery, and the City of Colusa Waste Water Treatment Plant.
HISTORICAL GROWTH TRENDS
Population
The population of the City of Colusa in 2005 was 5,582, according to the State of California
Department of Finance (DOF) population estimates. The growth rate since 1990 has averaged

Employment
Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the 2000 Census indicated that the total labor force
in the City of Colusa increased by 18.2 percent between 1990 and 2000, growing from 2,200 to
2,600 workers during that period. This compares with an 8.2 percent increase in the County as a
whole over the same period. The City has seen a 5.0 percent increase in total employment
during this time as compared with a 3.7 percent increase in the County.
Colusa residents are employed in a variety of job sectors, ranging from agriculture to public
administration. According to the 2000 Census, the category of agriculture, forestry, fishing, and
hunting accounts for the largest employment sector in the City (18 percent of total
employment). Other major sources of employment include educational, health, and social
services (15.3 percent), retail trade (12.5 percent), public administration (7.8 percent), arts,
entertainment, recreation, accommodations, and food services (7.7 percent), and waste
management services (7.5 percent). Information constitutes the smallest employment sector (0.3
percent).
Major employers of City residents in the area include the County of Colusa, City of Colusa,
Colusa Casino Resort, Colusa Unified School District, Colusa Regional Medical Center, Colusa
Industrial Properties, and Sunsweet Dryers. While many residents work locally, others commute to
Yuba City, Williams, and the Yolo-Sacramento area for work.
Jobs/Housing Balance
According to Census 2000, the current jobs-to-resident ratio in the City is 0.59. However, the ratio
of jobs within the City filled by City residents is 0.42. This means that while there are enough jobs
to employ 59 percent of Colusa workers only 42 percent are actually working in the City. The
remaining workers are commuting outside the City to their places of employment.
BUILDOUT UNDER THE 1994 GENERAL PLAN
Buildout under the existing 1994 General Plan, combined with land that has been annexed since
1994, could yield a total of 3,725 potential dwelling units and result in a buildout population of
slightly less than 10,500 residents. If full buildout were to occur during the 20-year timeframe of
the existing General Plan, this would represent an annual growth rate of approximately 3.5
percent, a figure considerably higher than the actual growth rate, which has averaged 0.95
percent since 1990.
The 1994 General Plan and its associated amendments allow for a variety of dwelling types and
residential densities. The current Land Use Map, shown in Figure 2.2, provides for land uses that
include rural residential, low-, medium- and high-density residential, commercial-professional,
heavy commercial, industrial, and parks/recreation and public facilities.
The 1994 General Plan also designated large unincorporated tracts of land in the vicinity of
Colusa as areas appropriate for future annexation and development. By doing so, the City
stated its intention to grow, with the SOI representing the City’s urban limit line.
Subsequently, the City approved seven General Plan amendments (GPAs) between 1997 and
2001, resulting in the annexation and change in land use designations/zoning of approximately
88 acres. These annexations added the potential for construction of 282 housing units based on
4 units per acre after a 20 percent deduction for roadway infrastructure. These annexations also

allowed for construction of 1.56 acres of general commercial development. The majority of
housing units approved as part of the GPAs were in the low-density category – 84 acres at low
density (approximately 336 single-family homes); and 2.2 acres at high density (estimated 30-40
apartment units), for a total of up to 376 dwelling units.
2.3      OUTLOOK
The land use districts in this element identify the types of land uses proposed for the City’s
planning area and the level of density or intensity to which they can be developed. These
designations, in conjunction with the Land Use Map, serve as a guide for the City’s development
pattern.
The Land Use Element is intended to go a step beyond the identification of land uses. Goals,
policies and implementing actions address how the city is to develop and be defined. The
success in enacting a form and pattern of development that embraces the concepts
articulated in this element and in the Community Character and Design element depends on
implementation. The identified implementing actions include future specific plans/planned
developments, community design guidelines, and development review.
PATTERNS OF DEVELOPMENT
Growth and Agricultural Lands
In addition to the direct economic benefits contributed by agriculture to the City, a variety of
indirect, yet equally important benefits generated by agricultural land may affect the future
growth and development of Colusa. Factors such as location, intensity, and type of new growth
can be guided by the management of agricultural land and land adjacent to agricultural land.
Establishing policies regarding the transition of agricultural lands and the handling of the
interface between agricultural lands and non-agricultural lands will allow the City to carefully
and thoughtfully evaluate land use proposals. In addition, such policies may lead to the creation
of enhanced land use alternatives and can help to ensure that valuable agricultural resources
are not converted to urban uses unnecessarily or prematurely.
Because large expanses of agricultural land are located adjacent to the City limits, as are
various areas proposed for annexation and/or development, consideration will be given to the
need for agricultural buffers as new development extends outward from the existing urban
edge. In cases where an agricultural buffer may be required to mitigate impacts created by
the agriculture-urban interface, the General Plan supports the use of various techniques to give
the City and project proponents flexibility in project design through the use of the Urban Reserve
land use designations, density transfers, agricultural easements, land transfers to non-profit
farmland trusts, and private agreements between developers and agricultural land owners. The
City’s continuing support of agricultural activity on farmlands adjacent to or inside of the Sphere
of Influence will discourage the speculative acquisition and conversion of agricultural land and
serve as an effective tool in controlling and directing urban expansion.
Conversion of Vacant Land
With the proposals for annexation and development of Brookins Ranch, the Vann property, and
parcels between SR 20/45 and the Sacramento River, land is expected to convert at a fairly
rapid rate from vacant or agricultural use to residential and commercial uses. The City’s Land
Use Element allows for development of these properties at urban densities out to the edge of the
proposed SOI, thereby avoiding or minimizing development that by-passes available sites closer

to the City. When land at the urban edge is developed, the City may require infrastructure
improvements such as the over-sizing of utility lines and street rights-of-way, as well as applying
appropriate Design Guidelines acknowledging that growth may occur beyond the project site.
Large tracts of land that comprise Brookins Ranch, the Vann property, and properties east of
Highway 20/45 are likely to be multi-phased developments. The City will encourage that
successive project phases tie into existing development closer to or adjacent to the developed
portions of the City. This pattern is preferred over any development proposal beginning at the
edges of individual projects or the edge of the sphere of influence.
Effects of Regional Growth Management Policies
The State Office of Planning and Research General Plan Guidelines discuss the need for a
community to look beyond its jurisdictional boundaries toward areas in the region that could
significantly affect the community’s quality of life. The enactment of local growth management
policies in many jurisdictions has tended to shift the direction of growth toward jurisdictions
whose growth management policies are limited or nonexistent. By pushing growth toward the
path of least resistance, local controls often have failed to produce the desired objectives of
reducing impacts from growth, and the impacts simply shift from one area or region to another.
Therefore, the City intends to monitor and actively comment on the land use decisions of Colusa
County, as well as monitor neighboring Yolo and Sutter counties to ensure that development
patterns and intensities do not shift in a manner that will adversely affect the citizens of Colusa
and preclude the City from achieving its community goals. Specifically, the areas of concern in
this General Plan include the areas of unincorporated Colusa County to the south and west of
the City limits.
GROWTH PROJECTIONS
Residential
Due to the flexibility within the proposed land use types and range of densities within the mixed
use districts, the Land Use Element cannot quantitatively compare buildout scenarios under the
1994 General Plan with the proposed 2025 General Plan. With the future development
anticipated under the 2025 General Plan, the City will, however, experience a substantial
increase in the ratio of developed residential to non-residential land. The buildout of this
General Plan (as compared to actual population projections) is based on buildout of the
planning area (SOI) assuming a mid-range density for all residential land use types.
When combined with existing development, buildout under a mid-range density over the 20-
year timeframe of the proposed General Plan could yield as many as 9,089 total dwelling units
and a total population of approximately 25,000 persons. If the entire plan area were to build out
under the 20-year timeframe of this General Plan, this would represent an average annual
growth rate of 6.45 percent.
While this General Plan anticipates that residential growth will occur at a higher annual rate over
the next 20 years than has been experienced during the last 20 years, it is unlikely that the
annual growth rate will approach half of this 6.45 percent. However, for planning purposes, the
General Plan assumes that, based on economic conditions and land proposed for annexation
and development, growth rates between 2005 and 2025 will be substantially greater than the
0.95 rate experienced during the last 20 years. A three to four percent growth rate is expected

over the next 20 years but could exceed that rate initially as areas are annexed to the city and
development occurs.
Non-Residential/Employment
A total of 600 acres of non-residential land uses are proposed for the planning area included in
this General Plan; these land uses include Commercial/Professional, Office Professional/Light
Industrial, Industrial, Mixed Use, and Urban Reserve – County Industrial. Each type of land use can
be expected to generate a specific number of square-feet of developed space, and a specific
number of employees for that space. Over the 20-year planning period, job growth in the
Planning Area is anticipated to increase by an estimated 3,000 to 8,300 new jobs (based on
additional square feet that will be available for a variety of non-residential uses). Coupled with
the square-footage that could be constructed under buildout of the 1994 General Plan, which
could generate up to 2,900 jobs, at build-out, the non-residential land uses identified in this plan
could generate between approximately 5,900 and 11,200 new jobs
Jobs/Housing Balance
Jobs/housing balance refers to the ratio of jobs to dwelling units within a given community. For
the purpose of reducing commute times, it is generally accepted that a balanced ratio
between jobs and housing is optimal. However, instances could exist in which a community may
prefer to have a ratio that is skewed in favor of one side or the other. The City of Colusa has
historically maintained a relatively balanced jobs/housing ratio, with most residents employed
within the City or the immediate surrounding area. While the future jobs/housing balance will
depend in large part on the economic trends of the region and state, it is anticipated that the
amount of land allocated to residential development, mixed use, commercial, and industrial will
likely maintain a ratio consistent with or better than current trends. The amount of non-
residential land within the City’s proposed SOI, in combination with industrial land in close
proximity to the City’s planning boundary, is anticipated to be sufficient to maintain a
reasonable jobs/housing balance.
The jobs/housing ratio will ultimately depend on commute behavior, local employment
opportunities by occupation and wage, housing and income needs, and the rate of both jobs
and housing growth within the City’s planning area. The policies and implementing programs in
this Land Use element are intended to promote a reasonable jobs/housing balance with the
understanding that this relationship will also be affected by regional housing and employment
center development, as well as personal preferences that determine where workers and
households choose to locate.
AREAS OF LAND USE CHANGE
This General Plan update includes a proposed expansion of the existing Sphere of Influence from
approximately 2,842 acres to approximately 3,805 acres (Figure 2.3). The majority of land
included in the updated sphere of influence is designated for residential development or has
been designated as Urban Reserve.
As indicated by the various development proposals presented to the City, substantial interest
has been shown by property owners and development interests to develop land adjacent to
the current City limits. The City’s policies reflect the belief that the proposed urban level of
development would be more appropriately served by the City than by the County, if municipal
services are available to do so. By expanding Colusa’s SOI, the City can plan for this level of
development and work with property owners and Colusa County toward providing efficient

municipal services and preventing duplication of services by the County or private service
providers.
Due to the heightened level of interest in developing portions of the Planning Area, the lack of
an annexation strategy could lead to a pattern of land use conversion that may result in leap-
frog development, infrastructure financing problems, and an increased need for vehicle trips.
These conditions could potentially result in adverse impacts to the existing quality of life and
fragmentation of the community. To help ensure that annexations do not occur in a disjointed
fashion, the City intends to prepare and adopt an Annexation Phasing Plan that will create a
logical phasing of land annexation and development to ensure that future projects maintain a
balance of land uses with proper timing, adequate financing, and provision of infrastructure.
DENSITY/INTENSITY DEFINED
Dwelling Units per Acre (du/ac)
The term ‘dwelling units per acre’ is used in the General Plan to describe the number of homes,
apartments, condominium units, or other types of dwelling units to be built on an acre of land.
The General Plan considers gross density, or the number of units on all residential land area within
the land use district to include streets, parks, and other open space. Related terms such as net
density, base density, and site density involve calculations derived from gross density – typically
applied to specific projects – but are not terms used in this planning document.
Proposed densities range from a low of 1-3 du/ac in the Estate Residential district to a high of 12-
20 du/ac in the High Density Residential district. The lower density ranges are intended to
accommodate single-family residential uses, while the higher density ranges will accommodate
multi-family development such as apartments, condominiums, and town homes. Urban Reserve
lands remain at the densities/intensities allowed under the current Colusa County General Plan.
Floor Area Ratio (FAR)
The term ‘floor area ratio’ which is expressed in a percentage or decimal, is used in the General
Plan to indicate non-residential land use intensity—the gross floor area of all buildings permitted
on a lot divided by the area of the lot. A higher FAR will allow for a greater range of activities in
one place, increasing the likelihood that multiple shopping tasks will be accomplished with one
auto trip.
A typical single-story suburban shopping center has a FAR of 0.2-0.25, or 20-25 percent of the
total site. For example, a 10-acre parcel (435,600 square feet) would yield approximately 80,000-
100,000 square feet of commercial space.
A small downtown shopping district may have FARs on individual parcels as high as 2.0 or 200
percent of the site area, since parking is often in public lots or on the street, and most of the
parcel is covered by two or more stories of building. FARs for land use designations will range
from 0.25 for commercial/professional uses to 2.00 in mixed-use districts that also contain
medium-to-high density residential.
Related terms such as net base and site intensity involve calculations derived from gross FARs—
typically applied to specific projects—but are not terms used in this planning document.

Land Use Designations
The General Plan assigns eleven (11) land use designations to land within the City’s Planning
Area, including four designated subcategories within the general Mixed Use designation. The
specific locations of these land use designations or “districts” are shown on the General Plan
Land Use Map, Figure 2.3. The General Plan land use designations define the type, density,
intensity, distribution, and general location of each land use category proposed.
(Note: These land use designations should not be confused with “zoning districts” that regulate
and provide standards for specific uses. Land use designations have the purpose of providing
general guidance for future land use, rather than specific detailed development standards and
regulations found in the Zoning Ordinance.)
The following descriptions generally define the land use designations that collectively constitute
the Land Use Map. Descriptions, land use densities/intensities, and design characteristics have
been developed to ensure compatibility between land uses as projects are developed.
Definitions include the general intent and focus of each land use district; they suggest what
complementary or supporting uses would be appropriate. The allowable uses incorporate any
existing entitlements that may already be in place within these districts.
Estate Residential (ER)
The Estate Residential (ER) land use district accommodates very low density residential
development—lands generally to northwest, south, and southeast of the City core area. Very
low to low-density housing developments are intended for these areas. The ER designation can
provide for large-lot residential development that permits small-scale agricultural uses.
Development within these areas is limited to single-family homes, including second residential
units, and related accessory uses that have rural residential characteristics. The density range is
established as 1-3 dwelling units per acre, although a lower density would be acceptable.
Low Density Residential (LDR)
The Low Density Residential (LDR) land use district is generally distributed throughout the City and
most unincorporated areas within the SOI. LDR development is intended to allow for single-
family homes and accessory residential uses, including second residential units. The density is
intended to fall within the range of 3-8 dwelling units per acre, although a lower density would
be allowed. Additionally, schools, day-care centers, places of religious assembly, and nursing
homes may be considered as permitted by the Zoning Ordinance.
Medium Density Residential (MDR)
The Medium Density Residential (MDR) land use district is generally found in the eastern portion
of the City, east of the Bridge Street corridor, and in the western region north of the SR 20
corridor. The MDR designation is intended for a variety of housing product types, including
detached townhouses, duplexes, and triplexes.            This designation emphasizes residential
development that promotes home ownership of affordable housing. Factors for consideration
of development in this designation include density, scale, mass, buffering, and provision of open
space. The density range for this land use is designated as 8-12 dwelling units per acre, although
a lower density would be allowed. Additionally, schools, day care centers, places of religious
assembly, and nursing homes may be considered as permitted by the Zoning Ordinance.

2.0 LAND USE
High Density Residential (HDR)
The High Density Residential (HDR) land use district is generally located along the SR 20/45
corridor and in the western Planning Area north of the SR 20 corridor. The HDR designation
provides for apartments, condominiums, and townhomes that can provide affordable housing
for a range of income levels. Density, building character, scale, and massing complementary to
surrounding land uses are important factors to consider in development within the HDR areas. It
is the intent to concentrate multi-family residential development in close proximity to transit lines,
commercial businesses, and public services where transit, pedestrian, and bicycle trips will be
convenient. The density is intended to fall within a range of 12-20 dwelling units per acre,
although a lower density would be acceptable. Additionally, schools, day care centers, places
of religious assembly, and nursing homes may be considered as permitted by the Zoning
Ordinance.
Urban Reserve (UR)
The Urban Reserve (UR) land use district is generally located in three areas of the City: 1) on the
east side of the City, south of Moon Bend Road, 2) in the southern portion of the City south
Walnut Ranch on both side of Wescott Road, and 3) west of the 14th Street, north of Wilson
Avenue.
The UR designation identifies areas outside of the urban service area in the unincorporated
County area, but within the Sphere of Influence (SOI) of the City, in which future development
and extension of municipal services are contemplated but not imminent. By identifying land
within the SOI suitable for future development, the UR district also serves as a “special interest
area” in which it is the City’s policy and intention that all development proposals within the
district are subject to joint review by both the County and City.
Until such time that this UR land is pre-zoned and annexed by the City, UR land is intended to
develop with land uses at the densities/intensities specified in Colusa County’s General Plan and
Zoning Ordinance.
Commercial Professional (CP)
The Commercial Professional (CP) land use district focuses on parcels in the southern portion of
the City of Colusa along the SR 20/45 corridor, as well as the western Planning Area north of SR
20. The CP designation allows for, but is not limited to, uses such as retail sales, automotive
services, hotels/motels, and professional offices. Land designated CP is generally within or
contiguous to developed areas that are served by the circulation network and are situated in
close proximity to areas where future residential growth is anticipated. The FAR within the
Commercial Professional land use designation is expected to range from .25 to .5, as
development will likely be service-based and will need to accommodate automobile parking
on site.
Mixed Use (MU)
The Mixed Use (MU) district is applied to four specific areas within the City, with each area
intended to emphasize a mix of land uses. Development within each MU area would be
tailored to each respective locale, generally providing for a pedestrian-oriented live/work/play
environment, where the business community, residents, and visitors mingle in a dynamic setting,
walking from offices to restaurants to shops to home. Within areas identified as MU on the Land
Use Map, Specific Plans may be used as an appropriate planning tool to further define the land

use mix and to provide additional use guidelines. FARs within the MU districts provide for
relatively high intensity development within these locations and may be two-story and occupy
nearly 100 percent of the parcel. Mixed Use districts may permit parking to be located off site,
thereby allowing more of the parcel to be used for the building. The MU locations and
descriptions are as follows:
    1) Main Street Mixed Use District – The Main Street Mixed Use District extends east to west
         between 13th Street and D Street, and north to south from the Sacramento River to
         Market Street. Preservation of historic features, building design, streetscape design,
         signage, and the use of creative parking strategies (with less restrictive parking
         requirements) would be integral components of development in this area along Main
         Street. This MU district is generally characterized by vertically and horizontally integrated
         retail, office-professional, and medium-to-high intensity commercial uses. Visitor-serving
         uses are encouraged in this district, including lodging, conference centers, arts and craft
         studios, wine tasting facilities, antique stores, newsstands, and fresh produce stands as
         permitted by the Zoning Ordinance. The FAR within the Main Street Mixed Use District will
         range from a minimum of .5 to a maximum of 2.0.
    2) Downtown Commercial Mixed Use District –The Downtown Commercial Mixed Use
         District, located between Market and Oak Street and south of the Main Street District , is
         generally characterized by a vertically and horizontally integrated mix of retail, office,
         professional, and service uses that serve daily shopping needs. Retail uses will generally
         predominate.        Permitted residential uses would include high-density residential
         apartments and condominiums (12-20 du/ac). The Downtown Commercial Mixed Use
         District will accommodate a FAR ranging from a minimum of .35 to a maximum of 2.0.
    3) Bridge Street Mixed Use District – Located along the east side of town, south of Oak Street
         along the Bridge Street corridor, the Bridge Street Mixed Use District is intended for transit-
         oriented development that provides a horizontally integrated mix of retail, professional,
         and service uses directed toward area residents and travelers along Bridge Street.
         Permitted residential uses would include medium- to high-density residential uses (8-20
         du/ac). Other uses could include those pertaining to family-oriented services, markets,
         and professional offices as permitted by the Zoning Ordinance. As the Bridge Street
         Mixed Use District allows horizontally integrated commercial uses along with medium to
         high-density residential, the FAR will range from a minimum of .35 to maximum of 1.0.
    4) Residential Mixed Use District – Generally located south of Oak Street and along Fremont
         Street between 10th and Bridge Streets, a horizontally integrated mix of residential, retail,
         professional and service uses is intended for the Residential Mixed Use District. Residential
         uses will predominate and be built at low-to-medium densities (3-12 du/ac). Other uses
         would complement residential developments, including parks, childcare facilities, and
         other neighborhood conveniences to serve residents. The Residential Mixed Use District
         would be the least intensive of all of the mixed-use districts. Low- to medium-density
         residential development, horizontally integrated with commercial and neighborhood
         conveniences to serve residents, would be accommodated with a FAR ranging from a
         minimum of .25 to a maximum of .75.
Office Professional/Light Industrial (OP/LI)
The Office Professional/Light Industrial designation is generally located south of SR 20 on the west
side of the City and west of SR 20/45 north of Moon Bend Road. Additional land designated for
Office Professional/Light Industrial use is situated along 14th Street between Wilson and Lurline

Avenues. This designation includes an integrated mix of professional offices with light industrial
uses.
Office Professional uses include medical, legal, financial, and other professional and
administrative offices and services. Other uses could include small, accessory-level commercial
uses that support the principal office uses such as day care facilities, small eateries, and coffee
shops as permitted by the Zoning Ordinance. Light Industrial uses include research and
development facilities, warehousing, manufacturing, fabrication, assembly and distribution of
consumer goods, or other uses which do not create excessive noise, smoke, odors, or other
objectionable nuisances to adjacent non-industrial zoned areas. Commercial uses in the office
professional/light industrial area shall be incidental to the primary use. Uses within this
designation can vary widely as they relate to the amount of parking required. For example,
medical or other offices might require more onsite parking than uses such as warehousing or
research and development facilities. As such, FARs are expected to range in size from a
minimum of .25 to a maximum of .75.
Parks/Recreation/Open Space (P/OS)
Parks, Recreation, and Open Space land uses are designated throughout the City of Colusa,
with the largest areas located in the southern portion of the City Planning Area. Open space
areas are also designated along the bank of the Sacramento River. This designation includes
lands suitable for park development, bike paths, greenbelts, nature preserves, and uses which
provide indoor and outdoor recreation opportunities for Colusa residents and visitors. This
designation applies to open space lands, which includes lands not suited for development due
to environmental conditions or location attributes, and to lands intended to remain in their
undeveloped natural state. Upon completion of the City’s Parks and Recreation Master Plan,
specific park types will be evaluated and sites identified on a project-specific level.
Industrial (IND)
The Industrial land use designation applies to properties generally located west of Will S. Green
Avenue south of SR 20, and the west side of SR 20/45 south of Farinon Road. This designation is
intended to accommodate more intense industrial uses than the Light Industrial areas. Uses in
this designation could include manufacturing, warehousing, and processing applications. The
Industrial land has been designated where necessary services such as transportation systems
and utilities exist or can be efficiently provided, and where disruption of adjacent uses will be
minimal. FARs would typically range from a minimum of .10 to a maximum of .75.
Public Facilities (PF)
The Public Facilities land use designation applies to land uses serving the public benefit. This
designation provides for a full-range of public and private facilities distributed throughout the
City of Colusa. Public Facility uses include schools, City and County offices, parks, municipal
utility locations, and the County hospital.
GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING CONSISTENCY
The zoning code serves as the primary tool for implementing the City’s General Plan land use
policies. State planning law requires the zoning code to be consistent with the General Plan.
Each General Plan land use designation will have one or more corresponding zoning districts.
While the General Plan is intended to be broad in its discussion of permitted land uses and
development intensities, zoning provisions must identify specific regulations so that property

SPECIAL PLANNING AREAS
The following areas are designated as Special Planning Areas (SPA) of the City. The boundaries
of these SPAs are shown in Figure 2.4. SPAs 1-5, as described below, are recognized as unique
planning areas that will provide substantial new growth and redevelopment opportunities for the
City. At the same time, these areas, along with SPA 6, present challenges that will require a
comprehensive planning approach in conjunction with the City’s efforts to improve
infrastructure and services citywide. It is the intent of this General Plan that these SPAs will be
planned, annexed, and ultimately developed through the use of specific plans or planned

2.0 LAND USE
Riverfront District
SPA 1:         Colusa Riverfront District - Colusa’s Riverfront District is bounded by the
               Sacramento River to the north, 13th Street to the west, Oak Street to the south,
               and Bridge Street to the east. This SPA will be given special attention with regard
               to architectural design, orientation, and land uses. All new development and
               redevelopment projects proposed within this district will be subject to
               development standards and design guidelines that will constitute the Riverfront
               Plan. The Riverfront Plan will be prepared by the City and will be incorporated by
               reference into the City’s Zoning Ordinance.
               The area surrounding the Riverfront District effectively serves as the principal City
               center. It achieves this in part through the many historic buildings that occupy
               the historic downtown/riverfront area (a reminder of the City’s origins) and in its
               varied retail and service establishments. Riverfront Plan development standards
               and design guidelines demonstrate the City’s commitment to enhancing the
               area and promoting local and visitor-serving businesses.
               Future development of the Riverfront District will largely occur as new infill projects
               and redevelopment. Projects will be expected to improve the aesthetic
               character and economic health of this historic district. Expansion of existing uses
               will be encouraged to include high-density residential units. Vertical expansion
               will be expected to maximize the use of and scenic views from this premium land,
               while increasing commercial vitality and creating affordable live-work housing
               opportunities.
New Growth Areas
Adjacent to the city limits and within the Planning Area are significant acreages of vacant land
that present new growth opportunities for the City. Each of these areas is being actively
planned for urban development, consistent with the Land Use Map (Figure 2.3), and is
considered appropriate for annexation into the City. Concurrent with this comprehensive
General Plan update, work has been ongoing with property owners and developers of SPAs 2-5
(described below) to create development proposals that will be consistent with the General
Plan. The results of these efforts have been incorporated into the SPA descriptions for their
respective areas. While the General Plan designates a range of land uses and assumes
development to occur at the mid-range of allowable densities, project-specific information was
submitted for use by the City and incorporated into this General Plan. This process has aided in
the formulation of policies and implementing actions that will allow new urban development to
occur without compromising the quality of life for existing Colusa residents. New growth SPAs
include:

SPA 2:              Brookins Ranch Estates – The Brookins Ranch Estates property consists of a 161.4-
                    acre vacant site located on unincorporated land adjacent to the southwest
                    boundary of Colusa. It is bounded on the west by Will S. Green Avenue, on the
                    north by Colusa High School, on the east by Tennant Estates subdivision
                    (approximately one-quarter mile west of Wescott Road), and on the south by the
                    old railroad right-of-way. The site, which is designated AgricultureTransition (A-T)
                    in the Colusa County General Plan, has not been farmed recently but contains
                    farm buildings along with a single-family residence.
                    The City’s intent for this planning area is that it be annexed to the City with a land
                    use designation of low-density residential LDR. Based on a mid-range density of
                    six dwelling units per acre, the General Plan would allow for maximum
                    development of approximately 600 units. Brookins Ranch would be developed as
                    a planned development to provide flexibility in site design and density
                    distribution.
                    Brookins Ranch Development Proposal The current proposal for Brookins Ranch
                    Estates is annexation of the 161.4 acres to be developed as a single-family
                    residential neighborhood. This would extend the city limits south to the old
                    railroad right-of-way, with an additional small triangle of land south of this
                    boundary reserved for onsite stormwater detention. The land use plan proposes
                    600 single-family lots ranging from 4,000 to 9,600 square feet. The existing Brookins
                    residence would remain on a 4.3-acre parcel. A fire station, two parks, and a
                    parking lot to jointly serve the high school and one of the two parks would be
                    constructed. Colusa Unified School District’s facilities plan will determine whether
                    the site may need to accommodate additional school facilities. City storm
                    drainage, water, and sewer facilities would be upgraded as needed prior to
                    development in order for the City to serve the new residents. The proposed
                    subdivision is laid out on a modified grid street system, which would provide two
                    access points at the north by extending 5th and 8th Streets, three connections to
                    Will S. Green Avenue on the west side, and connection to Tennant Drive on the
                    east side of the subdivision. Proposed land uses for this site are shown in Table 2.2
                    below.

2.0 LAND USE
SPA 3:           Colusa Crossings (Vann Property) – This 310-acre site is located adjacent to the
                 western boundary of the city. The site is bounded by State Route 20 to the east
                 and south and agricultural land to the west and north. The site is currently
                 designated Agricultural-Transition (A-T) and a small amount of Commercial (C) in
                 the Colusa County General Plan.
                 Colusa Crossings is well-suited for a master-planned community that could offer a
                 variety of uses to serve the entire community, and the site has been designated
                 with a range of densities. This will allow development of a variety of housing types
                 for a range of income groups. In addition, Colusa Crossing’s strategic location on
                 SR 20 will allow for viable commercial services for not only the development, but
                 for all City residents and travelers along the highway. While this SPA is considered
                 a possible location for the City’s community park, the size and location for this
                 type of park will not be determined until the City’s Parks and Recreation Master
                 Plan has been completed.
                 The City’s intent for this planning area is that it be annexed to the City with a mix
                 of land uses including low-, medium-, and high-density residential (LDR, MDR, and
                 HDR); commercial professional (CP); public facilities (PF); and Parks, Recreation,
                 and Open Space (P/OS). Based on a mid-range density assumption of six (6)
                 dwelling units per acre for LDR, 10 dwelling units per acre for MDR, and 16
                 dwelling units per acre of HDR, the General Plan would allow for a development
                 of a range of uses with a maximum 1,550 residential units and up to 402,930
                 square feet of commercial space. The Vann Property area would be developed
                 under a specific plan or as a planned development to provide flexibility in site
                 design and density distribution.
                 Colusa Crossings Development Proposal Colusa Crossings proposes a mix of uses
                 for this area to include low-, medium, and high-density residential units; an
                 elementary school site; a neighborhood or community park and other open
                 space to serve the residents; and a mix of commercial uses to serve local
                 residents and travelers along SR 20. City storm drainage, water, and sewer
                 facilities would be upgraded as needed prior to development in order for the
                 City to serve the new residents. The specific land uses that have been proposed
                 for development on this site are shown in Table 2.3 below.

 SPA 4:           Colusa Riverbend – Colusa Riverbend encompasses approximately 442 acres in
                  the northeast and eastern portion of Colusa’s Planning Area. The aggregate of
                  land is roughly bounded by the Sacramento River to the north and east, Highway
                  20/45 to the west, and Moon Bend Road to the south. This SPA is comprised
                  mostly of unincorporated land with multiple owners; the exception is the northern
                  80-acre parcel (formerly known as Riverbend), which is located within the City
                  limits and presently designated Residential in the City of Colusa General Plan.
                  The remaining unincorporated land is designated Rural Residential (RR) and a
                  small portion of Industrial (to the south) in the Colusa County General Plan.
                  The City’s intent for this planning area is that the entire area be annexed to the
                  City to be master-planned and developed with low- and medium-density
                  residential (LDR and MDR) development. Based on a mid-range density of six (6)
                  dwelling units per acre for LDR and 10 dwelling units per acre for MDR
                  development, the General Plan would allow for development of up to 2,530 units.
                  Colusa Riverbend would be developed under a Specific Plan or as a planned
                  development to provide flexibility in site design and density distribution.
                  Colusa Riverbend Development Proposal The 76-acre parcel presently in the
                  City limits would be developed as a planned development during the first phase
                  of development of this plan area. A Colusa Riverbend Specific Plan will be
                  prepared to serve as the City’s long-range plan for development of the portion of
                  Colusa Riverbend area outside the existing City limits. The Specific Plan would be
                  the planning and regulatory document for the purpose of implementing the
                  City’s General Plan, providing a bridge between the broad policies contained in
                  this General Plan and any detailed project-specific development plan
                  proposal(s). In accordance with California Government Code §65450-65457,
                  which provides guidelines for specific plan preparation and implementation, the
                  plan would include landscaping and design guidelines, development standards,
                  and a financing plan that identifies funding for new infrastructure and public
                  services. This specific plan would be adopted by the City of Colusa, consistent
                  with the General Plan, and serve as the policy document to accomplish buildout
                  within the Colusa Riverbend area.
                  Another component of the proposed Colusa Riverbend project is a Land Use
                  Plan, which provides for a range of residential housing types at a density ranging
                  from six (6)-10 dwelling units per acre. Under the specific plan’s buildout scenario,
                  this would result in approximately 2,530 single-family, detached units. It also
                  proposes an elementary school, parks, and open space land uses for the 442-

2.0 LAND USE
             acre area. City storm drainage, water, and sewer facilities would be upgraded
             as needed prior to development in order for the City to serve the new residents.
             The conceptual land use plan shows a macro grid street system, consistent with
             the City’s Circulation Map (see Chapter 4). This would include: 1) a North-South
             Collector extending east from Market Street into the middle of Colusa Riverbend,
             then heading south to Moon Bend Road; 2) the extension of Darling Lane from
             Bridge Street (at the intersection with Carson Street) to the North-South Collector;
             3) extension of D Street from Darling Lane to the North-South Collector.
             Prior to annexation and development of the unincorporated areas, the 80-acre
             Cribari property—a portion of Colusa Riverbend that is already within the City
             limits—will be proposed for development under a separate planning application.
             The project will propose subdivision and development of this land under a
             planned development— 360 residential units with eight acres of parks, open
             space, an enhanced drainage corridor, and river access. The development
             would be consistent with, and eventually be integrated into, the ultimate Colusa-
             Riverbend Specific Plan area.
SPA 5:       Colusa Industrial Park – Colusa Industrial Park, located adjacent to the south of
             Colusa’s city limits, comprises approximately 137.5 acres of the 1,049-acre Colusa
             Industrial Properties (CIP) complex. The site is roughly bounded by State Route
             20/45 to the east, Colusa Golf Club to the north, Wescott Road to the west, and
             CIP’s agricultural lands to the south. Existing businesses and an agricultural
             service complex are located on the northern portion of the site, while
             approximately 127 acres are presently vacant. The site is currently designated as
             Industrial (I) in the Colusa County General Plan.
             The City’s intent for this planning area is that it be annexed to the City with a mix
             of land uses including low-density residential (LDR) on the western portion of the
             site; commercial professional (CP) along the SR 20/45 corridor; and Parks,
             Recreation and Open Space (P/OS). Portions of this SPA are situated within the
             Colusa County Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) safety zones—the
             clear zone, approach/depart zone and overflight zone, as shown in Figure 2.5. At
             a mid-range density of six (6) dwelling units per acre and commercial intensity of
             between .25 and .5 FAR, the General Plan would allow for development of 253
             residential units and up to 827,640 square feet of commercial space. Colusa
             Industrial Park would be developed as a planned development to provide
             flexibility in site design.
             Colusa Industrial Park Proposal A proposal to develop the site with a mix of
             residential, commercial, and recreation uses is currently being processed through
             the County of Colusa Planning Department. The project, if approved, would
             result in an urbanized development outside of the city limits, consisting of
             approximately 50 acres of residential land to be developed with 200 single-family
             homes; a high-density residential complex; approximately 28 acres of commercial
             uses (e.g., motel, restaurant, and other highway commercial services);
             approximately 56 acres of open space to be developed as a nine-hole golf
             course facility, and a separate wastewater treatment plant.
             The City of Colusa is currently unable to provide domestic wastewater treatment
             capacity for the CIP proposal. Thus, CIP has proposed two alternatives: The first is

                                                                                       2.0 LAND USE
                to develop and offer for dedication to the City a separate 100,000 gallon-per-day
                (gpd) wastewater treatment plant to be built on approximately 34 acres of CIP
                property now permitted by the County for industrial process wastewater disposal.
                The second alternative calls for building a larger 800,000 gpd treatment plant
                (expandable to 1.2 million gpd) in the same location, dedicating the property to
                the City, reserving a larger portion (150-350 acres) of CIP’s permitted land
                application wastewater discharge, abandoning the City existing treatment
                facility, and converting that facility to a transfer pumping station to transport
                current flow to the new facility.
These new growth areas comprise significantly more land than what is currently forecast to meet
future City needs. However, recent growth trends and market pressures in the region suggest an
increased demand for housing and related commercial services is present. With this General
Plan update and subsequent implementing Master Plans, urban development can be directed
to within the city limits, and it is anticipated that Colusa will be prepared to accommodate this
new growth.
Airport Influence Area
SPA 6:          The Colusa County Airport and a portion of the Colusa Industrial Park site (SPA 5),
                are situated within the Airport Influence Area—specifically, the Airport Safety
                Zones, which include the clear zone, approach/depart zone and overflight zone,
                as delineated in the CLUP (see Figure 2.5). Most of the land in the airport
                overflight zone that is within the Planning Area is either the airport facility or land
                that is designated as Parks/Recreation/Open Space (P/OS).
                Of the three airport safety zones designated by the CLUP, the clear zone is the
                most restrictive, the approach/depart zone is somewhat restrictive, and the
                overflight zone is the least restrictive of the three airport safety zones. The
                overflight zone generally coincides with the area overflown by aircraft during
                normal traffic pattern procedures. This zone allows for residential development of
                up to one dwelling unit per five (5) acres. Whether proposed for annexation or
                not, the City will review all project proposals within the CLUP Airport Overflight
                Zone to ensure compliance with the CLUP.
INFILL AREAS
The General Plan encourages infill development that will help create a more compact
downtown center with a diverse mix of land uses, increase connectivity between
neighborhoods and uses, and provide a greater range of community amenities. The City will
promote infill projects on lands contiguous to existing development and infrastructure to prevent
the premature conversion of agricultural lands to urban uses and minimize the cost of
infrastructure and services to non-infill developments.
Infill development will continue on vacant land within the City limits – primarily to include parcels
surrounded by existing development with available infrastructure. This would include parcels in
the downtown core area, residential land along Wescott Road, and parcels in the vicinity of the
commercial center at the intersection of Bridge and Carson Streets. Infill development could
include rehabilitation of existing structures, demolition, and new construction. Redevelopment
of aging residential complexes in areas designated for medium-to-high residential development
are acceptable in infill areas if the project results in the retention or increase off the number of
rental units, consistent with the Housing Element.

SPECIAL PLANNING TOOLS
Specific Plans
Government Code §63450 authorizes cities to adopt specific plans to implement the General
Plan in designated areas. The specific plan will be used as a planning tool to guide and
encourage comprehensive planning and provide for urban design flexibility in localized
development areas that propose a mix of residential and non-residential land uses. While the
General Plan is the primary guide for growth and development in Colusa, specific plans will
focus on the unique characteristics of a special planning area by customizing the vision, land
uses, design guidelines, and development standards for that area.
A specific plan will designate all land uses and the geographic boundaries of each use allowed
in the specific plan area. A high level of detail on the types of uses to be permitted,
development standards (setbacks, heights, landscape, architecture, etc.), and circulation and
infrastructure improvements will be included in the plan. An implementation plan, including
infrastructure, phasing, and financing will be required with each plan.
A specific plan may be adopted by resolution (as a document of policies and standards) or as
an ordinance. The City will revise the Zoning Ordinance to identify specific plan requirements for
special planning areas.
Planned Developments
A Planned Development (PD) may accomplish objectives similar to those of a specific plan
within special planning areas. The purpose of a planned development is to allow diversification
in the development of one or more land uses and ensure complementary uses, building types,
complementary structures (e.g., club houses, community facilities, neighborhood commercial,
etc.), and open spaces. Planned developments may require flexibility in zoning standards such
as setbacks, height requirements, and density distribution, where appropriate, to achieve the
City’s vision for that area. Planned development applications will be accompanied by a
general development plan that identifies the zoning, development standards, design guidelines,
and implementation program for development within the project area. This approach will help
ensure not only substantial compliance with the city's General Plan and the provisions of the
Colusa Municipal Code, but will provide a means for comprehensive, rather than incremental,
planning for large parcels, particularly the Special Planning Areas described above.
Planned developments are intended for both large-scale developments and on smaller parcels,
such as infill sites, where special characteristics of the site merit and would benefit from flexible
zoning considerations.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Colusa’s location, at the intersection of two state highways, provides an advantage for its retail
economy. Colusa has three highway ingresses, all of which funnel traffic through the downtown.
The highway layouts, combined with the historic small town commercial sites, provide a distinct
advantage to the City’s opportunity for economic development. Colusa’s retail sector is the
predominant influence on its economy, as well as the major generator of tax revenues to the
City.
While commercial growth in Colusa during the years 1981-2001 was slow, it has shown some
modest growth in recent years. The average annual growth rate in taxable sales in the City over

2.0 LAND USE
the last twenty years has been approximately 5.3 percent per year. Average new construction
of commercial uses averaged 3,400 square feet a year. In 1988, this pattern of slow growth
changed when the Town and Country Shopping Center was built, creating 55,000 square feet of
new commercial space at the corner of Carson and Bridge Streets. As business leveled off
during the 1990s, the development created concern about the future vitality of commercial
sales in the historic downtown area.
In the past 20 years, Colusa has experienced fluctuations in its total taxable sales, with the
highest average annual increase of 26.4 percent between 1983 and 1984 and, more recently,
an 18.4 percent increase between 1998 and 1999. Although these increases in taxable sales are
encouraging, the City has also historically seen an average annual decrease of between 9.2
and 14.7 percent in the consecutive years of 1990 to 1991 and 1991 to 1992. Data from the
California State Board of Equalization suggests that between 1996 and 2001 (the most complete
recent data set), the City experienced an average annual increase of 8.1 percent in total
taxable sales. The increased taxable sales represent growth in the economic base in Colusa, as
well as increased commercial growth. Tax revenues are expected to increase with anticipated
future commercial expansion and redevelopment.
As with many cities in the State of California, the City of Colusa currently faces serious economic
challenges. In recent years, State government has increasingly shifted and utilized local
government tax revenue to balance the state budget. This trend has hurt local government
economies, adversely impacting local jobs, services, and infrastructure improvements. In
Colusa, very limited fiscal resources are available to fund and maintain vital community services.
The City has experienced minimal development over recent years and, consequently, there are
few employment opportunities for local residents. While it is not likely the City can create jobs for
every Colusa resident, it can take steps in this General Plan to address employment by creating
more job opportunities through General Plan land use policies, economic strategies, and
programs that will enable Colusa’s local economy to improve.
Economic development creates revenues for the City to use to provide public services.
Industrial, commercial, and professional office development affects the community’s fiscal
health in various ways.
Cost
Generally, providing necessary public services for non-residential development is substantially
less costly than for residential development because schools and most emergency service
needs are directly related to 24-hour residents. In addition, low- to medium-density housing
typically takes up three to 10 times more land area than required for non-residential which
translates into fewer tax dollars for the City.
Revenues
Commercial, office, and manufacturing facilities generate the following revenues to local
government.
    •    Property Tax: Property taxes for commercial, office, and manufacturing uses usually are
         higher than those for residential development because of the greater expense, size, and
         complexity of commercial and industrial buildings.
General Plan                                                                            City of Colusa
Final                                                                                    October 2007
                                                 2-34

                                                                                   2.0 LAND USE
    •    Sales Tax: Taxable sales are associated with both retail and manufacturing businesses.
         Industrial sales tax may depend on whether the sale is actually recorded in the City of
         Colusa or whether the company’s offices are elsewhere.
Indirect Revenues and Business Attraction
Industrial jobs pay wages and salaries that are spent, at least in part, in the local economy.
Manufacturing (industrial and light industrial) supports and attracts other businesses that are
needed for support goods and services. These businesses, in turn, create new jobs and make
purchases from other local businesses. This “multiplier” effect results in several times the
purchasing power of the first dollar spent on wages when that dollar is eventually spent on other
taxable goods and services within the City.
The use of state and federal grant funds by the City, non-profit organizations, and qualifying
private developers can also be used to stimulate development and redevelopment within the
Planning Area. These grant monies can provide incentives for private investment in the area,
with funds targeting specific improvements that will contribute positively to the project as a
whole.
2.4      GOALS, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
NEW DEVELOPMENT GROWTH PATTERNS
Goal LU-1:
To maintain well-defined boundaries at the edge of urban development.
Policy LU-1.1:
The Planning Area for 2025 shall coincide with the sphere of influence as shown on the General
Plan 2025 Land Use Map.
         Implementing Action LU-1.1.a: Land Use Map
         The proposed Land Use Map is shown as Figure 2.3. This map will serve as the basis for
         determining appropriate uses of land within the planning area.
         Implementing Action LU-1.1.b: Ordinance and Regulations Review and Update
         The Zoning Ordinance and other implementing ordinances will be made consistent with
         this adopted Land Use Map.
City of Colusa                                                                        General Plan

                                               2-35

2.0 LAND USE
Goal LU-2:
To ensure public health and safety by maintaining adequate buffers between
agricultural land and urbanized areas.
Policy LU-2.1:
Development projects shall be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to ensure that adequate
buffers are maintained between urban and agricultural lands, while giving developers flexibility
in design at the urban edge.
        Implementing Action LU-2.1.a: Development Review
        Impacts of proposed new development will be evaluated with each proposal.
        Mitigation of significant impacts to the agriculture/urban interface will be required as
        conditions of approval of site plans and subdivision maps.
        Agricultural buffers will be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on adjacent
        agricultural uses. Potential mitigation measures may include disclosure to potential
        buyers of properties adjacent to agricultural uses, agreements between developers and
        adjacent agricultural landowners, agricultural easements, and/or land transfers.
        Implementing Action LU-2.1.b: Development Agreements
        As appropriate, the City will use the development agreement process established under
        State law and the Zoning Ordinance. This process provides for specific requirements of
        the developers of major projects to ensure compliance with the policies of this General
        Plan and provides for other benefits to the City in exchange for land use entitlement
        certainty for developers and property owners.
        Implementing Action LU-2.1.c: Interagency Coordination
        The City’s efforts to achieve managed growth that preserves agriculture at the edge of
        the City’s urban growth boundary while allowing development to occur will require
        intergovernmental coordination. The City will work with State and local agencies,
        including LAFCO, Colusa County, the Airport Land Use Commission, Colusa Unified
        School District, Caltrans, and other affected agencies, particularly during planning and
        development review of proposed development projects. As part of the General Plan
        adoption process, the City will inform affected agencies of the City’s change in its
        planning area boundary (SOI), the newly adopted land use districts, and City policies
        regarding land use in proximity to agricultural areas.
Goal LU-3:
To maintain land as Urban Reserve for consideration for future development.
Policy LU-3.1:
The City shall actively discourage development in all areas identified as Urban Reserve unless
accompanied by a request for annexation and a General Plan Amendment. Absent any
General Plan                                                                         City of Colusa

request for annexation and General Plan Amendment, development shall occur as allowed
under the Colusa County General Plan.
         Implementing Action LU-3.1.a: General Plan Amendments
         The City will consider a General Plan Amendment for annexation and development of
         land within the Urban Reserve district using the following information:
                  a. Market Absorption Study
                  b. Fiscal Impact Analysis
                  c. Municipal Services Capacity Analysis
Goal LU-4:
To protect agricultural operations as new development occurs.
Policy LU-4.1:
The City shall require an evaluation of the potential for adverse impacts on agricultural
production and economic value from exposure to urban development for all new projects
adjacent to rural lands. It is the intent of this policy to minimize the creation of conditions that
will impair any present farm operations to a degree that threatens the long-term viability of the
use of that land for continued agricultural purposes.
         Implementing ActionLU-4.1.a: Development Review
         Through the development review process, projects will be evaluated to ensure that
         impacts to existing farming or other agricultural operations will not be adversely affected
         or restricted by adjacent urban uses. The City will require that developers of residential
         projects, which are within general proximity to agricultural operations in the County,
         provide notification to new homeowners within their deeds, of the County’s right-to-farm
         ordinance. In addition, projects requiring and/or proposing the use of agricultural buffers
         will be reviewed for adequacy of mitigation by the Agricultural Commission, Farm
         Bureau, and any other recognized authority.
Policy LU-4.2:
The City shall require a 200-500 foot residential buffer, based on the type of agricultural use (e.g.,
field crops, orchards, grazing, etc.) and method of pesticide application (aerial, ground
application), as appropriate.
         Implementing Action LU-4.2.a: Development Review (see Implementing Action LU-4.1.a
         above.
Policy LU-4.3:
The City shall require a combination of a residential buffer, masonry fencing, tree plantings at
the urban edge to mitigate agricultural impacts of noise, dust, trespass, and pesticide/herbicide
overspray.

Goal LU-5:
To ensure growth occurs in an orderly, compact, and efficient manner, so that
municipal services and infrastructure can be extended at the least possible cost.
Policy LU-5.1:
Development patterns shall tier off of existing development and avoid leap-frogging, including
areas intended for annexation that are presently outside the city limits.
         Implementing Action LU-5.1.a: Land Use Map (see Implementing Action LU-1.1a above).
         Implementing Action LU-5.1.b: Development Review (see Implementing Action LU-2.1a
         above).
Policy LU-5.2:
Development patterns shall extend primarily from Highways 20 and 45. To the extent feasible,
initial phases of new developments shall begin as close as possible to existing urban areas.
         Implementing Action LU-5.2.a: Land Use Map (see Implementing Action LU-1.1a above).
         Implementing Action LU-5.2.b: Development Review (see Implementing Action LU-2.1a
         above).
Policy LU-5.3:
The City shall limit annexations and future urban development to land within the sphere of
influence for this General Plan through the year 2025.
         Implementing Action LU-5.3.a: Land Use Map (see Implementing Action LU-1.1a above).
Policy LU-5.4:
The financing for and ability to guarantee construction of infrastructure and public services shall
be established before annexation can occur.
         Implementing Action LU-5.4.a: Annexation Phasing Plan
         The City will prepare and adopt an Annexation Phasing Plan to ensure a logical
         progression of annexations that meet the City’s economic and planning needs and do
         not strain City services, resources, and infrastructure. This plan is a statement and analysis
         of the City’s growth plans, focusing in particular on the timing of growth and the
         annexations needed to support that growth. The purpose of the plan is to give the
         Colusa County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) a context for evaluating
General Plan                                                                               City of Colusa

         the likelihood of significant growth. Within this context, LAFCO can compare a proposed
         annexation to projected demand for growth and the existing supply of vacant land
         within the City.
         The plan will include criteria, consistent with the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Reorganization
         Act of 2000, that promote the preservation of open space and agricultural lands; benefit
         the local economy; ensure a development pattern that is complementary and
         contiguous to existing development; and include adequate infrastructure and services.
         Implementing Action LU-5.4.b: Development Review (see Implementing Action LU-2.1a
         above).
         In addition, during the development review process of annexation proposals, the City will
         review the projects to ensure that:
         •   The project site can feasibly be served by the City within the General Plan time
             frame.
         •   The project site meets LAFCO criteria for annexation as required under the Cortese-
             Knox-Hertzberg Reorganization Act of 2000.
         •   The proposed annexation and development are consistent with General Plan goals
             and policies.
         •   There are sufficient assurances that the timing of infrastructure and public services
             are achieved through the LAFCO Municipal Services Review process, Environmental
             Review, Project-Specific Conditions of Approval, 5-year Capital Improvement
             Program, and Development Agreements
         •   The proposed use would fulfill a market need and would create public benefits that
             could not reasonably be accomplished without the annexation.
         Implementing Action LU-5.4.c: Interagency Coordination (see Implementing Action LU-
         2.1.c above).
COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING
Goal LU-6:
To provide a comprehensive, logical land use planning process rather than an
incremental, piecemeal approach.
Policy LU-6.1:
Growth shall provide a strong diversified economic base and a reasonable balance between
employment and housing for all income groups.

2.0 LAND USE
        Implementing Action LU-6.1.a: Specific Plans/Planned Developments
        All properties within Special Planning Areas will carry a SP/PD designation and will require
        preparation of a specific plan or will be processed as a planned development.
        Properties within these designated areas must conform to all requirements of the specific
        plan or planned development. The City will ensure that specific plans and planned
        developments are consistent with the goals and policies of the General Plan, and with
        California Government Code §65451 (Specific Plans). Specific plans will incorporate
        development standards and Design Guidelines, a phasing plan for public facilities and
        services, and financing measures.
        Permit requirements will be as specified in the City’s Zoning Ordinance, which will be
        amended upon adoption of this General Plan update. Proposed developments within
        the specific plan areas will be required to adhere to Zoning Ordinance process for
        discretionary review, such as those for conditional use permits, variances, architectural
        and site plan approval, and subdivisions. The Zoning Ordinance will be amended to
        establish development application and review procedures. Discretionary review and
        approval of all specific plans and planned developments will be conducted through a
        public hearing before the Colusa Planning Commission. The City will use development
        agreements to secure implementation and financing provisions for these specific plans
        and planned developments.
        Implementing Action LU-6.1.b: Public Participation
        The City will continue its public participation process, actively solicit public input through
        public hearings as part of the development review process, and provide opportunities for
        early consultation for major development proposals. In addition, the City will expand
        public involvement and information programs, such as providing information to affected
        residents and other stakeholders when public improvements are being planned.

         be evaluated for consistency with this plan. The plan will provide the framework for
         timed capital improvements and facility expansion projects and will identify funding
         sources beyond monthly service charges to finance improvements related to expansion
         and upgrades to wastewater capacity, flow, treatment, and reclamation. The City will
         refer to this plan when constructing improvements and upgrades to the Wastewater
         Treatment Plant as needed to accommodate existing customers and any approved
         development. Wastewater is discussed in detail in the Municipal Facilities and Services
         Element.
         Implementing Action LU-6.3.g: Storm Drainage Master Plan
         The City will adopt and implement a Storm Drainage Master Plan. Development projects
         will be evaluated for consistency with this plan. The plan will identify drainage facilities
         that will be constructed to eliminate drainage problems in the City and will describe the
         means for financing the improvements. The Storm Drainage Master Plan will address
         Regional Water Quality Control Board water quality standards, including Best

HISTORIC RIVERFRONT DISTRICT
Goal LU-7:
To create an economically vibrant Riverfront District that reflects the cultural and
historical significance of the area.
Policy LU-7.1:
The City shall strive to preserve and strengthen the Riverfront District and ensure that this historic
area remains the community’s civic and commercial focus.
         Implementing Action LU-7.1.a: Riverfront Plan
         The City will work with developers to undertake a major planning effort for the Riverfront
         District as delineated on the Land Use Map. The result will be a Riverfront Plan that will
         establish land uses, development standards, and design guidelines for private
         development in the area bounded by the Sacramento River to the north, 13th Street to
         the west, Oak Street to the south, and Bridge Street to the east. Redevelopment and
         new construction in the Riverfront District will adhere to the standards and guidelines of
         the Riverfront Plan, to be incorporated by reference into the Zoning Ordinance. They
         may include, but are not limited to, the following objectives:
         1) Preserve and enhance views of the Sacramento River.
         2) Reinforce the significance of historic architecture around the Riverfront District.
         3) Create opportunities for mixed retail, service, professional, and residential land uses
             around the Riverfront District, including the development of affordable housing.
         4) Provide uses that will enhance the Riverfront District’s ability to attract City residents
             and visitors.
         5) Develop Design Guidelines for the Riverfront District to maintain the diverse
             architectural styles found in the area and to enhance the appearance of new
             development and the rehabilitation of existing structures.

        Implementing Action LU-7.1.b: Design Guidelines (see Implementing Action CCD-1.1.b of
        the Community Character and Design Element)
        The City will adopt and implement Design Guidelines as described in of the Community
        Character & Design element of this General Plan. Collectively these will serve as
        evaluation criteria during the design review of proposed development projects. The
        Design Guidelines will be considered the minimum standards to achieve the City’s overall
        community design goals in the areas of aesthetics, signage, circulation and mobility, and
        enhancement of environmental resources. Modifications to these Design Guidelines
        may be made by the Planning Commission and City Council during the course of
        development application review and adopted as conditions of project approval,
        provided such conditions are found to be consistent with the policies that the Design
        Guidelines were intended to implement.
        Implementing Action LU-7.1.c: Development Review (see Implementing Action LU-2.1.a
        above).
        Implementing Action LU-7.1.d: Retail Market Analysis
        If it is unclear whether a proposed retail project is in keeping with the overall goals for the
        Riverfront District, the City will require supplemental and project-specific retail market
        analysis for projects larger than 10,000 square feet of building space.
        Implementing Action LU-7.1.e: Ordinance and Regulations Review and Update
        The City’s ordinances and regulations will be reviewed and updated to bring them into
        conformance with the General Plan, including the policies of this element. The current
        ordinances and regulations that will be subject to this effort include, but are not limited
        to, the following:
        •      Zoning Ordinance (comprehensive update)
        •      Subdivision Ordinance
        •      Environmental Ordinance (CEQA regulations and thresholds of significance)
        •      Sign Ordinance
        •      Development Review Procedures
        The City’s current regulatory framework does not provide for the mixed-use land use
        districts established by this element. The first priority of the ordinance and regulations
        review is the creation of new mixed-use zoning districts that are consistent with the
        policies and intent of the proposed mixed-use land use districts.

         Implementing Action LU-7.1.f: Redevelopment Plan
         The City will form a Redevelopment Agency and adopt and implement a
         Redevelopment Plan. Redevelopment can eliminate blight in the older sections of the
         City through revitalization of the historic downtown, the waterfront, and underutilized sites
         along the State highways. This revitalization is expected to increase employment
         opportunities, increase the City’s tax base, and create an economic environment that
         would encourage new private development and investment.
         The Redevelopment Plan will contain specific goals and objectives. The City will use its
         redevelopment authority to establish redevelopment areas in order to improve the
         appearance, upgrade infrastructure, and screen unsightly, but necessary, uses from
         view.
         Redevelopment of the targeted areas will include relocating housing in instances where
         land use incompatibility cannot be resolved.                 Rehabilitation of housing and
         implementation of other housing assistance programs, such as the Community
         Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, will also occur. The Housing Element
         contains a detailed description of the City’s housing programs and policies for affordable
         housing. Once the redevelopment areas have been established, housing objectives
         can be met through the Redevelopment Agency.
         Implementing Action LU-7.1.g: State Historical Building Code
         The State Historical Building Code is Part 8 of Title 24 (State Building Standards Code) and
         applies to all qualified historic structures, districts, and sites designated under federal,
         state, and local authority. The code provides alternative building regulations for the
         rehabilitation, preservation, restoration, or relocation of structures designated as qualified
         historic buildings. Enforcement of this code will help to maintain the historic character of
         downtown Colusa and avoid incompatible design and construction.
         Implementing Action LU-7.1.h: Article 30—Landmark and Historic Preservation
         The City will continue to implement Article 30 of the Municipal Code – Landmark and
         Historic Preservation Ordinance. Projects in the historic downtown core will be reviewed
         by the Heritage Preservation Committee to ensure that structures, sites, and landmarks of
         special character or special historical, architectural, or aesthetic interest or value will
         continue to be preserved, protected, and enhanced.
         Implementing Action LU-7.1.i: Permit Streamlining Act
         The City will continue to implement the development review process in accordance with
         the statutory requirements contained in such documents as the Zoning Ordinance, Sign
         Ordinance, Subdivision Standards, and the Subdivision Map Act; the California
         Environmental Quality Act (CEQA); the Permit Streamlining Act; and other statutes.
         The City will take all reasonable steps to ensure a seamless, user-friendly development
         application and review process that clearly informs development applicants of what the
         City’s expectations are with respect to new developments. To promote efficiency and
         ongoing improvement in the development review process, the City will develop and
         implement a “customer satisfaction” survey for the public. As with the General Plan, City

         Expanding the transient occupancy tax base through the development of a hotel and
         conference center within the Commercial/Visitor designation may also be considered.
         The City will investigate tax-based strategies such as Mello-Roos Districts as means to
         provide additional tax revenues. Any revenue development strategy will also include the
         identification and aggressive pursuit of grant funds.

3.0 COMMUNITY CHARACTER AND
          DESIGN
                                                      3.0 COMMUNITY CHARACTER & DESIGN
3.1      INTRODUCTION
“Community character” refers to the physical characteristics that lend shape, form, and identity
to a community. Concepts such as “small town,” “quality of life,” “living environment,”
“neighborhood,” and “community” are, to a large extent, expressions of familiar physical
characteristics – landmarks, streets, buildings, parks, and natural features that create a unique
identity in every community. “Community design” or “urban design” refers to the architectural
and engineering design principles that create the shape, form, and appearance of both new
development and the redevelopment of existing districts and neighborhoods.
                                      The Community Character and Design Element is not a state-
                                      mandated element as are others in this General Plan.
                                      Rather, it is an optional element that provides policy
                                      direction to guide community design as new development
                                      occurs. Municipalities statewide increasingly choose to
                                      include in their general plans a community design
                                      component that establishes a regulatory framework in
                                      recognition of the importance of aesthetics as a public
                                      policy issue.
                                      This element establishes a design review process and
                                      implementing actions to help achieve the desired visual
character and livability of Colusa in the context of the existing natural and built environments. Its
goals and policies are intended to ensure that the community’s future character reflects the
vision of both residents and decision-makers. The over-arching vision statements, goals, policies,
and implementing actions in this element reinforce and complement those in other elements,
such as Land Use, Circulation, Municipal Facilities & Services, and Parks, Recreation & Resource
Conservation.
3.2      COMMUNITY VISION
Past and recent community outreach efforts involving residents, business owners, and City
officials have concluded that there are certain facets to development that can substantially
contribute to or detract from the shape, form, and identity of Colusa. The vision statements
below convey some long-range expectations of the City with regard to its community
character. The “road map” for achieving these visions is in the policy framework that follows.
VISION 1: PRESERVE COLUSA’S SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND SMALL TOWN CHARACTER
    Colusa will still be recognizable to today’s residents decades from now. New development
                                               will be expected to reinforce the desirable
                                               characteristics that make Colusa an attractive
                                               community for both residents and visitors.
                                              New development will build upon the City’s
                                               attractive and distinctive neighborhoods rather than
                                               create isolated subdivisions that bear no relationship
                                               to the existing community’s environment.
                                              Colusa will welcome visitors and reinforce municipal
                                               pride with its distinctive gateways and City
     landmarks.

3.0 COMMUNITY CHARACTER & DESIGN
VISION 2: PRESERVE           AND    STRENGTHEN     THE  DOWNTOWN, RIVERFRONT,    AND  HISTORIC
PLACES
   The downtown and Riverfront will continue to serve as the
    central focus of the community.
   Downtown business and civic activities will be mutually
    supportive to promote social interaction and strengthen the
    City’s economic vitality.
   Colusa’s historic and cultural resources will be showcased
    and regarded as a source of civic pride.
   Access to the Sacramento River will be expanded for the
    enjoyment of Colusa residents and visitors.
   Commercial development along the SR 20 and SR 45
    corridors will complement rather than displace or preempt investment in the downtown.
VISION 3: PRESERVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES THAT DEFINE COLUSA
   The Sacramento River and related natural areas will
    be showcased and enhanced                    for   both
    preservation and public enjoyment.
   New development will accommodate views to the
    Sutter Buttes as a community amenity.
   Existing City neighborhoods will connect to new
    development and the Sacramento River through
    an extensive and interconnecting trail system, with
    the river’s natural features and sensitive vegetation
    areas integrated into this system.
   Farmland, open space and wildlife are important elements of this community. A clear edge
    between urban development and agriculture will allow this to continue.
VISION 4: ENSURE EASE OF MOBILITY FOR ALL RESIDENTS, VISITORS, AND BUSINESSES
   Accessible and convenient circulation systems for autos, pedestrians, and bicyclists will be
    incorporated into all new developments.
   Daily activities will occur within walking distance
    of each other as much as possible to allow
    independence and safe movement for those
    who do not drive, especially seniors and young
    people.
   Convenient and accessible truck routes for
    delivery and shipping of goods and services will
    not     impede         activities   in   residential

     neighborhoods.
    While it is a fact of modern life that development must adequately accommodate
     automobiles, pedestrian accessibility will not be sacrificed or made less important than
     automobile accessibility.
    Streets, thoroughfares, and public spaces will be safe, comfortable, and attractive to the
     pedestrian and motorist, free of barriers and designed with multiple connections to various
     parts of the community.
3.3      SETTING
Located in the northern Central Valley, just east
of Interstate 5, the City of Colusa provides wide
diversity in its natural and built environment.
While it is largely defined by its role as an
agriculture-supporting community, this small town
offers      an     abundance          of   recreational
opportunities and provides an attractive
alternative to the urban and suburban lifestyles
found in more populated counties to the south
and east.
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Colusa is nestled in a bend of the Sacramento River with vast acreages of agricultural land
extending beyond its urban edge. Colusa is adjacent to the 4,507-acre Colusa National Wildlife
Refuge, which primarily consists of intensively managed wetland impoundments and serves as
one of the primary wintering areas for waterfowl in the Sacramento Valley. These wetlands also
provide optimal habitat for resident wildlife and spring/summer migrant fowl.
Visually, the natural landscape extends far beyond Colusa’s boundaries. The area’s flat
topography allows for expansive scenic views, including those of the Sutter Buttes to the east
and the Coastal Range to the west.
HISTORIC DOWNTOWN AND EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS
    The City’s vibrant downtown maintains its historic character with tree-shaded, walkable
     residential areas located south of Market Street. Colusa conveys the feel of a community
     that is not highly suburbanized or modernized and
     celebrates long-established community activities
     such as Colusa Days, the Fireman’s Crab Feed,
     and the County Fair. A collection of landmark
     features, including the City water tower, City Hall,
     and historic downtown buildings all contribute to
     Colusa’s distinct character.
Incorporated in 1868, the City of Colusa remains an
attractive and picturesque community with many of
its original buildings still intact. The community boasts
fine examples of 19th Century architecture and has
unique residential neighborhoods built on a

traditional street grid pattern. The City offers quaint shops and small businesses in the historic
downtown, as well as visitor- and residential-serving uses along the SR 20 and SR 20/45 corridors.
In the central core, Colusa retains its original urban structure— a strong orientation toward the
edge of the Sacramento River with residential neighborhoods in close proximity to the
commercial businesses along Main and Market Streets. Consistent with Colusa’s traditional visual
context, many of the City’s older neighborhoods contain a mix of housing types and
architectural styles, which have evolved over the last 140 years. No single type or style
dominates; single-family homes are intermingled with multi-family dwellings, and setbacks are
varied with detached garages often rear-facing along alleys or set back from the street. The
City has 244 buildings that are considered historically significant. The City of Colusa Heritage
Preservation Committee (HPC) maintains the City of Colusa Historic Resources Inventory which
includes structures representative of architectural building styles from Colusa’s early years.
Examples of numerous period styles can be found in the City, including Classical Revival, Late
Gothic, Late 19th and 20th Century Revival, Tudor Revival, Queen Anne, and Craftsman.
In 1996, the HPC worked with the California State Historic Preservation Office to designate the
City a Certified Local Government (CLG). The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended, provided for the establishment of a CLG program to encourage the direct
participation of local governments in the identification, evaluation, registration, and preservation
of historic properties within their jurisdictions and promote the integration of local preservation
interests and concerns into local planning and decision-making processes. The CLG designation
allows the City of Colusa to compete for state grants to help fund preservation planning
activities and develop design guidelines for new development in or adjacent to historic places
in the City.
In recent years, more modern residential neighborhoods have been established south of the
downtown core. These subdivision designs trend toward ranch-style detached, single-family
homes with an emphasis on attached garages fronting the streets.
The incorporation of neighborhood serving commercial businesses in Colusa’s residential areas is
consistent with traditional urban design principles. This historic development pattern emerged
out of convenience to residents who did not use the automobile to the extent that it is used
today. The strategic location of small markets, salons, and services encouraged pedestrian and
bicycle mobility for residents to meet their daily needs.
CITY STREETS
The City’s grid-based street system is comprised of 300-foot long blocks and 20-foot-wide alleys
bisecting the blocks. The original road and alley structure provides an accessible and
pedestrian-friendly urban environment that
presents the opportunity to change direction
every half-block. This grid system offers the
shortest trip lengths and the largest number of
route choices (and therefore the most
convenient pedestrian travel) of any street
layout,     due     to    the     multitude      of
interconnections available within each block.
A typical historic residential street section in
Colusa is contains an eight-foot “parkway
strip” or “tree lawn” between the sidewalk
and the street. Typically, large canopied

street trees have been planted in these parkways, providing shade and definition to the street
edge and separating pedestrian from vehicle traffic.
Like most American communities, Colusa began to deviate from the traditional grid street
system after World War II. More recently, conventional neighborhood streets have changed in
character and shape, with subdivisions to the south developing on curvilinear streets and cul-de-
sacs. These streets are at least 36 feet wide at the curbs, with a “monolithic” sidewalk that is
adjacent to the curb and without a parkway. If street trees are planted, they occur in public
utility easements or front yards. Newer Colusa neighborhoods do not produce the street tree
canopy that is commonplace in historic residential neighborhoods.
STATE ROUTES 20 AND 20/45 CORRIDORS
State Route (SR) 20 bisects Colusa County from west of the City of Williams to the Sutter County
line. This segment of SR 20 is a key travel corridor that ultimately leads west to Ukiah on Highway
101 and Fort Bragg on the coast, while extending east to the gold country town of Nevada City
                                              and into the Sierra Nevada. State Route 45 follows
                                              the scenic Sacramento River past rice paddies,
                                              orchards, and wildlife sanctuaries from Grimes in the
                                              south and through the City of Colusa and Princeton
                                              at the north end of the County.
                                              Within the Colusa planning area, these roadways are
                                              considered scenic corridors and acknowledged as
                                              such in this element.        The environmental and
                                              aesthetic characters of the SR 20 and 20/45 corridors
                                              vary in different places throughout Colusa. Along SR
                                              20 from the west, the character is still largely rural
when entering the City limits, then transitions to traditional neighborhoods and the historic
downtown. As SR 20/45 exits the downtown, it converts to a
highway-serving commercial corridor with rural and
suburban subdivisions on the southeast, before once again
returning to a rural setting.
These major highway corridors are of significant concern,
particularly in the areas of safety, access, and efficient traffic
movement. Pedestrian crossing is particularly hazardous
along SR 20/45 at the Wescott Road intersection. Crossing
hazards pose one of the most serious obstacles to the
realization of a trail system linkage. A primary objective of this element is to provide direction in
the design of neighborhoods that will ensure safe travel for pedestrians and bicyclists across
these highways.
3.4      OUTLOOK
Because Colusa is emerging as a community suitable for a work force of commuters traveling to
the Sacramento, Yuba City, and Chico urban areas, new development is anticipated to occur
in the City. Given that there is significant potential for new residential development within the
Planning Area, it is important that it be harmonious with the character of existing traditional
neighborhoods. New opportunities also exist for rehabilitation and enhancement of existing
structures elsewhere in the City to strengthen this character.

3.0 COMMUNITY CHARACTER & DESIGN
Colusa’s historic urban structure serves as a point of reference as the City grows and develops
with new streets and neighborhoods. This element is intended to identify what works best about
the City and how that can be applied to new development. New residential subdivisions are
expected to bear some relationship to the character of traditional downtown neighborhoods
and avoid isolated, largely self-contained neighborhoods.
 HISTORIC DOWNTOWN AND RIVERFRONT DISTRICT
Historic structures are a major component of the City of Colusa’s effort to identify, protect, and
encourage preservation of historic and cultural resources. The HPC
will continue to provide architectural review, technical assistance,
and make recommendations concerning projects involving
qualified historic properties that are undergoing permit review in the
City. The HPC will also provide assistance to property owners
seeking      information      regarding    historic   architecture    and
landscaping.
The City will complete an update of its Landmark and Historic
Preservation Ordinance to implement the General Plan’s heritage
preservation goals and policies. While restoration and preservation
of period architecture in the City will remain a priority, as future
development projects are undertaken, the City will also seek to
encourage new and innovative designs compatible with existing historic resources in the City.
The development of new design guidelines will help integrate the design of new structures in
proximity to existing historic properties in the City. The City will also seek to take advantage of
federal and state incentives for heritage preservation activity by citizens and funding of planning
and education efforts.
Integration of new development into the historic downtown will help revitalize the City by
encouraging adaptive reuse of historic districts and buildings, conserving resources, using
existing infrastructure, increasing property values, fostering heritage tourism, supporting existing
businesses and new small business development, and generating new jobs.
Downtown commercial activities are expected to increase along Market and Main Streets with
the existing grid continuing to provide easy access to adjacent historic residential areas. The
retention of existing landmarks and public spaces, along with the addition of new ones, will serve
to strengthen community appreciation of this urban environment. At the same time, the
extension of Downtown to the river’s edge will take in panoramic views of the Sutter Buttes and
further define the City as a very special place to live and recreate.
The riverfront provides a unique opportunity for enhanced public access and enjoyment of this
recreational and scenic asset. The blocks between the Sacramento River and Market Street,
extending from 13th Street to Bridge Street, are designated in the Land Use Element as the
Riverfront District. This district has been identified as a Special Planning Area (SPA) that will take
full advantage of its historic resources and the riverfront through implementation of a
comprehensive master planning and redevelopment effort.
NEW DEVELOPMENT AREAS
The anticipated development of four other Special Planning Areas (SPAs) identified in the Land
Use Element have largely triggered the need for a community character and design

as 4,300 new homes, a community park, several neighborhood parks, a fire station, two new
elementary schools, and highway commercial businesses. As described in greater detail in the
Land Use Element, the new development areas are:
         Brookins Ranch Estates This 161.4-acre proposed residential development is situated
         south of the high school between Will S. Green Road and South Third Street, extending
         south to the old railroad right-of-way. The development would consist of 600 single-family
         detached homes, a fire station, neighborhood parks, pedestrian and bicycle pathways,
         and open space.
         Colusa Crossings      This proposal encompasses approximately 310 acres on the Vann
         Property, extending west of SR 20 to the old railroad right-of-way. It proposes a mix of
         uses including low-, medium-, and high-density residential development, an elementary
         school site, a neighborhood or community park, and a mix of commercial uses to serve
         local residents and travelers along SR 20.
         Colusa Riverbend This 442-acre development area on the east side of the City generally
         extends from Bridge Street (SR 20/45) to the Sacramento River, and south to Moon Bend
         Road. A master-planned community is proposed that would provide approximately
         2,530 single-family homes.       Amenities within the project area would include an
         elementary school, parks, and open space with public access provided to the river.
         Colusa Industrial Park Directly north of the Colusa County Airport, this 137.5-acre site is
         part of the larger 1,049-acre Colusa Industrial Properties (CIP) complex. A mix of uses is
         proposed for this area, including 200 single-family homes, high-density residential
         development, approximately 28 acres of commercial uses fronting SR 20/45, and golf
         course facilities.
As the City grows, achieving a balance between new development and preservation of
Colusa’s desirable small-town character will be critical. A key component in the successful
planning and buildout of these areas will be the application of the community character and
design principles provided in this element.
CITY STREETS
As Colusa looks to the future, a return to the
pre-1900s grid is considered a desirable pattern
for development. However, opportunities exist
for a hybrid of street designs that balance the
need       for     connectivity      with    current
development strategies and consumer interests.
This includes the integration of modern and
traditional street standards—both oriented
toward safe, efficient automobile travel and
easy emergency vehicle access. However,
there will be a renewed emphasis on narrower
roadways, raised curbs, and separated
sidewalks or parkways in street design.
Because city streets occupy the majority of the
public domain, their design should extend beyond that of servicing the automobile. Pedestrian
and bicycle movement through neighborhoods to the central business district, the riverfront,

parks, and schools is key to maintaining the small-town quality of life in Colusa. This will be
accomplished with the integration of trails and pathways into new development areas,
consistent with the Circulation Element and the Open Space, Recreation & Conservation
Element.
Finally, street landscaping will play an important part in street design. The renewed practice of
establishing tree canopies along city streets will help to ensure that the community’s aesthetic
appeal is preserved while providing shade during hot summers and abundant habitat for birds
and wildlife.
STATE ROUTES 20 AND 20/45 CORRIDORS
Arterial roadways that carry large traffic volumes are a major determinant of community
character because every resident and visitor views these streets every day as they travel
through town. Design principles in this element can be applied to SR 20 and SR 20/45, which
carry large traffic volumes, improving these arterials with additional landscaping and renovated
commercial facades to enhance the character
of Colusa. While some structures have been
renovated over the years, many have not, and
the building facades that front the streets look
worn and, in some cases, dilapidated. Improving
these building fronts with new paint, signs,
awnings, and attractive materials would greatly
enhance the City’s community character.
As Colusa is expected to grow significantly over
the next 20 years, ensuring safe crossing of these
heavily traveled highways is paramount to the
livability of the community. School children, non-drivers, and others who prefer to get around
town without using an automobile must be supported with safe travel between home, school,
businesses, and places of employment. This is of particular concern with the anticipated
development of large areas east and west of the highway corridors. This element emphasizes
neighborhood design that will facilitate pedestrian and bicycle access to all parts of the City.
3.5       GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
Community Character & Design goals, policies, and implementing actions are derived from, and
are intended to achieve the related vision statements described in Section 3.2 above.
Design Review Process
Colusa’s Design Review process is part of the zoning permit process that is intended to protect
the city’s unique qualities and strong sense of place by carrying out citywide development and
design objectives. The purpose of Design Review is to protect the character of Colusa and to
ensure that new development or changes to existing development are compatible with
surrounding neighborhoods. It will allow the City to look beyond the specifics of a proposed
development, and consider its context and how the project will fit and benefit its surroundings.
Design Review will help assure property owners that their investment will be protected. As
traditional zoning prevents incompatible uses from locating within a neighborhood, Design
Review can ensure that the character of a neighborhood or community is maintained.

Improvements in the quality of design stabilize and, in some cases, enhance the value of private
property, which will benefit the overall attractiveness of the city.
Design Review is an especially important tool for the city’s commercial district where increased
private investment and maintenance of an image of vitality is the goal. Places like Historic
Downtown and the Riverfront will rely heavily on Design Review to protect and enhance public
and private investments, and to support and encourage new development.
A range of design issues will be addressed during the Design Review process. While each issue
considered individually may appear small, in combination they can make the difference
between and compatible project that enhances the area and an incompatible project that
does not.
Goal CCD-1:
To ensure the preservation and enhancement of Colusa’s unique community character
and vitality within its neighborhoods and business districts.
Policy CCD-1.1:

Environmental Sustainability
Many types of design guidelines exist, but attention will be given to design considerations that
respect for the natural environment. These include preservation of Colusa’s biological resources,
use of local materials in development, minimal waste disposal, and climate-related building
design options.
The motivations for environmental design extend above and beyond a commitment to
stewardship. Experience has shown that policy decisions on environmental sustainability can
positively influence a community’s overall quality of life. Attention to the natural environment
creates the basis for a more sustainable way of life—one that safeguards and enhances local
resources, prevents harm to the natural environment and human health, and strengthens the
community and local economy for the sake of current and future generations.
Goal CCD-2:
To ensure that new development respects the natural environment.
Policy CCD-2.1:
The City shall encourage site and building design that respects the natural resources of Colusa,
as an enhancement to the environmental, aesthetic, and social benefits of the community.

         resources, water quality and air quality, will be required as part of the development
         review process. Mitigation measures to minimize impacts on these natural resources will
         be implemented as appropriate.
         Implementing Action CCD-2.5.c:        Improvement Standards (see Implementing Action
         CCD-2.2.c above)
Streets, Blocks, and Circulation
The guiding principle of the City’s circulation system is the preservation and development of a
variety of transportation systems that link residential, commercial and public areas of the
community. The street system is intended to safely and efficiently link neighborhoods to public
facilities and commercial business districts within the planning area in a manner that will serve
the entire community. The application of streets and blocks design criteria will help unify areas
targeted for new development with the existing urban center.
Older neighborhoods of Colusa are good models for street design. Traditional grid patterns,
including narrow streets, alleys to the rear of residences, and garages set back from streets and

adjacent to alleys promote a pedestrian-friendly environment while allowing efficient movement
of motorized vehicles throughout a neighborhood.
Deciduous street trees create shade in summer keeping the pavement cool and allowing solar
warming during cold winter months. Trees also soften the streetscape and define corridors of
use. Street trees are essential in making neighborhoods attractive and livable.
To the extent practicable, the City intends to preserve and promote the traditional circulation
concept throughout the existing neighborhoods and in new areas of development.

Community Gathering Places
Community gathering places contribute significantly to Colusa’s quality of life. Colusans identify
with their community as not only a place to live, but as an opportunity to gather with neighbors,
socialize, and conduct their business. With this community interaction, residents are more likely
to offer support to neighbors and become more involved in local improvement projects. The
Downtown and Riverfront District offer excellent opportunities to build upon these central
gathering places where residents can meet and foster community spirit. Similarly, creating
gathering places within new developments will help further this social interaction, and extend
this tradition of community and neighborhood pride to new residents.

Gateways, Landmarks, and Focal Points
State Routes 20 and 20/45 serve as the primary entrances to the City from the east and west, as
well as the city’s main street and commercial corridor. These entries to the City provide a
significant opportunity to make a positive first impression on visitors and pique their interest in the
community.
The City also recognizes the importance of its existing distinctive features, including the
Riverfront, the historic Downtown, and its traditional neighborhoods. The City can continue to
build a strong, appealing image by providing policy direction that emphasizes enhancement of
these features and extending that direction to new development.
The policies presented below are intended to facilitate creation of a memorable City image by
defining the entries to Colusa, preserving City landmarks, and encouraging distinctive private
development. An opportunities map for community entryways, identity features, and landmarks
is shown in Figure 3.1 Colusa Landmarks.

        Implementing Action CCD-8.4.a: Design Guidelines—Community Design Criteria (see
        Implementing Action CCD-1.1.b above)
Signage and Lighting
Signage: Throughout Colusa’s commercial areas, signs play a major role in creating either a
positive or negative visual image for the City. Signs should make a positive contribution to the
general appearance of the street and commercial area in which they are located. A well-
designed sign can be a major asset to a building. The individual identification of a business is not
achieved through use of an over-scaled mass of signage, but rather through a simple, direct,
well-designed sign that is unique to the business—the quality of a business’ sign is a direct
reflection of the business. Signage design criteria are intended to guide high quality,
imaginative, and innovative sign design.
Lighting:    Colusa possesses a rich architectural heritage within a uniquely beautiful scenic
setting. At night, lighting is an integral component of this built and natural environment. It is
important that illumination is carefully planned to complement the surroundings, is subtle to
avoid over-lighting, and can provide a cohesive appearance for the city and its neighborhoods.
Safety and security for persons and property are also of paramount concern, and it is necessary
to recognize the importance of quality of light rather than quantity. The goal of lighting design
guidelines is to promote a high standard of quality for lighting in commercial and residential
areas of the city through the application of concepts behind good lighting design.
Goal CCD-9:
To apply the use of signage and lighting in a manner that will enhance the aesthetic
character of the community.
Policy CCD-9.1:
The scale of signs should be appropriate for the building on which they are placed and the area
in which they are located. The size and shape of a sign should be proportional with the scale of
the structure and the sign shall be designed so it is integrated with the design of the building.

Historic Character
Downtown Colusa clearly displays its period of historic significance, during which the area
gained its architectural and historical importance. The residential structures in the downtown
area, the Riverfront district, and historic neighborhoods generally are intact and relatively
unchanged from the time of construction. Most structures still exhibit the majority, if not all, of the
original architectural elements and details that make them unique.
In addition to being from an historical period, an historic property also should retain sufficient
integrity; that is, a high percentage of the structure should date from the period of significance
and be maintained to preserve that character. Blanket or prescriptive zoning regulations that
are not compatible with the density or design characteristics of these historic places will be
replaced with historic design criteria that provide appropriate guidelines for restoration,
rehabilitation, and adaptive reuse. This will help to ensure that future uses respect the historic

Residential
The community character of Colusa’s historic residential neighborhoods presents a model for the
desired character of the new growth areas. The siting and orientation of residential units on a lot
and their relationship to the public realm are crucial to achieving the City’s desired community
character.
General Plan                                                                             City of Colusa

Modern subdivision design often includes placement of the garage in front of the house toward
the street, with the rest of the structure behind or to the side of the garage. The garage may
accounts for more than half the visible house frontage or lot width, thus becoming the primary
visual element of the streetscape, with the living areas becoming secondary. This garage
placement reduces the driveway length, forcing cars to be parked closer to the street, adding
to further dominance of the automobile to the streetscape. This creates an environment that
discourages interaction with neighbors and limits family living and recreation to back yards,
away from the street.
The Community Character and Design Element offers a more traditional approach to the design
of new residential areas. On blocks with relatively small lots, garages would be recessed or
pushed back behind the front living area or porch so that cars parked in the driveway do not
dominate the streetscape. With this approach, the continuity of street edges and the public
landscape are enhanced. Pulling the house forward on the site and recessing the garage
improves street character and increases the private rear yard area.
The City anticipates that new development and redevelopment proposals will also contain
attached housing, such as multiple family apartments or condominiums. This medium- to high-
density housing is intended to achieve the City’s goals and objectives for housing, land use, and
circulation and mobility. The City envisions that attached housing will be integrated attractively
into neighborhoods throughout the community, and that traditional design concepts will be
applied to this housing type, as well.
A shift away from conventional modern residential subdivision design toward more traditional
neighborhood design and integration of medium- and high-density housing into neighborhoods
will help to promote community interaction, increase efficiency in movement throughout the
community, and retain the City’s small-town qualities. The General Plan’s policies provide for
residential design guidelines that are intended to guide development in this direction.
Goal CCD-11:
To encourage new development that reflects the design and character of Colusa’s
traditional residential neighborhoods.

Non-Residential
Location and orientation are as important for non-residential buildings as for residential
structures. Proper orientation of office and commercial structures in relation to the surrounding
development and roadways can facilitate pedestrian activity and reduce dependence on the
automobile.
In traditional neighborhoods and downtowns, the placement of businesses on the street—
adjacent to a wide sidewalk—encourages easy pedestrian access from nearby neighborhoods
and businesses, as well as access by vehicle. By contrast, modern centers typically turn
unattractive “back doors” to the street and sidewalk, while their storefronts face internally
toward the parking lots. They are located at intersections of arterials or major collector streets
with few, if any, direct connections to adjacent neighborhoods. Even though strip centers and
individual commercial uses frequently abut each other, direct connections do not exist between
them. Consequently, cars are forced onto the frontage street in order to access an adjacent
center.
General Plan policies and non-residential design criteria recognize that modern commercial
centers need high visibility, necessitating locations at major intersections. However, the policies

directing non-residential design encourage the internal creation of a “Main Street” appearance,
requiring building fronts to be oriented toward at least one street or plaza and away from
parking lots. Linkages for both vehicles and pedestrians are to be created between commercial
uses and residential neighborhoods, multi-family buildings, and plazas.
It is expected that the small commercial centers located along SR 20 and 20/45 will
accommodate small commercial uses, such as convenience markets, cafes or coffee shops, dry
cleaners, gas stations, office service and support, video stores, and other service-oriented
businesses. General Plan policies and design guidelines will help to avoid random placement
and design of such highway and convenience commercial structures. They will encourage non-
motorized access to the businesses located in these centers and create aesthetically pleasing
commercial corridors along heavily traveled routes through town.
As future residential development occurs, it is expected that a need for heavier employment or
service centers may logically follow. The goals and policies below are intended to guide not
only commercial development, but office professional uses as well, and any light industrial
development that may be proposed in the future.

To develop attractive commercial and business centers that provide multi-modal
access.

4.1      INTRODUCTION
The Circulation Element, a legally required element, is included in this General Plan to address
issues related to the movement of people and goods through and around the City of Colusa.
The purpose of this Element is to provide an overview of the means of transport to, from, and
within the City of Colusa and the City’s Planning Area, and to address how these different
methods can complement each other to make the City’s circulation system work more
efficiently and effectively. The Circulation Element addresses a range of circulation issues that
affect mobility. Vehicle circulation on streets and highways, vehicle parking, bicycle circulation,
and public transit are key components addressed in this Element. Other components include
public transportation, air transportation, and water transportation along the Sacramento River.
The most common means of transportation is the automobile, and much of the circulation within
Colusa is focused on vehicle traffic. However, bicycles and pedestrians are clearly visible
throughout the City, and public transit has become an issue of importance. Therefore, the
Circulation Element focuses on the community’s system of regional or cross-town streets, local
access or neighborhood streets, transit, and bicycle and pedestrian routes.
State law recognizes that circulation and land use are closely related and requires that policies
contemplated by the Circulation, Land Use, and other elements be related and consistent. The
policies should demonstrate a balance between anticipated land uses and the transportation
facilities that serve them. Circulation policies are interwoven with other issues in this General
Plan, including community character and design, housing and neighborhoods, recreation,
resource conservation (e.g. air quality), noise, and safety policies.
4.2      SETTING
MOTOR VEHICLE CIRCULATION
Colusa is located at the intersection of two state highways, State Route (SR) 20 and State Route
(SR) 45, approximately ten miles east of Interstate 5, the major interregional freeway on the West
Coast. Consequently the major form of transportation in and through Colusa is by motor vehicle.
The City of Colusa street system is based on a large grid pattern; however, the newly developed
areas to the south of the City reflect curvilinear street designs with cul-de-sacs. The grid pattern,
with wide streets and rights-of-way, tends to diffuse traffic throughout all of the streets rather
than channel it to major collector and arterial streets. This diffusion of traffic throughout
neighborhoods results in more traffic circulating on neighborhood residential streets than would
be experienced with a collector or arterial street system.
The downtown area currently has the greatest traffic volume of any area in the City. According
to the City’s Public Works Department, the most recent traffic count completed in June 2000
indicates that the average daily traffic volume on the Fifth Street side of the Fifth/Market Street
intersection was 462 vehicles. Through traffic from SR 20 and SR 45, along with local
shopping/office circulation trips, generates this volume. Because Market Street is a four-lane
road between Tenth and First Streets, this volume does not currently create a congested
situation.
Wescott Road, Fremont Street, Eighth Street, and Third Street currently serve as major collectors,
especially during school traffic hours. These streets also serve as major pedestrian routes,
especially for school children. Future improvements involving these streets must consider

pedestrian traffic, incorporating designs that ensure the safety of pedestrians while promoting
traffic flow. Figure 4.2 illustrates major roadways in the City.
Major streets and roadways in Colusa include the following:
                                                    State Route 20 is an east-west, two-lane arterial
                                                    linking the coastal areas of northern California
                                                    with the Sierra foothill counties. SR 20 intersects
                                                    Interstate 5 just north of the City of Williams and
                                                    continues eastward, entering Colusa from the
                                                    southwest. Once inside the City limits, SR 20
                                                    travels north, east and south before exiting
                                                    Colusa at its southeastern corner. SR 20 then
                                                    continues eastward out of Colusa County
                                                    towards Yuba City in Sutter County.
                                                    State Route 45 is a north-south, two-lane arterial
                                                    that generally follows the Sacramento River. It
                                                    begins at Knights Landing in Yolo County and
                                                    follows the Sacramento River on its western side.
Approximately seven miles southeast of Colusa, SR 45 merges with SR 20 and subsequently enters
Colusa from the southeast, traveling north and then west. At the intersection of Market Street
and Tenth Street, SR 45 separates from SR 20 and continues northward. It passes through the
community of Princeton on its way out of Colusa County and eventually ends at its intersection
with State Route 32 in Hamilton City in Glenn County.
Market Street is an east-west, two-lane arterial that passes through the downtown commercial
area of Colusa. It acts as a “main street” for the City. From Tenth Street to Bridge Street, Market
Street is part of SR 20 and SR 45. From Tenth Street to Thirteenth Street, Market Street is a part of
SR 45. Market Street is a four-lane street from First Street to Tenth Street, and a two-lane street
outside this segment.
Bridge Street is a north-south, two-lane arterial located in eastern Colusa. This street passes
through the newer commercial development in the City. From Wescott Road to Market Street,
Bridge Street is a part of SR 20 and SR 45. Beyond Market Street, Bridge Street crosses over the
Sacramento River into the portion of Colusa County east of the river.
Tenth Street is a north-south, two-lane arterial in western Colusa. It begins at Harris Street and
extends into the Colusa Sacramento River State Recreation Area. From Harris Street to Market
Street, Tenth Street is part of SR 20.
                                          Wescott Road is a north-south, two-lane collector that
                                          extends south from Bridge Street. It serves the residential
                                          area located in southeastern Colusa and the Walnut
                                          Ranch residential subdivision outside the City limits.
                                          Fremont Street is an east-west, two-lane collector that
                                          extends from Tenth Street to Bridge Street. It passes by the
                                          primary and middle schools for Colusa, as well as by the
                                          Community Center for the Performing Arts building
                                          (formerly Colusa High School).

Sioc Street is an east-west, two-lane collector that extends from Tenth Street (SR 20) to Bridge
Street (SR 20/45). This street is residential in character until its intersection with Bridge Street,
where there is presently veterinary services and a local market. Many travelers passing through
Colusa currently use Sioc Street as their route of choice to connect between the two highway
segments of SR 20.
Main Street is an east-west two-lane collector that extends from Thirteenth Street to D Street.
Formerly the main street in the days when Colusa was a steamboat stop, it still serves some
commercial activities as well as residential access.
Third Street is a north-south, two-lane collector that extends from Main Street to the residential
area in southeastern Colusa.
ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION
Public Transportation
Colusa County Transit provides bus service Monday through Friday from 7:30 am to 5:00 pm. The
transit system operates on a “dial-a-ride” system on all four of its routes, which all originate in
Colusa. Bus service is provided regularly from Colusa to Williams, Arbuckle, and Grimes. Buses
go to Maxwell and Princeton twice a week, and to Stonyford about three times a month.
Ridership on Colusa County Transit has averaged about 4,500 passengers per month over the
past year (Barbara Salazar, Colusa County Transit, personal communication). The average is
higher during the summer months, when more migrant farm workers use the system. Average
ridership is lowest during the winter months (November-January), when agricultural employment
is at its lowest.
A supplemental taxi service that provided after-hours transit service ended last year, with the
retirement of the provider. Colusa County Transit has sought to find another provider of this
service, but lack of funds to subsidize potential providers has been an impediment. Colusa
County Transit has taken over the medical escort service previously provided by the taxi
company. This escort service takes riders to Yuba City, Woodland, Chico, and Sacramento.
Other destinations for this service are being considered.
Bicycle Circulation
Bikeways are commonly classified as follows:
•    A Bike Path (Class I Bikeway) provides for
     bicycle use on a paved right-of-way,
     separated from any street or highway.
     Under Caltrans standards, a bike path
     must be at least eight (8) feet wide for a
     two-way path.
•    A Bike Lane (Class II Bikeway) provides for
     a striped and stenciled lane for one-way
     travel on a street or highway. A Bike Lane
     has a minimum standard width of four (4)
     feet.

                                                          shared use of a street with pedestrians or
                                                          motor vehicle traffic and may be identified
                                                          only by signage. Bike routes usually are
                                                          used and posted to connect other bike

                                                      The County of Colusa prepared a Bicycle Plan
                                                      in 1992. The Bicycle Plan outlines general
                                                      design criteria for bicycle facilities and
                                                      designates bikeways for the County and its
                                                      incorporated cities, including Colusa. The
                                                      Bicycle Plan proposed Class III bicycle routes
                                                      within the City of Colusa along SR 20, SR 20/45,
                                                      Wescott Road, and Wilson Avenue. To date,
the only designated bikeway in the City is a Class III bike route along Wescott Road. There have
been no updates of the Bicycle Plan, so no new bikeways or changes to previously designated
routes have been proposed.
While there is only one designated bikeway in the City, bicyclists may use City streets for
traveling. In addition, the levee along the Sacramento River at the northern end of the City
provides a paved path that accommodates bicycle traffic.
Pedestrian Travel
Pedestrian movement occurs via a network of sidewalks along many streets throughout the City.
Typically, the City requires new development to install sidewalks as part of street improvements.
Some intersections have crosswalks that allow pedestrians to cross streets safely. The levee
along the northern end of Colusa provides a paved path for pedestrian use. There are no trails
in the City or its Planning Area.
Rail Service
There are no railroad facilities in the City of Colusa. A California Northern railroad line runs in a
north-south direction through Colusa County, passing by the communities of Maxwell, Williams,
and Arbuckle. This line is used for freight travel.
There is no passenger rail service in Colusa County. Amtrak operates a passenger rail route
along the eastern portion of the Sacramento Valley. An Amtrak train station was located in
Marysville, but it is now closed. The nearest Amtrak train stations are located in Chico,
Sacramento, and Davis.
Water Transportation
The Sacramento River was a major transportation route in Colusa’s past. Steamboats utilized
the river in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Colusa was an active steamboat stop for both
cargo and passengers. Steamboat service ceased by the 1930’s, and cargo ships now go no
farther north than Sacramento. Currently, recreational boating is the main transportation use of
the Sacramento River in the Colusa area. A boat launch ramp is available at the Colusa
Sacramento River State Recreation Area, adjacent to and north of the City. However, siltation
problems render the boat ramp usable only during times of high water. No other ramps or
marinas are located within the Planning Area. The City of Colusa supports having an
General Plan                                                                              City of Colusa

increase reliability and is pursuing grant funding to upgrade the facility through the Department
of Boats and Waterways.
Air Travel
The Colusa County Airport is located approximately 1.5 miles southeast of Colusa on the west
side of SR 20/45. It is under the jurisdiction of and operated by Colusa County and provides
general aviation services for the public. The airport has a single paved runway, 22 airport-
owned hangars, five privately owned hangars, and two agricultural operation hangars. Tie
down parking and fuel services are available.
The most recent estimate of annual flights is 28,000. According to data from AirNav.com and
conversations with Harry Krug, Airport Manager for Colusa County, approximately 64 percent of
the total airport operations are a result of locally-based crop-duster flight activity, with the
remaining 36 percent of operations coming from general aviation flights. Of the 36 percent of
general aviation flights handled by the airport, approximately 77 percent are transient general
aviation operations, with the remainder coming from local general aviation operations. The
airport does not provide scheduled passenger service. The nearest airport with this service is
Sacramento International Airport.
Private Transportation
Private bus service is not available in Colusa. Greyhound Bus Lines previously had a bus stop in
Williams, approximately ten miles to the west. However, Greyhound discontinued this bus stop in
April 2005. The nearest Greyhound bus stop is located in Marysville. Colusa County Cab
Company, based in Colusa, historically provided taxi service for residents in Colusa and
surrounding areas. However, as discussed on the Setting discussion on page 4-5, the service
provider has retired, and no service is currently available.
FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
Streets and highways in the City are described by their functional classification. These
classifications identify the purpose of the streets and highways relative to their overall function in
the distribution of different types of trips using the facilities. Figure 4.1 shows some of these street
classifications. The classifications that are relevant to the City are as follows:
Arterials
An arterial street is defined as a major street, consisting of two or more lanes, intended to move
traffic into and through the City. An arterial system consists of a network of regional routes
functioning primarily for the movement of through traffic, usually on continuous routes, with trip
length and capacities suitable for substantial statewide or interstate travel. The arterial functions
to form a regional network providing high-speed, high-volume travel corridors for uninterrupted
inter-county travel and movement between cities, large towns, and resort areas. Arterials are
spaced consistent with population density to provide a relatively high level of service to all
developed areas of the state. Caltrans is the agency responsible for improving and maintaining
these routes. In Colusa, SR 20 and SR 45, including Tenth, Market, and Bridge Streets, act as the
primary arterials through the City. Average daily trip volumes on arterial streets will vary based
upon adjacent land use types, available right-of-way width, and number of lanes. However,
arterial streets should be designed to accommodate average daily traffic volumes ranging from
20,000-26,000 average daily trips (ADT).

                                                    4-7
4.0 CIRCULATION
Collectors
Collector streets provide a link between local streets and arterial streets. Many local streets serve
as collectors. Main Street is a collector due to its commercial/light industrial land use. Third
Street is a collector from Yosemite Street to Fremont Street due to the subdivision design in that
area. This layout limits north/south traffic flows to either Third Street or Wescott Road, another
major north-south collector. Fremont Street is a collector street because the City previously had
designated it as a cross-town alternative to Market Street for traffic on SR 20. Fifth Street is a
collector due to its connection to Market Street in central downtown and due to potential
development south of the City. Other streets previously have been designated collectors due to
potential future development: Eighth Street, Thirteenth Street, D Street, Florimond Drive, Lurline
Avenue, and Will S. Green Avenue.
Residential collectors should be designed to carry over 3,000 ADT. Collectors that also act as
arterial streets, such as Tenth, Market, Bridge, and Main Streets, should not exceed 20,000 ADT.
Local Streets
Local streets primarily provide direct access to adjacent properties. Due to the use of the grid
street pattern, the majority of the streets in the City of Colusa are local streets. Local streets in
the basic grid pattern are intended to carry low-volume local traffic and are generally intended
to carry less than 1,000 ADT. Streets that allow access only to residential areas, such as cul-de-
sacs (e.g., Modoc Court) or small residential loops (e.g., Sequoia Way), should be limited to 500
ADT.
 LEVEL OF SERVICE STANDARDS
A “level of service” (LOS) is the operating condition experienced by motorists while driving along
a roadway. LOS is a qualitative measure of the effect of a number of factors, including speed
and travel time, traffic interruptions, freedom to maneuver, driving comfort, and convenience.
Designations for LOS are A through F, with A being the best and F the worst. LOS designations
cover the entire range of traffic operations that might occur. Tables 4.1 and 4.2 provide a
description of traffic operations under each LOS.
An important goal is to maintain acceptable LOS along the City’s road network. To accomplish
this, the City, Caltrans, and other local agencies adopt minimum levels of service in an attempt
to control congestion that may result as new development occurs. For Caltrans, the minimum
acceptable LOS for its roadways is D.

 The “v/c ratio” is a useful parameter for determining potential capacity deficiencies of a roadway facility. It is the result of the flow
 rate of a roadway lane (v) divided by the capacity (c) of the roadway lane.
 Overall Level of Service for unsignalized intersections is “worst case” of delay experienced by all motorists.

While assessment of peak hour conditions is standard for planning-level traffic studies it is also
beneficial to describe Levels of Service based on the ADT volumes occurring on major city
streets. Use of daily volumes permits relatively quick assessment of circulation system needs.

Existing Levels of Service – Roadway Segments
Table 4.3 presents current average daily trip volumes and resulting LOS on the streets and
highways that serve Colusa. The classification of each street under the proposed Circulation
Element is also noted.
As shown, all roadway segments currently carry volumes that are indicative of LOS C or better
conditions, with the exception of Bridge Street (SR 20) between Carson Street and Fremont
Street, which operates at LOS D.

 Existing Levels of Service – Intersections
 Current p.m. peak hour LOS at key intersections in Colusa are presented in Table 4.4. These
values are based on recent intersection traffic counts made between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
At signalized intersections and at locations controlled by all-way stops, these values represent
the average condition for motorists passing through the intersection. At intersections controlled
by side street stop signs, the values are representative of the delays occurred by motorists
waiting to turn onto the higher volume (larger) street.
As shown, the poorest Level of Service presently occurs at the SR 20 / Wescott Road intersection.
During the p.m. peak hour motorists waiting to turn onto SR 20 experience delays that are
indicative of LOS E conditions. The Level of Service at all other intersection is LOS C or better.
The extent to which any location is already a candidate for a traffic signal was also evaluated
using the peak hour volume traffic signal warrants, or traffic signal placement criteria,
established by Caltrans. These warrants, or traffic signal placement criteria, consider both urban
and rural conditions. Assuming that the higher volume urban warrants are applicable, none of
the intersections satisfies warrants.

Parking
An auxiliary requirement for good circulation in the downtown area is parking availability. The
parking inventory in the Downtown Improvement and Preservation Plan indicates a total of 1,205
off-street parking spaces in downtown Colusa generally located on either side of Main and
Market Streets and along the north side of Jay Street and between Bridge Street and 10th Street.
The inventory also indicates that in certain key areas of downtown, along Fifth, Sixth, Seventh,
and Jay Streets in particular, on-street parking utilization is at 85 percent, which is considered at
capacity. The downtown area of the City lacks sufficient parking during certain days of the
week, typically weekdays. This information is somewhat dated, but given the relatively small
increase in the City’s population, the current parking situation is not expected to be substantially
different.

State and Regional Trends
Traffic congestion and related conditions (e.g., “urban sprawl”) are currently not issues in the
City of Colusa. However, these issues have been identified as a significant problem in several
regions of California, particularly the Sacramento region to the south. Several significant trends
affect the problem.
People are driving more miles because suburban sprawl necessitates greater reliance on the
automobile. As land and housing costs increase in the greater Sacramento region, many
people have moved to outlying areas, requiring them to make longer commute trips. In some
counties with “bedroom communities,” residents commute up to two hours in each direction –
predominantly in single-occupancy vehicles.
General Plan                                                                                  City of Colusa

In addition, the number of employed persons per household has increased and, as a result,
these drivers are running more errands (e.g., picking up children) during peak hours.
Another trend has lead to the development of consolidated centers with retail, school, park,
and government activities located farther away from traditional neighborhoods. A convenient
walking distance is considered to be no more than a ¼- to ½-mile radius from a residence. More
of these consolidated facilities are located outside this typical walking radius, thereby
necessitating a greater number of motor vehicle trips.
The growth in traffic is a regional problem closely tied to the pattern of land use that has evolved
in the Bay Area and Sacramento regions. Since 1970, job growth has been concentrated in the
inner Bay Area counties and in Sacramento and Placer Counties in the Sacramento region.
Combined with lower housing costs, more people have been buying homes in the Central
Valley region and commuting to jobs in the Sacramento region or the Bay Area. The proximity of
Colusa to Sacramento, the town’s relatively lower housing costs, its close proximity to Interstate
5, and its small-town quality, are all factors that are expected to make Colusa an attractive
location for future residents.      More housing, in turn, would have an impact on traffic. In
addition, Colusa is located on the main road (SR 20) connecting Interstate 5 with the fast-
growing Yuba City/Marysville urban area. Traffic on SR 20, therefore, likely will increase as well.
Traffic Congestion
As discussed in the “Setting” section of this element, traffic congestion is currently not a
significant issue in Colusa. However, as local and regional growth occurs, congestion may
become more significant, and this discussion may need to be revisited. Should this issue re-
surface due to growth within Colusa or the surrounding area, discussions regarding traffic
congestion and traffic movement should involve all responsible parties, and solutions may be
regional in nature or may involve roadways not controlled by the City. Resolution of traffic and
traffic congestion issues will most likely require the cooperative efforts of various local, regional,
and state agencies.
Future Levels of Service
Future LOS on City streets and roadways was determined based on future development and
corresponding traffic volumes projected in the Colusa area. Specifically, these projections are
based on the buildout scenario presented in the Land Use Diagram for this General Plan (Figure
2.3). Trip generation rates are applied to the designated land uses in the Land Use Diagram,
providing estimates of traffic generated by these land uses.
The City’s goal is to avoid a degradation of the existing LOS. Increased traffic from SR 20, Bridge
Street, Wescott Road, and Third Street due to planned residential, commercial, and industrial
development, coupled with anticipated growth in the region, may make it necessary to provide
improvements for circulation. Emergency access considerations are directly linked to levels of
service, particularly when access to the medical center by emergency personnel depends on
the use of already congested roadways, such as Bridge Street. The General Plan Circulation
Plan and related policies recognize the need for multiple access routes across town.
Future development in the southern portion of the City may ultimately generate a need for an
east-west collector street based upon the identification of potential trip generation resulting at
the time of build-out of the General Plan Land Use Diagram. The City previously considered the
acquisition of the Union Pacific right-of-way, located on the southern boundary of the Sphere of
Influence, for a future collector street. However, a private party has acquired the right-of-way,

and the City is no longer pursuing this option. At this time, the Circulation diagram does not
contemplate the need for a future east-west collector street within the life of the General Plan.
Should future development in the southern portions of the City result in changes to the City’s
Land Use Diagram, the need for such an improvement will be evaluated at that time. Due to
increased development in the southern portion of the City, a future collector from Farinon Road
to Wescott Road may be necessary. According to the 2004 State Transportation Improvement
Program (STIP), current programmed road projects in the City of Colusa are road rehabilitation
projects on Seventh Street from Webster to Parkhill Street, Parkhill Street from Tenth to Eleventh
Street, and Wescott Road from Louis Lane to Country Club Drive.
One change that has occurred in the traffic situation since the last General Plan update has
been the growth of the Colusa Casino Resort, located on SR 45 approximately three miles to the
north of the City. The Cachil Dehe Band of the Wintun tribe operates the casino. Casino growth
has attracted more traffic, much of which comes through the City. Given the increase in traffic
to the casino, the City may wish to consider transportation services that provide an alternative to
motor vehicle trips. One possibility is the creation of a shuttle service between Colusa Casino
and downtown Colusa. The shuttle could potentially reduce the amount of traffic on SR 45, as
well as encourage more visitors to stay in the City. A reduction in traffic volumes from existing
land use inside and outside the City could affect future traffic levels of service through the
overall reduction in fixed destination trips.
Air Quality and Health Issues
Air pollution is a major regional issue that has been firmly linked to transportation – cars cause
more than half of all air pollution in California. Strict emission-control standards have improved
auto emissions since the 1960s, but air quality will be worse in the future because people are
driving more. The California Clean Air Act was passed in 1988 to address this issue. The Act
established strict new air quality standards and gave air quality districts new powers to achieve
them. The Parks, Recreation, and Resource Conservation Element of this General Plan discusses
air quality issues in more detail.
The impacts of automobile use on air quality will continue to shape regional, state, and federal
transportation policies. Air quality issues will also shape local transportation policies, as efforts to
reduce emissions from motor vehicles are emphasized more. Local air quality could be
potentially affected by increased traffic in the Colusa area. Increased traffic would contribute
more exhaust emissions that would adversely affect air quality. Traffic congestion would
exacerbate the problem, particularly as it would increase localized emissions of carbon
monoxide.
Given the emphasis on improving air quality, the City should consider programs that encourage
less use of gasoline-powered vehicles. As an example, the City could consider parking areas
with electrical outlets for electric cars. Another alternative is the encouragement of ridesharing
programs, using incentives. Still another is encouragement of the use of public transportation
and other modes of travel. This Element discusses alternative mode options in the Setting and
Goals, Policies, and Implementing Actions Sections.
Circulation has an impact on health issues other than air quality. Recently, concern has been
expressed regarding the increasing number of people who are obese, particularly children.
Several factors are involved in this increase in obesity, but one factor cited is the increased use
of automobiles and the associated decrease in the use of alternate modes of transportation
that provide exercise, such as bicycling and walking. This trend has been facilitated by land use
decisions that separate places where people live from places where they work, shop, and
General Plan                                                                              City of Colusa

conduct personal business. Separation of these land uses compels people to use their
automobiles more, and discourages walking and bicycling. The City, in its land use plans and
decisions, should consider measures that
would encourage more walking and
bicycling. Along with providing exercise
that promotes weight loss, these measures
would reduce the number of automobile
trips, thereby reducing congestion and
emissions of air pollutants.      As noted
previously, this Element addresses these
issues through its Goals, Policies, and
Implementing Actions, which promote
walking and bicycling.
Parking
The City will further encourage utilization
of existing off-street parking. Off-street parking is underutilized, and additional potential for off-
street spaces has not been explored. There are two locations in the downtown area that have
potential for an off-street parking structure. These areas are located at Fourth and Jay Streets
and 10th and Market Streets. However, availability of funding and aesthetic considerations may
discourage the construction of parking structures.
One option would be to place commercial and retail space at the street level, and parking at
levels above the commercial/retail space.               Sales tax revenues generated by the
commercial/retail activities would help defray the operating expenses of the garage. Also, the
commercial/retail outlets would present a more appealing street-level view of the garage
building, thereby addressing potential visual character problems. Several cities, including Santa
Cruz and Mountain View, have built or approved parking garages with retail space.
Traffic Calming
In residential areas where vehicle speeds are excessive, it is common practice to install traffic
calming intersection designs to slow down vehicles. In addition to the more traditional stop signs
and speed bumps, traffic-calming techniques include roundabouts and street narrowing. City
staff is in the process of evaluating alternative traffic calming techniques, which may be
required in new development projects.
Aesthetics and Scenic Highways
Minimizing noise, traffic, and air pollution and maintaining visual aesthetics should be key
objectives in transportation planning. Landscaping, buffers, and related design features can
minimize exposure of the community to noise and air pollution caused by traffic. Some
communities have implemented design features for development projects that screen
occupants from the noise and views of traffic. Other communities have created special design
requirements for streets as a technique to improve the appearance of roads and better
integrate them into the community. Major streets that pass through residential neighborhoods
carry traffic in the same way as other streets, but design elements can screen sidewalks and
front yards from the sights and sounds of heavy traffic, slow the speed of vehicles, and narrow
the streets—either physically or by appearance. These elements include:

•    Reducing curb-to-curb pavement widths where performance standards for garage
     placement, projected traffic, and parking restrictions are used.
•    Installing planter strips between streets and sidewalks.
•    Screening cars parked at the curb from residences and commercial developments by the
     use of landscaping, walls, etc.
•    Planting trees between curb and sidewalk.
The Community Character and Design Element contains a discussion of these and other features
applicable to streets.
The Colusa County Circulation Element proposes the designation of SR 20/45 as a scenic
highway. Although the SR 20/45 corridor through Colusa contains urban development, a scenic
designation may assist the downtown area through increased tourism. This would work in
tandem with the proposed design guidelines for the Downtown and Riverfront districts, as set
forth in the Community Character and Design Element.
ALTERNATIVE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION
Public Transportation
Future growth in the City of Colusa will naturally place additional ridership demands on the
public transit system within the City and the region. As the City expands and grows away from
its central core, the need for public transportation options grows as well. Along with the growth
of the City comes an increase in demand for public transit—particularly for the aged, disabled,
and others without access to private transportation.
Mobility is essential to personal, neighborhood, and community growth and opportunity.
Transportation facilities should be designed to serve all members of the community, particularly
those with special needs—seniors, low-income households, and persons with disabilities—to meet
their daily and medical transportation requirements. Public transit will become increasingly
important as senior citizens make up an increasingly larger percentage of Colusa’s population.
Lower-income families also depend on buses or other means of public transportation for
mobility. The City will need to ensure accessibility for its disabled population, as well, since it is
expected to increase along with the general population in the City. Additionally, it means
making existing transit stops, sidewalks, and other circulation facilities more accessible to this
special needs group.
Land use considerations influence transit demand and usage. Logical transit routes and
potential locations for fixed stops must be easily accessible to as many people as possible (i.e.,
within ¼- to ½-mile radii). Both land use mix and density are important to enhancing transit
demand and usage. A mix of complementary uses within a short distance of a transit stop
enables a rider to accomplish more than one errand or task with one stop. Conversely, single
uses force the transit rider to take several rides or trips to different destinations in order to
accomplish more than one errand or task, which discourages transit use. To encourage use,
transit stops should be located to provide easy and direct pedestrian connections within walking
distance.

Bicycle Circulation
As with public transit, anticipated new growth within the City will result in additional new
opportunities and new demands for non-vehicular travel options. As development moves
progressively outward from the central core of the City and correspondingly farther from
established public service centers, the need for connectivity of existing bicycle routes is
increased along with the need for new bicycle route options. Increases in residential
development will result in increases to local school enrollment and a corresponding increase in
the use of non-motorized travel needs within the City.
The outlook for bicycle circulation within the City is very good. Because of Colusa’s grid-based
street system and the relatively small geographical size of the City, bicycle travel remains a
viable, efficient, and convenient method of transportation. However, as the size of the City
grows, motorized traffic trips and the distance between destinations and origins increase, safety
becomes a primary concern with regard to bicycle travel within the City. A consistent bicycle
network with either bicycle lanes or wider curb lanes is desired to increase safe access for
bicyclists and pedestrians to work, school, recreation, retail, and other destinations. Appropriate
design that balances automobile and pedestrian uses can enhance transportation facilities and
make them an asset to the community and neighborhood. These considerations will become
increasingly important as anticipated growth in Colusa and the surrounding region occurs, and
the City will need to place a growing emphasis on the inclusion of such facilities in future
development projects.
Pedestrian Travel
As noted above the in the outlook discussions for public transportation and bicycle circulation, it
is anticipated that pedestrian travel and the need for pedestrian amenities will increase as the
City grows. In particular, pedestrian travel is expected to increase along Third, Fifth, Seventh,
Eighth, Webster, and Twelfth Streets as a result of new residential developments south of Sioc
Street. In recognition of the probability of increased pedestrian travel, the City should review the
existing sidewalk system to identify any system deficiencies and areas where improvements are
needed and should work to assure that pedestrian connections are included in new
development proposals. As noted in the bicycle circulation system discussion above, Colusa’s
small size, grid-street system and concentrated development pattern make the City a very
walkable community. As the City grows, the maintenance of this condition should be preserved,
and new connections and pedestrian amenities should be evaluated.
Rail Service
The City of Colusa does not currently have commuter or freight rail service available within the
City. However, while such service is not currently available, the City should support regional
efforts to secure rail services if the opportunity arises.
Water Transportation
As with rail service, water transportation services are not currently available in the City.
However, existing boat launch facilities at the Colusa-Sacramento River State Recreation Area
serve as a valuable recreational amenity for the community and region when available and
functional. As additional growth occurs within the City, a corresponding increase in the
demand for recreation opportunities and access to the Sacramento River is expected. To
support the anticipated demand for increased river access, the City is proactively seeking to

work with the State Parks and Recreation Department to assure that this valuable facility remains
open and available for public use.
Air Travel
The Colusa County Airport does not currently provide regularly scheduled air transport services.
However, as the population of the City of Colusa grows and as additional business and industrial
uses are established to support the growth in the residential sector, options for charter air service
and air cargo and freight operations may become available. The presence of a viable local
airport with an existing fixed-based operator should be a viewed as a resource that is available
should opportunities for air travel become available or feasible. The City, working with the
County and the Airport Land Use Commission, should be sensitive to the impacts of
development on airport operations and should work with local businesses to enhance the
visibility of the existing airport.
PRIVATE TRANSPORTATION
The nearest commercial bus service is available in Marysville. Colusa Casino Resort, one of the
major destination locations in the region, has become a major visitor attraction and could
present opportunities for the establishment of a limited operation shuttle service between the
City and the casino. As the City continues to grow, and as additional population growth in the
adjacent county areas continues, increases in demand may result in increased opportunity for
the expansion of existing and development of new private transportation services.
4.4       GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
MOTOR VEHICLE CIRCULATION
The overall absence of urban traffic congestion in the City of Colusa is an important aspect of its
quality of life and small-town character.
Future growth will require development of new roadways and widenings and improvements of
existing roadways. To ensure smooth-flowing traffic conditions on City roadways, the General
Plan establishes policies and implementing actions to ensure an acceptable level of service
(LOS) as new development occurs. LOS C or better is generally the roadway standard for streets
and intersections throughout the City. However, LOS D will be considered acceptable in existing
heavily-traveled areas through the downtown, particularly along the SR 20/45 and SR 20
corridors. The General Plan also includes provisions for the funding of new roadways to serve
new development.
The General Plan calls for improvements to the regional transportation system and
improvements and funding for a local transportation system primarily for City of Colusa residents,
employees, and visitors.

The City shall ensure the maintenance of acceptable Levels of Service (LOS) on City streets and
intersections when considering new development within Colusa.
         Implementing Action CIR-1.1.a: Streets and Roadways Master Plan
         The City will prepare, adopt, and periodically update a Streets and Roadways Master
         Plan that establishes LOS C as the minimum acceptable LOS for City streets and
         intersections, except in the downtown area on SR 20/45 and SR 20 (Market, Bridge, 10th,
         and Main Streets), where LOS D is established as the minimum acceptable LOS,
         consistent with Caltrans LOS standards for state highways through urban areas. If
         conditions of LOS D or worse are already present, future proposed projects may not
         cause roadway volumes to increase by five percent or more and will be accompanied
         by other mitigation measures intended to reduce trip generation.
         Implementing Action CIR-1.1.b: Development Review
         The City will conduct a review of each proposed development for potential traffic
         impacts. If the City determines that a development proposal requires a traffic impact
         study, the analysis will be prepared consistent with the assumptions and methodology
         used for traffic projections made in this General Plan, consistent with the California
         Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process.
Policy CIR-1.2:
The City shall extend the existing street grid pattern into new development areas where feasible,
as a general guideline. However, the City may allow new development projects to design
streets on a traditional, modified, or curvilinear grid within the City’s arterial street network,
consistent with the goals, policies and implementing actions in the Community Character and

5.1      INTRODUCTION
The Safety Element, a legally required Element of the General Plan, identifies and appraises
potential safety hazards within the City, and is used as a guide for establishing land use patterns
that minimize the exposure of City residents to excessive natural and man-made hazards. It also
establishes policies and implementing actions that will minimize risks associated with seismic,
geologic, flood, fire, and environmental hazards. By identifying these hazards and the
appropriate abatement measures, the Safety Element will effectively reduce the potential for
events to occur that would threaten lives, damage property, and disrupt the local economy.
While seismic and geologic hazards in Colusa are minimal, seismic and geologic goals and
policies are provided to protect the City’s residents from danger associated with active faults,
liquefaction, and ground failure. Drainage channels within the City and the Sacramento River
trigger the need for development standards to provide flood protection.
Goals and policies in the Chapter also address issues related to fire hazards, hazardous
materials, and airport hazards. Existing and planned residential, commercial, and industrial
development, as well as undeveloped properties and grasslands surrounding the City pose
potential safety hazards the City must address.
The airport policies contained in the Colusa County Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan
(CLUP) are addressed both in this element and the Circulation Element. Specifically, the Safety
Element will address proposed land uses within the airport overflight and safety zones.
Other emergency services and programs addressed in this Element include police, fire,
emergency response, and health services – all critical aspects of planning for the health, safety,
and welfare of Colusa residents. The police and fire discussions in this Element relate specifically
to the City’s ability to provide for the public’s health, safety, and welfare. The facilities planning
associated with police and fire services is addressed the Municipal Facilities and Services
Element. The Community Character and Design Element discusses aspects of design that
promote safety, and the Circulation Element includes policies and actions that encourage safe
travel.
5.2.1 SETTING - SEISMIC AND GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS
TOPOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY
The City of Colusa is located adjacent to the Sacramento River in the center of the Sacramento
Valley. The topography of Colusa is relatively flat, with little change in elevation. The highest
elevations are found along the levees of the Sacramento River.
The geological history of the Colusa area includes a mixture of ancient marine and alluvial
deposits. About 300 million years ago, a vast sea occupied the valley and upland areas of
Colusa County. Up to 155 million years ago, periods of volcanic activity and uplifting were
followed by periods of uplifting and folding, which formed the Coast Range to the west. These
periods ended about three to four million years ago, when the sediments of the Tehama
Formation were deposited from coastal range streams onto the valley floor.
The floor of the Sacramento Valley, which was formed by the uplift of the mountains surrounding

years ago.
SEISMIC HAZARDS
There are no known active faults within Colusa County. However, the possibility of an
earthquake affecting the City of Colusa cannot be ruled out. Colusa County is vulnerable to
moderate ground shaking from earthquakes centered outside of the County. Four minor quakes
on an unknown fault in the coastal foothills to the west occurred in 1985. Earthquakes of a
maximum magnitude of 5.7 on the Richter scale could occur at the nearest known fault at the
Sutter Buttes. This could cause ground shaking in Colusa County up to an intensity of VI to VII, as
measured by the Modified Mercalli Scale. The effects of earthquakes of this magnitude on
structures are described as minor to moderate, especially in un-reinforced masonry chimneys
and architectural ornaments. Still, the best geologic evidence indicates that Colusa would
experience only low-intensity shaking from faults
outside the County.
Liquefaction is a hazard associated with seismic
activity.    Liquefaction occurs when seismic
waves act upon water in saturated soils,
causing the soils to lose their cohesiveness and
act like a liquid. As the description indicates,
liquefaction tends to occur in soils that are
moist, which generally includes soils near
streams and bodies of water. Colusa is located
on the west bank of the Sacramento River, on
top of soils formed by deposits left from previous
flooding. These soils tend to contain silts, which
can become moist easily. Liquefaction could
be a concern in areas with soils located near
the Sacramento River.
GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS
Geological hazards, as defined in this Safety Element, include hazards such as landslides,
mudslides, volcanic hazards, subsidence, unstable soils, and expansive soils. Soils in the Colusa
area tend to be loams and silt loams. Because of the extremely flat topography, these soils do
not have a tendency to become unstable. There is no danger of landslides or mudslides in
Colusa or its Planning Area due to the flat topography. The nearest volcano is Lassen Peak,
approximately 90 miles to the northeast. It is possible that Colusa could receive deposits of ash
from an eruption of Lassen Peak, weather conditions permitting. However, the likelihood of any
significant hazard from Lassen Peak is considered low.
Subsidence is defined as localized sinking of the ground surface. Subsidence can be caused by
excessive groundwater withdrawal, extraction of gas or oil, or by tectonic movement. It can
cause damage to all types of construction, such as buildings and roadways. The City of Colusa is
in an area of known low subsidence. Groundwater levels have remained relatively steady,
preventing subsidence from occurring.
Expansive soils are soils that expand as they gain moisture and contract as they lose moisture.
These “shrink-swell” soils can do damage to building foundations and to infrastructure such as
roadways and pipelines. Generally, expansive soils contain a significant amount of clay. Three

swell potential: the Moonbend silt loam, the Colusa loam, and the Grandbend loam.
5.2.2 OUTLOOK - SEISMIC AND GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS
The City of Colusa is located in an area of California that experiences less seismic activity than
other areas of the State. However, the City could be exposed to ground shaking from active
earthquake faults in the region. Therefore, the City’s ability to respond to a seismic event is
important to the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.
The City of Colusa contains many older commercial and residential buildings. Many of these
buildings are constructed with masonry that may be un-reinforced against seismic shocks.
Absent any seismic retrofitting, these buildings, or portions of these buildings, could suffer
moderate to severe damage or collapse, endangering people both within and outside these
structures. As described above, the City could experience earthquakes of an intensity that
could damage un-reinforced masonry buildings or building elements. Older residential buildings
constructed with masonry are also potentially vulnerable to damage. The extent of this
vulnerability is unknown at this time.
5.2.3 GOALS, POLICIES,          AND  IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS       FOR   SEISMIC AND    GEOLOGICAL
HAZARDS
Goal SAF-1:
To minimize injury and property damage due to seismic and geologic hazards.
Policy SAF-1.1:
The City shall continue to mitigate the potential impacts of seismic and geologic hazards.
         Implementing Action SAF-1.1.a: Development Review
         The City will continue to refer all development proposals to the Fire and Building
         Department/Building Division, Public Works Department, and City Engineer to address
         potential seismic or geologic impacts. The City will require development applicants to
         provide specific data requirements pertaining to potential seismic and geologic hazards
         and, where necessary, require geotechnical reporting by a licensed soils or geotechnical
         engineer. In all development review, the City will continue to enforce the Uniform
         Building Code, including seismic design provisions. These review requirements will apply
         to all public and private building construction.
         Implementing Action SAF-1.1.b: Ordinance and Regulation Review and Update
         The City will review and revise its Subdivision Ordinance as needed to incorporate
         specific data and design requirements related to ground failure and other seismic and
         geological hazards that are contained in this General Plan update.

Policy SAF-1.2:
The City will continue to maintain current information on seismic hazards and take appropriate
action if significant seismic hazards, including potentially active faults, are discovered within the
City or the Planning Area.
         Implementing Action SAF-1.2.a: Seismic Information Update
         The City will monitor California Geological Survey studies for potentially active faults in the
         vicinity of Colusa. Information on a previously unknown or inactive fault that is discovered
         or becomes active can be obtained by monitoring such studies. If any such fault in the
         region is discovered, the City will consider modifications to its development and building
         codes to reduce potential hazards. The City will periodically update its maps and
         information on seismic hazards for use in evaluating development proposals. As part of
         its annual review of the General Plan, the City will update its information on seismic and
         geologic hazards.
5.3.1 SETTING - FLOOD HAZARDS
HYDROLOGY/DRAINAGE
The Sacramento River forms a natural boundary
for the City of Colusa. The River originates in the
mountains of Siskiyou County and flows
generally in a north-south direction until it
empties into Suisun Bay. Other streams in the
vicinity of Colusa include Lurline Creek,
Freshwater Creek, and Salt Creek. These creeks
flow west to east from the foothills toward
Colusa, but are redirected south by the Colusa
canal located three miles west of the City.
It is not unusual for cities located in areas of
relatively flat topography, such as Colusa, to
have drainage problems.              The City has
experienced drainage problems on its east side,
which have been examined in studies dating
back to 1936.
To the west of the City is a drainage feature called the Colusa Basin, served by the Colusa Drain.
The Colusa Basin drains approximately 230,000 acres along the west side of the Sacramento
River, discharging into the Sacramento River at Knights Landing, northeast of the City of
Woodland.
FLOODING
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has mapped the flood hazard zones for
the City of Colusa and most of the surrounding vicinity. The 100-year floodplain designation

(Zone X) indicates the probable maximum extent of flooding during a storm with a one percent
probability of occurrence in any given year. The 100-year flood is the standard generally used in
flood hazard planning. Figure 5.1 illustrates the 100-year floodplain boundary (Zone X), based on
the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) for Colusa and surrounding area. Figure 5.1 shows that
most land in the City limits lies outside the 100-year flood hazard (within Flood Zone X), due
mainly to the protection afforded by the levee running parallel to Main Street in the downtown
area.
However, flooding within the City’s Planning Area occurs, and can do so even during mild
storms. Periods of flooding can cause significant circulation problems and has resulted in some
property damage in flood-prone areas. Flooding events cause inconveniences and potential
safety hazards to motorists traveling through the flooded streets and property owners attempting
to access parked cars. Minor flooding events can appear as quickly as one hour after
significant rainstorms. While flooding may occur as quickly as one hour after the initiation of a
storm event, generally speaking, the flooded areas drain within two or three hours after the end
of the storm event.
DAMS AND LEVEES
Five reservoirs, which retain water from the Sacramento River or its tributaries, could cause
damage in the City of Colusa if their dams were to fail: Lake Oroville, Shasta Lake, Whiskeytown
Lake, Black Butte Lake, and East Park Reservoir. The Governor’s Office of Emergency Services
(OES) maintains maps of inundation resulting from hypothetical severe dam failure, which may
occur primarily due to earthquake activity or unusual weather conditions. Floodwaters would
reach the Colusa according to the following time projections: Lake Oroville - 8 hours; Lake
Shasta - 42 hours; Black Butte Lake - 35 hours; Whiskeytown Lake - 82 hours; and East Park
Reservoir - 35 hours.
Colusa is situated on the southern bank of a bend in the Sacramento River, which drains the
                                                        northern half of the Central Valley. No other
                                                        major bodies of water are located within the

                                                        The main channel for the Colusa Drain is an
                                                        excavated earthen channel. The channel
                                                        has levees on both sides for the most part,
                                                        and levee height varies to a maximum of
                                                        approximately six feet. Additional levees
                                                        along tributary drains connect to the Colusa

The information presented above shall be used for emergency planning and is based on worst-
case scenarios. The time factors indicated appear to allow for safe evacuation out of the
Colusa area both to the south and west. Also, it should be noted that the probability of dam
failure at any given time is low. The Division of Safety of Dams, a division of the California
Department of Water Resources, inspects dams under state jurisdiction on a periodic basis for
structural integrity. Responsibility for the safety of dams under federal jurisdiction belongs to the

the Federal Guidelines for Dam Safety prepared by FEMA.
5.3.2 OUTLOOK - FLOOD HAZARDS
Future development will significantly increase the amount of impervious surface areas in the City
while decreasing natural vegetation. Such conditions limit water percolation and, without
adequate mitigation, can increase stormwater runoff and decrease the time required to reach
peak discharge rates. The City is committed to minimizing damage due to flood hazards by
identifying floodplain boundaries and limiting development in areas where flooding is likely to
occur.
The levee adjacent to downtown Colusa plays a major role in protecting the City from flooding
by the Sacramento River. The City shall cooperate with all agencies seeking to maintain the
levee system, and the City shall not allow development to occur that would threaten the
structural integrity of the levee.
Localized flooding does occur within the City, primarily on the east side. The flooding has been
serious enough to threaten public safety and property. Future development of properties east
of Bridge Street and State Route (SR) 20 must adequately address and mitigate impacts upon
storm water drainage systems. The studies noted in Section 5.3.1 above document the need for
a comprehensive solution to storm- and surface-water drainage and disposal.
The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA) requires local governments to develop and submit
mitigation plans by November 1, 2004, as a condition of receiving Hazard Mitigation Grant
Program and other related funds. FEMA will continue to make funds available for hazard
mitigation planning. Also, FEMA distributes monies for Flood Mitigation Assistance to states that,
in turn, provide funds to communities. Allocation of these funds is focused on repetitive loss
properties.

5.4.1 SETTING - FIRE HAZARDS
Fires can be significant hazards in developed areas. Even well-constructed buildings may suffer
damage from fires started accidentally or intentionally. In addition, structures located adjacent
to fields and wildlands may be vulnerable to fires started on such lands. In addition to property
damage, fires pose a threat to human life.
The City of Colusa, surrounded by agricultural
fields, is in an area of low potential for wildfires.
Cultivated and irrigated fields have a low
incidence of fire, unless these fields are burned
as part of agricultural operations. Such burning
would pose a threat only to City structures
adjacent to these fields. However, in recent
years the State of California has sought to
discourage burning of agricultural fields,
particularly rice fields that are widespread in
Colusa County. The City of Colusa Fire Chief
has expressed concern that this could lead to a
greater potential for vegetation fires, as fields
are not maintained. This could become more
of a concern as the City annexes agricultural
fields that may not be developed immediately.
Fires originating in these fields could threaten
adjacent existing buildings.
The riparian area adjacent to the Sacramento River is a potential source of wildland fires, started
by either natural or human causes. This hazard would be greatest during the summer and early
autumn. Lack of rain lowers river levels, and low humidity and high temperatures cause some
vegetation to lose moisture. Given its proximity to the Sacramento River, the riparian area is
unlikely to go completely dry, except during times of severe drought. Most of the riparian area is
separated from the City by the levee in the downtown area. However, it is possible that fires in
the riparian area would jump over the levee and threaten adjacent buildings.
In summary, the potential fire hazard to Colusa from adjacent open space and agricultural

FIRE PROTECTION
The City of Colusa Fire Department provides firefighting services within the City limits. The City of
Colusa Fire Department also participates in a countywide mutual aid program with six other fire
protection agencies within Colusa County. Fire Department career staff consists of the Fire
Chief, Assistant Fire Chief, Fire Captain/Mechanic, and two (2) Fire Apparatus Engineers (FAE).
Volunteer staff consists of a Division Chief, four (4) captains, four (4) Driver/Operators, and 17
firefighters. Of the entire staff, 12 personnel are trained as Emergency Medical Technicians, and
all other personnel are trained as First Responders. Shift personnel work 24-hour rotating shifts
year-round.
The Fire Department has one fire station in the City of Colusa, located at 750 Market Street.
Firefighting equipment consists of four engine pumpers (three with a capacity of more than
1,250 gallons per minute [gpm] and one with a capacity of 1,000 gpm), one ladder truck with a
1,500-gpm capacity and 500-gallon water tank, and one grass rig with a 300-gpm capacity and
500-gallon tank. One reserve ambulance is housed for emergency backup only, but it is rarely
dispatched.
Total service calls for the Fire Department in 2004 were 450. Of these, 235 were for emergency
medical service. According to the Fire Chief, the Fire Department can provide an average
three- to four-minute response time to anywhere within the current service area. Access
problems are slight throughout the City of Colusa, as most of the City’s streets are configured in
a grid pattern that facilitates emergency vehicle movement. Traffic is the primary issue the Fire
Department considers when answering a service call.
The Fire Department currently has an Insurance Services Office (ISO) rating of 3. An ISO rating is
based on the public protection classification program, which rates a given city’s fire service for
water supply, equipment, personnel, alarm and dispatch, and training. A city’s ISO rating is a
prime factor in determining fire insurance rates within that community. The rating is on a scale of
1 to 10, with 1 representing the best level of fire protection.
5.4.2 OUTLOOK – FIRE HAZARDS
State restrictions on agricultural field burning could lead to a reduction in properly maintained
fields. Vegetation in these fields could pose a fire hazard, particularly during the dry season,
generally from May to October. Also, annexation of this type of land may increase the fire
hazard to existing structures adjacent to the annexed land, particularly if it remains in an
undeveloped state. The City and its Fire Department should consider developing a strategy that
would reduce the potential fire hazard posed by these undeveloped areas. One option could
include weed abatement, which could be required as a condition of approval for new
development or annexation.
Recent construction practices and building code revisions have significantly reduced the
incidence of fires in buildings. However, older structures within the City may not have been
brought up to recent code standards and, therefore, may pose a greater potential fire hazard.
The City should actively identify these structures and enforce measures that would abate or
address potential hazards. Options could include a nuisance abatement program and low- or
no-interest loans for fire safety building upgrades.
As a city’s population increases, fire department personnel typically need to increase to
maintain steady levels of service. The nationally-accepted standard is one fire department
employee per 1,000 residents. Based on the range of population projections in the Land Use
General Plan                                                                            City of Colusa

Element, the Colusa Fire Department would potentially need seven to 11 additional firefighting
personnel by the year 2020. The Fire Department currently does not have adequate staff to
serve the projected population increases. However, budget changes, development fees, and
changes in training requirements could influence future staffing levels.
5.4.3 GOALS, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS FOR FIRE HAZARDS
Goal SAF-3:
To minimize the potential for loss of life, property, and the environment due to fire.
Policy SAF-3.1:
The City shall require new development and redevelopment projects to incorporate fire-safe
design and practices in new construction.
         Implementing Action SAF-3.1.a: Fire and Safety Codes
         Through the Colusa Fire Department, the City will continue to enforce state and federal
         codes relating to fire and safety. Specifically, the Fire Department will apply the Uniform
         Codes to their inspection procedures, including but not limited to the Uniform Fire Code,
         California Fire Code, National Electrical Code, Uniform Mechanical Code, and codes
         relating to hazardous materials disposal. Where appropriate, the Fire Department will
         refer code violations to the City’s Building Department for enforcement.
         The City may consider the adoption of an ordinance requiring the abatement of
         structural hazards in unreinforced masonry buildings.
         Implementing Action SAF-3.1.b: Development Review
         Through the project review process, the City will continue to ensure that landscaping,
         lighting, building siting and design, adequate water pressure and peak load storage
         capacity, and building construction materials reduce the opportunity for fire hazards.
         The City will also continue to implement requirements for non-combustible roofs.
         The City will continue to require access for emergency vehicles and firefighting
         equipment on all new development and redevelopment projects. Whenever feasible,
         the City will encourage new development or redevelopment projects to maintain the
         basic grid pattern of the City’s streets to facilitate access.
Policy SAF-3.2:
The City shall work to reduce fire hazard risks in existing buildings.
         Implementing Action SAF-3.2.a: Fire Department Review and Fire Safety Management
         The City will include Fire Department review and comments on proposed building plans
         to address safety concerns. The Department will require property owners to maintain their
         structures in compliance with safety standards identified in adopted Fire Codes. The
         Department will promote smoke detector installation in existing structures and adopt
         requirements for the installation of fire suppression equipment as a condition for granting
         a permit on new development or redevelopment projects. Part of the City’s fire safety

        its strong ISO rating of 3.
        Implementing Action SAF-3.4.b: City Budget and Rate Review
        During its annual budget review, the City will consider the needs of the Colusa Fire
        Department and will support those needs with budget revenues, grants, and impact
        fees. As part of the budget review process, the City will review impact fee rates to
        ensure they adequately reflect a fair share of funding by development and other Fire
        Department service recipients.
5.5.1 SETTING - HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Hazardous materials consist of any substance which has the potential to cause injury to people.
These can include flammable liquids and gases, poisons, corrosives, explosives, radioactive
materials, and medical supplies and wastes. The transport, storage and disposal of hazardous
material, and the cleanup (remediation) of hazardous sites are regulated by a number of
federal, state, and local agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA), and the California Department of Toxic
Substances Control.
Several industrial operations are located within the Colusa area , mainly around the Colusa
County Airport, that use, transport, or store hazardous materials. A small number of operations
are located closer to the City, including a petroleum products storage facility at Lurline Avenue
General Plan                                                                            City of Colusa

and Fourteenth Street. While these operations are small in scale compared to those in larger
urban areas, they use and store materials considered hazardous. In addition, commercial
activities, such as gasoline stations and vehicle
repair shops, use and/or store potentially
hazardous substances.
Within the City there are no known sites
contaminated by hazardous substances on
which a cleanup action has not been taken.
The State tracks potential contamination sites
and remediation status through databases such
as the Leaking Underground Storage Tank
database (LUST), Cal Sites, and the Hazardous
Substance and Waste Site list (“Cortese List”). A
recent check of these databases identified 17
hazardous material sites in Colusa and vicinity,
all of which involve leaking underground
storage tanks. However, most of the sites have
undergone successful remediation and are no
longer considered contaminated. Two sites are
undergoing remediation or post-remediation monitoring, and will likely be considered “clean” in
the near future. One site, the Colusa County Airport, has not undertaken active remediation
efforts. However, recent monitoring well test data has indicated that contamination levels have
dissipated to a level that is considered to be safe by the State of Callfornia. As a result, it is
anticipated that in the near-term, onsite monitoring wells will be removed, and active monitoring
will be completed.
The greatest danger of hazardous substance exposure for residents of the City of Colusa is from
potential spills from vehicles transporting hazardous substances along SR 20 and SR 20/45, either
by accidents or by leakages. This type of event would be the most likely cause for an
emergency evacuation of the City due to hazardous substances.
HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS
The most common hazardous materials are those found or used in the home. Waste oil is a
common hazardous material that is often improperly disposed of and can contaminate surface
water through runoff. Other household hazardous wastes (paint, pesticides, cleaning products,
and other chemicals) are common and often improperly stored in garages and homes.
Because of their widespread use in households throughout the community, these products
constitute the most common health hazard associated with hazardous materials to Colusa
residents.
ASBESTOS
Asbestos is a strong and incombustible fiber widely used in the past for insulation. Asbestos is
often found in the walls and ceilings of older buildings. Asbestos was commonly used in the past
as an insulating material because it had the desirable characteristic of being fire-resistant.
However, it can pose a health risk when very small particles become airborne. These dust-like
particles can easily be inhaled or swallowed, where their microscopically sharp structures can
puncture tiny air sacs in the lungs, resulting in long-term health problems.

5.0 SAFETY
LEAD-BASED PAINT
Paint used in many houses and apartments built before 1978 may contain lead. The lead from
paint, paint chips, and dust can pose serious health hazards if not handled properly. People can
breathe or ingest lead through exposure to objects covered with lead dust, contaminated
garden soil, or paint chips. Peeling, chipping, chalking, or cracking lead-based paint is a hazard
that needs immediate attention. Since babies and young children often put objects in their
mouths, and since children’s brains and nervous systems are more sensitive to the damaging
effects of lead, the hazard is greater for children than for adults.
Exposure to lead dust often occurs through improper removal and disposal of lead-based paint
in the home. Lead dust can form when lead-based paint is dry-scraped, dry-sanded, or heated.
Lead in soil can be a hazard when children play in bare soil or when soil is transported into the
house on people’s shoes.
The City’s Building Inspector is available to advise the public about proper abatement and
disposal procedures during the demolition or renovation of old buildings. The Building Inspector
and the Fire Inspector provide education to the public concerning lead-based paint hazards.
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS
More than 60,000 chemicals are produced in the United States. Over 11,000 of these chemicals
are used for commercial purposes. In the City of Colusa and vicinity, various industrial,
commercial, and service industries use or store hazardous materials, including pesticides, acids,
solvents, caustics, plastics, and heavy metals.
Chapter 6.95, §25503 of the California Health and Safety Code, specifies the thresholds that
trigger the requirement of businesses to report the quantity and locations of hazardous materials
to the regulatory authority on an annual basis. In Colusa, businesses are required to submit their
Hazardous Material Business Plans (HMBPs) to the Colusa County Department of Environmental
Health. A plan must be submitted for each site that stores above the threshold quantities of a
hazardous material or any amount of hazardous waste. The HMBP includes an inventory of
hazardous materials stored at a facility with specific physical and chemical descriptions of each
material.
The HMBP is required to be reviewed annually and updated if there are any material changes
that affect the quantity or location of hazardous materials. The HMBP also includes a
Consolidated Contingency Plan or Emergency Response Plan, which describes the emergency
response procedures to be taken in case of a hazardous material spill or fire. The Emergency
Response Plan provides facility identification information, emergency contacts, and response
procedures to be taken in the event of a hazardous material emergency. Emergency
equipment capabilities, emergency services, and employee training also are outlined in the
Plan.
TRUCK TRANSPORT OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Trucks traveling through Colusa commonly carry a variety of hazardous materials, including
gasoline and various crude oil derivatives and other chemicals known to cause human health
problems. When properly contained, these materials present no hazard to the community. In the
event of an accident or spill, these materials may be released, either in liquid or gas form. In the
case of some chemicals, such as chlorine, highly toxic fumes may be carried through the air a
significant distance from the site of their release. Although standard accident and hazardous

materials recovery procedures are enforced by the state and adhered to by private
transportation companies, the City is at moderate risk because of the volume of truck traffic on
SR 20 and SR 20/45.
The Colusa County Sheriff’s Office, along with City of Colusa Fire Department, is the primary
responder to any such incidents, based on the City’s Hazardous Materials Management Plan.
The Plan identifies the specific locations of flammable or toxic materials are used and stored,
allowing appropriate response to a hazardous material emergency.
5.5.2 OUTLOOK—HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Many of the potential risks associated with hazardous materials can be reduced through the
City’s provision and distribution of educational materials about and adoption of staff
recommendations for projects using, storing, or transporting such materials. Education about the
handling and disposal of household products, asbestos, and lead-based paints will be an
ongoing effort to ensure the safety of Colusa residents. One component of this educational
outreach might include information about alternatives to potentially hazardous household
products. Many household products that contain non-toxic ingredients are becoming available
on the market, and some common household ingredients can be used to make cleaners and
other products that are less hazardous to human health and the environment. Information on
such “green” alternatives is available on several Internet sites, a list of which the City could be
included in the public outreach materials.
Local, state, and federal regulations will largely be relied upon for ensuring that reporting
requirements are met and business plans are prepared by those business operations that involve
the transport, handling, and storage of hazardous materials. The City will help to ensure
compliance with these regulations to the greatest extent possible in the course of its normal
permit and inspection processes.
As previously noted, pesticide contamination would be a significant issue mainly with vacant
land on the edge of the City that is planned for development or with agricultural land that is
annexed to the City. In such areas, it would be prudent to conduct soils testing and cleanup, if
necessary, before allowing intensive development to occur.
Many old structures in Colusa, particularly those constructed before 1979, could potentially
contain asbestos. It should be assumed that the demolition of older structures in the City might
present this hazard. Proper asbestos abatement and disposal procedures shall be undertaken
during the demolition of old buildings.
5.5.3 GOALS, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS FOR HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

        Materials Business Plan required under the State Code, for businesses that store
        hazardous wastes in excess of standards set in the statute. These statutes will apply to
        hazardous chemical storage at all City-owned and operated facilities.
        Implementing Action SAF-4.1.b: Development Review
        The City will refer any development proposal that may be affected by, or affect, the
        storage, handling, disposal, or transportation of hazardous materials to the Fire
        Department, the Colusa County Sheriff’s Office, and other appropriate agencies for
        review. When required, a Hazardous Material Business Plan will be prepared and
        submitted in accordance with County procedures. The Business Plan will contain all
        provisions required by Assembly Bill 2185, Department of Transportation (DOT), and Cal-
        OSHA regulations for environmental controls of hazardous materials, and other provisions
        that may be required by the County.

        hazards to human health and the environment.
5.6.1 SETTING—AIRPORT HAZARDS
The Colusa County Airport is the only airport within the Planning Area and the only public airport
in Colusa County. It is located approximately one-half mile southeast of the City of Colusa on
approximately 81 acres of land. The airport is located within the jurisdiction of and is managed
by the County of Colusa. The airport was established in 1961 and received a permit from the
State’s Division of Aeronautics the same year.
General Plan                                                                            City of Colusa

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) classifies Colusa County Airport as a Basic Utility Stage
II airport. This is an airport that can serve approximately 75 percent of the single-engine
airplanes used for personal and business purposes, as well as high-performance single-engine
aircraft and light twin-engine aircraft typically used for business and air-taxi purposes. The airport
has one paved runway 3,000 feet long, 60 feet wide, and laid out in a northwest-southeast
orientation parallel with the adjacent SR 20. The approved traffic pattern for the runway keeps
all arriving and departing aircraft to the east of the airport, where primarily agricultural land
exists. A lighted windsock and a standard rotating beacon mark the airport. There are 22
airport-owned T-hangars, five privately-owned hangars, 42 open tie-downs, one large hangar,
two agricultural operation hangars, and a caretaker’s residence. Services available at the
airport include transit and taxi service, fuel sales, and crop dusting service.
The airport is located adjacent to and west of SR 20. It is surrounded on the south, west, and
north by commercial and industrial facilities, business and personal services, and public services.
As previously noted, the east side of the airport is agricultural land, currently pasture and
orchard. Residences, businesses, and other activities located adjacent to or near the Colusa
County Airport could be exposed to hazards arising from airport operations. Land use activities
located within the flight path of aircraft could be exposed to potential accidents involving
aircraft. Nearby buildings could be exposed to accidents or interfere with airport operations well
as.
COMPREHENSIVE LAND USE PLAN
The Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission adopted the Colusa County Airport
Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) on June 5, 1995. The CLUP provides the land use
compatibility guidelines on which compatibility of land uses with airport operations are
determined. It also establishes the planning boundaries around the airport. These boundaries
are established for height, noise, and safety. Following adoption by the Airport Land Use
Commission, a CLUP is transmitted to all jurisdictions affected by the plan. Under California
Government Code §65302.3, local jurisdictions must take action within 180 days to assure that its
land use regulations are consistent with CLUP provisions. In addition to the provisions of the
adopted CLUP and the provisions of Government Code §65302.3, §11010.13(b) and §1102.6a of
the California Civil Code establish additional notification requirements for land use applications
occurring within an “Airport Influence Area”. An Airport Influence Area is defined as a radius
area approximately two statute miles beyond an active airport, inside of which a formal “Notice
of Airport in the Vicinity” is required.
Concerns of airport land use planning, as defined and described in the adopted CLUP, fall into
three categories: height restrictions, noise compatibility, and safety of persons on the ground.
The CLUP evaluates all three categories. Since the Noise Element discusses airport noise issues,
this Safety Element will focus on the first and third categories.
STRUCTURE HEIGHT
Height restrictions are necessary to ensure that objects will not impair flight safety or decrease
the operational capacity of the airport. Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 77 defines a
series of imaginary surfaces surrounding airports. Any object or structure that would penetrate
any of these imaginary surfaces is considered by the FAA to be an obstruction to air navigation.
Applicants for projects that penetrate certain imaginary surfaces are required to notify the FAA
of their intent. The FAA then initiates an aeronautical study to analyze if the project would be a
hazard to air navigation. While the FAA can determine that a project would constitute a hazard
to air navigation, it cannot prohibit construction. However, California law does prohibit the
construction of any structure that would constitute an air navigation hazard as defined in FAR

5.0 SAFETY
Part 77, unless a permit is issued by the California Department of Transportation, Division of
Aeronautics.
The CLUP for Colusa County Airport has adopted the imaginary surfaces defined in FAR Part 77.
In general, to determine if a project would constitute a hazard to air navigation, notice is
required to be given to the FAA if construction or alteration penetrates these imaginary surfaces
or is more than 200 feet in height above the ground level at the project site. Most of the
structures within the Colusa city limits that are in the vicinity of the airport are single-family
residences or multifamily complexes no higher than two stories. These structures do not
penetrate the imaginary surfaces defined in FAR Part 77 and, therefore, present no hazard to air
navigation or are exposed to air hazards due to height.
SAFETY ZONES
Areas around airports are exposed to the possibility of aircraft accidents, even with well-
maintained aircraft and highly trained pilots. Airport safety areas are established to minimize the
number of people exposed to aircraft crash hazards. This is accomplished by placing restrictions
on land uses in various designated safety areas.
The CLUP for the Colusa County Airport designates three safety areas: the clear zone, the
approach/departure zone, and the over flight zone. The clear zone is near the end of the
runway and is the most restrictive of the safety areas. The approach/departure zone is located
under the takeoff and landing slopes and is less restrictive. The over flight zone is the area under
the air traffic pattern and is the least restrictive of the safety areas. Figure 5.2 shows the safety
areas established around Colusa County Airport. As designated by the Colusa County Airport
Land Use Commission, the safety areas are as follows (numbering corresponds to number labels
in Figure 5.2):
1) Clear zone – beginning 200 feet beyond the end of the paved runway surface and
     centered along the extended runway. It has an inner width of 250 feet, extends outward for
     a length of 1,000 feet, and has an outer width of 450 feet.
2) Approach/departure zone - beginning at the outer end of the clear zone and centered
     along the extended runway. It has an inner width of 450 feet, extends outward for a length
     of 2,000 feet, and has an outer width of 850 feet.
3) Overflight zone – generally coincides with the area overflown by aircraft during normal traffic
     pattern procedures but outside of the clear and the approach/departure zones.
According to the land use compatibility guidelines in the CLUP, virtually all land uses are
incompatible in the clear zone, except for roadways, open space and natural areas, pastures,
and agricultural row crops. None of the land currently within the Colusa City limits is located
within the clear zone. However, the Planning Area does contain a portion of land designated
for Parks/Recreation within the clear zone (see Land Use Diagram Figure 2.3).
The approach/departure zone allows for some commercial and industrial uses, but it prohibits all
residential uses. Most of the approach/departure zone that is within the Planning Area covers
land designated as Parks/Recreation. According to the CLUP, recreational uses within the
approach/departure zone are limited to open space and natural areas, golf courses, and riding
stables.

5.0 SAFETY
The overflight zone appears to cover part of the Planning Area in the southeast. According to
the Land Use Diagram, most of the land within the overflight zone that is within the Planning Area
is designated Low Density Residential, which allows primarily for single-family residences. The
CLUP indicates that single-family detached residences are a compatible land use in the
overflight zone, provided that the density is five acres or more per single-family residence.
5.6.2 OUTLOOK - AIRPORT HAZARDS
Colusa County has proposed a number of new facilities and airport improvements. The ultimate
construction of these facilities will depend on securing adequate funding. Facilities and
improvements proposed include construction of new hangars, acquisition of additional property,
improvement of the airport’s drainage system, and slurry seal of the existing runway, taxiway,
apron, and tie-downs. A proposed extension of the runway is planned but has been postponed
at this time. The future number of fixed-base aircraft and operations is projected to increase due
to various factors, including the reform of product liability laws, the proposed upgrades to airport
facilities, and the continued viability and vitality of the agricultural industry in Colusa County.
 5.6.3 GOALS, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS FOR AIRPORT HAZARDS
Goal SAF-5
To ensure public safety during airport operations.
Policy SAF-5.1:
The City shall require development projects within the overflight zone of the Colusa County
Airport to consider all applicable safety policies, City standards, and land use compatibility
guidelines.
          Implementing Action SAF-5.1.a: Development Review
          The City will refer all development projects within the overflight zone of the Colusa
          County Airport to the Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission for its review and
          comment. As part of the development review process for projects within the overflight
          zone of the Airport, the City will apply airport/land use safety compatibility criteria to site
          design review to ensure compatibility between airport operations and proposed land
          uses.
          Implementing Action SAF-5.1.b: Interagency Coordination
          The City will work with the Colusa County Airport Land Use Commission to assist with the
          updating of the airport’s Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP).
          Implementing Action SAF-5.1.c: Public Disclosure
          The City will inform applicants whose projects fall within the Airport Influence Area that
          disclosure statements regarding the presence of an active airport are required. See
          Business & Professions Code §11010 and Civil Code §1102.6(d) for language regarding
          disclosure by realtors and the two-mile “bubble”.

5.7.1 SETTING—OTHER EMERGENCY SERVICES
This section discusses emergency services other than fire protection. These include police
protection, emergency medical services, and health services. Section 5.4, Fire Hazards,
describes existing fire protection services in the City of Colusa and includes goals, policies, and
implementing actions related to those services. In addition, the Municipal Facilities and Service
Element describe fire and police facilities.
POLICE PROTECTION
The City of Colusa Police Department provides police protection services within the City of
Colusa. The main station is located at 260 6th Street. The Police Department has nine sworn full-
time officers, including the Chief of Police, one lieutenant, two sergeants, and five officers. There
is one personnel position consisting of a non-sworn secretary.              Additionally, the Police
Department has been authorized a tenth position which will become its first full-time detective
position. The Police Department uses seven vehicles for its services.
Patrol shifts for the Police Department consist of one officer during the 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. shift,
one officer during the 5:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. shift, and one officer during the 9:00 p.m. to 7:00
a.m. shift. A fourth supplemental shift serves at the department’s discretion for days or nights,
depending on immediate needs. The most prevalent crime problems in Colusa are property
thefts, assaults, vandalism, and traffic incidents. There is a very low level of serious crime. While
the incidence of serious crime is low, the number of calls for service to the Police Department
has risen from 3,229 in 1999 to 5,638 in 2005 (Colusa PD, 2006).
The Colusa County Sheriff’s Department provides police services to the unincorporated portion
of the Planning Area. Since the Sheriff’s Department headquarters are located in Colusa,
response time to calls in the unincorporated area surrounding Colusa is relatively short. The
Sheriff’s Department provides contracted dispatch services to the Colusa Police Department.
HOSPITAL AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES
The Colusa Fire Department, through an agreement with Colusa County Emergency Medical
Services (EMS), assumes the first response to all medical emergency calls in the City. Shift
personnel on the initial response apparatus are certified as Emergency Medical Technicians
(EMTs). The Fire Department currently has twelve first responder EMTs on staff, along with nine
EMS personnel (cross-trained). In 2003, 199 calls were received for emergency medical service.
Enloe Hospital, based in Chico, provides ambulance service.
Colusa’s role in health services issues is somewhat limited. The City is not directly involved with
the establishment or management of any health care facilities. Nevertheless, Colusa is a
growing community with an ever-increasing need for health services that is recognized by the
City in its planning efforts.
The Colusa Regional Medical Center (CRMC), located at 1999 East Webster Street, is a private,
non-profit community facility which is governed by a local volunteer board of directors. The
Medical Center is a 48-bed acute care facility providing a 24-hour emergency room, an
intensive care unit, a medical/surgical unit, skilled nursing facility, laboratory, pharmacy, home
health services, rehabilitation services, diagnostic imaging, and other medical services. A
medical office building adjacent to the hospital houses six physicians. Trauma level care is
provided via airlift to either UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento or Enloe Medical Center in
Chico. CRMC is currently evaluating the level of emergency care that will be required under
City of Colusa                                                                             General Plan
October 2007                                                                                      Final

new legislation enacted in 2006. CRMC also supports three Rural Health Clinics located in
Colusa, Stonyford, and Williams and is studying the need for additional clinics in order to
accommodate growth in population throughout the County.
The hospital facility is dated and is undergoing ongoing facility and equipment upgrades. The
County meets the criteria as a Health Professional Shortage Area, and CRMC is developing a
recruitment plan to attract more physicians to the community in order to meet the access
standards of the minimum of one primary care physician for every 3,500 residents. CRMC is also
recruiting specialty care physicians in order to provide the full spectrum of medical care to local
residents. (Kirby, February 6, 2007)
5.7.2 OUTLOOK—OTHER EMERGENCY SERVICES
POLICE PROTECTION
The existing Colusa General Plan recommends a standard of two sworn police officers per 1,000
population. At the current population, Colusa is approximately two sworn officers short of
meeting this standard. Moreover, based on the range of population projections in the Land Use
Element, Colusa would require from four (4) to 11 additional sworn officers by the year 2020. A
Municipal Service Review of City of Colusa services characterizes current law enforcement
services in Colusa as adequate. However, as the City’s population grows, maintaining this
adequacy may become an issue.
HOSPITAL AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES
Colusa County’s population is growing at a rate where demand for medical services exceeds
what CRMC is able to provide. In addition to new and upgraded facilities, there are
requirements for emergency preparedness (e.g., bioterrorism, toxic exposure and treatment,
etc.) that must be met. However, as the demand continues to increase for medical services,
CRMC will continue to be faced with shortages in facility space and staffing. It is anticipated
that the size of the emergency department will need to be increased in proportion to increases
in population and emergency service calls. (Kirby, February 6, 2007)
Consequently, the City and County will need to work cooperatively with the Medical Center to
facilitate improved medical care for all residents of Colusa and the surrounding area. Siting and
construction of medical facilities can be accomplished through the assistance of City or County
staff (depending on jurisdiction) with their respective development review processes, and local
government assistance with applications for state and federal funding, if required.

5.8.1 SETTING—EMERGENCY PLANS AND EVACUATION ROUTES
COMPREHENSIVE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN
The City’s Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan provides direction for responding to
disastrous occurrences in Colusa. This Plan facilitates accomplishing the underlying goal of the
Safety Element, which is to protect the life, property, and environment of community residents,
businesses, employees, and visitors. It also serves as a key component in implementing the City’s
policies that address emergency response.
General Plan                                                                            City of Colusa

The plan defines the primary and support roles of City agencies and departments in after-
incident damage assessment and reporting requirements. In addition, the plan provides for the
operation of police, fire, and health services, as well as transportation alternatives in the event of
a multi-hazard emergency. City evacuation procedures are described and are submitted to the
State Office of Emergency Services (OES) for approval.
EVACUATION ROUTES
Likely reasons for a potential emergency evacuation of the City of Colusa include a hazardous
materials spill from vehicles transporting these materials along SR 20 and SR 20/45 or flooding
resulting from levee overtopping or failure. Potential evacuation routes include SR 20 (east and
west), SR 20/45 (north), Lurline Avenue (west), Wescott Road (south), and Bridge Street (north).
Due to the relatively low number of vehicles currently required to completely evacuate the City
and the City’s grid street system, an organized evacuation using all available routes could be
accomplished in a short period of time.
5.8.2 OUTLOOK—EMERGENCY PLANS AND EVACUATION ROUTES
Since the General Plan was last updated, national events have brought greater attention to the
need for comprehensive emergency planning, including planning for evacuations. The terrorist
attacks against New York and Washington on September 11, 2001 showed that natural disasters
are not the only situations that call for emergency planning. These attacks also highlighted the
importance of coordinating responses by government at all levels, of communication among
first responders, and of dealing with unusual threats, such as the use of biological agents.
In spite of the havoc that could be caused by terrorist attacks, natural disasters remain the most
likely types of events to occur in Colusa that would prompt emergency action. As mentioned
above, flooding would be a possible disaster facing Colusa. Floods in Yuba County in 1986 and
1997 show that levees do not guarantee complete protection from this type of disaster. The City
should always be aware of potential emergency situations and plan accordingly.
Disasters often highlight aspects of emergency planning that are overlooked. For instance,
Hurricane Katrina in 2005 clearly demonstrated the problems associated with evacuating
residents from a large city, particularly those residents who had no personal transportation.
Katrina also illustrated the serious impacts that a disaster may have on areas not directly hit by
the event, as states outside the hurricane zone began receiving evacuees, sometimes by the
thousands. In emergency planning, the City of Colusa should consider the potential impacts
from likely disasters in nearby areas, such as flooding in Sacramento, Marysville/Yuba City, or an
earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area.

6.1      INTRODUCTION
State law requires that General Plans address the conservation, development, and utilization of
open space and natural resources. This Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element
meets this requirement by addressing open space and resource conservation. The State
encourages, but does not require, the General Plan to include a parks and/or recreation
element. Because recreation is important to Colusa residents, and issues related to City parks
and recreation are integrally related to the City’s open space and natural resources, this
element combines parks and recreation issues with resource conservation.
Open space not only functions to preserve habitat and natural resources but also allows visual
and physical access to those resources and their associated recreational opportunities. Human
beings are drawn to open space as a respite from the urban landscape of roadways and
buildings. Both developed parklands and undeveloped natural features establish areas around
which neighborhoods and cities are often centered or oriented. Open space also may define
the edges of a community’s urban development and the beginning of agricultural production
or resource management.
Parks, recreation, and resource conservation policies serve as an important tool that can help
ensure that Colusa’s quality of life continues to improve as new development occurs.
Maintaining and expanding existing parklands and facilities, as well as acquiring new ones, is
essential for improving the City’s recreational programs and parks. Support exists in the City for
the development of new parks, possibly including a community park. The challenge for the City
regarding park development is the allocation of limited revenue. The General Plan will address
park development issues and present policies that require new development to integrate
parkland as part of new projects.
The resource conservation issues discussed in this element include historic and cultural resources,
air quality, biological resources, soils, agricultural lands, water quality and conservation, solid
waste reduction, energy, and visual resources.
6.2.1 SETTING—OPEN SPACE
Colusa boasts an abundance of “green areas” through a combination of City parks and
regional open space for its residents. The adjacent Colusa-Sacramento River State Recreation
Area and nearby Colusa National Wildlife Refuge provide a riverfront and open space lands for
both active and passive recreational uses. An array of recreational opportunities are also
offered residents by City-owned and maintained neighborhood parks.
Open space in the Colusa area provides opportunities for resource conservation. While the
urbanized areas do not contain significant wildlife resources or habitat, the City is located in
close proximity to sizable waterfowl and raptor nesting areas. The Sacramento River is part of a
major migratory route for birds on the Pacific Flyway and provides habitat to a number of
species. These resource areas in and around Colusa are open to the public for hiking, biking,
picnicking, bird watching, fishing, and boating.
One of the City’s greatest assets is the abundance of open space in the form of parks, school
grounds, fairgrounds, and a nearby golf course in the unincorporated County, which are
discussed under Parks and Recreation section later in this element. Open space areas have a
variety of uses, from passive recreation to the more active participation of organized sporting
events, greatly adding to the quality of urban life.
City of Colusa                                                                         General Plan

6.2.2 OUTLOOK—OPEN SPACE
As vacant lands surrounding the City are proposed for development, opportunities will arise to
incorporate new parks into these areas. The City will also have the opportunity to work with
developers to set aside open space lands to ensure the health of the environment.
Opportunities for increased access and enjoyment of the City’s riverfront are a high priority for
the City, since present access to the River within the City is limited and discontinuous. This priority
is evidenced by the City’s intention to promote redevelopment in a “Riverfront District” as
discussed in the Land Use Element. The riverfront is a focal point for the development of a
pedestrian/bike path that would encircle the City. (See the discussion and policies set forth on
the development of bike paths in the Circulation Element.) Site layout and design will play a
critical role in the enhancement of and access to the riverfront. Proper development and
redevelopment of riverfront parcels can provide enjoyable views of the River, while preserving its
shores from development.
6.2.3 GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS FOR OPEN SPACE
Goal PRC-1:
To preserve, protect, and enhance an interconnected system of significant open space
areas, including lands with sensitive local resources, to the maximum extent feasible.
Policy PRC – 1.1:
The City shall ensure that the development process respects the unique characteristics and
functions of sensitive local resources. The preferred treatment is: first – avoidance, second –
onsite restoration, third – in-kind replacement, and fourth – impact fees. Sensitive local resources
include wetlands, riparian corridors, floodplains, and woodlands.
         Implementing Action PRC-1.1.a: Development Review
         Through the development review process, the City will use the California Environmental
         Quality Act (CEQA) process to evaluate the impacts of proposed new development on
         natural resources. The CEQA process specifies that the City will refer any development
         proposal with a potential for direct or indirect impacts on open space and sensitive local
         resources to the City Planner, City Engineer, and other local agencies, as applicable, for
         review and comment.
         Implementing Action PRC-1.1.b: Development Agreements
         The City will require identified open space areas within new residential developments to
         be maintained by the project developers through development agreements; codes,
         covenants, and restrictions; or other means. The City will also ensure that new
         development is designed and constructed to integrate and preserve natural areas and
         features as open space to the maximum extent feasible. The City will collaborate with
         relevant county, state, and federal agencies on open space maintenance, preservation,
         and management issues.
General Plan                                                                            City of Colusa

Policy PRC – 1.2:
The City shall require that new development be designed and constructed to preserve the
following types of areas and features as open space to the maximum extent feasible:
     •   High erosion hazard areas
     •   Scenic corridors
     •   Wetlands and riparian vegetation
     •   Drainage corridors
     •   Colusa-Sacramento River State Recreation Area
     •   Other areas of federal, state or local significance
         Implementing Action PRC-1.2.a: Development Review (see Implementing Action PRC-
         1.1.a above).
         Implementing Action PRC-1.2.b: Fees, Dedications, and Easements
         Parcel lines (in the case of a subdivision) or easements (in the case of a subdivision or
         other development) will be located to optimize resource protection. If a sensitive local
         resource or significant corridor is proposed for inclusion in an open space parcel or
         easement, allowed uses and maintenance responsibilities within that parcel will be
         clearly defined and conditioned prior to map or project approval. Fees and dedications
         will also be used to ensure adequate preservation of sensitive local resources.
Policy PRC – 1.3:
As development and redevelopment occur, the City shall pursue, where feasible, public access
to the Sacramento River from the nearest appropriate public street and/or walkway. Access
shall be designed to minimize disturbance to residents and sensitive habitat areas.
         Implementing Action PRC-1.3.a: Development Review (see Implementing Action PRC-
         1.1.a above).
         Implementing Action PRC-1.3.b: Fees, Dedications and Easements
         The City will use land dedications or public access easements to ensure that pedestrian
         access can be provided and maintained to public use areas.
6.3.1 SETTING—PARKS AND RECREATION
CITY PARKS AND RECREATION FACILITIES
The City of Colusa maintains approximately 15.5 acres of parks and open space that are
administered by the City’s Public Works Department, Recreation Division. This represents a ratio
of approximately 2.9 acres of combined park land and open space per 1,000 residents. State
standards recommend that at least three to five acres per 1,000 residents be devoted to

placeholder page – delete form PDFCity recreation facilities, most
of which are more than 20 years old, operate at or above
capacity much of the time. The community pool located at Will S.
Green Park is heavily utilized. On many summer days, attendance
exceeds the pool’s capacity. The 55-year old facility is in need of
complete renovation. Improvements are required to comply with
the American Disabilities Act (ADA), and expansion is needed to
accommodate the growing population. Additional ballfields are
needed to meet both current and projected demand. The City’s
little league field and two softball fields are inadequate to serve
the number of organized teams in the City. Practice fields exist at the City schools and are
heavily used.
Upgrades to existing City parks are needed. The two outdoor picnic and barbeque areas are
used extensively. Needed improvements include installation of bathrooms at Veterans Memorial
Park and Will S. Green Park. The former is also in need of playground equipment. Improvements
needed for Sankey Park, C.D. Semple Park, Levee Park, and Leland Taylor Park include restroom
facilities, basketball courts, picnic tables, and playground equipment, respectively.
The Old Boy Scout Cabin, located at 9th and Webster, is known as the “Senior Center” and is
operated by the County. In the past, a daily lunch program was held at this location; however,
that program is no longer operating for financial reasons. Currently, there is no facility in the City
dedicated to providing activities and services to seniors. Aside from school facilities, Colusa has
no multi-purpose indoor recreation facilities for activities such as volleyball, basketball, yoga,
aerobics, martial arts, or dance programs.
Recreation Programs
The Recreation Division of the City’s Public Works Department is also responsible for organizing
recreational activities that are offered year-round to City and County residents. Activities
include classes, trips, and special events, such as concerts in the park. The Recreation Division
administers adult sports, after school/camp activities, aquatics, youth sports, and senior citizen
programs. Adult sports include softball; children’s activities include t-ball, basketball, and other
team sports.
The Colusa Adult Canteen, which operates under the direction of the Recreation Division, is held
at the Fellowship Hall of the Trinity Methodist Church on Fifth Street. This activity allows senior
citizens the opportunity to meet and socialize with a pot-luck luncheon two times per month. The
Department also operates the community swimming pool in the summer and organizes aquatics
for all age groups.
Colusa Golf Club
Colusa Golf Club is located on the west side of State Route 20/45 and east of Country Club
Estates outside the City limits. This nine-hole course is privately-owned but is open to the public.
It is the only golf course within the Colusa Planning Area.
Colusa-Sacramento River State Recreation Area
The Colusa-Sacramento River State Recreation Area (SRA) is a 67-acre park located on the west
side of the Sacramento River near downtown Colusa. The River Patwin Indian tribe once lived
near the area, and in 1872, John Muir camped near what is now the park. The SRA once was

used as a dump, but was filled, graded, and improved in 1964. The area was opened as a park
that is now popular with campers, boaters, fishermen, and hikers.
Riverbank cottonwoods and willows shelter one of the finest fishing stretches in California, with
king salmon, steelhead, rainbow trout, and striped bass found there. The river is on a major
migratory route for birds of the Pacific Flyway and provides home to wide range of bird species.
The SRA also has boat launching facilities. However, due to siltation, the boat launch can
become unusable for most of the year. As a result, the City is exploring alternative sites for a
boat launch facility.
Colusa County Fairgrounds
The Colusa County Fairgrounds is located on 20 acres on 10th Street, north of Colusa High School.
The facility, owned by the State of California and managed by the 44th District Agricultural
Association, is home to annual events such as the Colusa County Fair, Colusa Farm Show,
Western Days, and Holiday Craft Fair. Fairground facilities include several exhibition halls ranging
in size from 3,500 to 10,500 square feet, a multi-use outdoor pavilion, a lighted grandstand with
seating for 1,400 visitor, barns, 26 horse stalls, and 35 RV parking spaces . The Association offers
rental of fairgrounds buildings and services
6.3.2 OUTLOOK—PARKS AND RECREATION
As the City of Colusa anticipates significant
residential growth with this General Plan update,
one of the challenges will be to maintain a healthy
community, in part, through the provision of
adequate parks and recreational facilities.
At potential buildout of the Planning Area, as
described in Chapter 2, Land Use, the population
of Colusa would stand at approximately 25,811
residents. The City will be assessing the park land
and recreation facilities needs anticipated with this
growth through the development of a Parks and
Recreation Master Plan—one of the first actions to
be undertaken upon adoption of this General
Plan.
As the population increases, continual assessment will be required to determine whether the
quantity and types of park land are meeting the changing needs of City residents. The City will
plan and evaluate its parks and recreation facilities by applying the Parks and Recreation
Master Plan’s parks definitions, standards, and siting criteria, as well as the guiding policies of this
General Plan.
PARK LAND CLASSIFICATIONS
As is the case with many small cities, Colusa’s parks come in a range of sizes and types. Park
land classifications have been created to assist in identifying the types of parks that a
community may need. Park types are typically chosen according to the user group, service
area, and/or type of facilities that are needed.
General Plan                                                                             City of Colusa

                                          6.0 PARKS, RECREATION AND RESOURCE CONSERVATION
The following park land classifications, adapted from industry standards, identify the types of
parks that could likely fill current parkland deficiencies and meet future demand for parks in
Colusa. These classifications serve as guidelines only, and are not intended as City standards.
Park standards (e.g., function, size, service area, site characteristics, etc.) will be adopted in a
Parks Master Plan, which is to be prepared as an implementing action of this element.
     •   Mini-parks: Typically range from 2,500 square feet to two (2) acres and service a “sub-
         neighborhood” area (within ¼-mile or a short walking distance). A mini-park is generally
         defined as a small, landscaped area that serves a concentrated or limited population,
         such as tots or senior citizens. This type of park would be located in close proximity to
         apartment complexes, medium-to-high density residential neighborhoods, and senior
         housing developments.
     •   Neighborhood parks: Generally five- (5) to 10-acre parks that provide scenic, aesthetic,
         and recreational value. Typical improvements found at neighborhood parks include
         athletic fields, multi-use turf areas, hard courts, and playground equipment. Some may
         provide more passive facilities such as picnicking, turf areas, and some natural areas.
         Neighborhood parks service an entire neighborhood (within a 1-mile radius) and may be
         developed as a joint-use school/park facility.
     •   Community parks: Publicly-owned land sites, usually in the range of 20 to 50 acres, with
         full public access intended to provide recreation opportunities beyond those supplied by
         neighborhood parks.         Most regulation fields and active facilities are located in
         community parks. Such facilities as youth baseball, soccer, and softball fields are sited in
         “complexes” of four or more to allow for the most efficient use and for support facilities
         such as restrooms and concession stands. Community buildings, indoor recreation
         facilities, tennis courts, and swimming pools are also typically located in community
         parks. Such parks may contain picnic grounds and pathways, natural areas, and passive
         landscaped areas, and they require ample car and bicycle parking facilities.
         Community parks are expected to draw from the entire community and may include
         inter-community recreation and sports league activities.
PARKS AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES
The City has already identified the need for a new community park to meet demand for future
recreational needs as new growth occurs. The community park has been envisioned as a site
for soccer, little league, and softball fields and for Pop Warner football. This park would also
provide areas for community gatherings and picnics,
In addition, a community center will be needed that can provide multi-use indoor facilities for
the various programs that serve the City. This facility could provide a home for existing programs
that lack a regular location, including classes for mature drivers, CPR, first aid, Community
College Extension courses, and other community group meetings. The community center facility
could be part of a larger Civic Center, which would house City Hall and potentially include a
dedicated senior center.
One potential location for a new civic center (to include City Hall) is in the area encompassing
Will S. Green Park, the Community Pool, and the old high school site on 10th Street. Potential
locations for new outdoor recreational parks facilities sites have been identified in new growth
areas east of downtown Colusa between Bridge Street and the Sacramento River and south of
the High School. A potential site for a community park has been identified in the new growth
area west of Highway 20 across from the Colusa County Fairgrounds.

Neighborhood parks and mini-parks are also a necessary component of the City’s overall parks
system. It is anticipated that the location, design, and function of these parks will be determined
as new developments are proposed.
6.3.3 GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS FOR PARKS AND RECREATION
Goal PRC – 2:
To ensure a geographically-distributed and well-maintained system of park and
recreational facilities.
Policy PRC – 2.1
The City shall ensure ongoing maintenance and corrections in deficiencies of existing
community parks and facilities.
        Implementing Action PRC-2.1.a: Capital Improvement Program
        The City will identify sufficient annual funds through a Capital Improvement Program
        (CIP) to ensure ongoing maintenance of and improvements to existing parks and
        recreational facilities.
Policy PRC – 2.2:
The City shall provide sufficient parkland and recreational facilities to meet the needs of all
residents while new development continues to occur.
        Implementing Action PRC-2.2.a: Parks and Recreation Master Plan
        The City will adopt and implement a Parks and Recreation Master Plan prior to or
        concurrent with project approvals associated with large development projects. With this
        plan, park sites will be identified, and the City will work with developers to identify desired
        neighborhood park sites well in advance of subdivision development. Components of
        the Parks and Recreation Master Plan may include:
        •    Parkland and recreational facilities inventory, including number, size and type of
             parks and facilities; area and population served; and current maintenance
             responsibilities and costs.
        •    Identification of parkland and recreational facilities deficiencies and identification of

         •   Development of parks design guidelines and siting standards to ensure efficient and
             safe park facilities. These guidelines and standards would be developed as
             performance standards to allow the City and developers the flexibility for varying
             circumstances – in terms of size, facilities, and service areas –that can ensure existing
             and future needs are met for all residents.
         •   Conceptual plan for a community center, in either new or existing buildings, to

        district, the County, and other agencies to develop, administer, and use parks, open
        space, and recreation facilities and programs. These agreements could facilitate use of
        non-City-owned properties including, but not limited to, schools and the fairgrounds.
6.4.1 SETTING—HISTORIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES
NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY
The City of Colusa is located at the site of the former Native American village of Koru. Koru was
the governing seat for the Korusi Tribe of Southern Wintun. There are several spellings of the
names of tribal groups and villages along the Sacramento River in Colusa County: Koru, Ko-roo,
Coru, Kol-loos, Coluse, Korusi, Ko-ru-si, Colusi, Colouse, and Colusa. The native language

pronunciation of “r” was a quick roll, which was probably interpreted by Euro-Americans as an
“l”—a distortion that created the name “Colusa” (DeJarnatt 1886; Green 1880; Merriam n.d.;
Rogers 1891).
Will S. Green, one of Colusa’s early settlers, recalled in his History of Colusa County (1880) that
there were at least 15 Korusi villages along the Sacramento River when he arrived in 1850. He
estimated the Korusi population along the River to be at least 1,000 and noted that village and
family boundaries were marked by particular sloughs. Green lists the sloughs by name and
states that “Loch-Loch” was located the farthest south at the mouth of Sycamore Slough, “Tu-tu”
was located the farthest to the north about two miles above Princeton, and “Doc-doc” was
located just below the City of Colusa. Most of these villages were well populated and had their
own communal structures and sweat lodges (Green 1851; Rogers 1891).
The Korusi Tribe was included in the 1851 United States treaty negotiations with native
populations (Heizer 1972:52–54). Chief Sioc, the Korusi Chief, signed a treaty with the United
States government, and the remaining people of his tribe were relocated north of Koru. The
Korusi relocated on the property of Colonel George Hagar in a village named “Tat-no.” Colonel
Hagar stated that the Korusi would be welcome as long as he owned his land. Regardless, the
relocation of the Korusi was traumatic, and as a result, Chief Sioc died in 1852 of a “broken
heart” caused by the decline and corruption of his people and their ways. The decline of the
Korusi, as with other groups of Native Americans, was relatively rapid after the establishment of
permanent Euro-American settlements. By 1900, the dwindling population of Korusi occupied
only two villages, “Tat-no” and “Wy-terre,” located nine miles north of Colusa (Green 1880;
Hendrix 1992).
The 1851 treaty signed by Chief Sioc was one of the 18 treaties with California Indians never
ratified by Congress. No formal rancheria was set up for the Korusi until 1907, when the
government bought 40 acres approximately four (4) miles north of Colusa. By that time, there
were only about 60 Native Americans left in Colusa County, and by 1918, the population had
dwindled to only 50 (McComish and Lambert, 1918).
ARRIVAL OF EURO-AMERICANS
Mission registers provide the earliest historic accounts of Wintun populations. They indicate that
Euro-American contact with Wintun groups occurred by at least 1800 (Johnson 1978:351). The
influx of European and Spanish explorers and settlers during the 1830s and 1840s certainly
affected Wintun populations. The discovery of gold at Sutter’s Mill in Coloma in 1848, however,
was the catalyst that caused a dramatic alteration of both Native American and Euro-American
cultural patterns in California. Once news of the discovery of gold spread, a flood of Euro-
Americans entered the region and gravitated to the area of the “Mother Lode”. Initially, the
Euro-American population grew slowly, but it soon exploded as the presence of large deposits of
gold was confirmed in the Sacramento area. The population of California quickly swelled from
an estimated 4,000 Euro-Americans in 1848 to 500,000 in 1850.

Beginning in the late 19th century, Colusa County and the City of Colusa
became agricultural centers for the production of wheat. Wheat was
shipped down the Sacramento River and then shipped to England. In
1876, Colusa County produced 143,000 tons of wheat for export. In 1894,
the wheat ranching bonanza came to an end when Australia, Argentina,
and Canada all became major wheat exporters, and the price of wheat
fell dramatically. In 1911-12, rice was introduced into the valley and
eventually replaced wheat as the major agricultural crop in Colusa
County. Rice required more water than other crops, which fostered the
development of irrigation projects such as the Glenn-Colusa Irrigation
Canal. Consequently, both rice and water have been major factors in
the growth of both Colusa County and the City of Colusa.
RECENT HISTORY
The City was founded in 1850, and numerous historic resources still exist among the many
buildings in the downtown area and along the Sacramento River. In September 2002, the City of
Colusa Heritage Preservation Committee (HPC) published the City of Colusa Historic Resources
Inventory. This document identifies 244 buildings that are either considered locally significant,
eligible for the California Register of Historical Resources (CRHP), or eligible for the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Table 6.2 identifies the existing sites in the City listed on the
NRHP and 15 properties recognized as historically significant by the local government as
identified by HPC.

The City of Colusa commissioned a cultural resources study of the Planning Area. These
investigations included: a records search at the Northwest Information Center (NWIC) at
Sonoma State University, Rohnert Park; a sacred lands search conducted by the Native
American Heritage Commission; consultation with the Native American community; and
archival research. Archaeological and historical investigations identified that the City’s Planning
Area is archaeologically sensitive for both prehistoric and historic sites and artifacts. The
investigation identified eight archaeological sites within the Planning Area. However, these sites
are not listed here in order to protect their integrity.

                                                 Preservation of historic buildings in the City has
                                                 always been a priority for residents of Colusa. With
                                                 the adoption of the Landmark and Historic
                                                 Preservation Ordinance in 1975, the City officially
                                                 established a program that will be updated and
                                                 revised to reflect the updated General Plan. The
                                                 City’s overall preservation objectives are to identify,
                                                 protect, and encourage preservation of Colusa’s
                                                 historic and cultural resources throughout the City.
                                                 The restoration of historic buildings to meet modern
                                                 building codes can become cost restrictive for
                                                 property owners. In addition, some alterations
                                                 required by these modern codes could detract
                                                 from the historic aspects of the structures. In the
                                                 future, the City will encourage property owners to
pursue historic designation for their structures and sites under federal, state, or local authority.
This designation would enable historical property owners to implement alternative building
regulations for the rehabilitation, preservation, restoration, or relocation of structures designated
as qualified historic buildings, as allowed by the State Historical Building Code (Title 24, Part 8).

         Implementing Action PRC-4.2.b: Public Awareness and Education
         The City’s role in public education about cultural and historic resources will be to work
         with the Heritage Preservation Committee to promote involvement in historical
         preservation, construction of informational markers, and historic structure restoration
         efforts. In partnerships with this group and local historians, outreach efforts will be made
         to solicit involvement in signage design, funding, and construction through local schools,
         businesses, and residents.
Policy PRC-4.3:
The City shall encourage the preservation, enhancement, and conservation of historic and older
neighborhoods through its direct actions.
         Implementing Action PRC-4.3.a: Federal, State, and/or Local Funding
         The City will work cooperatively with private developers to pursue financial incentives
         through federal, state, and local funding sources that encourage structural rehabilitation
         and restoration of private historic properties. The City will also pursue grants for historic
         preservation, such as the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and the
         California Heritage Fund (provided by the Safe Neighborhood Parks, Clean Water, Clean
         Air, and Coastal Protection Bond Act of 2000).
         Implementing Action PRC-4.3.b: Mills Act
         The City will participate in the Mills Act Tax Abatement Program as an economic
         incentive for private property owners to actively participate in the restoration of their
         properties. The Mills Act legislation grants participating local governments (cities and
         counties) the authority to enter into contracts with owners of qualified historic properties
         that actively participate in the restoration and maintenance of their historic properties
         while receiving property tax relief.

6.5.1 SETTING--AIR QUALITY
Colusa enjoys good air quality most of the year due to Valley breezes and the community’s
relative distance from large urban areas. However, the City is still seasonally affected by wheat
and rice burning, even though the State of California passed a law more than a decade ago
phasing out rice straw burning in the Sacramento Valley. Without conscious efforts on other
fronts to maintain current air quality standards as significant new development occurs, serious
threats to the public health could result. Primary sources of pollutants include increased
emissions from motor vehicles, as well as stationary sources such as industrial development.
Children, seniors, fetuses, pregnant women, and persons with existing health problems, such as
respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, are especially sensitive to the effects of air pollutants,
particularly carbon and monoxide and ozone. Typical sensitive receptor populations are likely to
be located in facilities such as schools, retirement homes, convalescent homes, hospitals, and
medical clinics.
The Colusa County Air Pollution Control District (APCD) is the agency responsible for ensuring
healthful air quality in Colusa County. According to the Colusa County APCD 2000
Attainment/Non-attainment Status report, the City of Colusa and Colusa County are designated
unclassified/attainment for federal ozone levels and unclassified for particulate matter (PM10)
levels. State levels for ozone have been designated non-attainment/transitional, and PM10 levels
are non-attainment.
In 2001, the Colusa County APCD implemented the Carl Moyer Memorial Air Quality Standards
Attainment Program to provide grants for the incremental cost of new low-emission heavy-duty
engines and low-emission retrofit technologies. The exhausts from heavy-duty diesel engines are
a significant source of smog-forming emissions, contributing to PM10 levels and increasing toxic
air contaminants (TAC).
The following Federal and State Designations define the air quality setting in Colusa County.
Federal Designations:
     •   Non-attainment - Any area that does not meet (or that contributes to ambient air quality
         in a nearby area that does not meet) the national primary or secondary ambient air
         quality standard for the pollutant.
     •   Attainment - Any area that meets the national primary or secondary ambient air quality
         standard for the pollutant.
     •   Unclassifiable - Any area that cannot be classified on the basis of available information
         as meeting or not meeting the national primary or secondary ambient air quality
         standard for the pollutant.
State Designations:
     •   Unclassified - A pollutant is designated unclassified if the data are incomplete and do
         not support a designation of attainment or non-attainment.
     •   Attainment - A pollutant is designated attainment if the state standard for that pollutant
         was not violated at any site in the area during a three-year period.
City of Colusa                                                                         General Plan

    •   Non-attainment - A pollutant is designated non-attainment if there was at least one
        violation of a state standard for that pollutant in the area.
    •   Non-attainment/Transitional - A subcategory of the non-attainment designation. An area
        is designated non-attainment/transitional to signify that the area is close to attaining the
        standard for that pollutant.
6.5.2 OUTLOOK—AIR QUALITY
Buildout under this General Plan will result in a substantial increase in vehicle emissions as a direct
result of population growth. Regional growth will continue to adversely affect air quality as well.
Land use patterns that minimize automobile use, along with Design Guidelines to be developed
as part of the Community Character & Design Element, will directly benefit the City’s air quality.
The emphasis on traditional neighborhood design encourages and facilitates walking and
biking, which is expected to reduce the amount of local automobile travel and resultant vehicle
emissions. Proposed site preparation and construction activities standards and the use of trees
and vegetation for air contaminant reduction will further serve to reduce the adverse impacts of
growth on air quality.
6.5.3 GOALS POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS FOR AIR QUALITY
Goal PRC – 5:
To recognize improved air quality as a health benefit and to preserve air quality as a
natural resource.
Policy PRC-5.1:
The City shall require that site preparation and construction activities incorporate effective
measures to minimize dust and pollutant emissions from motorized construction equipment and
vehicles.
        Implementing Action PRC-5.1.a: Development Review
        Projects will be evaluated for their potential impacts to air quality as part of the
        development review process, applying the California Environmental Act (CEQA)
        Guidelines and in consultation with Colusa County Air Pollution Control District (APCD).
        Implementing Action PRC-5.1.b: Best Management Practices
        The City will require that developers use best management practices (BMPs) as
        recommended by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and Colusa
        County APCD. Approaches to design, construction, and maintenance techniques
        should ensure that development would not cause or worsen air quality.
Policy PRC-5.2:
New development shall provide a street design that includes multiple vehicular access points
and bicycle/pedestrian pathways within neighborhoods. The circulation system shall increase
community connectivity and avoid long, circuitous routes to commercial districts, schools, and
other neighborhoods.

         Implementing Action PRC-5.2.a: Development Review
         Through the CEQA environmental review process, as part of development review,
         proposed development projects will be evaluated to determine the extent to which they
         minimize motor vehicle traffic.
         Implementing Action PRC-5.2.b: Design Review Ordinance (See Implementing Action
         CCD-1.1.a in Chapter 3.0 Community Character and Design)
         The City will adopt a Design Review Ordinance that establishes a process to consider a
         wide range of design issues with development projects. These include such things as
         open space and natural features, pedestrian and traffic circulation, building scale and
         massing, architectural history and details, signs and advertising features, landscaping,
         site lighting, and utility connections. The Design Review process will provide the public
         with an opportunity to review and comment on all development projects requiring a
         permit before the Design Review Board makes a final decision on the project.
         Implementing Action PRC-5.2.c: Design Guidelines (See Implementing Action CCD-1.1.b
         in Chapter 3.0 Community Character and Design)
         The City will adopt Community Design Guidelines in which preservation and
         enhancement of the City’s existing character will be the overriding design principle.
         These Guidelines, to be used in conjunction with the City’s zoning ordinance, will include
         specific design criteria for various development types.
Policy PRC-5.3:
The City shall ensure that residents’ exposure to post-construction emissions is minimized.
         Implementing Action PRC-5.3.a: Development Review
         Through the development review process, projects will be required to demonstrate that
         existing and/or future sensitive receptors are protected from significant air emissions or
         odors through the use of adequate buffer zones, setbacks, or other site design
         techniques.
         Implementing Action PRC-5.3.b: Interagency Coordination
         The City will periodically consult with the Colusa County Air Pollution Control District and
         Colusa County to ensure compliance with federal and state ambient air quality
         standards. This may include limiting the use of wood-burning devices, new construction
         methods, and conversion to natural gas fireplaces in remodeling projects.
Policy PRC-5.4:
The City shall ensure that existing trees and vegetation are retained and incorporated into the
project design wherever feasible.

         Implementing Action PRC-5.4.a: Development Review
         Through the development review process, a landscaping plan will be prepared and
         reviewed for each project to ensure maximum retention and addition of mature trees
         and other vegetation that will contribute to absorption of carbon emissions.
         Implementing Action PRC-5.4.b: Community Design Guidelines (see Implementing Action
         PRC-5.2.b above).
         Implementing Action PRC-5.4.c: Landscape Ordinance
         The City will adopt and implement a landscape ordinance, which will establish standards
         for landscaping as part of new development. Requirements will specify the preparation
         of a landscape plan that shows appropriate application of trees and other vegetation.
         This ordinance will be applied in the design and development of private and public
         development projects and will be consistent with other provisions of the General Plan.
Policy PRC-5.5:
The City shall encourage the use of public transportation as an alternative to the automobile.
         Implementation Action PRC 5.5.a: Public Awareness and Education
         The City will provide public information describing how well-integrated land use and
         transportation planning, combined with greater use of public transit, can reduce vehicle
         miles of travel and motor vehicle emissions that contribute to air pollution, thereby
         improving the community’s air quality.
6.6.1 SETTING—BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
Colusa is located next to the Sacramento River, in an area with high levels of waterfowl activity
and raptor nesting. The River Basin contains a number of species, subspecies, and genetically
distinct populations of fish that are presently listed as federally- or state-threatened/endangered
species or species that appear to be approaching that status. However, the urbanized areas
both in and just outside of the City limits are generally less likely to contain significant wildlife
resources or habitat, and the California Department of Fish and Game has indicated there are
no endangered animal species within the City of Colusa.
Just south of the City of Colusa, the federal government maintains the Colusa National Wildlife
Refuge, part of the Pacific Flyway, which provides winter refuge for migrating waterfowl, such as
ducks and geese. The 10,783-acre refuge consists of about 7,600 acres of managed wetlands,
uplands, riparian habitat, and vernal pools. The refuge supports several endangered plants and
animals, including transplanted colonies of palmate-braced bird’s-beak, species of fairy shrimp,
vernal pool tadpole shrimp, giant garter snake, wintering peregrine falcon, bald eagle, and
breeding tri-colored blackbird. Resident wildlife includes grebe, heron, blackbird, golden eagle,
beaver, muskrat, black-tailed deer, and other species typical of upland and wetland habitats.
Approximately 9,000 people hunt on the refuge each year, and 73,000 people use the visitor
center, auto tour route, and walking trail.
Although the urbanized area of the City of Colusa and outlying areas do not have species or
vegetation which fall into the rare, threatened, or endangered categories, the City does
consider its large variety of mature trees lining its streets a significant resource.
General Plan                                                                             City of Colusa

6.6.2       OUTLOOK—BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
Biological resources in and around the City have, and will continue to be, impacted by
development. Buildout of the General Plan would result in the conversion of large tracts of
undeveloped prime agricultural land which could adversely affect sensitive habitat. However,
infill development in more developed areas of the City is not expected to adversely affect
important biological habitats or plant species. To mitigate the impacts of development, the City
may require projects to integrate or set aside lands of biological significance.
The General Plan Master Environmental Impact Report (MEIR) will identify special status species
and habitats that occur within the General Plan Planning Area. This information will be used as a
starting point for future site planning of large developments when proposed. While this
information is intended to serve as a general guide in identifying screening-level risk assessments
(SLRAs), site-specific biological resource evaluations may also be required to determine if a
project could result in potentially significant impacts to sensitive biological resources.
6.6.3 GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS FOR BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
Goal PRC – 6:
To preserve and protect the biological resources of the City.
Policy PRC – 6.1:
The City shall protect and preserve the area’s biological resources.
         Implementing Action PRC-6.1.a: Development Review
         Through the development review process, and consistent with the requirements of the
         California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the City will require development projects
         to avoid disturbing biological resources within the City, to the greatest extent feasible.
         The City will ensure that adverse impacts to sensitive biological resources are mitigated
         to the maximum extent feasible. Mitigation measures will be specific, feasible actions
         that will actually improve adverse environmental conditions. A mitigation measure is
         considered feasible if it is capable of being accomplished within a reasonable period of
         time, taking into consideration economic, environmental, legal, social and technological
         factors. The City will encourage measures that will, in order of priority, avoid, reduce,
         and/or rectify adverse effects. Priority will be given to measures that mitigate impacts
         on-site and in-kind. Priority will be given to measures that maintain the integrity of habitat
         areas, preferably on site.
         If, during the development review process, the City determines that a proposed project
         has the potential to affect biological resources, the City may require the applicant to
         prepare, at the applicant’s expense, a biological resources assessment, a wetlands
         delineation, an arborist report, and/or other technical information that will allow the City
         to assess the project’s potential to cause adverse impacts to biological resources.

        The City’s review of proposed development projects will include, but is not necessarily
        limited to, the following considerations:
        •    Preservation of heritage oaks and oak woodland habitat;
        •    Protection of special-status plant and animal species as defined by state and federal
             regulations;
        •    Conservation of sensitive wildlife habitat, and mitigation for any loss of that habitat, if
             appropriate;
        •    Avoidance of wetlands and riparian plant communities, and mitigation for any loss of
             that habitat, as appropriate;
        •    Replanting of native vegetation.
        Implementing Action PRC-6.1.b: Interagency Coordination
        The City will coordinate with Colusa County and responsible resource and regulatory
        agencies during project development. The purpose will be to ensure that ample
        opportunity is given to solicit their comments concerning potential impacts to threatened
        and endangered species or other sensitive biological resources within the planning area.
        Implementing Action PRC - 6.1.c: No Net Loss of Wetlands
        As part of the development review process, the City will ensure that proposed
        development projects cause no net loss of wetlands. The term “no net loss” may include
        mitigation implemented through participation in an off-site mitigation bank or similar
        mitigation mechanism acceptable to the City and permitting agencies. On a case-by-
        case basis, the City will consult with permitting agencies regarding the most appropriate
        mitigation strategy for each development project. Strategies that may be considered
        include 1) avoidance, 2) acre-for-acre mitigation, in which the acreage of preserved or
        restored wetlands is directly related to the acreage of affected wetlands, 3) habitat-
        based mitigation, in which the acreage of preserved or restored wetland habitat is
        directly related to the acreage of affected wetland habitat, or 4) a combination of
        these strategies. Wetlands to be preserved and/or restored shall be of the same type as
        those affected, and shall be located within the same biological region.
        Implementing Action PRC – 6.1.d: Native Vegetation List
        The City will develop a list of native vegetation to be used as a landscape pallet within
        open space areas (e.g., parks, preserves, etc.). Through the development review
        process the City will encourage developers to incorporate native plants into landscape
        plans for new development. The City shall implement a public education program to
        encourage citizens to incorporate native plants in residential and commercial
        landscaping throughout the City

6.7.1 SETTING—SOILS
According to the Soil Survey of Colusa County, California, four soil types, with sub variations,
comprise the primary soils found in the Planning Area: the Colusa Series, Sycamore Series, and
Marvin Series. Figure 6.2 identifies each soil type relative to their location throughout the City.
COLUMBIA SERIES
Columbia Series soils consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium from
mixed sources. These soils are located on flood plains and natural levees and have slopes of 0 to
8 percent. Soils are moderately well-drained; negligible to medium runoff; moderately rapid
permeability. Clay substratum phase has slow permeability below a depth of 40 inches. Except
where drained, these soils are saturated at 20 to 48 inches for several months in the period from
November to April. In areas not protected by levees or other flood control structures, these soils
are subject to occasional to frequent, brief to long periods of flooding in November to May. Rare
flooding occurs in partly protected areas. These soils are used for irrigated hay, small grain, and
orchard and row crops. Vegetation consists of a fairly dense cover of oaks, cottonwoods,
willows, vines, shrubs, and grasses near stream channels, but more open away from the
channels.
COLUSA SERIES
Colusa Series soils are derived from mixed river sediments, which contain a predominance of
micaceous granite material. Colusa subsoil structure has no definition, but includes distinct
horizontal characteristics. Variations in this series include deep subsoil, which may be stratified
and underlain at various depths by a moderately dense clay substratum that resembles Marvin
Series soil material. Alkali content varies in amount and consists of sodium carbonate alkali.
Topography associated with these soils is flat with many shallow drainage channels. Drainage is
poor with a high annual water table.

6.0 PARKS, RECREATION AND RESOURCE CONSERVATION
MARVIN SERIES
Marvin Series soils consist of soil derived from transported alluvium of mixed origin with a
predominance of granitic rock. These soils occupy the older and imperfectly drained portions of
the flood plain and/or occur near the flat basin area of a river channel. The subsoils are
moderately compacted with accumulations of lime. Surface and subsoil drainage tends to be
poor.
SYCAMORE SERIES
Sycamore Series soils are composed of a group of alluvial soils formed from transported materials
that are dominantly granitic in character. This series also contains some basic and sedimentary
alluvium. Surface textures range from fine sandy loam to clay loams. Most of the loams have
been inherited from ground water reaching the lower profile during the rainy season. Parent
materials are generally non-calcareous, but the subsoils are calcareous. The topography of
these soils is generally flat, with gently sloping flood plain relief. The soil type is generally well
drained with little to no erosion.
6.7.2 OUTLOOK—SOILS
Soil conservation is an important aspect of natural resource management – both during
construction and after development. Development under buildout of this General Plan will
significantly disturb soils. The policy and implementing actions in this element are intended to
preserve or minimize disturbance to soils primarily through the use of sound grading and erosion
control techniques. The General Plan policy will rely on proposed local ordinances and Best
Management Practices (BMPs) recommended by the Natural Resource Conservation Service
(NRCS) as the primary guidelines for grading and erosion control measures.
In addition, knowledge of soils limitations and their suitability for development will help to
conserve this limited resource and determine proper land use. The soils map (Figure 6.2),
combined with the Colusa County Resource Conservation District’s Soil Survey of Colusa County,
California, define the characteristics of soils in Colusa. This information can be applied to
constraints analyses as new development is proposed.
6.7.3 GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS FOR SOILS
Goal PRC – 7:
To protect and preserve soils as a natural resource.
Policy PRC-7.1:
The City shall minimize soil erosion and sedimentation by maintaining compatible land uses,
suitable building designs, and appropriate construction techniques.
         Implementing Action PRC-7.1.a: Best Management Practices
         The City will require that developers use Best Management Practices (BMPs) as
         recommended by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Approaches
         to design, construction, and maintenance techniques should ensure that development
         would not cause or worsen erosion and sedimentation. Techniques will include erosion

         and sediment control practices, such as hay bales, turbidity screens, temporary
         vegetation, and other management practices during construction. The City will require
         that these measures be left in place until disturbed areas are stabilized with permanent
         vegetation that will prevent the transport of sediment offsite.
         Implementing Action PRC-7.1.b: Development Review
         Developments will be reviewed to ensure that sound soil conservation practices and
         minimization of land alterations are incorporated into project design and construction.
         Implementing Action PRC-7.1.c: Grading and Erosion Control Ordinance
         The City will adopt and implement a grading and erosion control ordinance that includes
         specific standards for project construction and erosion control. This ordinance will
         address prompt revegetation of disturbed areas, avoidance of grading activities during
         wet weather, avoidance of drainage corridors and riverbanks, and other erosion control
         measures.
6.8.1 SETTING—AGRICULTURAL LANDS
Colusa’s urbanized core is surrounded by prime agricultural lands. Section 56064 of the
Government Code broadly defines land as “prime agricultural land” if it meets any of the
following criteria:
     a) Land, that if irrigated, qualifies for rating as class I or class II in the USDA Natural Resources
         Conservation Service land use capability classification
     b) Land that qualifies for rating 8 through 100 Storie Index Rating
     c) Land that supports livestock used for the production of food and fiber that has an annual
         carrying capacity equivalent to at least one animal unit per acre
     d) Land planted with fruit or nut-bearing trees, vines, bushes, or crops that have a
         nonbearing period of less than five years and that will return not less than $400 per acre
         from the production of unprocessed agricultural plant production on an annual basis.

Agriculture is, by far, the County’s leading industry and accounts for most of the City’s economic
base as well. The crops grown on this land – mainly rice, tomatoes, almonds, prunes, and wheat
– account for a large part of Colusa County’s total revenue each year.
6.8.2 OUTLOOK—AGRICULTURAL LANDS
Implementation of the Land Use Element may result in substantial conversions of prime
agricultural land to urban uses. However, the County General Plan Land Use designations
anticipate such conversions.
Although Colusa has not designated any of its lands in the Planning Area for agricultural uses,
the preservation of farmland is a critical component in maintaining Colusa’s rural, small-town
character. As the City develops and expands, it will continue to support agricultural
conservation practices and will oppose premature efforts to intensify development outside its
planning boundaries.
As land at the outer edge of the Planning Area is annexed into the City for urban development,
the City will work with developers and landowners to ensure that sufficient transition areas are
maintained between urban and agricultural land uses. The need for buffer areas to separate
urban development from agricultural land may vary from project to project and from lot to lot,
depending on the adjacent agricultural use. The City will adhere to agricultural buffer standards
within the limits established by the State of California.
This General Plan does not propose a Right-to-Farm ordinance because the areas shown as
prime agricultural land within the City’s Sphere of Influence are already designated in the
Colusa County General Plan as Agricultural-Transitional (AT), Rural Residential (RR), or Urban
Residential (UR), which provide for varying intensities of residential development.
6.8.3 GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL LANDS
Goal PRC-8:
To retain agricultural land uses beyond the City’s urban growth boundary.
Policy PRC 8.1:
The City shall support efforts to preserve existing agricultural land uses in areas outside the City’s
sphere of influence.
         Implementing Action LU-8.1.a: Interagency Coordination (see Implementing Action LU-
         2.1.c above).
         Implementing Action LU-8.1.b: Public/Private Partnerships
         The City will work with Colusa County, nonprofit organizations, and landowners to
         establish programs that will protect prime agricultural areas within one-quarter (¼) to
         one-half (½) mile of the sphere of influence boundary, including a process to implement
         techniques such as transfer of development rights, agricultural conservation easements,
         and farmland trusts.

        The City will also work with Colusa County to establish mutually reinforcing goals of city-
        centered development in order to prevent the intrusion of residential development into
        agricultural lands.
        Implementing Action PRC-8.1.c: Development Review Process
        The Development Review process will include a project-specific assessment of loss of
        Prime Farmland and determine appropriate mitigation (type and amount) in
        accordance with the City’s adopted policy or program that provides for mitigating loss
        of Prime Farmland within the General Plan’s Planning Area.
6.9.1 SETTING – WATER QUALITY AND WATER CONSERVATION
The City of Colusa is within the Colusa sub-basin of the Sacramento Valley Groundwater Basin,
which has a surface area of 918,380 acres or 1,434 square miles. The Sacramento Valley
Groundwater Basin is bounded on the east by the Sacramento River, on the west by the Coast
Range and foothills, on the south by Cache Creek, and on the north by Stony Creek. Average
annual precipitation is up to 27 inches. Regional rainfall is concentrated during the winter
months and varies from 17 to 27 inches, with practically no rain from May to September.
Groundwater level data show an average seasonal fluctuation of approximately five feet for
normal and dry years, with no increasing or decreasing trends in groundwater levels.
Groundwater level supplies have an estimated storage capacity, to a depth of 200 feet, of
approximately 13,025,887 acre-feet (one acre-foot equals 325,851 gallons).
The Colusa sub-basin aquifer system is composed of continental deposits of late Tertiary to
Quaternary age. The Tehama formation is the predominant water-bearing unit within the Colusa
Sub-basin, consisting of moderately compacted silt, clay, and fine silty sand enclosing lenses of
sand and gravel, silt and gravel, and cemented conglomerate.
GROUND WATER
Groundwater quality in the region is generally good, as evidenced by widespread low total
dissolved solids, with some localized contamination. Sodium bicarbonate waters typically occur
in the Colusa planning area, with high levels of
nitrates and manganese impairments. However,
these levels are not significant and are not
indicative of the water quality delivered to the
consumer. (See the Community Facilities Services
Element for further discussion on water treatment
and delivery.)
SURFACE WATER
The northern border of the City of Colusa is defined
by the Sacramento River. Other streams in the
general area of Colusa are Lurline, Freshwater, and
Salt Creeks, but these are redirected to the south,
away from Colusa via the Colusa Drainage Canal.
The Sacramento River winds approximately 90 miles
upstream from Sacramento into Colusa County.
General Plan                                                                         City of Colusa

The Department of Water Resources (DWR) has collected water quality data for the Sacramento
River since 1955, while the U.S. Geological Service gauging station has recorded flow since 1921.
The water quality of the Sacramento River and its major tributaries supports beneficial uses most
of the time, including drinking and irrigation water, recreation, and protection of fish and other
aquatic life. Most of the water in the Sacramento River and its major tributaries, such as the
Feather and American Rivers, is derived from melting snow that enters the Rivers by managed
discharges of water from reservoirs. Because the snow is pure, much of the Sacramento River
and its large tributaries have low concentrations of dissolved minerals. Variable climatic
conditions and variation in the amounts of rainfall, coupled with competing demands for water
uses, affect the aquatic ecology of this basin.
6.9.2 OUTLOOK – WATER QUALITY AND WATER CONSERVATION
The Sacramento River and inland drainages are among the most significant and valuable of
Colusa’s natural resources. Development adjacent to the river and natural drainage areas will
need to be designed, constructed, and maintained to avoid adverse impacts on riparian
vegetation, river bank stability, and water quality to the maximum extent feasible.
The City’s commitment to water conservation and water quality for both surface water and
groundwater are demonstrated through its General Plan policies. Implementing actions
emphasize the use of buffers and proper design to minimize urban runoff and pollutants entering
waterways. (Water supply policies are discussed in the Municipal Facilities and Services
Element.) In addition to land use considerations, key implementing actions to protect water
resources involve the use of setbacks, best management practices (BMPs) for grading, drainage
and erosion control, along with site design. The City will encourage the use of natural
stormwater drainage systems to preserve and enhance existing natural features.

                                                 6.10.1 SETTING – SOLID WASTE REDUCTION
                                                 Solid waste is defined as any unwanted or
                                                 discarded material that is not a liquid or a gas. In
                                                 Colusa, common solid wastes include paper
                                                 products, metals, glass, plastics, cloth, food scraps,
                                                 rock, soil, yard waste, and wood. Presently, the City
                                                 produces approximately 40 tons of household solid
                                                 waste per day. Since much of this material is
recyclable, conservation efforts to reduce solid waste and landfill volumes are an important
component of this General Plan.

Currently, the City provides solid waste disposal services to City residents and businesses. Waste is
collected and transported in compliance with County and State regulations governing solid
waste disposal to the Ostrom Road Landfill in Yuba County. Recycling in the City is provided by
both private and public entities. The City of Colusa provides a drop-off center for plastics,
aluminum cans, and glass, which is collected by and maintained by the Lions Club. The City also
provides pickup for newspaper and yard waste. Private contractors in the City provide recycling
facilities for plastics, aluminum, glass, newspaper, cardboard, white paper, and colored paper.
Additionally, local businesses such as Holiday Market, Rite Aid Pharmacy, and Chung Sun Market
recycle cardboard.
The reduction of solid waste has become a major issue in California and throughout the country.
Not only is the amount of solid waste increasing each year, but disposal areas are becoming
scarce. The State of California has established goals for solid waste reduction and increased
use of secondary (recycled) materials. State Assembly Bill 939 requires the reduction of solid
waste for all jurisdictions throughout the State. In keeping with the State’s goal for the reduction
of solid waste, in 2005, the City of Colusa reduced solid waste by more than 2,300 tons through
recycling efforts in the City. Table 6.3 identifies the amount of waste diverted from landfills due
to reduction efforts in the City for the year 2005.

Source Reduction and Recycling Element (SRRE). This Regional Agency allows the three
jurisdictions to consolidate integrated waste management planning and diversion reporting.
The Regional Agency has prepared a Summary Plan for Colusa County, which provides an
overview of the waste management infrastructure for the County and its incorporated cities.
The Summary Plan describes the goals and objectives developed by the County and Local Task
Force to guide the County in coordinating countywide diversion programs. The Summary Plan

The City of Colusa will continue to work with the City of Williams and Colusa County to achieve
its solid waste reduction goals. Future development within the planning area is not expected to
affect the ability of the City or its solid waste disposal services to continue their part in
implementing solid waste reduction programs.
6.10.3 GOALS, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS FOR SOLID WASTE REDUCTION
Goal PRC – 10:
To minimize the solid waste stream in the City.
Policy PRC-10.1:
The City shall continue to encourage recycling, waste reduction, and the re-use of materials to
reduce the amount of solid waste generated in Colusa.
          Implementing Action PRC-10.1.a: Assembly Bill (AB) 939
          The City will continue to comply with the requirements of AB 939 with regard to meeting
          state-mandated targets for reductions in the amount of solid waste generated in Colusa.
          Implementing Action PRC-10.1.b: Source Reduction and Recycling Program
          The City will implement a program of source reduction and recycling to include the
          following components to the maximum extent feasible:
          •    Provision of solid waste reduction facilities for the recycling of plastics, glass,
               aluminum cans and newspaper and collection of yard waste.
          •    Curbside recycling program for Colusa residents.
          •    Use of recycled concrete in all base material utilized in City and private road
               construction.
          •    Purchase of recycled, recyclable, or reusable products and materials for use in City
               facilities where feasible.
          •    The contractor selection process will include a demonstration by contractors that a
               portion of their products and/or services includes the use of recycled materials.
          Implementing Action PRC-10.1.c: Public Awareness and Education
          As part of the joint cities-county solid waste reduction effort, the City will facilitate and/or
          co-sponsor local events that focus on solid waste reduction and recycling in an effort to
          educate the public about the countywide efforts to meet its goals. Possible events, as
          suggested by the California Integrated Waste Management Board, include:

         Targeted materials include:
         •   Grass and yard waste recycling
         •   Home composting
         •   Unwanted mail
         •   Excess packaging
         Joint cities-county efforts will also encourage involving others through Environmental
         Roundtables that bring together key citizens and business leaders to discuss waste
         reduction issues on a regular basis. These events offer opportunities for education,
         information sharing, waste exchanging, and support. Often groups are formed about a
         specific industry or type of business such as hospitals or school districts, or by issue such as
         reuse, packaging, or composting.
6.11.1 SETTING—ENERGY
Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) provides electricity and natural gas in the City. PG&E
is a privately owned utility whose service area covers most of northern and central California.
PG&E provides energy conservation services for residents, as well as energy assistance programs
help low-income households conserve energy and control utility costs. These programs include
the California Alternate Rate for Energy (CARE) program and the Relief for Energy Assistance
through Community Help (REACH) program, which provides one-time energy assistance to
qualifying customers. PG&E has also sponsored rebate programs that encourage customers to
purchase more energy-efficient appliances and heating and cooling systems.
6.11.2 OUTLOOK—ENERGY
Californians have become more energy-conscious since the energy crisis in 1972. The advent of
deregulation, the rapidly escalating cost of energy, and ever-decreasing availability of fuel
sources has prompted government agencies to conserve energy and look for alternatives to the
use of non-renewable resources. Strategies used by state and local communities include
improving the efficiency of transportation systems, replacing fixtures that use a lot of energy with
newer and more efficient equipment, and promoting recycling.
Title 24 of the California Administrative Code sets forth mandatory energy standards for new
development and requires the adoption of an “energy budget.” Future developments must
meet these standards, and the City is responsible for ensuring that they do.
As electricity and natural gas costs continue to rise, energy conservation will become
increasingly important to the community. This General Plan addresses conservation of energy

through policies and implementing actions aimed at making the City’s homes and businesses as
energy-efficient as possible.
6.11.3 GOALS, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS FOR ENERGY
Goal PRC – 11:
To reduce consumption of energy sources in Colusa.
Policy PRC-11.1:
The City shall seek to minimize energy impacts from new residential and commercial projects.
        Implementing Action PRC-11.1.a: Development Review (see Implementing Action PRC-
        1.1.a).
        Implementation Action PRC 11.1.b: Public Awareness and Education
        The City will provide information on available energy conservation techniques and
        products to the public and builders. Resources will include information on programs
        such as Pacific Gas and Electric’s “Savings by Design” program for remodeling
        residences as a means of reducing energy demands and costs.
        Implementation Action PRC 11.1.c: Title 24 Uniform Building Code
        The City will require energy efficient siting and building design in all new development
        projects consistent with the requirements of Title 24 of the California Administrative Code.
        Measures include building orientation and shading, landscaping, use of active and
        passive solar heating and hot water systems, etc. The City will also investigate and
        consider adopting Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) sustainability
        standards for residential and commercial development.
Policy PRC 11.2:
The City shall utilize new, environmentally safe energy sources to the maximum extent feasible.
        Implementation Action PRC- 11.2.a: Facilities Master Plan
        As part of its Facilities Master Plan, the City will evaluate options for use of alternative
        energy systems when retrofitting or constructing new City facilities or when purchasing
        new equipment, provided they meet all public, safety, health, and design requirements
        and are proven to be reliable.
        Implementation Action PRC-11.2.b: Capital Improvement Program
        The City will consider incorporating into its Capital Improvement Program a green fleet
        that includes the City’s purchase of fuel-efficient and alternative-fuel vehicles.
6.12.1 SETTING—VISUAL RESOURCES
A variety of visual resources contribute to the City’s tranquil quality of life. The Sacramento River
is an important scenic water feature that also serves as a recreational resource. Trees and other

riparian vegetation grow along the riverbanks, providing a green and shaded area during the
summer months when temperatures are hot and other vegetation becomes dry. While views of
the Sacramento River from the City and other portions of the Planning Area are obstructed by a
levee along the southern bank, a bicycle/pedestrian path along the top of the levee provides
key vantage points for views of the River.
While not within the City’s Planning Area, the Sutter Buttes and the Coast Range are significant
assets to the extent they provide a breathtaking backdrop to the City, enhancing its rural
character and providing a nearby resource for passive recreation. Located just nine miles east
of the City, the Sutter Buttes are readily visible from nearly every part of the Planning Area that is
not significantly obstructed by trees or tall structures.
Diverse commercial and residential landscapes, including several historical buildings, create a
visual spectrum that shows Colusa’s heritage and culture. Originally, the City’s commercial area
developed adjacent to the Sacramento River, which reflected its status as a steamship port.
Today, much of the City’s historical commercial area is located between Main Street and Oak
Street, interspersed with historic residences. The variety of housing styles reflects architectural
styles spanning many decades. Many homes from the 19th century “Victorian” era can still be
seen, along with “California Bungalows,” and other housing types from more recent periods.
The City developed on a traditional grid street pattern lined with broad shade trees that have
created its “small town” atmosphere. More recent residential developments in the southern
portion of the City are suburban in character. Visual characteristics in these developments
include wider and more curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, and greater prominence of garages in
the streetscape.
6.12.2 OUTLOOK—VISUAL RESOURCES
The City of Colusa will use the tools provided in this General Plan to retain its small-town
character in what is now a desirable rural setting. In an effort to avoid generic suburban
architectural styles, the policies and implementing actions of this element seek to preserve open
space areas and views as an important feature of the community. Together with the design
guidelines provided for in the Community Character and Design element, the policies and
implementing actions in this element will help to further strengthen the visual interest of the city.
The gateway areas are visual focal points for those entering the City on SR 20 and SR 20/45.
Buildout under this General Plan will bring substantial new development in close proximity to
these routes—portions of which are within sensitive viewing corridors that take in the Sacramento
River, the Sutter Buttes, and the Coast Range. Consequently, proper siting and design of
development projects in these areas are critical to maintaining a desirable aesthetic quality in
these areas.
Development should be sensitive to the key natural features of the area, including ecological
systems, vegetative communities, mature trees, watercourses, landforms, archaeological and
historical resources, and architecturally significant structures. Proposed projects should identify
and conserve special areas of high ecological sensitivity throughout the City. By respecting and
preserving important natural resources and visual character, development may serve as an
asset rather than a detriment to the community.

7.1      INTRODUCTION
The Noise Element is a legally required Element and is included in this General Plan because
noise in any community can be regarded as a health problem. Excessive noise may produce
actual physiological damage such as hearing impairment, but, just as importantly, noise
interferes with the quiet use and enjoyment of one’s property. The health effects of noise in the
community can interfere with human activities such as sleep, speech, recreation, and tasks
demanding concentration or coordination. When community noise interferes with human
activities, public tolerance for that noise source decreases. This decrease in acceptability and
the threat to public health and welfare are the basis for land use planning policies that minimize
or prevent exposure to excessive noise levels. This Noise Element addresses issues related to
noise in and around the City.
NOISE ELEMENT OBJECTIVES
The basic objectives of the Noise Element include:
    •    Ensuring that site design requirements for residential development are adequate to
         protect residents from sound levels that exceed the specified residential standards.
    •    Protecting sensitive land uses, such as schools, hospitals, and libraries from sound levels in
         excess of residential sound levels.
    •    Designing streets to reduce, wherever feasible, excessive noise from the roadways.
    •    Restricting truck traffic in residential areas, except for deliveries within the area or on
         designated truck routes. To the extent possible, truck usage in residential areas should
         be limited to daylight hours.
    •    Providing sound protection, to the extent possible, along transportation routes in
         accordance with the adjacent land uses.
    •    Providing sound protection, to the extent possible, from aircraft during takeoff and
         landing.
The Noise Element outlines goals, policies, and implementing actions to protect Colusa residents
from excessive noise levels that are annoying to the senses and detrimental to public health.
The element establishes acceptable noise level standards for land uses affected by both mobile
and stationary noise sources, including temporary noise related to construction. Noise and land
use compatibility criteria are designed to provide an acceptable community noise environment
and to minimize noise-related complaints from residents. The compatibility criteria should be
used in conjunction with future noise exposure levels in order to identify projects or activities that
may require special treatment to minimize noise exposure.
NOISE FUNDAMENTALS
Noise is often described as unwanted sound and is defined as any pressure variation in air that
the human ear can detect. If the pressure variations occur frequently enough (20+ times per
second), they can be heard and hence are called sound. Two parameters are used to
technically describe certain sounds: amplitude and frequency. Amplitude is measured in units of
decibels, abbreviated dBA. The amplitude of a sound is a measure of the pressure or force that
a sound can exert. Frequency is measure in Hertz (hz), meaning cycles per second, and refers to
City of Colusa                                                                             General Plan

the number of times that the acoustic pressure (amplitude) peaks in each sound. A sound that
has more cycles per second is higher pitched. High-pitched sounds are produced by a rapidly
vibrating sound source, and low-pitched sounds are from a more slowly vibrating source.
Measuring sound directly in terms of pressure would require a very large and awkward range of
numbers. To avoid this, the decibel (dB) scale was devised (see Table 7.1). The decibel scale
uses the hearing threshold (20 micropascals) as a point of reference, defined as 0 dB. Other
sound pressures are then compared to the reference pressure, and the logarithm is taken to
keep the numbers in a practical range. The decibel scale allows a million-fold increase in
pressure to be expressed as 120 dB. Another useful aspect of the decibel scale is that changes in
levels correspond closely to human perception of relative loudness.
The perceived loudness of sounds is dependent upon sound pressure level and frequency
content. However, within the usual range of environmental noise levels, perception of loudness is
relatively predictable and can be approximated by weighing the frequency response of a
sound level meter by means of the standardized A-weighting network. There is a strong
correlation between A-weighted sound levels (expressed as dBA) and community response to
noise. For this reason, the A-weighted sound level has become the standard tool of
environmental noise assessment.
Everyday sound normally ranges from 30 dBA (very quiet) to 100dBA (very loud). The average
level of conversation ranges from 30 to 80 dBA. Sound becomes discomforting at 120 dBA and
physically painful above 140 dBA (See Table 7.1).

Community noise is commonly described in terms of the “ambient” noise level. Several rating
scales have been developed for the measurements of community noise. The predominant
rating scales now used in California are:
    •     Leq-Energy Noise Level. A common statistical tool to measure the ambient noise level is
          the average, or equivalent, sound level (Leq). The sound level corresponding to a steady-
          state sound level containing the same total energy as the time varying signal over a
          given sample period, which corresponds to a steady-state A-weighted sound level.
    •     Ldn-Day-Night Average Sound level. Similar to Leq but applies a weighing factor, which
          places greater significance on noise events occurring at night (10:00 pm to 7:00 am)
          than during the day (7:00 am to 10:00 pm).
    •     CNEL-Community Noise Equivalent Level. Similar to Ldn but with weighing factors placed
          on two time periods (evening, 7:00 am to 10:00 pm, and night 10:00 pm to 7:00 am).
    •     Lmax, Lmin- Maximum, Minimum. The maximum and minimum A-weighted sound levels
          measured on a sound level meter, during a designated time interval, using fast time
          averaging.
One of the greatest problems in noise analysis is that of relating noise exposure to health and
welfare and determining maximum noise levels for the protection of a community’s residents.
Although there has been some dispute in the scientific community regarding the detrimental
effects of noise, a number of general conclusions have been reached:
    •     Noise of sufficient intensity has caused irreversible hearing damage.
    •     Noise has produced physiological changes in humans and animals that in many
          instances have not resulted in adaptation.
    •     The effects of noise are cumulative and, therefore, the levels and duration of noise
          exposure must be taken into account in any overall evaluation. The recognition of this
          fact has been translated into legislation specifying limits on total permissible noise
          exposure in industrial settings.

7.0 NOISE
     •    Noise can interfere with speech and other communications.
     •    Noise can be a major source of annoyance by disturbing sleep, rest, and relaxation.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has suggested a noise reduction goal of 55 dBA
(Ldn) in residential areas for the protection of health and welfare. The U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development’s minimum standard of noise in residential areas is 65 dBA (Ldn). CNEL or
Ldn levels can be mapped using contour lines around major noise generators. The contours
typically correspond to 5 dBA intervals and the maps include all contours greater than 60 dBA
(Ldn). The 60 dBA cut-off corresponds to the state requirement that all new housing with exterior
noise levels exceeding this level be insulated. As a guideline, interior noise levels should be no
louder than 45 dBA (Ldn). Since noise reduction provided by a typical house is 12 to 18 dBA,
additional insulation is usually required where exterior noise exceeds 60 dBA.
NOISE REDUCTION METHODS
Noise problems have three basic elements: the noise source, a transmission path, and a
receiver. The appropriate acoustical treatment for a given project depends on the nature of the
noise source and the sensitivity of the receiver. The problem should be defined in terms of
appropriate criteria (Ldn, Leq, or Lmax), the location of the sensitive receiver (inside or outside), and
when the problem occurs (daytime or nighttime).
Noise control techniques should then be selected to provide an acceptable noise environment
for the receiving property while remaining consistent with local aesthetic standards and
practical structural and economic limits. Fundamental noise control techniques include the use
of setback areas, physical noise barriers, incorporation of site design techniques (including
placement and uses of structures), building design, acoustical design of building facades, and
placement of site vegetation.
7.2       SETTING
Generally, noise is not a significant problem in the City of Colusa. There are no major noise-
generating industries in Colusa, and those industries that do exist are mostly segregated from
residential areas, with the notable exceptions of unincorporated areas along Fourteenth Street
and along west Main Street. No railroad passes through or near the City; and the noise
generated by Colusa County airport traffic does not impact sensitive receptors (e.g., schools,
residences) since it is surrounded by land that is largely undeveloped, open space (golf club) or
industrial.
The noise exposure contours provided in this Noise Element are taken from the Colusa County
Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP), as shown in Figure 7.1. These contours do not
include areas within the Colusa City limits. Presently, noise exposure contours within the City are
established, if needed, through site-specific acoustical analysis. Roadway Vehicle Traffic Noise
corridors along SR 20 through town are between 60 dBA and 70 dBA at 18-38 feet (See Table 7.2)
from the center of the roadway, with the highest recordings being on Market Street when traffic
volumes are highest.
The major source of noise in the City is vehicle traffic from the two State highways/routes (SR)
that intersect within Colusa: SR 20 and SR 45. SR 20 enters Colusa from the southwest. Once
inside the City limits, SR 20 travels north (10th Street), east (Market Street) and south (Bridge
Street) before exiting Colusa at its southeastern corner. Approximately seven miles southeast of
Colusa, SR 45 merges with SR 20 and subsequently enters Colusa from the southeast,

separates from SR 20 and continues in a northerly direction. These highways provide enough
traffic to cause noise that would potentially exceed EPA and State noise guidelines.

The peak levels of traffic occur on Market and Bridge Streets (an average of 20,500 ADT or 2,375
vehicles per peak hour, as shown in Table 4.2 of the Circulation Element). At this level of traffic
volume and at the slower speeds driven through the town, the level of noise generated from
traffic would not exceed the 60-decibel level on a day/night average scale (Ldn) (See Figure 7.1
Noise Contour Map). Peak-hour traffic would occur during daylight hours, and Market Street is
lined with mostly commercial uses, which are less noise sensitive than residential uses. The
biggest problem is truck noise from this traffic flow. Loud trucks would be especially annoying
during the night. In general, the City of Colusa has an invaluable resource—a relatively quiet
community.
AIRCRAFT
Aircraft noise affecting the City of Colusa is produced by operations occurring at the Colusa
County Airport, located on SR 20 south of the City and within its sphere of influence. It is
recognized that the Colusa County Airport is a noise generator by virtue of airport activity, as
well as agricultural and airport-related businesses.
The greatest potential for sound intrusion occurs when aircraft land, take off, or run up their
engines while on the ground. The sounds associated with general aviation propeller aircraft are
produced primarily by the propellers and secondarily from the engine and exhaust.
NON-TRANSPORTATION NOISE SOURCES
Non-transportation noise sources can be characterized as stationary noise sources that may last
a period of several hours or be ongoing through a 24-hour period. General descriptions of some
of the existing stationary noise sources in the City of Colusa are provided below.
General Service Commercial and Light Industrial Uses
Noise sources associated with service commercial uses such as automotive and truck repair
facilities, tire installation centers, car washes, loading docks, corporation yards, etc., are found
within relative close proximity to SR 20 and SR 45 within the City limits. The noise emissions of these

types of uses are dependent on many factors and are difficult to quantify precisely. Nonetheless,
noise generated by these uses contributes to the ambient noise environment in the immediate
vicinity of these uses.
Parks and School Playing Fields
Several recreational parks and school playgrounds are sources of stationary noise within the City.
Noise generated by these uses depends on the age and number of people utilizing the
respective facilities at a given time and the types of activities in which they are engaged.
School playing-field activities tend to generate more noise than those of neighborhood parks,
because the intensity of school playground usage tends to be much higher. At a distance of 100
feet from an elementary school playground being used by 100 students, average and maximum
noise levels of 60 and 75 dB, respectively, can be expected. At organized events such as high-
school football games with large crowds and public address systems, the noise generation is
often significantly higher. As with service commercial uses, the noise generation of parks and
school playing fields is variable.
NOISE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
City of Colusa General Plan 1994
The 1994 General Plan Noise Element’s Table 1 provides the current noise performance
standards used to determine compatibility between new and existing land uses. The standards
were developed with the guidelines in place at that time, as published by the California
Department of Health Services, Office of Noise Control.
The table identifies three separate standards for noise exposure: normally acceptable,
conditionally acceptable, and normally unacceptable. Maximum exposure levels for residential
interiors are 45 dBA Ldn; maximum exposure levels for public/quasi-public uses range from 45 to
55 dBA Ldn; maximum levels for commercial uses range from 50 to 65 dBA Ldn; and maximum
levels for light industrial and industrial uses range from 55 to 70 dBA Ldn.
Table 1 must be updated based on changes in State noise regulations and building code
requirements over the last 12 years and to reflect a wider range of land use types as proposed
with the General Plan update. In Section 7.3 Outlook that follows, this element provides an
updated and expanded range of noise performance standards, as shown in Table 7.3 and Table
7.4.
Colusa County Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan
The Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) prepared by the Colusa County Airport Land Use
Commission (ALUC) in 1995 sets forth the noise criteria that the ALUC uses to evaluate proposed
land use plans and development in the vicinity of the Colusa County Airport. The noise
evaluation criteria determine airport/land use noise compatibility to protect the public from the
adverse effects of aircraft noise. The criteria consider future Community Noise Equivalent Level
(CNEL) contours as established by the State of California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 21,
Subchapter 6. The criteria established by the code for airports with four-engine turbojet or
turbofan aircraft and 25,000 annual operations is 65 dB CNEL.
While the CLUP defines residential uses incompatible in areas at or above 55 dB CNEL, it does
not indicate where this noise contour line exists within the City. However, the 2015 Noise
City of Colusa                                                                          General Plan

7.0 NOISE
Exposure Map produced by the Colusa County Airport establishes a 55 dB CNEL noise contour.
The southern portion of the City Planning Area, which includes residential land use designations,
is within the airport 55 dB CNEL noise contour. Figure 7.1 identifies the Colusa County Airport
noise contours as they relate to the City. These contours represent an average of all noise levels
expected during a normal 24-hour day, adjusted to an equivalent level that accounts for the
greater intrusiveness of evening and nighttime noise.
The CLUP contains a comprehensive set of policies and implementing actions that govern future
land uses to ensure compatible uses with airport noise levels. The City must follow these policies
when considering land use applications around the airport.
For land uses within the noise contour of the state-mandated criterion of 65 dB CNEL, the
following land uses are incompatible:
     •   Single-family dwellings
     •   Multi-family dwellings
     •   Mobile home parks
     •   Schools of standard construction
The state has established noise reduction requirements for new hotels, motels, apartments, and
other dwelling units, except single-family dwellings, in CCR Title 25, Section 28. The code
establishes a standard that limits noise to 45 dB CNEL, with windows closed, in any habitable
room in affected dwellings. For residential dwellings, other than single-family detached, in areas
having an airport showing CNEL greater than 60 dB, the code requires an acoustical study
showing that the structure has been designed to meet the interior standard of 45 dB CNEL. In
addition to the acoustical standards contained within the adopted CLUP, future development
within the Airport Influence Area, as defined by the California Civil Code, will require disclosure
and proximity statements regardless of any formal requirements for noise mitigation.
7.3      OUTLOOK
As development activity continues to move closer to the airport facility, noise mitigation and
airport influence area notice requirements may need to be implemented to comply with the
adopted CLUP and California Civil Code. The main source of noise in Colusa, however, will
continue to be traffic on SR 20 and SR 45. While land uses along these highways are varied in the
Planning Area, nearly the entire SR 20 corridor and some of the SR 20/45 corridor leading into the
City are developed. As a result, some noise impacts will be unavoidable. Future development
along these routes will consider noise increases generated by vehicle traffic associated with the
new projects.
Even with the future development anticipated in the City, ambient noise levels are not expected
to drastically increase. The City’s noise standards, which are incorporated into Policies N-1.1 and
N-1.2 of this Element, are intended to mitigate future noise increases in all sensitive areas of the
City.
As the City continues to grow, development in the southern portion of the Planning Area could
intrude into the Colusa County Airport 55 dB CNEL noise contour. While a majority of this area
has land use designations that are compatible to guidelines established by the CLUP, residential

uses are not. Therefore, land use decisions in the City’s Planning Area must consider the CLUP
land use compatibility guidelines for areas in the 55 dB and above noise contours.
NOISE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS UNDER THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
Colusa’s exterior noise standards for new uses affected by traffic and airport noise under this
General Plan update range from 60 to 70 dBA Ldn. Table 7.3 outlines standards for various land
uses. These noise standards are consistent with those recommended by the State Office of Noise
Control and are most appropriately applied to land uses adjacent to continuous noise sources,
such as roadway traffic noise.

  Notes:
  1. For traffic noise in the City of Colusa, Ldn and peak-hour Leq values are estimated to be approximately similar. Interior noise
      level standards are applied in noise-sensitive areas of the various land uses, with windows and doors in the closed
      positions.
  2. Outdoor activity areas for single-family residential uses are defined as back yards. For large parcels or residences with no
      clearly defined outdoor activity area, the standard shall be applicable within a 100-foot radius of the residence.
  3 For multi-family residential uses, the exterior noise level standard shall be applied at the common outdoor recreation area,
      such as at pools, play areas, or tennis courts. Where such areas are not provided in multi-family residential uses, the
      standards shall be applied at individual patios and balconies of the development.
  4. Where it is not possible to reduce noise in outdoor activity areas to 60 dB Ldn or less using a practical application of the best
      available noise reduction measures, an exterior noise level of up to 65 dB Ldn may be allowed—provided that available
      exterior noise level reduction measures have been implemented and interior noise levels are in compliance with this table.
  5. Outdoor activity areas of transient lodging facilities include swimming pool and picnic areas.
  6. Hospitals are often noise-generating uses. The exterior noise level standards for hospitals are applicable only at clearly
      identified areas designated for outdoor relaxation by either hospital staff or patients.
  7. Only the exterior spaces of these uses designated for employee or customer relaxation are considered sensitivee.
Standards based on 24-hour weighting are not adequate to address certain noise sources,
particularly industrial noise sources, which occur infrequently but at a potentially higher intensity.
Colusa’s exterior noise standards for new uses affected by non-transportation (stationary) noise
sources under the General Plan update range from 50 to 65 dBA Leq. Table 7.4 contains the
noise standards for new uses affected by stationary noise sources.

 3. Outdoor activity areas of transient lodging facilities include swimming pool and picnic areas, and are not commonly used
     during nighttime hours.
 4. Hospitals are often noise-generating uses. The exterior noise level standards for hospitals are applicable only at clearly
     identified areas designated for outdoor relaxation by either hospital staff or patients.
 5. Only the exterior spaces of these uses designated for employee or customer relaxation have any degree of sensitivity to
     noise.
 6. The outdoor activity areas of office, commercial, and park uses are not typically utilized during nighttime hours.
 7. It may not be possible to achieve compliance with this standard at residential uses located immediately adjacent to loading
     dock areas of commercial uses while trucks are unloading. The daytime and nighttime noise level standards applicable to
     loading docks shall be 55 and 50 dB Leq, respectively.
 8. General: The Table 7.2 standards shall be reduced by 5 dB for sounds consisting primarily of speech or music, and for
     recurring impulsive sounds.
 9. If the existing ambient noise level exceeds the standards of Table 7.4, then the noise level standards shall be increased at 5
     dB increments to encompass the ambient.
NOISE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS
During initial review of development proposals, it may be determined that noise levels have the
potential to exceed City noise standards if the project were implemented. In such cases, the
City will require that a noise analysis be prepared to further evaluate the extent to which
mitigation would be required if the project were approved. This measure includes projects
proposed within the CLUP noise contours shown in Figure 7.1. Table 7.5 outlines the City’s
requirements for the preparation of a noise analysis. These analyses will be the responsibility of
the project applicant.

                                  REQUIREMENTS FOR ACOUSTICAL ANALYSIS
 An acoustical analysis prepared pursuant to the Noise Element shall:
   1. Be the responsibility of the applicant.
   2. Be prepared by qualified professionals experienced in the fields of environmental noise
        assessment.
   3. Carry out a scope of work that has been previously approved by City Planning and Engineering
        staff.
   4. Include representative noise level measurements with sufficient sampling periods and locations to
        adequately describe local conditions.
   5. Estimate existing and projected (cumulative) noise levels according to the standards provided in
        Table 7.3 and Table 7.4 and assess these noise levels’ consistency with the adopted policies of
        the Noise Element.
   6. Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with the adopted policies and
        standards of the Noise Element. Where the noise source in question consists of intermittent
        single events, the report must address the effects of maximum noise levels in sleeping rooms and
        evaluate possible sleep disturbance.
   7. Estimate interior and exterior noise exposure after the prescribed mitigation has been
        implemented.
   8. Provide a post-project assessment program that could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the
        proposed mitigation.
7.4      GOALS, POLICIES, AND IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
MOBILE AND STATIONARY NOISE SOURCES
Goal N – 1:
To protect noise-sensitive land uses from new noise-generating uses that would be
incompatible with such sensitive receptors.
Policy N-1.1:
The City shall implement the noise standards in Table 7.3 above for new uses affected by traffic
and airport (mobile) noise and in Table 7.4 above for new uses affected by non-transportation
(stationary) noise sources.
         Implementing Action N – 1.1.a: Development Review
         The City will implement its development review process in accordance with the
         requirements contained in documents such as, but not limited to, the City of Colusa
         Zoning Ordinance, the Uniform Building Code (UBC), State Noise Insulation Standards
         (Title 24), Specific Plans, the City’s design guidelines, the California Environmental Quality
         Act (CEQA), and Colusa County environmental health regulations.
         Because noise considerations are an integral part of the community planning and design
         process, the City will require noise information from the project applicant to adequately
         evaluate the effects of project noise on the community. Conditions of approval will be

        developed, along with environmental mitigation measures, to ensure that the goals and
        policies of this Noise Element are met. For projects that are subject to design review, this
        process will be used to determine ways in which project design may reduce noise to
        acceptable levels: site planning, traffic planning, architectural layout, construction
        modifications, landscaped berms and, as a last resort, sound wall barriers.
        Implementing Action N – 1.1.b: Noise Performance Standards
        The noise performance standards shown in Table 7.3 and Table 7.4 of this Noise Element
        will be adopted with the General Plan update. The City will apply these standards to the
        review of new development of noise-sensitive uses exposed to existing fixed noise
        sources. These standards will also be used to evaluate the potential impacts of proposed
        new fixed noise sources in proximity to existing noise-sensitive land uses. Where a noise
        sensitive land use is proposed near a fixed noise source, such as an industrial facility or
        the airport, noise measurements will be performed to determine whether existing and/or
        future noise levels from that source will exceed the City’s noise performance standards at
        the property line of the proposed use. Similarly, where a fixed noise-producing use such
        as an industrial facility, is proposed near an existing or future noise sensitive use, a noise
        analysis will be prepared to ensure that the noise produced by the proposed project will
        not exceed the City’s noise performance standards at the property line of the noise
        sensitive use. The acoustical analysis will be the responsibility of the project applicant
        and follow the guidelines in Table 7.5.
        Implementing Action N – 1.1.c: Noise Level Contour Map
        The noise level contour map shown in Figure 7.1 of this Noise Element will be adopted
        with the General Plan update. To evaluate the potential for noise conflicts associated
        with new developments and projects in the City limits around the airport, the City will
        refer to this contour map. The map shows generalized locations of noise contours
        associated with the various noise sources. The contour map can be used as a tool to
        evaluate the potential for exposure of a noise-sensitive land use to noise levels that may
        exceed the City’s noise standards. Because topography, vegetation, or intervening
        structures may significantly affect noise exposures at a particular location, the noise
        contours should be considered generalized and not site-specific.
        Implementing Action N – 1.1.d: Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan
        The City will ensure that projects located within the Area of Influence of the Colusa
        County Airport are routed to the Airport Land Use Commission for review and comment.
        Implementing Action N – 1.1.e: Ordinance and Regulations Review and Update
        The City will review and update its zoning ordinance, subdivision ordinance,
        environmental review ordinance (new), and development and site plan review
        processes to ensure compliance with the goals, policies, and standards contained in the
        Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan and California Civil Code.
Policy N-1.2:
The City shall require appropriate noise attenuation measures to be included in the project
design for proposed noise-sensitive uses in proximity to existing noise-producing uses, as needed,
and project design shall be in compliance with the noise standards in Table 7.3 and Table 7.4.

         Implementing Action N – 1.2.a: Ordinance and Regulations Review and Update
         The City will review and update its zoning ordinance, subdivision ordinance,
         environmental review ordinance (new), and development and site plan review
         processes to ensure compliance with the goals, policies, and standards contained in the
         Noise Element. The updates will reference noise standards contained in this General Plan
         and will be administered as part of the regular planning, zoning, and building permit
         application processes. The applicant will be responsible for preparing a noise analysis
         and ensuring project compliance with the standards.

8.1      INTRODUCTION
The Municipal Facilities and Services element is an optional element under State law, but is
included to address important issues related to how new development under this General Plan
will affect the City’s ability to provide adequate municipal infrastructure and services. This
Element concerns the public infrastructure and facilities that allow for the growth of the
community. Operational and programmatic issues are considered, but this chapter is primarily
concerned with the provision of capital facilities.
The facilities that are considered in this element include civic facilities such as city hall, fire and
police facilities, parks and recreational facilities, and solid waste disposal; other agencies’
facilities, including schools, the library, and the airport; and water, wastewater, and storm
drainage systems. For each of these facilities, the General Plan sets forth the goals, policies, and
implementing actions that will be required to ensure there are adequate facilities to
accommodate both new development and the existing community.
The primary tools for implementing the Municipal Facilities and Services Element are
infrastructure and facilities master plans (i.e., water, wastewater, storm drainage, parks) and the
City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP). The City of Colusa does not currently have the
master plans or a CIP in place, but will prepare them upon completion of the General Plan
update process. The master plans will comprehensively identify the City’s infrastructure and
facilities needs through buildout of the General Plan (through 2025). The CIP will also prioritize the
projects and identify timing and available funding sources.
8.2.1 SETTING — CIVIC AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES
CITY HALL
The City of Colusa was incorporated in 1868 and offers municipal services, administered from
City Hall, located at 425 Webster Street. Constructed in 1918, the Colusa City Hall was originally
used as a public school until the mid 1970s. In 1978, the City purchased the building and
renovated it to serve as the City Hall. Since that time, the building has undergone several
renovations. The existing building is in need of extensive improvements including a new roof, a
new heating and cooling system, repairs to exterior architectural features, and upgrades to
wiring and plumbing. The City has identified a need for a new Facilities Master Plan as part of
the General Plan update to determine the size of facilities needed to accommodate the
administrative functions of City Hall in the future. The following City Departments are currently
located at City Hall:
     •   Administration and Finance: The City of Colusa has a City Council/Manager form of
         government. The City Manager works directly with the City Council and is the chief
         administrator of the City. The City Manager and Finance Department are responsible for
         preparing and managing the City’s budget, and the City Manager oversees each of the
         other City departments and is responsible for personnel. This Department is also chiefly
         responsible for implementing goals and objectives established by the City Council.
     •   Public Works: Primary duties of the Public Works Department include performing
         maintenance on public parks, streets, sidewalks, storm drains, streetlights, traffic signals,
         trees, water and sewer services, garbage, and public landscaping areas. The
         Department’s main office is located at City Hall. The City’s Corporation Yard is located
         at 12th and Main Streets in downtown, and an additional equipment storage yard is
         located at 1411 Will S. Green Avenue.
City of Colusa                                                                            General Plan

8.0 MUNICIPAL FACILITIES AND SERVICES
     •   Planning Department: The Planning Department is responsible for implementing the goals
         and policies of the City of Colusa General Plan and its implementing document, the
         Zoning Ordinance. This department also provides staff to the Planning Commission.
         Planning staff is responsible for assisting persons seeking to develop property within the
         City limits and ensuring that development in the City complies with federal, state, and
         local environmental and planning regulations, including compliance with the City’s use
         permit requirements.
     •   Building Division: The Building Division is overseen by the City’s Fire Chief and provides
         plan check and building inspection services for new construction. The Building and
         Planning Department counters are located together in City Hall to facilitate the
         coordination of development projects in the City.
     •   Recreation Department: The Recreation Department’s primary duties include managing
         the City’s parks and recreation programs. The Department is also responsible for
         planning, acquisition, and development of new facilities and programs and assisting
         community organizations in planning their activities. (Note: Please refer to the Parks,
         Recreation and Resource Conservation Element for a full policy discussion of parks and
         recreation.)
PUBLIC WORKS MAINTENANCE/CORPORATION YARD
The Public Works Maintenance/ Corporation Yard is located at the corner of 12th and Main
Streets. The maintenance building at the yard houses the Public Works Streets/Solid Waste
Division Superintendent’s office, maintenance facilities, and the staff meeting/break room. The
yard also serves to store vehicles, garbage trucks, and equipment used to maintain the City’s
parks and streets. The yard’s facilities are very old and the site is over capacity. The City is
considering relocating the yard to the larger storage property located on Will S. Green Avenue.
POLICE STATION
The City of Colusa Police Department provides police protection services within the City limits.
The police station is located at 260 6th Street in the historic Carnegie Library Building. This two-
story 3,600 square foot building was constructed in 1906 and is listed on the National Register of
Historic Places. The station’s location, across the street from the Colusa County Courthouse and
the District Attorney and Probation Offices, is considered ideal by the department. Currently,
the department’s office and equipment storage uses have maximized the building’s capacity.
The department currently has nine (9) staff and seven (7) vehicles. Due to the building’s
designation as a historic building, however, expansion is neither feasible nor desirable.
The department anticipates a need for additional staff, vehicles, and equipment to meet
increasing policing needs due to population growth, particularly the significant growth
anticipated with this General Plan update. The department is currently investigating potential
sites for a new Police Station, although funding has not been identified. A location near the
existing site would be ideal for the department. (Note: a detailed discussion of the City’s
emergency response procedures, law enforcement personnel, and standards is included in the
Safety Element.)
FIRE STATION AND EQUIPMENT
The City of Colusa Fire Department provides firefighting services within the incorporated area of
the City of Colusa. The Fire Department operates one fire station which is located at 750 Market
General Plan                                                                            City of Colusa

Street. The current fire station is aged and in need of repairs and renovations. The Fire
Department currently lacks the necessary funding to accomplish these improvements.
Additionally, it is unlikely that the existing facility will be able to house additional equipment
necessary to serve proposed developments, as the station has reached its capacity for
Department staff and equipment.
Firefighting equipment consists of three (3) engine pumpers (two (2) with a capacity of 1,250
gallons per minute [gpm] and one (1) with a capacity of 1,000 gpm), one (1) ladder truck with a
1,500-gpm capacity and 500-gallon water tank, and two (2) grass rigs with a 300-gpm capacities
and 500-gallon tank. One (1) ambulance is housed for emergency backup situations only, and
is dispatched when the department receives calls for service. (Note: A detailed discussion of the
City’s emergency response procedures, fire-fighting personnel, and standards is included in
Chapter 5, Safety Element.)
SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL
Currently, the City provides solid waste disposal services to City residents and businesses. Waste is
collected and transported in compliance with County and State regulations governing solid
waste disposal to the Ostrom Road Landfill in Yuba County.
The City currently uses one (1) truck called the EVO that provides residential pickup service.
Residential services include two separate weekly pickups—a pickup of one (1) 90-gallon green
waste container and pickup of one (1) 30-, 60-, or 90- gallon household waste container. One
large transport truck is used to convey waste from the EVO and commercial bins to Ostrom
Road Landfill, located south of Marysville near Beale Air Force Base. According to the Public
Works Department, the transport truck is approximately three (3) years old; the Department is
also in need of a new EVO.
8.2.2 OUTLOOK—CIVIC AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES
CITY HALL
The historic City Hall building is in need of substantial structural repair and upgrade if it is to
continue to serve as the center for administration, planning and building, public works, and
recreation services for Colusa. As the City’s population grows, it is anticipated that the current
City Hall will not be large enough to accommodate increasing demand for municipal services.
The City requires additional office space and facilities replacement of aging City Council
Chambers and expanded meeting rooms. The auditorium theater at City Hall is also in need of
repairs and upgrades to its lighting and sound systems.
Alternative locations for City Hall are being considered, including the vision for a larger and
combined City Hall and Community Center. The old high school site, located on 10th and
Fremont Streets has the potential to meet this need. The ground floor of this building currently
houses the Colusa Unified School District offices; the District also rents out space to the County
Office of Education for use as a community theatre and special education classrooms. The
second story of this building has not been maintained but has the potential for renovation and
expansion.       The advantage of this site is its location across the street from the existing
community pool and Senior Center (in the Old Boy Scout Cabin). If City Hall were relocated to a
larger facility, the existing City Hall could be renovated and provide other uses (e.g., senior
housing, new school district facilities, etc.).

8.0 MUNICIPAL FACILITIES AND SERVICES
PUBLIC WORKS MAINTENANCE/CORPORATION YARD
To meet the anticipated increase in demand for solid waste services, the Public Works
Department is considering relocation of the aging maintenance/corporation Yard on 12th and
Main Streets to an area with larger facilities. The new location would allow the Public Works
Department to upgrade and expand its office space, repair facilities, storage, and employee
Facilities. Such an expansion could be provided at the City’s supply yard, located at Will S.
Green and Colus Avenues, which is owned by the City. Partial funding of this expansion could
come from sale of the maintenance/corporation yard and development impact fees.
POLICE STATION
The existing police station and present Police Department staff and equipment levels are
inadequate to serve additional growth in the City. The department’s station is currently at
capacity, with 10 personnel occupying the historic Carnegie Library building downtown. The first
story of this two-story building is used for equipment and evidence storage; the second story
houses the department offices and dispatchers. Planning for new police facilities, staff, and
equipment is in its early phases. The department considers its current location near the courts to
be ideal. As of the writing of this General Plan Update, a potential location for a new police
station has not been identified.
In addition to existing facilities, a new police station at least twice the size of the existing station
would be required to serve the existing City and new growth identified in the General Plan. In
the past, consideration has been given to the possibility of a joint fire and police facility, but no
location of suitable size has been identified in the downtown. The California Police Chiefs’
Association suggests a ratio of 2.5 officers per 1,000 residents as optimal for communities in
California. At buildout, population growth in the City identified in the General Plan is expected
to require facilities that will accommodate between 15 and 25 additional officers, as well as
additional vehicles and equipment.
FIRE STATION AND EQUIPMENT
At its present staffing, equipment, and facility levels, the Fire Department could not provide
services to new growth areas. The existing fire station is an aged facility in need of repair. In
order to house the additional firefighting personnel, fire engines, and associated equipment
needed to serve new growth identified in the General Plan and, at the same time, maintain
current response times, construction of three (3) new fire stations would be required in the
proposed new development in areas east, west, and south of downtown Colusa. In addition,
repairs to the existing facility would be required.
One potential site for a fire station has been identified south of Colusa High School in the
Brookins Ranch development area. Sites for new stations would also need to be identified in
new growth areas east of downtown Colusa between Bridge Street and the Sacramento River,
and west of Highway 20 across from the Colusa County Fairgrounds. These new fire stations
would be essential in maintaining acceptable response times and ISO ratings in the new
development areas. The Fire Department estimates that the cost for each new facility would be
approximately $1.1 million. In addition, there would be costs for salaries for 35 full-time
firefighting personnel, a fleet of 12 fire-fighting vehicles, and associated administration, training,
and equipment expenses.

SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL
Solid waste disposal services will continue to be provided by the City of Colusa and hauled to
the Ostrom Road Landfill in Yuba County. Future development with this General Plan would not
affect the City’s ability to provide solid was disposal services. (Note: Recycling and reduction of
solid waste stream are discussed in the, Parks, Recreation and Resource Conservation Element.)
8.2.3 GOALS, POLICIES          AND    IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES        FOR   CIVIC  AND   COMMUNITY
         FACILITIES
Goal MFS – 1:
To provide civic, community, and maintenance facilities for both new development and
existing residents and businesses at a level that will maintain and improve the standard
of living for the entire community.
Policy MFS-1.1:
The City shall ensure that new development does not exceed the capacity of the City to
provide adequate municipal facilities and does not disproportionately impact the capacity of
existing service levels. New growth shall pay its fair-share cost of facilities and services without
creating an additional burden to existing residents.
         Implementing Action MFS-1.1.a: Capital Improvement Program
         The City of Colusa will establish a Capital Improvement Program (CIP), which will guide
         the development of municipal facilities and infrastructure improvements over a five-year
         period. The program, which is to be updated on an annual or biannual basis, schedules
         by fiscal year the proposed capital construction phases and related expenditure and
         financing needs expected to occur during the five-year period. The Program will identify
         priorities, funding sources, and timing for design, construction, and operation, to be
         developed in conjunction with the City’s budget.
         Implementing Action MFS-1.1.b: Development Impact Fees
         The City will update its Development Impact Fee Program. As new development occurs,
         projects will be charged their fair-share of development impact fees to offset the cost of
         needed improvements to the City’s municipal facilities. The City will review and update
         the development impact fee schedule on an annual basis.
         Implementing Action MFS-1.1.c: Assembly Bill (AB) 1600 Analysis
         In accordance with Government Code §66000 et seq., as amended, the City will
         conduct a thorough analysis of the City’s development impact fee structure (commonly
         referred to as the AB 1600 Analysis) to ensure that fees are (1) adequate to fund capital
         projects and facilities, (2) based on expansion or provision of new facilities required by
         growth, and (3) meet all requirements of State law. The AB 1600 analysis will be initiated
         at the same time as the first Capital Improvement Program, and fees will be adjusted
         annually to keep up with inflation and construction costs. The project applicant will be
         responsible for the cost of this analysis. The City may require a particular project to fund
         the master study, with reimbursement to be made for areas not affected by the
City of Colusa                                                                            General Plan

        particular project through credits against developer fees when building permits are
        issued. Until the AB 1600 city-wide master analysis is completed, the share of facilities
        costs and impacts on the community should be determined on a project-by-project
        basis.
Policy MFS-1.2:
The City shall assess the central staffing and facility needs for administrative and community
functions; facilitate coordination of operation between City departments; and emphasize
efficiency through centralization as a “one-stop shop” for public services wherever possible. The
plan will provide for municipal buildings, facilities and equipment needed to provide essential
City services.
        Implementing Action MFS-1.2.a: Civic Facilities Master Plan
        The City will prepare a Civic Facilities Master Plan for City administrative and service
        facilities, including the selection of a specific site(s) for future expansion. Financing
        mechanisms for capital improvements will be identified in through the Civic Facilities
        Master Plan.
Goal MFS – 2:
To provide and maintain acceptable police protection facilities.
Policy MFS-2.1:
The City shall maintain acceptable law enforcement services for City residents and businesses
through the provision of adequate facilities and equipment.
        Implementing Action MFS-2.1.a: Monitor Facilities and Equipment Needs
        The City will review the Police Department’s facility needs annually, concurrent with the
        City budget process, to address facility deficiencies and maintenance issues. The City
        will also review the Department’s equipment needs to ensure the Department maintains
        up-to-date equipment and vehicles that will enable the Department to continue to
        provide excellent law enforcement services to the community. Additionally, the City will
        consult with the Police Department when development applications are received to
        determine the degree of impacts on the Department and to establish appropriate
        mitigation measures.
Policy MFS-2.2:

8.3.1 SETTING—FACILITIES PROVIDED BY OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES
SCHOOLS
The discussion of schools includes public education facilities and future expansion of these
facilities to address student population growth in grades K-12. Considerations include the size
and number of facilities; potential joint-use opportunities and funding of commonly-used
facilities such as athletic fields and libraries; and adequate funding for construction and
maintenance of school facilities in response to anticipated growth.
The Colusa Unified School District serves the residents of the City of Colusa and surrounding
unincorporated residential areas, providing education services for children in grades K-12. The
District operates five schools: Burchfield Primary School, Egling Middle School, Colusa High
School, Colusa Alternative Home School, and Colusa Alternative High School. Our Lady of
Lourdes, a private school, provides K-8 education for Colusa residents, as well. Enrollment for all
schools is summarized in Table 8.1

Presently, the School District is experiencing a decline in student enrollment. However, despite
this trend, the District is currently using portable classrooms. Burchfield Elementary School
provides education services to kindergarten through third grade students. As required by the
state, the school currently operates under a student to teacher ratio of 20:1. This facility currently
utilizes eleven portable classrooms and operates three lunch schedules to accommodate its
enrollment. Future growth in the City of Colusa will likely require expansion of elementary school
facilities.
Egling Middle School provides education services to fourth through eighth grade students.
Egling Middle School is a 23-classroom facility, of which eight classrooms are portables. Three of
the eight portables are used for special education purposes. The Colusa Unified School District
has completed an architectural study that indicates two additional portable classrooms can be
placed on the Egling Middle School campus. When these two classrooms are located at the
school, an additional portable restroom must also be provided.
Students in the ninth through twelfth grades attend Colusa High School, which has a capacity of
approximately 500 students. Currently, Colusa High School has an enrollment of 358 students. At
30 students per teacher, its student-to-teacher ratio is slightly greater than the typical State
“loading” of 25-27 students per classroom). However, Colusa High School could experience a
rapid increase in enrollment over the next several years, if proposed residential developments
were approved and constructed. Colusa Alternative High School is housed in two portable
classrooms on the high school campus. The District’s master plan is being prepared and will
identify additional sites if needed for expansion due to student population growth.
California State law allows the school district to levy fees on new residential and commercial
development. The development fee is intended to provide funds for capital development of
school facilities to mitigate the impact of residential and commercial development upon school
facilitates. The district is presently charging the minimum fee allowed, and has historically used
these fees to lease portables and currently uses the fees to construct new classrooms when the
need presents itself. The City requires developers to mitigate impacts on schools as a condition
of project approval.

8.0 MUNICIPAL FACILITIES AND SERVICES
In addition to public schools, there is one private Catholic school (Our Lady of Lourdes) located
in Colusa, which serves children in grades K-8. Enrollment is approximately 106 students.
LIBRARY
The Colusa County Library operates one of its seven branches in the City of Colusa, located at
738 Market Street. The 10,000 square foot library, which began service in 1928, is in a building
shared with the Colusa Unified School District offices. The current facility was built in 1965 and,
according to the Colusa County librarian, was given to the County by the City of Colusa with the
provision that it continues its present use as a library. The Morse Room operates at maximum
capacity as a community meeting room.
The Colusa branch library is open Monday through Wednesday, 11:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m, and
Thursdays from 11:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. Since the facility is open only one weekday evening
and closed on weekends, public access to library services is very limited. The library has 6 full-
time staff, 3 part-time staff, and is largely dependent upon its volunteer staff to maintain
operations.
This facility serves as more than a public library to the community—it houses local genealogical
data, local newspapers and the County’s historic records. Its close proximity to downtown
services and public gathering places makes it a desirable location for the library. The library also
provides mobile literacy services—the Imagibus, which is funded in part by “First Five” funds,
travels throughout the community to daycare centers, and other places that serve small
children, providing books and story-telling activities.
AIRPORT
The Colusa County Airport, which is owned and operated by Colusa County, is located south of
the City of Colusa, west of SR 20/45. New infrastructure and building sites for businesses have
recently been added, so the facility is considered both a public asset and an economic
development opportunity. The County Airport has one 60-foot by 3,000-foot asphalt concrete
and concrete surfaced runway, 22 T-hangers, two conventional hangers, one maintenance
building, and 24-hour refueling facilities. The airport serves both general and agricultural
aviation. Recent upgrades at the Airport include an overlay of the runway and taxiways, slurry
and repainting of the runway and taxiways, and upgrades to the drainage system and shoulders
of the runways and taxiways. Two “fixed base operators” (FBOs) are located onsite, including
the County of Colusa, which provides fuel, and Valley Air, which operates crop dusters. There
are approximately 31 aircraft onsite. One hanger provides offices, but they are currently
vacant. (Note: a detailed discussion of the Airport facilities and operations is included in the
Circulation Element.)
8.3.2 OUTLOOK—FACILITIES PROVIDED BY OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES
SCHOOLS
Colusa Unified School District’s Facilities Master Plan projects the need for two additional schools
as population increases. The plan indicates that the school locations will be determined based
upon development patterns. The City will continue to collaborate with the Colusa Unified School
District and incorporate the School Facilities Master Plan in planning for quality school sites and
facilities for Colusa’s K-12 youth. The district will be updating the School Facilities Master Plan
during the upcoming 2007-08 school year.
General Plan                                                                            City of Colusa

LIBRARY
The City recognizes that reading and literacy skills are fundamental to success in the
community’s economic and social well-being. Public libraries will remain a key educational
resource for Colusa residents. As new development occurs under the proposed General Plan, it
is anticipated that a significant increase in demand for library facilities and services will occur
with the new residents. Needed improvements to the Colusa County library include: expanded
facilities; building renovations, including front access which meets Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) requirements; updated equipment (e.g., computers, internet access); expanded hours of
operation; additional parking; and an improved literacy component.
Another essential need is the protection of books and archival documents from potential
flooding, fire, windstorm or other catastrophic event that could destroy them. These require
storage in an environmentally controlled space. Construction of such protected space would
provide the opportunity for a single building to serve as a joint archival library facility, preserving
documents for both the City and the County.
This could be accomplished in the short term by expansion into the other half of the Market
Street building, which will be vacated by CUSD offices since they plan to relocate to a larger
facility. Long-range plans could include incorporation of a new library facility into the City’s
plans for a new community center or occupying other City facilities in the historic downtown
that are vacated as a result of relocation and expansion. California Senate Bill (SB) 156, which
is still in the legislature, is a potential bond issue that could be on November 2008 ballot
authorizing $4 billion to provide funding for library renovations. This competitive funding source
could possibly assist with improvements to Colusa County Library. Other funding sources could
include developer impact fees to assist with capital improvements as demand increases for
library services due to residential growth.
AIRPORT
The Colusa County Airport is expected to continue offering services to small airplanes and
commercial crop dusters. The County recently invested substantial funds to upgrade various
aspects of the Airport, and such investment and support is likely to continue in the future. The
Airport is conveniently located next to the City of Colusa and will serve as a future economic
benefit as the City and County experience continued business and population growth. (Note: a
detailed discussion of the Airport facilities and operations is included in the Circulation Element.)

         Implementing Action MFS-5.2.a: Joint-Use Facilities Study
         The City will explore opportunities with the Colusa Unified School District for the creation
         of joint-use facilities that may accommodate other City and County programs and
         services. For example, the City may coordinate with the school district in planning for
         parks and recreation facilities and other facilities that maximize community use
         opportunities. This effort will include a joint-use study for all school sites, starting with
         existing sites and continuing with new sites as they are proposed and developed. The
         study will establish the feasibility of pursuing joint-use agreements between the Colusa
         Unified School District and the City. This study will also identify opportunities to maximize
         public use of school facilities and minimize duplication of services.
8.4.1 SETTING—FACILITIES SUPPLIED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR
ELECTRIC, GAS, AND COMMUNICATION UTILITIES
Electricity and natural gas in Colusa are provided by Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E).
PG&E maintains a facility at the corner of 2nd and Main Streets that is used by the company as a
service center for gas and electric work crews, a substation, and as a pole yard.
Comcast Cable provides basic and digital cable television service as well as cable internet to
customers in the City of Colusa. Frontier Communications provides telephone and internet
services. Both cable television and telephone services are available to all residents and
businesses within the planning area.
8.4.2 OUTLOOK—FACILITIES SUPPLIED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR
ELECTRIC, GAS, AND COMMUNICATION UTILITIES
As a private business, PG&E will continue to provide electrical and natural gas services to the
City of Colusa. With the City approaching buildout of the current City limits, PG&E does not
anticipate difficulties in maintaining this service in the future, or extending new services to new
development in the Planning Area as it occurs.
The City and County are likely to experience dramatic increases in the demand for
telecommunication products and services in the next decade as the City grows and new
residents “telecommute” to work and “teleshop” for goods and services. It is anticipated that
Frontier Communications will continue to provide local telephone and internet service to the
City, while cable television and cable internet service will continue through Comcast Cable

8.5.1 SETTING—MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE
WATER SYSTEM
The City of Colusa provides potable water for residential, commercial and industrial uses within
the City limits. It also provides water to the following areas outside the City limits: the Walnut
Ranch development, the Lurline area, the area east of Bridge Street, and restrooms at Moon
Bend Road. The City receives its municipal water from deep wells that tap aquifers within
underground geological formations. Land uses in the unincorporated portion of the Planning
Area not served by City water rely on individual wells for their water supply.
The City of Colusa is within the Colusa Subbasin of the Sacramento Valley Groundwater Basin.
The Colusa Subbasin aquifer system comprises continental deposits of late Tertiary to Quaternary
age. A review of hydrographs of spring-spring groundwater levels indicated a slight decline in
levels associated with 1976-77 and 1987-94 droughts, followed by recovery to pre-drought
conditions.     Generally, groundwater levels have an average seasonal fluctuation of
approximately five feet for normal and dry years. Overall, there appears to be no increasing or
decreasing trends in groundwater levels (Colusa LAFCO, 2005).
Within the City limits, the City of Colusa administers a domestic water delivery system, operated
by the Public Works Department. Figure 8-1 presents a general map of the City’s water system.
All water used by the City comes from five wells. The depth of these wells exceeds 200 feet
below ground surface, and each well is encased with a deep-water sanitary seal for a minimum
of 50 feet to prevent infiltration. In 2003, the five wells had a maximum day production of
approximately 3.17 million gallons. The annual total for all five wells was approximately 552.3

million gallons. The wells pump between 1,000 and 1,330 gallons per minute (gpm) with one 225-
kW diesel generator. The average dry weather pumping is between approximately 1.5 and 2.0
million gallons per day (mgd), with a peak of 3.0 mgd (Colusa LAFCO, 2005).
As of 2003, there were 1,997 active water service connections within the City. Of these
connections, 1,796 were for general and residential customers, 196 were for commercial
customers, and the remainder included industrial and agricultural users. A standard residential
connection is ⅝-inch or ¾-inch. The City meters all water connections (Colusa LAFCO, 2005).
Water lines in the older sections of the City vary in size from 4 to 8 inches in diameter. In a few
cases, water lines may have a smaller diameter than 4 inches. Much of the newer lines in the
developing southern section of the City are 8-inch, 10-inch and 12-inch ductile iron pipe. Water
is stored in two large elevated storage tanks, for pressure purposes. Combined, the two tanks
have a 250,000-gallon storage capacity (Colusa LAFCO, 2005).
Based on its annual report to the Department of Health Services, the City appears to provide an
adequate level of service to its customers. Water provided by the City’s system is of generally
good quality, with only elevated levels of manganese and iron noted at three of the City’s wells.
The most prevalent problems encountered in 2003 were service connection leakages and
complaints about dirty water and iron and manganese levels. In 2003, ten water system
problems were reported. Of these, eight were service connection breaks/leaks, one was a main
break/leak, and one was a “positive bacteriological incident of treated water.” In addition,
there were a total of 73 complaints reported and investigated, mostly dealing with meter leaks
and taste/odor/color of water. None of these complaints were reported to the Department of
Health Services (Colusa LAFCO, 2005).
Two activities within the City of Colusa utilize recycled water – a car wash and a car dealership.
However, the City is not involved in any type of “gray water” reuse or other water recycling
projects at this time.
WASTEWATER SYSTEM
The City currently has one wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) with a permitted capacity of 0.9
million gallons per day (mgd) on the average dry weather flow (ADWF) basis; the current flow is
approximately 0.5 mgd (ADWF). The facility does not comply with current water quality
discharge requirements and requires upgrading of its treatment process. In addition, the WWTP
does not have the design capacity to serve buildout of the proposed General Plan.
Within the City of Colusa, sewage is conveyed mostly through a series of 6-, 8-, 10-, 12- and 15-
inch clay pipes in City streets, leading toward a series of pump stations located throughout the
City. The City’s WWTP includes a pond system that supports a low-rate biological process that
produces an effluent that is considered equivalent to secondary effluent from conventional
mechanical process. The WWTP uses chlorine to remove pathogenic bacteria to safe levels and
to disinfect wastewater. Figure 8-2 provides a general map of the wastewater system.

There are two drainage sheds within the City of Colusa: the west shed (Area 1) and east shed
(Area 2), as illustrated in Figure 8-3. The dividing line between the two areas splits the city east
and west generally beginning at the Sacramento River at 6th Street running south to Sioc Street
at 3rd Street, and continuing south to the intersect with Wescott Road. Historically, the east
downtown shed, Area 2A, has been the subject of numerous studies due to extensive and
repeated flooding. Several studies have been prepared in 1974, 1986, and 1991, identifying
possible drainage solutions, but none of the solutions have been completely implemented.
Both drainage sheds consist primarily of surface drainage systems conveying stormwater by
means of guttered flow lines that traverse under intersections and driveways via under-roadway
culverts. The west downtown stormwater enters into underground piping in 10th Street and in
Fremont Street. There are two pipelines (24 inches and 54 inches in diameter) that convey the
stormwater to a lift station on the southwest corner of Colusa High School. The stormwater is
lifted to a 60-inch pipeline that opens to the main westerly drainage ditch that conducts the
stormwater southwest to the Colusa Basin/Powell Slough. Area 1C, as illustrated, also conveys
that development’s stormwater to the west lift station. The remaining portion of Area 1,
including 1B, 1D, 1E, and land west of Wescott Road drain through pipes and natural ditches to
the West Ditch as indicated in Figure 8-3.
The east downtown stormwater is collected by drainage piping and conveyed south and east
to Bridge Street, where it is transported south along Bridge Street. The stormwater is then
released into a drainage ditch at the wye of Highway 20/45 and Wescott Road, where it
continues south along 20/45. The water is then transported across Highway 20/45 through a
ditch that crosses under the road via culverts and drainage piping to the drainage channel
(ditch) that flows through the golf course and southeast through the Colusa Industrial Park (CIP)
property. The water eventually turns west to empty into the Colusa Basin/Powell Slough.
The stormwater drainage system is constructed of approximately 35,000 linear feet of
underground piping ranging is size from 15 to 60 inches in diameter. Three (3) small lift stations
within Areas 2B, 2C, and 2D assist in conveying drainage from other localized areas and from
detention ponds for subdivisions that lift stormwater to gravity pipe systems. These gravity pipe
systems ultimately release into the natural drainage channel flowing through the golf course and
southeast through the CIP property. All other portions of Area 2 east of Wescott Road drain
through pipes and the drainage channel (ditch) that flows through the golf course and
southeast through the CIP property.
The County of Colusa completed a Phase I levee project in 2001 referred to as the Powell Slough
Levee Project. The Phase I levee alleviated flooding to businesses and rural residences on the
west side of Colusa. The southwestern area of the City, including land in its sphere of influence, is
still subject to backwater flooding during 10- to 100-year storm events. Another County-
proposed flood control project designed in 2003, Powell Slough Levee Phase II, would address
the backwater flooding. Construction of this project has not been actively adopted by the
County nor any other agency, and as of the writing of this General Plan Update, no initiatives
are in place to complete the project.

8.5.2 OUTLOOK—MUNICIPAL INFRASTRUCTURE
WATER SYSTEM
It is anticipated that the City’s wells will
continue to produce approximately 3.17
million gallons per day, which currently
serves a population of approximately 5,600
people. Currently, the City’s groundwater
wells produce an adequate supply of
potable water for Colusa residents. While
peak demand is currently less than peak
supply, demand will grow as the City’s
population grows with new residential
development.       In order to serve future
growth and buildout of the General Plan,
new water distribution conveyance and
pumping facilities will need to be
constructed.
WASTEWATER SYSTEM
The City’s wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and collection capacity must be improved to
support community development and economic expansion. In addition, because the WWTP’s
current secondary treatment process with effluent disposal to the Powell Slough does not meet
recently-imposed state regulations and Clean Water Act standards, the City is currently
upgrading the WWTP with new treatment facilities that will provide a tertiary treatment level to a
permitted capacity of 0.7 mgd by August 2008. To address future development beyond the
proposed 0.7 mgd permitted capacity and to serve the General Plan Build out, future
expansions of the WWTP will be required. Future expansions will be identified through updates of
the City’s Wastewater Facilities Plan.
STORM DRAINAGE SYSTEM
Buildout of the General Plan will substantially increase the amount of storm water runoff and the
need for improvements to the City’s storm water drainage system. The City will prepare for this
through master planning efforts along with site-specific planning to adequately accommodate
the additional storm water runoff. A Storm Water Facilities Master Plan will be prepared that will
comprehensively address the facilities needs and phasing of as new development occurs.
One of the primary goals is to take all parts of the future City limits out of the floodplain. This, too,
will be addressed in the Storm Water Facilities Master Plan to ensure that all existing and future
land uses will be protected from flooding within the City’s sphere of influence.

         Plan and all applicable policies and regulations. As part of the development review
         process, the City will also consider the cost of service delivery and fiscal impacts of both
         private development projects and public projects pursuant to the California
         Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
         Implementing Action MFS-7.1.c: Water Master Plan
         The City will prepare and implement a Water Master Plan to provide a framework for
         timed capital improvements and facility expansion projects. The plan will aid the City in
         identifying and establishing funding sources beyond monthly service charges to finance
         improvements related to water quality, supply, recycling, distribution, conservation, and
         other issue areas identified issue areas identified by the City and the plan. The plan will
         evaluate the depth, size, recharge rate, and capacity of the aquifer to accommodate
         the City’s projected future growth. The plan will also make determinations regarding the
         need to develop additional water sources during the planning period of this General
         Plan.
         Implementing Action MFS-7.1.d: Development Impact Fees (see Implementing Action
         MFS-1.1.b, above).
Policy MFS-7.2:
To minimize the need for the development of new water sources and facilities and to minimize
sewer treatment needs, the City shall promote water conservation in City operations and in
private development. The City shall annually monitor water usage to assess the effectiveness of
the water conservation program.
         Implementing Action MFS-7.2.a: Water Master Plan

WASTEWATER SYSTEM
Goal MFS – 8:
To provide adequate wastewater services to all existing and future development.
Policy MFS-8.1:
The City shall expand its wastewater treatment plant in phases to adequately accommodate
projected new growth estimated through the end of the planning period of this General Plan
(2025).
         Implementing Action MFS-8.1.a: Wastewater Master Plan
         The City will prepare and implement a Wastewater Master Plan to provide the framework
         for timed capital improvements and facility expansion projects, and to identify funding
         sources beyond monthly service charges to finance improvements related to
         wastewater capacity, flow, treatment plant expansion and upgrades, reclamation, and
         any other issue areas identified by the City. Furthermore, the City will construct
         improvements and upgrades to the Wastewater Treatment Plant as needed to
         accommodate existing customers and any approved development.
         Implementing Action MFS-8.1.b: Development Agreements
         The City will use development agreements for larger projects to provide for specific
         mechanisms and financing of infrastructure and facilities, as appropriate. The City will
         ensure that both new agreements and amendments to previous agreements are
         consistent with City policies and standards, as well as the particular needs of the projects
         that are the subject of the agreements.
         Implementing Action MFS-8.1.c: Capital Improvement Program (see Implementing Action
         MFS-1.1.a)
         Implementing Action MFS-8.1.d: Interagency coordination
         The City will coordinate wastewater services with all applicable agencies. Coordination
         will allow expansion to occur in the timeliest and most efficient and cost-effective way
         possible, thereby avoiding any unnecessary delay in the development entitlement
         process.
Policy MFS-8.2:
The City shall ensure adequate and timely provision of wastewater collection and treatment to
all City residents and businesses.
         Implementing Action MFS-8.2.a: Development Review
         The City will use the development entitlement review process to ensure the adequacy of
         wastewater infrastructure in new developments, and will require consistency with the
         General Plan and all applicable policies and regulations. As part of the development
         review process, the City will also consider the cost of service delivery and fiscal impacts
