Introduction
1. Community Description
The City of Del Mar is a small, residential community located on the Pacific Coast, west of
Interstate 5 and approximately 20 miles north of downtown San Diego. According to the 2010
Census, Del Mar is the smallest incorporated jurisdiction in San Diego County with a population
of 4,161 and an area of roughly two and a half square miles.
The development pattern found in the City today began in the early 1900s when the South
Coast Land Company bought the majority of the land that comprises Del Mar and proceeded
to create a residential community “of distinctive class.” Strict building standards were enforced.
Lots in the City’s hillside areas were divided in irregular shapes to assure individuality and scenic
views while lots along the shoreline were divided into a more traditional grid pattern.
Today, Del Mar continues to be characterized by its high-quality residential neighborhoods, as
well as its small-village downtown. Visitors are attracted to the City’s coastal location, its
agreeable climate and small-village atmosphere. The 22nd District Agricultural Association,
located in the north eastern portion of the City, is home to the Del Mar Racetrack and
Fairgrounds and where numerous other regional events are held. They draw a large number of
tourists who contribute to many of the retail and service industries that provide employment
opportunities in the City.
The majority (70 percent) of the City’s existing housing stock consists of single-family units, with
the remainder comprised of multi-family projects of varying sizes. There are no mobile homes in
the City. Since the City is virtually built-out, only a limited amount of land remains for future
residential development. Land costs for single-family lots in the City generally exceed $1 million
per lot. In 2010, the median price for a single-family home in Del Mar was approximately
$1,055,000. In that year, average rents in the City ranged from $1,400 for a studio unit to $2,500
for a three-bedroom unit.
The City is long and narrow in shape, bordering approximately 2.5 miles of the coast, and
extending inland less than one mile at its widest point. Along the coast, the land rises abruptly
from the sandy beaches to cliffs reaching 75 feet in height. The cliffs have been eroded by
drainage from the San Dieguito River (to the north) and Los Penasquitos Creek (to the south),
creating small canyons extending into the hillsides. Crest Canyon extends south from the San
Dieguito Lagoon and forms much of the eastern boundary of the City. Much of the northern
portion of the City lies within the floodplain of the San Dieguito River. The City is vigilant in its
protection of natural resources, environmental protection for the cliffs, canyons, and wetlands.
This presents some constraints on the location of new development and opportunities for new
subdivisions.

2. State Policy and Authorization
The California State Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and suitable
living environment for every Californian as the State’s major housing goal. Recognizing the
important role of local planning programs in the pursuit of this goal, the Legislature has
mandated that all cities and counties prepare a housing element as part of their comprehensive
General Plans (California Government Code Section 65583). In Del Mar, the General Plan is
called the Del Mar Community Plan.
In addition to the particular Government Code section cited above, other sections call for a
local jurisdiction’s zoning and density laws to be structured to ensure that any changes to zoning
or density designation result in no net loss of density or an inability to accommodate its fair share
of housing needs. The manner in which Del Mar meets this requirement is described in detail in
the Housing Resources Section of this Housing Element Update.
State Housing Element Law also requires all cities and counties to update their Housing Elements
at statutory deadlines mandated by State law. Del Mar’s Housing Element was last updated in
June of 2007 for the period of July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2010. Although the City Council
approved the document, it did not gain certification by the State Department of Housing and
Community Development. This current update covers the period of January 1, 2013 through
April 30, 2021.
Due to the combination of historic land use patterns, high land and housing costs, scarcity of
vacant land and environmental constraints, the City of Del Mar is faced with limited
opportunities for the provision of affordable housing. This Housing Element Update evaluates
housing needs in Del Mar based on its demographic and housing characteristics. The Update
also analyzes existing and potential constraints to the production of affordable housing. It
includes an inventory of resources available to accommodate the identified housing needs;
assesses the effectiveness and appropriateness of existing City housing programs; and sets forth
crafts a housing strategy to address the housing issues related to housing availability, adequacy,
and affordability.
This Housing Element Update represents a policy statement about how Del Mar will continue to
strive toward maintaining and enhancing housing opportunities while also preserving its
desirability as a place in which to live, work and play.
3. Relationship to Other Community Plan Elements
The Del Mar Community Plan (the City’s General Plan under California law) is comprised of the
following five elements: 1) Environmental Management; 2) Transportation; 3) Recreation; 4)
Community Development; and 5) Housing.
Goal 3-D of the Community Development Element of the Del Mar Community Plan cites, as an
overall objective and policy: Preserve existing and ensure adequate housing for diverse age
and socio-economic groups within the community. Other objectives and policies in the
Community Plan also call for: the protection of low- and moderate-cost housing; the facilitation
                                                                                       City of Del Mar
Page 2                                                                      2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                  144

of housing opportunities for senior citizens; and incentives to encourage the development of
lower-cost housing.
The background information and policy direction presented in one Community Plan element is
also reflected in others. For example, residential development capacities established in the
Community Development Element are incorporated within the Housing Element. This Housing
Element builds upon other Community Plan elements and is consistent with the goals and
policies set forth in that document.
Consistent with the City’s goal to encourage a wide range of housing opportunities for persons
with special needs, this Housing Element Update also includes programs to amend the Zoning
Ordinance to address the provision of homeless shelters and transitional/supportive housing, and
for accommodating housing for persons with disabilities.
Furthermore, whenever any element of the Community Plan is amended, the Housing Element
will be reviewed and modified, as necessary, to ensure the continued, internal consistency
among elements. The City recognizes the need to update its Environmental Management
Element of the Community Plan to address AB 162 requirements relating to flood hazards and
flood management.
4. Public Participation
Prior to submitting the Draft Housing Element to the State Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) for review, the City Council conducted a number of public
hearings for: review of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) figures assigned by
SANDAG; review of housing law; and an affirmation of the City’s goals in preparing a Housing
Element. The Planning Commission then conducted two meetings, one a public workshop and
the other a public hearing both for the purpose of receiving community input and making
recommendations on the draft 2013-2021 Cycle Housing Element. Following the Planning
Commission meetings, the City Council again met and directed staff to submit the revised draft
Housing Element to HCD to initiate the required review of the Draft Housing Element.
Notices of the City Council meeting and for the Planning Commission public workshop/public
hearings were posted on the City’s website, published in the local newspaper, and posted at
City Hall. Copies of the draft 2013-2021 Housing Element and associated documents were also
posted on the City’s website and hard copies were available for review at City Hall and at the
Del Mar Public Library. The posted copies of the document included updated iterations of the
Housing Element reflecting the modifications made by the Planning Commission and City
Council.
As part of the public review process, notice was sent to known housing advocacy groups,
housing developers, agencies providing supportive housing services, housing professionals, and
community stakeholders at the local and regional levels. A copy of the list of groups and
agencies to whom notice was sent is included in Appendix D.
In addition to the meetings of the Planning Commission and City Council, meetings were
conducted by a citizen’s committee appointed by the City Council to work with staff in the
preparation of the Housing Element Update, the Housing Element Advisory Committee (HEAC).
That committee included members of two local housing advocacy groups: Del Mar Community

Community Profile
This Section of the Housing Element describes and assesses the factors and characteristics that
contribute to the supply and demand for housing in Del Mar. Specifically, the assessment
addresses the community’s population, employment, economic, and household characteristics
along with an identification of special needs groups, and housing stock characteristics. This
analysis provides the basis for developing a successful housing strategy that meets the needs of
the community.
A. Population Characteristics
Understanding the characteristics of a population is vital in the process of planning for the future
needs of a community. Population characteristics affect the nature and extent of housing
demands in a community. Factors such as population growth, age composition, and
race/ethnicity can influence the type of housing needed and the ability of individuals and
families to pay housing costs. The following section describes and analyzes the various
population characteristics and trends that affect housing needs.
1. Population Growth
The 2010 Census reported that Del Mar’s population declined from 4,860 in 1990 to 4,161 in 2010
(Table 1). Despite this decline, the SANDAG 2050 Regional Growth Forecast estimates that Del
Mar’s population will once again reach 4,800 by 2020. Del Mar is the smallest incorporated
jurisdiction within San Diego County. Reflecting its location in a more built-out part of a growing
county, Del Mar is expected to experience less growth than its larger neighbors and the County
as a whole.

2. Age Characteristics
A community’s current and future housing needs are determined in part by the age
characteristics of residents. Typically, each age group has distinct lifestyles, family structures and
sizes, ability to earn incomes, and therefore, housing preferences. As people move through
each stage of life, housing needs and preferences change. Traditional assumptions are that the
young adult population (20 to 34 years old) tends to favor apartments, low to moderate cost
townhomes/condominiums, and smaller single-family units. The adult population (35 to 64 years
old) represents the primary market for moderate to relatively high cost condominiums and
single-family homes. The senior population (65 years and older) tends to generate demand for
low to moderate cost apartments, condominiums, smaller single-family homes, and senior living
facilities. In order to create a balanced and sustainable community, it is important to provide
housing options that accommodate the needs of various age groups.
Figure 1 compares changes in the age composition of Del Mar’s population from 1990 to 2010,
while Table 2 compares the percentage of individuals under 18, over 65, and the median age of
Del Mar with those of nearby communities. The population of Del Mar, with a median age of
48.6 years, is significantly older than the population of neighboring communities and that of the
County as a whole. In 2010, Del Mar’s median age was about 14 years older than the County’s
median age. The higher median age is due to the larger percentage of seniors (21 percent of
the population in 2010) and the smaller percentage of children under 18 years of age (12
percent in 2010) as compared to most other San Diego County communities. The senior
population nearly doubled as a proportion of the City’s overall population since 1990, reaching
21 percent by 2010. The proportion of senior residents in neighboring cities, however, was
noticeably lower (by two to eight percentage points depending on the jurisdiction).

3. Race/Ethnicity Characteristics
An examination of the race/ethnicity of the population is important to in analysis of housing
needs and conditions for several reasons. A community’s racial and ethnic composition may
have implications for housing needs to the extent that different groups have different household
characteristics, income levels, and cultural backgrounds that may affect their housing needs
and preferences.
In 2010, roughly 91 percent of Del Mar residents were White, less than one percent Black, four
percent Hispanic, three percent Asian, and two percent of other races. Pacific Islander and
American Indian constituted minute portions of the City population (Figure 2). Del Mar has a
significantly higher proportion of White residents and smaller proportion of residents of all other
racial/ethnic groups compared to most other jurisdictions and the County.

B. Economic Characteristics
Employment has an important impact on housing needs. Incomes associated with different job
types and the number of workers in a household determines the type and size of housing that it
can afford. In some cases, the job types can affect housing needs and demands (such as in
communities with military installations, college campuses, and large amounts of seasonal
agriculture). Employment growth typically leads to strong housing demand, while the reverse is
true when employment figures contract.
1. Employment and Wage Scale
In 2000, the largest occupational categories for City residents were professional services and
education, and health and social services occupations (Table 4). These categories accounted
for 45 percent of jobs held by Del Mar residents. In comparison, these occupations comprised
31 percent of jobs held by County residents. According to the American Community Survey
(ACS) for the period of 2006-2010, approximately 49 percent of Del Mar residents worked in
educational, health and social services occupations or professional services occupations. An
additional 24 percent of the City’s residents worked in the finance, insurance and real estate
professions.
Table 5 displays average annual wage data for occupations compiled by the California
Employment Development Department (EDD) for the San Diego Metropolitan Statistical Area in
2011. Professional and health services occupations, including managers, doctors, attorneys,
architects, and engineers were among the highest paying professions in the region. Education
and financial occupations generally offer high to moderate pay scales while the food
preparation and retail sales offer lower wages.

C. Household Characteristics
The Census defines a household as all persons who occupy a housing unit that may include
single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood and unrelated individuals
living together. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes, dormitories or other group
living situations are not considered households. Household type, size, and income levels
determine the type of housing needed by residents, their preferences, and ability to obtain
housing that meets their needs. For example, single-person households, often seniors or young
adults, tend to reside in apartment units or smaller single-family homes. Families typically prefer
and occupy single-family homes. This section details the various household characteristics that
affect housing needs.

1. Household Type and Size
According to the 2010 Census, there were 1,086,865 households in San Diego County. Of these,
2,064 households, or less than one percent, were located in Del Mar. Among the Del Mar
households, 34 percent were single-person households, and households headed by seniors (65+)
comprised 28 percent of all households.                       Single-person and senior-headed households
represented a much larger proportion of Del Mar’s total households than nearly all other area
jurisdictions and the County as a whole. Conversely, 16 percent of Del Mar households consisted
of families with children; a much smaller proportion than that found in other area jurisdictions or
countywide (Table 6).

Table 7 shows that in 2010, about half of Del Mar households consisted of families (53 percent).
Among these 1,098 family-households, 673 were married couples that do not have children (61
percent), compared to 254 married couples with children (23 percent). The greatest change
from 2000 to 2010 was the 13-percent increase in other families, followed by the 13 percent
decrease in other non-family households (such as unrelated persons living together).

Household size is a significant factor in housing demand. Often, household size can be used to
predict the unit size that a household will select for its housing. For example, smaller households
(one to four persons) traditionally can find suitable housing in smaller units (such as studios, one-
and two- bedroom units) while larger households (five or more persons) find housing units with
three or more bedrooms adequate.
Individual’s choices also reflect preference and economics. This was especially true during the
housing boom when mortgage credit was readily available and many households extended
beyond their financial means and purchased large homes. The National Association of Realtors
estimates that after the housing boom, the average size of homes will be trending downward.
However, in a community such as Del Mar, where residents generally have higher comparative
incomes, many can afford larger homes without overextending themselves financially.
In 2010, the average number of persons per household in the San Diego region ranged from 2.1
to 3.5, with a region-wide average of 2.8 persons per household. Del Mar had an average of just
2.0 persons per household, virtually no change from 2000. Table 8 compares household size in
Del Mar to household sizes in surrounding cities and the County. Household sizes varied among
the cities, with Del Mar and Solana Beach having the lowest average household size among
surrounding jurisdictions. This average household size correlates with the household type and
age of residents (mostly senior households and married couples without children).

2. Household Income
Household income is one indicator of the wealth within a community and, therefore, is directly
connected to the ability to afford housing. As household income increases, it is more likely that
the household will be a homeowner. As household income decreases, households tend to pay
a disproportionate amount of their income for housing with a related result that the number of
persons occupying unsound and overcrowded housing increases.
For planning and funding purposes, the California State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) has identified the following income categories based on the Area Median
Income (AMI) of the metropolitan area (San Diego County):
City of Del Mar
2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                    Page 13
                                                         155

        Extremely Low Income: households earning up to 30 percent of the AMI
        Very Low Income: households earning between 31 and 50 percent of the AMI
        Low Income: households earning between 51 percent and 80 percent of the AMI
        Moderate Income: households earning between 81 percent and 120 percent of the AMI
        Above Moderate Income: households earning over 120 percent of the AMI
Combined, the extremely low, very low, and low income groups are referred to as lower
income.1
Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) estimates based on 2006-2008 American
Community Survey (ACS) data exist for some jurisdictions. However, because of the City’s small
population, updated data does not exist for Del Mar; Therefore, CHAS estimates from 2000 are
used below. In 2000, approximately 79 percent of Del Mar households earned moderate or

extremely low, very low, and low income levels.2 It should be noted however, many households
in Del Mar (particularly senior households) may have low incomes but significant assets and/or
have equity.

Household incomes in Del Mar tend to be significantly higher than those in the region as a
whole. Median household income in Del Mar was $81,001 in 2000, compared to the San Diego
County median household income of $47,067. The ACS estimates that the median household
income in Del Mar between 2006 and 2010 was $112,566, compared to $63,069 in the County.
         Figure 3 and Table 10 compare household income in Del Mar to those of the San Diego
region between 2006 and 2010. The difference can be explained by the high proportion of City
residents employed in high paying management and professional service occupations (Table 4
and Table 5).
1   Federal housing and community development programs typically assist households with incomes up to 80 percent
    of the AMI and use different terminology. For example, the Federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
    program refers households with incomes between 51 and 80 percent AMI as moderate income (compared to low
    income based on State definition).
2   Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) estimates based on 2006-2008 American Community Survey
    (ACS) data for Del Mar does not exist because of the City’s small size. Therefore this data was obtained from CHAS
    estimates prepared for HUD by the Census Bureau in 2004 using 2000 Census data. CHAS data does not provide a
    breakdown of household income for those with more than 80 percent AMI as those households are not qualified for
    federal housing programs.

According to the 2006-2010 ACS, only six percent of the Del Mar households earned less than
$25,000 (Figure 4). About 53 percent of Del Mar households earned $100,000 or more during this
time period. Like Del Mar, the County’s income distribution between 2006 and 2010 was skewed
toward the higher income categories, though not to the same extent as Del Mar.

D. Housing Problems
The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) developed by the Census Bureau for
HUD provides detailed information on housing needs by income level for different types of
households in Del Mar. The most recent available CHAS data for Del Mar was published in 2004
and was based on 2000 Census data (Table 11).3 Housing problems considered by CHAS
included:
                     Units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom);
                     Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room);
                     Housing cost burdens, including utilities, exceeding 30 percent of gross income; or
                     Severe housing cost burdens, including utilities, exceeding 50 percent of gross income.
The types of problems in Del Mar vary according to household income, type, and tenure. These
include:
                     In general, owner-households had a higher level of housing affordability problems (40
                      percent) than renter-households (36 percent).
                     Approximately 93 percent of very low income (households earning between 31 and 50
                      percent of the AMI) and 80 percent of low income households (households earning
                      between 51 and 80 percent of the AMI) had one or more housing problems.
                     No lower income large households were identified in Del Mar in the 2000 Census.
3   HUD has updated the CHAS data with the American Community Survey (ACS). However, given the population size
    of the City of Del Mar, the ACS does not include data for Del Mar at the time of writing this Housing Element.

While not reflected in the Census data, the City provides assistance to lower income households
through the Rental Subsidy Program. Some of the assisted households may be large households
with five or more members.

1. Overcrowding
The combination of low incomes and high housing costs has forced many households to live in
overcrowded housing conditions. “Overcrowding” is generally defined as a housing unit
occupied by more than one person per room in house (including living room and dining rooms,
but excluding hallways, kitchen, and bathrooms). Overcrowding can be an indicator that a
community does not have an adequate supply of affordable housing, especially for large
families.
Overcrowding typically occurs when there are not enough adequately sized units within a
community, when high housing costs relative to income force too many individuals to share a
housing unit than it can adequately accommodate, or when families reside in smaller units than

because they need to devote income to other necessities, such as food and health care.
Overcrowding tends to accelerate the deterioration of housing. Therefore, maintaining a
reasonable level of occupancy and alleviating overcrowding are critical to enhancing quality
of life.
Because of Del Mar’s demographic profile (older population, smaller household size),
overcrowding historically has not been an issue. In 2000, less than two percent of Del Mar
households lived in overcrowded conditions (Table 12). The incidence of overcrowding among
renters and homeowners was approximately the same (one percent of renters versus less than
one percent of owners).
The 2010 Census does not contain information of detailed occupancy status. However, the
2006-2010 ACS provides estimates on overcrowding. According to the ACS, as in 2000,
overcrowding in Del Mar was not a significant issue between 2000 and 2010, with less than one

2. Overpayment (Cost Burden) In Relationship to Income
Measuring the portion of a household’s gross income that is spent for housing is an indicator of
the dynamics of demand and supply. This measurement is often expressed in terms of
overpayment (referred to as cost burden). Whenever households pay an excessive amount of
their income for housing, it decreases the amount of disposable income available for other
needs. This indicator is an important measurement of local housing market conditions as it
reflects the affordability of housing in the community. Federal and state agencies use
overpayment indicators to determine the extent and level of funding that should be allocated
to a community to assist with housing opportunities. State and federal programs typically define
over-payers as those paying more than 30 percent of its household income for housing costs to
be cost burdened. A household is considered experiencing a severe cost burden if it spends
more than 50 percent of its gross income on housing.
                                                                                                      City of Del Mar

Table 11 presented earlier provides overpayment detail by income group and household type
for Del Mar in 2000. Approximately 78 percent of lower income households in the City overpaid
for housing versus just 25 percent of moderate and above moderate income households.
Overpayment among very low income and low income households was most severe, at 93
percent and 80 percent, respectively.
E. Special Needs Groups
Certain segments of the population may have more difficulty in finding decent, affordable
housing due to their special needs.                            Special circumstances may be related to one’s
employment and income, family characteristics, disability and household characteristics, or
other factors. Consequently, certain residents in Del Mar may experience higher incidences of
housing overpayment (cost burden), overcrowding, or other housing problems. The special
needs groups analyzed in the Housing Element include the elderly, persons with disabilities
(including persons with developmental disabilities), homeless people, single parents, large
households, and farmworkers (Table 13). Many of these groups overlap, for example many
farmworkers are homeless migrant workers, and many elderly people have a disability of some
type. The majority of these special needs groups could be assisted by an increase in affordable
housing.

The following sections provide a detailed discussion of the housing needs facing each particular
group in Del Mar as well as programs and services available to address their housing needs.
1. Seniors
Some senior-headed households have special needs due to their relatively low incomes,
disabilities or limitations, and dependency needs. Limited discretionary income and impaired
physical mobility or mental capacity can make it difficult for some seniors to maintain their
homes.
The limited income of many senior persons often makes it difficult for them to find affordable
housing. Table 14 shows that 866 persons were age 65 and over in Del Mar in 2010. This
accounted for about 21 percent of residents, noticeably higher than the percentage found in
neighboring cities and the region as a whole.

Furthermore in 2010, 28 percent of the City’s households were headed by someone 65 years old
or older. Of these households, the majority (86 percent) owned their homes, while the remainder
(14 percent) rented their homes. Among senior-headed households, 37 percent overpaid for
housing in 2000 – 36 percent of senior homeowners overpaid, while 38 percent of senior renters
overpaid.
In addition to overpayment problems faced by seniors due to their relatively fixed incomes,
many seniors are faced with various disabilities. Roughly 23 percent of Del Mar’s senior
population was listed as having one or more disabilities in 2000 by the Census. Among these
disabilities, the most common were mental disabilities (68 percent) and disabilities that
limited/prevented seniors from going outside the home (55 percent). Updated Census data on
disabilities is not available.
Resources
According to the California Department of Social Services, in January 2012, Del Mar was home
to three State licensed community care facilities for seniors, which had a total capacity of 24
beds, according to the State Department of Social Services. Licensed community care facilities
                                                                                              City of Del Mar

serving six or fewer persons are permitted by right in all residential zones. Facilities serving more
than six persons are conditionally permitted in the RM, R-2, and RC zones. The City also offers a
Shared Housing program operated by an organization known as Community Connections that
may benefit some elderly persons by pairing them with other individuals or families seeking
lower-cost housing.
2. Persons with Disabilities (including Developmental Disabilities)
Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities may prevent a person from working, restrict
one’s mobility, or make it difficult to care for one’s self. Thus, disabled persons often have
special housing needs related to limited earning capacity, a lack of accessible and affordable
housing, and higher health costs associated with a disability. Some residents suffer from
disabilities that require living in a supportive or institutional setting.
No updated data on disabilities is available from the 2010 Census or ACS. The 2000 Census
defines six types of disabilities: sensory, physical, mental, self-care, go-outside-home and
employment. The Census defines sensory and physical disabilities as “long-lasting conditions.”
Mental, self-care, go-outside-home and employment disabilities are defined as conditions
lasting six months or more that makes it difficult to perform certain activities. A more detailed
description of each disability is provided below:
        Sensory disability: Refers to blindness, deafness or severe vision or hearing impairment.
        Physical disability: Refers to a condition that substantially limits one or more basic,
         physical activities, such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting or carrying.
        Mental disability: Refers to a mental condition lasting more than six months that impairs
         learning, remembering or concentrating.
        Self-care disability: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to dress, bathe, or get around
         inside the home.
        Go-outside-home: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to go outside the home alone
         to shop or visit a doctor’s office.
        Employment disability: Refers to a condition that restricts ability to work at a job or
         business.
According to the 2000 Census, approximately 12 percent of Del Mar residents over five years of
age had a disability. The Census tallied the number of disabilities by type for residents with one
or more disabilities. Among the disabilities tallied, nine percent were sensory disabilities, 18
percent were physical disabilities, 20 percent were mental disabilities, seven percent were self-
care disabilities, 13 percent were disabilities that limited the ability to go outside the home, and
33 percent were employment disabilities (Table 15). The 2000 Census reported that 18 percent
of persons with disabilities in Del Mar lived below the poverty level. It is also estimated that 33
percent of people with disabilities between the ages of 21 and 64 years in the City were not
employed.

A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element discuss the housing needs of
persons with developmental disabilities. As defined by federal law, “developmental disability”
means a severe, chronic disability of an individual that:
        Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical
         impairments;
        Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
        Is likely to continue indefinitely;
        Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major
         life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning; d) mobility;
         e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic self- sufficiency; and
        Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special,
         interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of assistance
         that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated.
The Census does not collect or report statistics for developmental disabilities and no other source
is known to have this data for Del Mar. According to the U.S. Administration on Developmental
Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage of the population that can be defined as
developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. This equates to 62 persons in the City of Del Mar with
developmental disabilities, based on the 2010 Census population.
According to the State’s Department of Developmental Services, as of August 2011, about 50
residents with developmental disabilities were identified in the Del Mar ZIP Code and were being
assisted at the Developmental Center and Regional Center in San Diego. 4 All of these
individuals were residing in a private home with their parent or guardian and 28 of these persons
with developmental disabilities were under the age of 18.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional
housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment

where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional
environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided.                     Because
developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the
developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an
appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The most obvious housing need for persons with disabilities is housing that is adapted to their
needs. However, most single-family homes are inaccessible to people with mobility and sensory
limitations. Housing may not be adaptable to widened doorways and hallways, access ramps,
larger bathrooms, lowered countertops, and other features necessary for accessibility. “Barrier
free” housing, accessibility modifications, proximity to services and transit, and group living
opportunities are important in serving this group. To address this concern, the City is proposing a
set of code amendments for relaxed zoning standards to accommodate mobility limitations.
Resources
State and federal legislation mandate that a portion of units in new or rehabilitated multi-family
apartment complexes be accessible to individuals with limited physical mobility. The City also
enforces the California Building Standards Code, which provides flexibility in the design of
housing for persons with disabilities.
The State Development Center and Regional Centers in San Diego provide or coordinate
services for persons with developmental disabilities. The Centers provide diagnosis and
assessment of eligibility and help plan, access, coordinate and monitor the services and
supports that are needed because of a developmental disability.
3. Large Households
Large households are defined as those consisting of five or more members. These households
comprise a special need group because many communities have a limited supply of
adequately sized and affordable housing units. To save for other basic necessities such as food,
clothing and medical care, it is common for lower income large households to reside in smaller
units, which frequently results in overcrowding and can result in accelerated unit deterioration.
Table 16 compares the number of large households in Del Mar to that of the San Diego region.
In 2010, just three percent of households in Del Mar consisted of five or more persons, compared
to 14 percent region-wide. Among large households in Del Mar, the 2010 Census reported 69
percent owned their homes and 31 percent rented.
The Census estimated that all of the large households in Del Mar earned moderate or above
moderate incomes in 2000 (see Table 11). Overall, a slightly smaller percentage of large
households (33 percent) had housing problems than all households (38 percent) in 2000. About
35 percent of owner-occupied large households had one or more housing problems, and no
renter-occupied large households suffered from housing problems (see Table 11).

Resources
Resources and programs available for this group are limited. The Housing Choice Voucher
(formerly known as the Section 8 Housing Program) and Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC)
programs, both of which are administered by the County of San Diego can assist this group by
helping to subsidize rental costs. However, few housing units in Del Mar are within the price
range of the Voucher and MCC programs.
4. Single-Parent Households
Single-parent households, particularly female-headed families with children, often require
special consideration and assistance because of their greater need for affordable housing and
accessible day care, health care, and other supportive services. Female-headed families with
children are considered a vulnerable group because they must balance the needs of their
children with work responsibilities, often while earning limited incomes.
An estimated four percent of Del Mar households were headed by single parents in 2010 (Table
17); the large majority of the single-parent households were headed by females (73 percent).

Lower income single-parent households can benefit from City programs that provide rental
assistance, such as Housing Choice Vouchers, Shared Housing, and City Rental Subsidy
programs.

5. Residents Living in Poverty
Families, particularly female-headed families, are disproportionately affected by poverty. In
2000, nine percent of the City’s total residents (383 persons) lived in poverty. Approximately 19
percent of female-headed households with children had incomes below the poverty level. The
2006-2010 ACS reports that four percent of the City’s population and no female-headed families
with children in Del Mar lived below the poverty level.
Resources
The Housing Choice Voucher program targets assistance toward extremely low income
households. In addition, the City’s Shared Housing and Rental Subsidy programs can benefit this
income group.
6. Homeless
Throughout the country and the San Diego region, homelessness has become an increasingly
important issue in light of the current economic conditions. Factors contributing to the rise in
homelessness include increased unemployment and underemployment, a lack of housing
affordable to lower and moderate income persons (especially extremely low income
households), reductions in public subsidies to the poor, and the de-institutionalization of the
mentally ill.
State law mandates that municipalities address the special needs of homeless persons within
their jurisdictional boundaries. “Homelessness” as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD), describes an individual (not imprisoned or otherwise detained)
who:
        Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; and
        Has a primary nighttime residence that is:
         o A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary
              living accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, and
              transitional housing for the mentally ill);
         o An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be
              institutionalized; or
         o A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping
              accommodation for human beings.
This definition does not include persons living in substandard housing (unless it has been officially
condemned); persons living in overcrowded housing (for example, doubled up with others),
persons being discharged from mental health facilities (unless the person was homeless when
entering and is considered to be homeless at discharge), or persons who may be at risk of
homelessness (for example, living temporarily with family or friends.)
The Regional Task Force on the Homeless (RTFH) is San Diego County’s leading resource for
information on issues of homelessness. The RTFH promotes a regional approach as the best

solution to ending homelessness in San Diego County. RTFH compiles data from a physical Point-
In-Time (PIT) count of sheltered (emergency and transitional) and street homeless persons. The
2011 Count was conducted on January 28, 2011 and the results are shown in Table 18.
Oceanside had the largest homeless population of the North County coastal cities. Del Mar’s
homeless population is estimated at 11 persons.

According to RTFH, the San Diego region’s homeless population can be divided into two general
groups: (1) urban homeless, and (2) rural homeless, including farm workers and day laborers who
primarily occupy the hillsides, canyons and fields of the northern regions of the County. It is
important to recognize that homeless individuals may fall into more than one category (for
example, a homeless individual may be a veteran and a substance abuser), making it difficult to
accurately quantify and categorize the homeless.
Resources
The City contracts with a non-profit organization Del Mar Community Connections to provide
referral services for shared-housing opportunities to homeless persons and others. The Del Mar
Community Connections staff is available to work with homeless persons to identify potential
shared housing opportunities or refer the person to available homeless services elsewhere within
the County. The Sheriff’s Department also refers homeless persons found within the City to local
shelters including:
     Winter-only shelters
      Bread of Life in Oceanside
      Operation Hope in Vista (families with children only)
      Rotational shelters provided by the San Diego Interfaith Network at local churches with

7. Farmworkers
Agricultural workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned
through permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farm laborers work in the fields,
processing plants, or support activities on a generally year-round basis. When workload increases
during harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal labor, often supplied by a
labor contractor. For some crops, farms may employ migrant workers, defined as those whose
travel distance to work prevents them from returning to their primary residence every evening.
Due to the high cost of housing and low wages, a significant number of migrant farm workers
have difficulty finding affordable, safe and sanitary housing.              According to the State
Employment Development Department, the average farmworker earned between $19,000 and
$30,000 annually.5 This limited income is exacerbated by their tenuous and/or seasonal
employment status. It is estimated that there are between 100 and 150 farmworker camps
located throughout the San Diego region, primarily in rural areas. These encampments range in
size from a few people to a few hundred and are frequently found in fields, hillsides, canyons,
ravines, and riverbeds, often on the edge of their employer’s property. Some workers reside in
severely overcrowded dwellings, in packing buildings, or in storage sheds.
According to the 2000 Census, one percent of Del Mar’s residents were employed in farming,
forestry, or fishing occupations. However, by 2010, the 2006-2010 ACS found that none of Del
Mar’s residents were employed in these occupations. Housing programs generally available to
lower income households could address housing needs of farmworkers.
8. Students
The college student population in the area is another significant factor affecting housing
demand. Del Mar is located near the University of California, San Diego, San Diego State
University, the University of San Diego and Point Loma Nazarene University. According to the
2006-2010 ACS, about three percent of Del Mar’s population was enrolled in college or graduate
school. While many of the City’s college students reside with their parents, some students reside
in Del Mar in their own independent housing. Although no policies and programs are needed to
address the limited housing needs of students living in Del Mar, the City recognizes that a
general lack of affordable housing is often a factor in a student’s decision to move elsewhere
after graduation.

9. Del Mar Racetrack and Fairgrounds Workers
The 22nd District Agricultural Association Fairgrounds property comprises roughly 20 percent of
the land area of the City of Del Mar. The San Diego Fair and the Del Mar Race meet employ a
large number of workers in temporary positions during the annual Fair and horse racing seasons
and for numerous other events conducted intermittently on the property. Jobs associated with
the annual Fairgrounds and race meet are comprised primarily of low-paying positions. Due to
the temporary nature of the work, workers are usually residents of lower-cost communities in the
region but travel to the Fairgrounds when temporary employment is available.
Housing is available on the Fairgrounds for approximately 1,200 people on a seasonal basis.
Currently, on-site housing for temporary employees is provided in the form of up to 110
recreational vehicle (RV) parking spaces and multiple dorm buildings containing basic sleeping
rooms with shared bathroom facilities. Many of the employees utilizing the various sleeping
quarters, especially during the Del Mar Fair and horse racing season, are persons with lower
incomes, such as carnival workers and equine grooms. During the Del Mar Fair, both the rooms
and RV facilities are available to carnival workers, Future Farmers of America (FFA) members,
and 4-H members and their parents. Carnival operators and commercial exhibitors also are able
to utilize the RV facilities during the Fair. During racing season, the sleeping rooms and RV
parking facilities are available to horse handlers and grooms. For the remainder of the year the
sleeping rooms are locked and not used. The RV spaces are available for the remainder of the
year for use by persons exhibiting at the various shows occurring on the site and by persons
traveling in their RVs. In most cases, these temporary housing arrangements are in substandard
conditions.
The 22nd District Agricultural Association has adopted a (2008) Master Plan that includes a
residential component. It identifies the demolition of the existing dormitory style housing now
used by seasonal workers and construction of 78 new replacement units to be available for its
seasonal workers, as well as for some of its permanent employees. The City is working with the
District to facilitate the construction of those new units in a manner that meets the definition of
dwelling units under both the California Building Code and the U.S. Census Bureau.
F. Housing Stock Characteristics
The characteristics of the housing stock, including growth, type, availability and tenure, age and
condition, housing costs, and affordability are important in determining the housing needs for
the community. This section details the housing stock characteristics of Del Mar to identify how
well the current housing stock meets the needs of its current and future residents.
1. Housing Growth
As a largely built-out community, Del Mar has experienced only moderate housing growth since
1990. With limited vacant land available for future residential development, the City’s slow
housing growth is projected to continue into the future. The housing stock in the City grew only
                                                                                     City of Del Mar

                                                  170

slightly from 2,514 units in 1990 to 2,596 units in 2010, or a three-percent increase over 20 years
(Table 19). Overall, housing growth in the Northern Coastal County areas has been limited,
compared to countywide growth.

2. Housing Type
Del Mar maintains a diverse housing stock. Figure 5 shows that in 2010 a majority of Del Mar’s
housing stock was made up of single-family units (69 percent). Multi-family units made up the
remaining 31 percent of the total housing stock. There are no mobile homes/trailers in the City.

3. Housing Availability and Tenure
Housing tenure and vacancy rates are important indicators of the supply and cost of housing.
Housing tenure refers to whether a unit is owned or rented. Tenure is an important market
characteristic because it is directly related to housing types and turnover rates. The tenure
distribution of a community’s housing stock can be an indicator of several aspects of the
housing market, including the affordability of units, household stability, and residential mobility,
among others. In most communities, tenure distribution generally correlates with household
income, composition and age of the householder.
In 2000, among the City’s occupied housing units, approximately 56 percent were owner-
occupied, while 44 percent were renter-occupied (Table 20). The homeownership rate for the
City has remained relatively steady over the past 10 years. According to the 2010 Census, the
homeownership rate in Del Mar decreased only slightly to 54 percent of occupied units. Renter-
occupied housing units made up about 46 percent of the City’s occupied housing stock.
Approximately five percent of total housing units in the City were vacant and available for rent

As shown in Table 21, owner-occupied households had a slightly higher average household size
than renter-occupied households in 2010. The average owner-household size in 2010 was 2.15
persons compared to 1.85 persons for the average renter-household. In 2000, the gap between
average owner-household size and average renter-household size was slightly larger; however,
the average overall household size remained the same.

Vacancy rates are an important housing indicator because they indicate the degree of choice
available. High vacancy rates usually indicate low demand and/or high supply conditions in the
housing market. Too high of a vacancy rate can be difficult for owners trying to sell or rent. Low

vacancy rates usually indicate high demand and/or low supply conditions in the housing
market. Too low of a vacancy rate can force prices up making it more difficult for lower and
moderate income households to find housing. Vacancy rates of between two to three percent
are usually considered healthy for single-family or ownership housing, and rates of five to six
percent are usually considered healthy for multi-family or rental housing. However, vacancy
rates are not the sole indicator of market conditions. They must be viewed in the context of all
the characteristics of the local and regional market.
According to the 2010 Census, the overall vacancy rate in Del Mar was 20.5 percent. However,
a vast majority (70 percent) of these vacant units were used for seasonal, recreational, or
occasional stays. Excluding these seasonally occupied units, the City has a vacancy rate of
approximately five percent (3.6 percent vacant for rent and 1.5 percent vacant for sale).
Additional vacancy information was obtained in fall 2011 from the San Diego County Apartment
Association (SDCAA) and is shown in Table 22. Vacancy rates in Del Mar were on par with those
in neighboring communities and the County as a whole.

4. Housing Age and Condition
Housing age can be an important indicator of housing condition within a community. Many
federal and state programs also use the age of housing as one factor in determining housing
rehabilitation needs. Typically, housing over 30 years of age is more likely to have rehabilitation
needs that may include new plumbing, roof repairs, foundation work and other repairs.
Housing growth in the City declined noticeably in the 1980s, reflecting the limited land remaining
for development. Del Mar’s housing stock therefore, is significantly older than the County’s
housing stock (Figure 6). About 77 percent of Del Mar’s housing stock was constructed over 30
years ago, while only 57 percent of the County’s housing stock is of this age.

Typically, such a large proportion of older housing would indicate that the majority of the City’s
housing stock could potentially require major rehabilitation. However, due to the City’s higher
than average median household income and housing values, owner-occupied housing is better
maintained than in many other jurisdictions. The vast majority of the City’s older housing units
have already undergone maintenance and remodeling efforts. According to the City Building
Division, none of the 2,064 housing units in the City are considered substandard.
5. Housing Costs and Affordability
Housing costs reflect the supply and demand of housing in a community.                This section
summarizes the cost and affordability of the housing stock to Del Mar residents.
Home Ownership Market
In 2010, median home prices in the North County coastal areas of San Diego ranged from
$295,000 in Oceanside to $1,055,000 in the cities of Del Mar and Solana Beach (Figure 7). Del
Mar’s median home price was one of the highest in the entire County.
Median home sale prices in Del Mar decreased slightly by about four percent between 2009
and 2010. Other northern coastal San Diego cities, however, saw noticeable increases in their
median home prices during this time period. Compared to the peak of the housing market in
2006, median home price in the City decreased 33 percent from $1,585,000.

Rental Market
The primary source of information on rental costs in the San Diego region is the San Diego
County Apartment Association (SDCAA). SDCAA conducts two surveys of rental properties per
year. For the fall 2011 survey, 6,000 surveys were sent out to rental property owners and
managers throughout San Diego County. Responses were received from 19,915 units. Although
this survey sampled a broad variety of rental housing, it was not a scientific sampling.
Table 24 shows that in the fall of 2011, average monthly rents in Del Mar ranged from $1,373 for a
studio apartment to $2,575 for a three-bedroom apartment. Apartment rents in Del Mar are
some of the highest in all of San Diego County.

Housing Affordability by Income Level
Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning a home in the
City with the maximum affordable housing costs for households at different income levels. Taken
together, this information can generally show who can afford what size and type of housing and
indicate the type of households most likely to experience overcrowding and overpayment.
The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts annual household
income surveys nationwide to determine a household’s eligibility for federal housing assistance.
                                                                                                       City of Del Mar
Page 34                                                                                   2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                                  176

Based on this survey, the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
developed income limits, based on the Area Median Income (AMI), which can be used to
determine the maximum price that could be affordable to households in the upper range of
their respective income category. Households in the lower end of each category can afford
less by comparison than those at the upper end. The maximum affordable home and rental
prices for residents in San Diego County are shown in Table 25.
Table 25 shows the maximum amount that a household can pay for housing each month
without incurring a cost burden (overpayment). This amount can be compared to current
housing asking prices (Table 23) and market rental rates (Table 24) to determine what types of
housing opportunities a household can afford.
Extremely Low income Households
Extremely low income households earn 30 percent or less of the County AMI – up to $16,900 for a
one-person household and up to $26,050 for a five-person household in 2012. Extremely low
income households cannot afford market-rate rental or ownership housing in Del Mar without
assuming a substantial cost burden.
Very Low income Households
Very low income households earn between 31 percent and 50 percent of the County AMI – up
to $28,150 for a one-person household and up to $43,400 for a five-person household in 2012. A
very low income household can generally afford homes offered at prices between $86,500 and
$116,000, adjusting for household size. After deductions for utilities, a very low income household
at the maximum income limit can afford to pay approximately $664 to $991 in monthly rent,
depending on household size. Given the high cost of housing in Del Mar, persons or households
of very low income could not afford to rent or purchase a home in the City.
Low income Households
Low income households earn between 51 percent and 80 percent of the County’s AMI - up to
$45,000 for a one-person household and up to $69,400 for a five-person household in 2012. The
affordable home price for a low income household at the maximum income limit ranges from
$152,000 to $217,000. Based on the asking prices of homes for sale in 2012 (Table 23), ownership
housing would not be affordable to low income households. After deductions for utilities, a one-
person low income household could afford to pay up to $1,085 in rent per month and a five-
person low income household could afford to pay as much as $1,641. Low income households
in Del Mar would not be able to find adequately sized affordable apartment units (Table 24).
Moderate income Households
Persons and households of moderate income earn between 81 percent and 120 percent of the
County’s AMI – up to $98,400, depending on household size in 2012. The maximum affordable
home price for a moderate income household is $267,000 for a one-person household and
$395,000 for a five-person family. Moderate income households in Del Mar would not be able to
purchase a home in the City. The maximum affordable rent payment for moderate income
households is between $1,554 and $2,366 per month. Appropriately-sized market-rate rental
housing is generally affordable to households in this income group.

G.Affordable Housing
1. Project-Based Assisted Housing
State law requires that the City identify, analyze, and propose programs to preserve existing
multi-family rental units that are eligible to convert to market-rate housing uses due to
termination of subsidy contract, mortgage prepayment, or expiring use restrictions during the
next ten years. Thus, this at-risk housing analysis covers the period from January 1, 2013 through
December 31, 2022.
No publicly assisted rental housing that is deed restricted for low income use is located in Del
Mar. Therefore, no low income rental units are considered “at risk” within the January 1, 2013
through December 31, 2022 housing analysis period.
2. Tenant-Based Rental Subsidies
The City utilizes its Housing Assistance Reserve account to operate a rental subsidy program. The
program currently assists eight very low income households. In addition to the City-funded
program, another rental assistance program is the Housing Choice Vouchers (aka Section 8).
This program is administered by the Housing Authority of the County of San Diego. Due to the
high market rents in Del Mar, which exceed the Fair Market Rents established for the program,
utilization of this program is limited. In 2010, only two households in the City were assisted with
Housing Choice Vouchers.
H. Coastal Housing
1. Requirements and Exemptions
California Government Code Section 65588(c) requires each periodic revision of the Housing
Element to include the following information relating to housing in the Coastal Zone:
         The number of new housing units approved for construction within the coastal zone since
          January 1, 1982;
         The number of housing units for persons and families of low or moderate income required
          to be provided in new housing developments either within the coastal zone or within
          three miles of the coastal zone as a replacement for the conversion or demolition of
          existing coastal units occupied by low or moderate income persons;
         The number of existing residential units occupied by persons and families of low or
          moderate income that have been authorized to be demolished or converted since
          January 1, 1982 in the coastal zone; and

                                                  179

       The number of residential units for persons and families of low or moderate income that
        have been required for replacement units.
The coastal replacement housing requirements do not apply to the following:
       The conversion or demolition of a residential structure which contains less than three
        dwelling units, or, in the event that a proposed conversion or demolition involves more
        than one residential structure, the conversion or demolition of 10 or fewer dwelling units.
       The conversion or demolition of a residential structure for purposes of a nonresidential use
        which is either "coastal dependent” or “coastal related”, such as visitor-serving
        commercial or recreational facilities, coastal-dependent industry, or boating or harbor
        facilities.
       The conversion or demolition of a residential structure located within the jurisdiction of a
        local government which has within the area encompassing the coastal zone, and three
        miles inland therefrom, less than 50 acres, in aggregate, of land which is vacant, privately
        owned and available for residential use.
       The conversion or demolition of a residential structure located within the jurisdiction of a
        local government which has established a procedure under which an applicant for
        conversion or demolition will pay an in-lieu fee into a program, the various provisions of
        which, in aggregate, will result in the replacement of the number of dwelling units which
        would otherwise have been required.
2. Housing in the Del Mar Coastal Zone
New Construction
The entirety of the City of Del Mar is located in the California Coastal Zone. Since 1982, 267 new
and replacement housing units have been constructed in the City.
Affordable Housing
Government Code Section 65590 (d) (also known as the Mello Act) states that “new housing
developments constructed within the coastal zone shall, where feasible, provide housing units
for persons and families of low and moderate income, as defined in Section 50093 of the Health
and Safety Code. Where it is not feasible to provide these housing units in a proposed new
housing development, the local government shall require the developer to provide such
housing, if feasible to do so, at another location within the same city or county, either within the
coastal zone or within three miles of.”
The City has established a number of inclusionary housing policies and programs (discussed in
the section entitled Housing Plans, beginning on Page #76) to generate housing funds to support
affordable housing programs. The accrued funds are deposited in a dedicated Housing
Assistance Reserve account. As an example, the City has been using the accrued housing
funds to provide rental subsidies to eight very low income households.

Demolished/Converted Low and Moderate Income Housing
Since 1982, 152 housing units have been demolished in the City. None were affordable units and
in almost all cases, the demolished structures were replaced with residential units.
Replacement Housing
A majority of the residential construction projects in the City involve the replacement of older
single-family units with new single-family homes or duplexes. The City is largely built out and has
less than 50 acres of vacant land designated for residential uses. Therefore, the City is not
subject to the replacement requirement.

Housing Constraints
As in most communities, a variety of constraints affect the opportunities for the provision of
adequate and affordable housing. In Del Mar, these include primarily the market constraints of
very high land costs and, to a lesser extent, governmental regulations, infrastructure, and
environmental sensitivities. These factors do combine to affect the availability and affordability
of new housing (especially for lower and moderate income households) in the community.
A. Market Constraints
1. Land Costs
While the City contains numerous vacant properties, a January 24, 2012, web search revealed
that only eight vacant parcels were offered for sale, each zoned for single-family residential use.
The asking price ranged from $1,250,876 for a one-acre lot to $3,499,000 for a 0.42-acre site with
an unobstructed ocean view. The very limited supply and extremely high cost of vacant land
poses the largest constraint to the construction of affordable housing, especially affordable
housing in Del Mar.
2. Construction Costs
The cost of construction is another major factor in the price of housing. The International Code
Council (ICC) provides estimates for the average cost of labor and materials for typical Type V
wood-frame housing. Estimates are based on “good-quality” construction, providing for
materials and fixtures well above the minimum required by state and local building codes. In
February 2011, the ICC estimated that the average per square-foot cost for good-quality
housing in the San Diego region was approximately $97 for multi-family housing and $109 for
single-family homes. Construction costs for custom homes and units with extra amenities, as is
common in Del Mar, run even higher. Although construction costs are a significant portion of the
overall development cost, they are consistent throughout the region and, especially when
considering land costs, are not considered a major constraint to housing production in Del Mar.
3. Availability of Mortgage and Rehabilitation Financing
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a home. Under the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to disclose information
on the disposition of loan applications and the income, gender, and race of loan applicants.
The primary concern in a review of lending activity is to determine whether home financing is
available to residents of a community. The data presented in this section include the disposition
of loan applications submitted to financial institutions for home purchase, home improvement,
and refinancing in Del Mar.
                                                                                     City of Del Mar
Page 40                                                                   2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                 182

In 2010, a total of 338 households applied for conventional mortgage loans in Del Mar. 6 As
shown in Table 26, 64 percent of the conventional mortgage applications were approved, 19
percent were denied, and 17 percent were withdrawn or closed for incompleteness.
In comparison, only 124 households applied to use government-backed loans to purchase
homes in Del Mar. The approval rate of these loans (70 percent) was higher than the approval
rate of conventional loans (64 percent). In the past, government-backed loans were a
significant source of financing for lower and moderate income households. However, during the
peak of the housing market, other loan options including zero percent down, interest-only, or
adjustable rate loans were available. As a result, government-backed loans became less
attractive. Recent tightening of underwriting standards has limited the availability of these
“creative” financing options, suggesting that government-backed loans may again become a
significant source of financing in many communities.
Another 47 Del Mar households applied for home improvement loans in 2010; of these 60
percent were approved and 36 percent were denied. In general, home improvement financing
is less accessible during market downturns. High debt-to-income ratios coupled with lower
property appraisals can make it more difficult to qualify for additional financing.
Applications to refinance existing mortgages were most common with a total of 1,527
applications. The approval rate for refinance loans (62 percent) was slightly lower than the
approval rate for conventional home purchase loans (65 percent).
More than 62 percent of the applicants for loan applications had incomes that exceeded 120
percent of the Area Median Income (AMI). Of these upper income applicants, 67 percent were
approved and 18 percent were denied. The approval/denial rate was slightly lower for
moderate income applicants (64 percent). Lower income households, particularly very low
income households had the lowest loan approval rates and highest denial rates. Only 45
percent of very low income and 56 percent of low income applicants were approved.
Given the relatively high rates of approval for home purchase, improvement, and refinance
loans, home financing is generally available and not considered to be a significant constraint to
the provision and maintenance of housing in Del Mar.
6    Government-backed loans include loans insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA),
     Veteran Administration (VA), and Farm Service Agency (FSA)/Rural Housing Services (RHS).

4. Economic Constraints
The effects of market forces on the construction industry may act as a barrier to affordable
housing. The forces of supply and demand can affect the timing and level of housing
construction. For instance, in the early 1990s a number of factors cumulatively dampened the
real estate market and slowed housing construction in Southern California despite the fact that
interest rates were at relatively low levels. Yet, by the mid-1990s the housing market began to
turn around, and until 2006, housing prices skyrocketed, rendering the region as one of the most
expensive metropolitan areas in the nation. According to the California Association of Realtors
(CAR), only nine percent of the households in San Diego County could afford a median-priced
home in September 2005. In 2008, the bubble burst and housing prices have come down
significantly. The median home price in San Diego County dropped more than $200,000
(approximately 36 percent) and sales dropped 50 percent between 2005 and 2010.7 The
cyclical nature of the real estate market has a significant impact on the supply and demand for
housing, which in turn affects the timing and cost of construction.

B. Governmental Constraints
1. Land Use Controls
The existing Community Development Element of Del Mar’s Community Plan, the City’s Local
Coastal Program (LCP), and the City’s Zoning Ordinance set forth regulations for residential
development. They provide for a range of residential types and densities dispersed throughout
the City. The LCP and Zoning Ordinance, each of which is consistent with the Community Plan,
identify the following residential categories and their existing allowed densities:
       Very Low Density Residential (R1-40) (1 unit/net acre)
       Modified Low Density Residential (R1-14) (Max. 3.1 units/net acre)
       Low Density Residential (R1-10) (Max. 4.3 units/net acre)
       Low Density Residential - Beach (R1-10B) (Max. 4.3 units/net acre)
       Medium Density Single Family Residential (R1-5) (Max. 8.7 units/net acre)
       Medium Density Single Family Residential - Beach (R1-5B) (Max. 8.7 units/net acre)
       Medium Density Mixed Residential - East (RM-East) (Max. 8.8-17.6 units/net acre)
       Medium Density Mixed Residential - West (RM-West) (Max. 8.8-17.6 units/net acre)
       Medium Density Mixed Residential - Central (RM-Central) (Max. 6.3-12.5 units/net acre)
       Medium Density Mixed Residential - South (RM-South) (Max. 10.9-12.5 units/net acre)
       High Density Residential (R-2) (Max. 12.5 units/net acre)
       Residential Commercial (RC) (Max. 12.5 units/net acre)
       Carmel Valley Precise Plan (As allowed under the Carmel Valley Precise Plan)
       Professional Commercial (PC) (Max. 1 unit/parcel)
       North Commercial (NC) (Max. 1 unit/parcel)
       Central Commercial (CC) (Max. 1 unit/parcel)
These residential categories already accommodate development of a wide range of housing
types in Del Mar. With Del Mar being essentially built out, most future residential development
will occur as in-fill housing on existing lots. Furthermore, maintaining the existing residential
categories is important for ensuring compatibility between the new and existing housing.
Additional Dwelling Units Allowed per Zoning
To facilitate the production of affordable units, the City adopted a Second-Dwelling Unit
Ordinance in April 1999. The ordinance allows second units to be built within four zones that are
otherwise designated solely for single-family development. Those zones are: the Very Low
Density (R1-40), Modified Low Density (R1-14), Low Density (R1-10), and Low Density-Beach (R1-
10B) districts. Under the ordinance, the Second Dwelling Units are required to be deed-restricted
as rentals for Low Income households for at least 30 years.
Although the ordinance has been in place since 1999, no Second-Dwelling Units have been
constructed. As is discussed in the Housing Programs section of this Update, the City will be
adopting modifications to its land use regulations to create additional incentives for the use of
the Second-Dwelling Unit program.

                                                 185

   Density bonuses are another way to increase the number of dwelling units otherwise allowed in
   a residentially zoned area. The City’s Zoning Ordinance allows for a 25-percent density bonus
   when housing projects provide between 10 and 20 percent of the units at an affordable rate,
   with the bonus based on the level of affordability. In addition, developers of a density bonus
   project can receive at least one development incentive or concession, such as reduced
   parking requirements, reduced development review fees, or priority permit processing.
   Current State law significantly reduces the number of units that a developer must provide in
   order to receive a density bonus and requires the City to provide up to three concessions,
   depending upon the percentage of affordable units that the developer provides. Developers
   can receive a density bonus of up to 35 percent, depending on the proportion of units set aside
   for lower or moderate income households. It also imposes a new land donation rule, and
   statewide parking standards. The City will revise the Zoning Ordinance to allow for density
   bonuses and related concessions, consistent with State law.
   2. Residential Development Standards
   Del Mar’s residential development standards (i.e. heights, setbacks lot coverage) are
   summarized in Table 27. Under the Community Plan and base zoning, the highest density
   allowable in the City is 17.6 units per acre.

   In addition to the development standards identified in Table 27, Del Mar requires a certain
   number of garage parking spaces to be provided for each new residential unit. Guest parking is
   also required for multi-family housing at a ratio of one space for every four units. The parking
   requirements are identified in Table 28.

   As indicated earlier, the City adopted a Second-Dwelling Unit Ordinance as one means to
   promote affordable housing in the City.
   Typically, the cost associated with garage parking construction can be viewed as a constraint
   to affordable housing development, particularly for multi-family housing. However, the City’s
   parking regulations are not a significant constraint because the number of required parking
   spaces for duplexes and multi-family projects varies by the number of bedrooms and is less than
   the required number of spaces for single-family units. Furthermore, affordable housing projects
   that qualify for a density bonus can request application of the State’s parking standards, which
   require only one space for zero or one bedroom units, two spaces for two- or three-bedroom
   units, and 2.5 spaces for units with four or more bedrooms. Per State law, the parking can be
   provided in tandem or uncovered on-site spaces, making the requirement easier to satisfy.

Maximum Building Height
The City’s Local Coastal Plan, as approved by the California Coastal Commission, restricts the
maximum building height within the City to 26 feet. This figure is compatible with other nearby
coastal jurisdictions.
This Housing Element includes a range of land use planning programs to designate appropriate
locations for higher density residential development at 20-25 units per acre. In addition, the City
will review its development codes to establish appropriate development standards for
facilitating higher density residential development.
3. Residential Development Standards for the 22nd DAA Fairgrounds
     Property
As discussed in an earlier segment of this Section, the Master Plan for the 22nd DAA Fairgrounds
property includes a residential component, the replacement of employee housing currently
provided in dormitory style structures with 78 new units. The City has been working cooperatively
with the 22nd DAA to ensure that the new housing units will be designed and constructed in a
manner to meet the definition dwelling units under the California Building Code and the U.S.
Census Bureau definitions. On February 19, 2013, the Del Mar City Council adopted a resolution
to initiate a partnership between the City and the 22nd DAA to carry out shared goals regarding
housing at the Fairgrounds property. On March 12, 2013, the Board of Directors of the 22 nd DAA
adopted a similar resolution.
4. Inclusionary Housing/ In-Lieu Fees
To mitigate the loss of affordable housing stock, the City’s Affordable Housing Assistance
program, as codified in the Subdivision and Condominium Conversion Ordinances, require that
certain housing developments be subject to payment of an in-lieu fee or that some of the units
be set aside for affordable housing. The in-lieu fees are placed in a Housing Assistance Reserve
and used to provide rental subsidies to very low income households (including extremely low
income households).
The following discussion identifies the Affordable Housing Assistance program requirements and
includes an analysis of potential constraints:
        Condominium Conversion (Duplex): The creation/conversion of two condominium units
         (duplex) requires payment of an in-lieu housing mitigation fee for each of the converted
         units (the in-lieu fee is not applied to conversions of three or more multi-family units where
         a set-aside of affordable units is instead required, as noted below). The current rate of
         the in-lieu housing mitigation fee is $23,508 per unit. As part of the Housing Plan Section
         of this Update, the City will be exploring whether the current fee is set at an appropriate
         mitigation level.
                                                                                       City of Del Mar
Page 46                                                                    2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                    188

       Condominium Conversion (3+ Units): Currently, the City’s Condominium Conversion
        Ordinance requires that the conversion of three or more rental units into condominiums
        be conditioned such that two-thirds (67 percent) of the total number of converted units
        be set-aside and offered for rent at or below the “Fair Market Rent” to very low income
        tenants (with incomes not exceeding 50 percent of the AMI). In-lieu fees may not be
        substituted to meet this requirement.
        Given the extremely high ownership housing costs (for both single-family homes and
        condominiums), rental housing provides more affordable market-rate housing
        opportunities in Del Mar. The original intent of the two-thirds set-aside requirement for
        condominium conversions was to preserve the existing market-rate rental housing
        developments of three or more units within the City. While this requirement has been
        effective in preserving market-rate rental housing, it has not resulted in providing
        opportunities for lower income households in the community because the market rate for
        rental housing is relatively high.
        As housing costs continue to rise, rental housing at market rate is not affordable to lower
        income households. As part of this Housing Element update, the City is proposing to
        modify the inclusionary set-aside housing requirement from a 66% set-aside to a set-aside
        range of between 10% and 30%, this in order to allow some condominium conversions
        while ensuring the establishment of designated affordable housing units.
       New Construction: Under the City’s existing subdivision ordinance, for subdivisions of 10 or
        more single-family residential lots, one of every 10 lots is required to be reserved for rental
        at a rate at or below the “Fair Market Rent” for tenants qualifying for Housing Choice
        Vouchers. The developer has the option to instead pay an in-lieu Housing Mitigation Fee
        for the lot that would otherwise be reserved for affordable housing rental rates.
        Given the limited vacant land in the City, the City has not received any applications for
        subdivisions of ten lots or more for more than ten years. The program requirements
        themselves have not constrained opportunities for large subdivision development in Del
        Mar. Rather, it has been the limited number of large lots that might otherwise be
        proposed for subdivision and the lack of a desire of the owners of those few lots to pursue
        such proposals that has limited larger subdivision proposals.
        Property owners who pursue a subdivision do have the option to pay an in-lieu fee
        instead of constructing the affordable housing directly. The current In-lieu Housing
        Mitigation Fee is set at $23,508 per unit. Single-family housing construction is a highly
        profitable venture in Del Mar with average sale prices of new homes often exceeding
        one million dollars. The In-lieu Housing Mitigation Fee represents a very small percentage
        of the total housing cost. As mentioned above, the current rate of the in-lieu Housing
        Mitigation Fee will be reviewed by the City Council to determine whether it is set at an
        appropriate level. The primary constraint to the subdivision of land into ten or more lots is
        the built-out nature of the community’s single-family neighborhoods. As a result, there is
        no virtually no land remaining for large subdivisions. Should a developer assemble

                    enough parcels for subdivision of ten or more single-family lots, this program requirement
                    will help the City achieve its share of the regional housing need for all income groups.
         5. Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types
         Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made
         available through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the
         development of a variety of types of housing for all income levels. Table 29 summarizes the
         City’s zoning provisions for various types of housing.

*Permitted as an accessory to an allowed use
Source: City of Del Mar, Zoning Ordinance, 2012.
         Single-family
         A detached building used exclusively for occupancy by one family (including their guests,
         servants, and employees) and containing one dwelling unit. Single-family use is permitted in all
         residential zones in the City.
         Duplexes
         Two dwelling units on lot, each used exclusively for occupancy by one family (including their
         guests, servants, and employees) living independently of each other. The two units may be
         attached or separate. Duplexes are permitted in the RM, R-2, and RC zones.
         Clustered
         Per the Zoning Ordinance, “clustered” units include attached or detached dwellings in close
         proximity to one another. Clustered development is allowed with approval of a Conditional Use
         Permit (CUP) in the RM, R-2, and RC zones. Clustered housing development allows flexibility in
         site planning, by allowing the clustering of residential units and leaving room for amenities.
         Given the small lots in the City, clustered development allows the developer to more creatively
         use the land and therefore works as a tool to facilitate residential development. Clustered
         housing development is an option that the developer may choose to utilize; it is not a
                                                                                                  City of Del Mar

requirement. Clustered development also does not alter the allowable density. As part of this
2013 -2020 Housing Element, the City is proposing the elimination of the requirement for receipt
of a Conditional Use Permit to develop clustered units in the RM, R-2 and R-C Zones.
Multi-family
A building, portion thereof or buildings used for occupancy by three or more families (including
their guests, servants and employees of each such family) living independently of each other,
and containing three or more dwelling units. This includes apartment houses, bungalow courts
and group houses.         Currently, multi-family housing is permitted in the RM-S zone and
conditionally permitted in RM-E, RM-W, and RM-C. Program 2B proposes to remove the CUP
requirement, thereby allowing the density of 17.6 units per acre by right.
Manufactured Housing/Mobile Homes
Currently, the City’s zoning ordinance does not include provisions for manufactured housing or
mobile homes. State law requires local governments to permit manufactured or mobile homes
meeting federal safety and construction standards on a permanent foundation in all single-
family residential zoning districts (Section 65852.3 of the California Government Code). The City
will amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow manufactured housing consistent with State law
(Program 6).
Affordable Second Dwelling Units
As discussed earlier in this document, the City has a Second-Dwelling Unit ordinance that allows
such units in the R1-40, R1-14, R1-10, and R1-10B districts. Per the ordinance, the units can be no
larger than 550 square feet in size and must be deed-restricted at affordable rental rates for low
income individuals for at least 30 years. Although the ordinance has been in place since 1999,
no Second-Dwelling Unit has been constructed in the City since the Ordinance’s adoption.
Following adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City will amend the ordinance to
facilitate the construction of Second-Dwelling units, including creation of incentives and
modification of the affordable rental requirement.
Community Care Facilities
The City of Del Mar Municipal Code explicitly allows Small Community Care Facilities as a “by
right” use in all of its residential zones, including the Residential Commercial zone. A Small
Community Care Facility is defined in the Zoning Ordinance as: “Any facility, place, or building
that is maintained and operated to provide non-medical residential care, day treatment, adult
day care or foster family agency services for children, adults, or children and adults, including
but not limited to, the physically handicapped, mentally impaired, incompetent persons, and
abused or neglected children consistent with State law (CA Health and Safety Code Sections
1500 et.seqitur).” Pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 1566.3, such facilities are treated
in a unique manner with respect to licensing. No conditional use permit, zoning variance, or
other zoning clearance is required for a Small Community Care Facility which is not required of a
family dwelling of the same type in the same zone.
A Large Community Care Facility is defined as: “Any facility, place or building, serving seven or
more persons, that is maintained and operated to provide non-medical residential care, day
treatment, adult day care or foster family agency services for children, adults, or children and

                                                  191

adults, including but not limited to, the physically handicapped, mentally impaired,
incompetent persons, and abused or neglected children consistent with State law (CA Health
and Safety Code Sections 1500 et sequitur).” These facilities are conditionally allowed in the RM,
R-2, and RC zones, provided that there is at least 1,000 linear feet between Large Community
Care Facilities, parking is provided for the operator and employee(s), and that a circulation and
parking plan is approved by the City.
The City does not apply special conditions for group homes that are providing services on-site.
The Conditional Use Permit process for Large Community Care Facilities is the same process
required for any conditionally permitted use in the City and includes an opportunity for input
from the community.
The City’s regulations already allow for flexibility in parking requirements to accommodate large
group homes throughout Del Mar. However, the existing 1,000-foot spacing requirement could
be a constraint. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to reduce the required spacing
distance between Large Community Care facilities from 1,000 feet to 300 feet to reduce
potential constraints on the development of such facilities (Program 6).
Boardinghouse or Lodginghouse
A “Boardinghouse” or “lodginghouse” is defined in the Zoning Ordinance as “a building where
lodging and meals are provided for compensation, but not including rest homes.” These uses
are permitted in the RM-S Zone. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance regulation of
boardinghouse/lodginghouse to expressly exclude community care facilities meeting State
Lanterman Act or transitional/supportive housing (see discussions below) meeting State Health
and Safety Code definition of regular rental housing (Programs 5 and 6).
Farmworker Housing
The City does not have any land zoned for or in agriculture production. According to the
American Community Survey, no residents were employed in the farming industry. Therefore,
there is no need for farmworker housing in Del Mar.
Transitional and Supportive Housing
Transitional housing is a type of supportive housing used to facilitate the movement of homeless
individuals and families to permanent housing. California law defines "transitional housing" and
"transitional housing development" as buildings configured as rental housing developments, but
operated under program requirements that call for the termination of assistance and
recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient after a predetermined
period, not less than six months (Health and Safety Code Section 50675.2). Residents of
transitional housing are usually connected to supportive services designed to assist the homeless
in achieving greater economic independence and a permanent, stable living situation.
Supportive housing links the provision of housing and social services for the homeless, people
with disabilities, and a variety of other special needs populations. State law defines “supportive
housing” as housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by low income adults with
disabilities, and that is linked to on-site or off-site services that assist the supportive housing
resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her
                                                                                     City of Del Mar
Page 50                                                                  2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                   192

ability to live and, when possible, work in the community (California Health and Safety Code
Section 50675.14).
Currently, Del Mar’s Zoning Ordinance does not explicitly address transitional or supportive
housing facilities. The Zoning Ordinance will be amended to specifically define
transitional/supportive housing. Transitional housing pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section
50801(i) will be permitted in all zones where housing is permitted and subject to the same
development standards as the same type of housing in that zone. Supportive housing pursuant
to Health and Safety Code Section 50675.14(a)(B)(2) will be permitted in all zones where housing
is permitted and subject to the same development standards as the same type of housing in
that zone.
Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Units
SRO units are one-room units intended for occupancy by a single individual. They are distinct
from a studio or efficiency unit, in that a studio is a one-room unit that must contain its own
kitchen and bathroom. Although SRO units are not required to have their own kitchen or
bathroom, many SROs have one or the other. Currently, the City’s Zoning Ordinance does not
address SRO units. In order to help accommodate the housing needs of extremely low income
households, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to include provisions for SROs.
Emergency Shelters
The Del Mar Zoning Ordinance currently does not address emergency shelters for the homeless.
Consistent with State law, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to accommodate
emergency shelters in the North Commercial (NC) zone. This zone encompasses 15 parcels
totaling roughly 15 acres. Many of the existing uses are underutilized and could be retrofitted as
emergency shelters. Adequate capacity exists to accommodate an emergency shelter for at
least 11 homeless individuals (identified unsheltered homeless population in Del Mar) and at least
one year-round emergency shelter.         The North Commercial Zone is located along a major
circulation corridor, Jimmy Durante Boulevard, an area served by municipal services and near
the site of a proposed regional rail transit stop at the Del Mar Fairgrounds. Locations in the North
Commercial Zone are ideal for housing persons who would require access to social and
supportive services.
6. Development Application Fees
The City charges various fees to cover the costs of processing development permit applications
and providing certain services and utilities. In 2008, the City commissioned a study to analyze
the administrative costs incurred to process planning and land use applications. The study
included a detailed review of the various services staff performs to process the applications,
functions such as: intake; publishing of public hearing notices; coordinating reviews by other City
departments; project analysis; preparation of staff reports; attendance at public hearings; and
all of the follow-up documentation required to shepherd the proposal from application to permit
entitlement. The detailed study showed that, based on the fees in place at the time of the
study, the City recovered from developers only a small portion of the actual costs incurred to
process development applications. The current fee schedule became effective February 12,

2010, and which is summarized in Table 30. Under the fee schedule, the City recovers a
portion but not all of the City’s administrative costs for processing development applications.
However, even under the 2010 fee schedule, the review of development applications in Del Mar
is still subsidized by the City’s General Fund. The City’s Engineering fees, also effective February
12, 2010, are summarized in Table 31.
Some development application fees are charged as a flat rate lump sum. These fees are
revised annually to reflect changes to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The charges for some
application types, due to their complexity, are based on the recovery of the actual
administrative costs that will be incurred by the City in processing of particular application,
essentially a time-and-material recovery charge. In such cases, a deposit is required, submitted
at the time of application, in accordance with Initial Deposit figure listed in the Schedule of Fees

required to complete the processing of an application. Any unspent portion of a deposit will be
returned to the applicant following completion of the application review process.

     Notes:
     *Fee amount covers one review cycle unless otherwise noted. Additional review, if necessary, is deposit based.
     **Three review cycles.
The City also applies a charge fee to all discretionary applications (including non-residential) to
create a reserve of funds to support the periodic updates to the City’s Community Plan
mandated by state law. The surcharge is also intended to support associated updates to the
City’s Zoning Code. A 10 percent surcharge is added to applications that require payment of a
flat fee. For deposit applications, the surcharge is 10 percent of the initial deposit or $1,000,
whichever is less. Where multiple applications are submitted concurrently for a project, only one
Community Plan/Zoning code Update charge is required and is based on the amount of the
highest of the fees or deposits required for the submitted applications. The charges that are
collected are placed in a reserve account dedicated to funding Community Plan and Zoning
code updates.
The discretionary permit fees described above are separate and distinct from the ministerial
Building Permits required for new and remodeled structures. Building Permit fees are based on
the structure’s square footage size.
In addition to City fees charged at the time building permits are issued, developers are required
to pay school impact fees. The amount of school fees is controlled by State law. Considering
the high cost of land in Del Mar, the fees charged by the City and school district do not create a
constraint to the construction of market rate housing. The fees only comprise a very small
percentage (generally less than five percent) of the entire cost to construct a residence in Del
Mar. Other than the referenced school impact fees and the requirement for payment of an In-
lieu Mitigation fee for condominium conversions, the City does not require payment of impact
fees.
                                                                                                                    City of Del Mar
Page 54                                                                                               2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                                  196

The Director of Planning and Community Development may waive all, or a portion of, planning
fees for projects that include affordable housing units, as those units are defined in the Del Mar
Housing Element. Furthermore, upon written request, the City Manager may waive all or a
portion of, planning fees or charges when unique circumstances exist that warrant the request.
Examples of such unique circumstances include but are not limited to, requests from non-profit
organizations or in cases of demonstrated financial hardship.
Overall, total planning and development fees, including Building Permit Fees, for a typical single-
family unit are estimated at $18,000 and total fees for a typical multi-family unit are estimated at
$16,000. Given the high cost of land and therefore the overall high cost of development in Del
Mar, fees represent only a minute portion (generally less that 2%) of the overall cost of
development. Furthermore, because the City continues to subsidize a portion of the cost to
process development applications for market-rate housing and empowers City staff to waive all
or a portion of planning fees for affordable housing projects or in response to demonstrated
financial hardship, development application fees in Del Mar are not a significant constraint to
the construction or maintenance of adequate housing for all socio economic segments of the
community.
7. On-/Off-Site Improvements
The infrastructure in Del Mar is fully developed and well maintained. As a result, only minimal on
or off-site improvements are required for most new development. Typical on-site improvements
consist of curbs, gutters, sewers/water, and sidewalks. Required off-site improvements are also
minimal and directly relate to project impacts. For example, a project approval may be
accompanied by conditions for localized street and intersection improvements. The City’s
residential street standards require 40 feet of paved width. But again, because the City’s
infrastructure is largely in place and because there is minimal land available for subdivisions,
requirements for construction of new public streets or other significant infrastructure is very rare.
The required public improvement standards are used primarily to ensure that the existing
roadways adjacent to new residential construction maintain or provide the appropriate right-of-
way. In conclusion, given the completely developed nature of the City’s infrastructure, the cost
to developers of providing public facilities is relatively low when compared to other parts of the
region where the infrastructure is not already available or is inadequate to serve new
development.
8. Building Codes and Enforcement
Del Mar has adopted the 2010 California Building Standards Code with minor amendments that
affect all land uses in the City. Specifically, the City modified the Code to regulate roofing
materials and eave construction for enhanced fire protection. The California Building Standards
Code is considered the minimum necessary to protect the public health, safety, and welfare.
Like many of the smaller cities in San Diego County, Del Mar contracts with a private company
for Building Department services, including plan check and inspection.

                                                  197

Code Enforcement is conducted on a complaint basis. Staff conducts field inspections,
prepares written notices/orders for code compliance, verifies compliance measures, prepares
reports and requests for action by nuisance abatement, and educates the public on storm
water compliance. Code Enforcement issues Notices of Violations to obtain compliance and
issues infraction citation Notices to Appear. The enforcement program highlights voluntary non-
judicial compliance with an emphasis upon public awareness of governmental regulatory
provisions.
9. Local Processing and Permit Procedures
To a small degree, the permit review process required by Del Mar can contribute to the cost of
housing in that holding land through the entitlement period can be costly. The following
describes typical time requirements for processing a permit for a single-family home in Del Mar:
        Design Review Board – 6 weeks
        Drainage Review – 1 month
        Follow-up – 1 month
Design Review
All new residential construction is subject to some level of site plan review and architectural
review which, in Del Mar, is termed Design Review. The Del Mar Design Review process is
intended to preserve and improve the scenic amenities of Del Mar and to protect the City’s
natural environment, its scenic vistas and the community’s overall aesthetic quality. The Design
Review process encourages good design, including the use of harmonious materials and colors,
and the appropriate use of landscaping.
As part of the review process, application proposals are evaluated for their consistency with the
provisions of the Del Mar Community Plan and with the City’s Zoning Ordinance. In reviewing a
Design Review application, City staff and the Design Review Board also evaluates the project’s
consistency with the applicable Design Review standards, which are codified in the Municipal
Code. For multi-family housing, the following design standards apply:
        That all developments shall reflect imaginative design in keeping with the village-like
         character of Del Mar.
        That all developments shall maximize the amount of park-like, unobstructed, non-
         vehicular open space.
        That the design of any development, the landscaping, scale, height, length, width, bulk,
         coverage, and exterior appearance of any structures shall be in harmony with
         neighborhood character and with developments on nearby lots.
        That the shape and size of any developments, and especially any portion of any
         development which exceeds one story in height, shall minimize the blockage of views
         and direct sunlight from nearby lots and public rights-of-way.
        That identical building facades on adjacent parcels shall be avoided.
        The Design Review Board shall consider siting alternatives, building size and bulk
         constraints, landscaping requirements, and other design improvements as may be
                                                                                   City of Del Mar
Page 56                                                                 2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                 198

         reasonably required to preserve and enhance the integrity, public use, enjoyment, and
         public visibility to and from public open spaces, the beach, and the beach bluffs.
The Design Review Board’s review involves an evaluation of a structure’s placement and size,
the materials and colors to be used, and in the case of a new structure, the type and extent of
the landscaping proposed. It also involves an evaluation of the project’s compatibility with the
uses and design of structures on surrounding properties.
Design Review standards are structured such that the application will be approved unless a
determination is made, supported by findings of fact, that a project violates one or more of the
Design Review Ordinance standards. Project approval is generally conditional, with conditions
attached, as necessary, to ensure the project’s continued compatibility with the Design Review
and Zoning Ordinances, and to address health and safety issues.
It is important to note that the Design Review process is not in and of itself an impediment to
development of housing in general or affordable housing in particular. Nearly every Design
Review application submitted is approved. In the past fifteen years, 645 applications for Design
Review Permits were submitted. Of these 643, applications, or 99.68 percent were conditionally
approved. The two actions that were taken to deny a Design Review application occurred only
after findings had been made that the proposed site plan or building design represented an
egregious violation of the Design Review Ordinance that would have resulted in a project that
adversely affected the health, safety or welfare of the community.
With these facts in mind, the City’s design review process cannot be considered an undue
barrier to the provision of housing. To ensure that the Design Review process described herein
continues to rely on appropriate standards and processes, the City will continue its periodic
monitoring and evaluation of the Design Review Ordinance Standards and their application
processes to ensure that they do not present an undue constraint on new housing proposals.
This provides certainty to property owners and other project applicants that if a project is
proposed in a manner that does not present an egregious violation of the health, safety and
welfare provisions of the Design Review standards, the project will be approved.
As a related note, in order to further ensure that the process does not constrain opportunities for
affordable housing, the City’s schedule of fees for recovering the administrative costs of
processing development applications, including those for Design Review Permits, includes a fee
waiver for projects with an affordable housing component. Additionally the City’s Second
Dwelling Unit ordinance exempts such projects from the requirement for receipt of a Design
Review Permit.
More detailed information about the Design Review Process is provided below.
The Design Review process includes the following steps:
        Pre-Application Conference:         To process an application most effectively, a pre-
         application conference with a member of the Planning Department is highly
         recommended (but not required). A pre-application conference is allows prospective

                                                  199

        applications to get early feedback and direction from City staff on initial development
        concepts. It is structured to help applications prepare a complete formal application
        and a project design that is consistent with the City’s development regulations.
       Formal Application: After the initial submittal of the application, the project will be
        assigned to a member of the Planning Department for a detailed analysis. The planner
        reviews the application for completeness and for compliance with the applicable Zoning
        Codes. If it is determined that the application is missing information, or is somehow
        inconsistent with one or more provisions of the Zoning Code, it will be deemed
        Incomplete. The Design Review application will also be deemed incomplete for projects
        requiring a Conditional Use Permit or other Planning Commission review, until such
        approval is received.
       Story Pole Plan & Certification: Story Poles are required to be erected 15 days prior to the
        Design Review public hearing and certified by a licensed land surveyor or civil engineer
        10 days prior to the Design Review Board’s meeting.
       Design Review Board Hearing: Once deemed complete, the application is scheduled
        for consideration by the seven-member Design Review Board at a noticed public
        hearing. Generally, there is a five-week period between the time of submittal and the
        scheduled hearing date. A staff report is prepared describing the project and the
        applicable standards of review. After the close of public testimony, the Design Review
        Board renders a decision to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the application.
        Per the Design Review Ordinance, an application may only be denied by the Design
        Review Board if findings of fact are made demonstrating that the proposed project will
        violate one or more of the standards of review contained in the Design Review
        Ordinance intended to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community. In some
        instances, an application may be continued to a subsequent meeting to allow staff to
        gather additional information or to allow an applicant the opportunity to modify project
        plans.
       Appeal Period: The decision of the Design Review Board is final unless a written appeal is
        filed with the City Clerk, accompanied with a processing fee, within ten working days
        from the date of notice of the action taken on the application. Appeals are forwarded
        to the City Council. The City Council can decide to reject the appeal, thereby
        upholding the Design Review Board’s decision, or to set the matter for a subsequent date
        for a new (de novo) public hearing review.
For the convenience of property owner’s, their agents and interested parties, detailed
information about the Design Review process is posted on the City’s website To ensure
consistency of application of the City’s Design Review Ordinance, the City will develop a set of
design guidelines to provide to property owners, applicants, and members of the Design Review
Board guidance on how the DRO standards are applied to development proposals.

Historic Preservation Overlay
The City has identified several properties within the City that warrant additional protection to
preserve their historic character. Affected properties must meet more stringent design
requirements. Only three such properties are identified within residential zones (RM-West, RM-
Central, and R-2). They were included at a time when the structures on those sites were used for
non-residential purposes. Two other affected properties are located in the Central Commercial
Zone. In estimating the capacity for future residential development (see Housing Resources
section), the City has excluded the properties identified with a Historic Preservation Overlay.
Open Space Overlay
The Open Space Overlay zone allows development consistent with the underlying zoning, but
requires that any proposed development receive a Conditional Use Permit (CUP). This process
allows the City to evaluate the proposed development for compliance with the criteria
described in the Open Space Element of the Community Plan. The CUP is reviewed by the
Planning Commission. As a result, the Open Space Overlay may add an additional two-month
processing time, albeit to a very limited number of properties.
10.      Housing for Persons with Disabilities
State law requires cities, as part of their Housing Elements, to analyze potential and actual
constraints to the development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons with
disabilities. It also requires that local governments take actions to remove governmental
constraints that would hinder the accommodation of housing for persons with disabilities. The
Housing Element Update must also include programs that remove constraints or provide
reasonable accommodations for housing designed for persons with disabilities. The analysis of
constraints must touch upon each of three general categories: 1) zoning/land use; 2) permit and
processing procedures; and 3) building codes and other factors, including design, location and
discrimination, which could limit the availability of housing for disabled persons.
Reasonable Accommodation
Persons with mobility disabilities may require modifications to their living quarters such as access
ramps, wider doors and hallways, larger bathrooms, and lowered countertops. The City
enforces the California Building Standards Code which provides flexibility in the design of
housing for persons with disabilities.
Information concerning reasonable accommodation, including information about the benefits
of applying Universal Design, is readily available from City staff. Staff is trained on Universal
Design principles and provides information about Universal Design to property owners and their
agents. The City is not aware of any instance wherein its regulations have had an adverse
impact on the availability or cost of housing for persons with disabilities.
Both the federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act require
local governments to make reasonable accommodations in their zoning laws and other land
use regulations and practices when such accommodations are necessary to afford disabled
persons with an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.
City of Del Mar
2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                    Page 59
                                                  201
Reasonable accommodation in the land use and zoning context means providing individuals
with disabilities or developers of housing for people with disabilities, flexibility in the application
of land use and zoning and building regulations, policies, practices and procedures, or even
waiving certain requirements, when it is necessary to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities.
The City does not currently have a formal procedure for considering reasonable
accommodation requests. To mitigate this constraint, within 12 months of City Council adoption
of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City will adopt an ordinance to provide for a ministerial
review of requests for reasonable accommodation for those portions of new and remodeled
dwelling units necessary to construct structural components directly related to providing
accommodations for persons with disabilities in a manner consistent with state and federal law.
Community Care Facilities
The City of Del Mar Municipal Code explicitly allows Small Community Care Facilities as a “by
right” use in all of its residential zones, including the Residential Commercial zone. A Small
Community Care Facility is defined in the Zoning Ordinance as: “Any facility, place, or building
that is maintained and operated to provide non-medical residential care, day treatment, adult
day care or foster family agency services for children, adults, or children and adults, including
but not limited to, the physically handicapped, mentally impaired, incompetent persons, and
abused or neglected children consistent with State law (CA Health and Safety Code Sections
1500 et.seqitur).” Pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 1566.3, such facilities are treated
in a unique manner with respect to licensing. No conditional use permit, zoning variance, or
other zoning clearance is required for a Small Community Care Facility which is not required of a
family dwelling of the same type in the same zone.
A Large Community Care Facility is defined as: “Any facility, place or building, serving seven or
more persons, that is maintained and operated to provide non-medical residential care, day
treatment, adult day care or foster family agency services for children, adults, or children and
adults, including but not limited to, the physically handicapped, mentally impaired,
incompetent persons, and abused or neglected children consistent with State law (CA Health
and Safety Code Sections 1500 et. seqitur).” These facilities are conditionally allowed in the RM,
R-2, and RC zones, provided that there is at least 1,000 linear feet between Large Community
Care Facilities, parking is provided for the operator and employee(s), and that a circulation and
parking plan is approved by the City.
The City does not apply special conditions for group homes that are providing services on-site.
The Conditional Use Permit process for Large Community Care Facilities is the same process
required for any conditionally permitted use in the City and includes an opportunity for input
from the community.
The City’s regulations allow for flexibility in parking requirements accommodate large group
homes throughout Del Mar; however, the 1,000-foot spacing requirement could be a constraint.
Within 12 months of City Council adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City will amend
the Zoning Ordinance to reduce the required distance between Large Community Care
facilities from 1,000 feet to 300 feet so as to reduce potential constraints on the development of
such facilities (Program 5).
                                                                                         City of Del Mar
Page 60                                                                  2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                  202

Occupancy Standards
Currently, the Zoning Ordinance defines a “family” as “an individual, or two or more persons
related by blood, marriage, adoption, or guardianship, or a group of not more than five persons,
excluding servants, who are not so related, living together in a single dwelling unit and
maintaining a common household.” This definition could limit housing choice in “family”
residential zones. California law requires local governments to treat licensed group homes and
residential care facilities with six or fewer residents no differently than other by-right single-family
housing uses. “Six or fewer persons” does not include the operator, the operator’s family or
persons employed as staff. The City must allow these licensed residential care facilities in any
area zoned for residential use, and may not require licensed residential care facilities for six or
less to obtain conditional use permits or variances that are not required of other family dwellings.
To address this potential constraint, within 12 months of City Council adoption of the 2013-2021
Cycle Housing Element, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to define “family” as “one or
more persons living together in a dwelling unit, with common access to, and common use of all
living, kitchen, and eating areas within the dwelling unit” (Program 5).
Fees
As discussed earlier in this section, the City’s fees are reasonable and an appropriate means for
the City to recover a portion of the cost to process development applications. The fee schedule
provides City staff with discretion to waive all or a portion of, planning fees or charges under
unique circumstances. Examples of such unique circumstances include but are not limited to,
requests from non-profit organizations or in cases of demonstrated financial hardship. These
provisions give City staff additional flexibility to reasonably accommodate persons with
disabilities. The City has and will continue to apply this provision to provide appropriate and
reasonable relief in charges required for application processing fees for non-profit organizations
and in cases of hardship.
Building Codes and Enforcement
The City of Del Mar has adopted and implements the 2010 version of the California Building
Standards Code with minor local amendments pertaining to roofing and eave construction for
enhanced fire safety. These local amendments do not diminish the ability to accommodate
persons with disabilities. The City strives to provide reasonable accommodation for persons with
disabilities in the enforcement of building codes and the issuance of building permits.
Conclusion
The City has reviewed all of its zoning laws, policies and practices for compliance with fair
housing law and has also reviewed the San Diego Regional Analysis of Impediments to Fair
Housing Choices and has identified the existing 1,000-foot spacing requirement for large
community care facilities and the definition of “family” to be potential constraints on the
provision of housing for persons with disabilities. The City will implement Program 6 to remove
these identified constraints.

11.      State Policies and Regulations
State policies and regulations may also serve to constrain housing development in local
communities.
Article 34 of the California Constitution
Article 34 was enacted in 1950. It requires that low-rent housing projects developed,
constructed, or acquired in any manner by any State or public agency, including cities, receive
voter approval through the referendum process. No such projects have been proposed in Del
Mar and, therefore, the residents of Del Mar have not been asked to vote on a referendum to
allow the City to develop, construct, or acquire affordable housing.
California Health and Safety Code further clarifies the scope and applicability of Article 34 to
exclude housing projects that have deed-restrictions on less than 49 percent of the units or
rehabilitation/reconstruction of housing projects that are currently deed-restricted or occupied
by lower-income persons. The City has and will continue to apply this provision to provide
appropriate and reasonable relief in charges required for application processing fees for non-
profit organizations and in cases of hardship. Regardless, Article 34 could be an obstacle for
local governments to be directly involved in production of long-term affordable housing on a
larger scale; however, the perceived constraint is the result of a statue that is beyond City
control.
Environmental Protection
State regulations require environmental review of proposed discretionary projects (e.g.,
subdivision maps, use permits, etc.). Costs resulting from fees charged by local government and
private consultants needed to complete the environmental analysis, and from delays caused by
the mandated public review periods, are also added to the cost of housing. However, the
presence of these regulations helps preserve the environment and ensure environmental safety
to Del Mar residents.
C. Infrastructure Constraints
Another factor that could constrain new residential construction is the requirement and cost to
provide adequate infrastructure (major and local streets; water and sewer lines; and street
lighting) needed to serve new residential development. In most cases, where new infrastructure
is required, it is funded by the developer and then dedicated to the City, which is then
responsible for its maintenance. Because the cost of these facilities is generally borne by
developers, it increases the cost of new construction, with much of that increased cost often
“passed on” in as part of home rental or sales rates. However, such infrastructure costs do not
represent a barrier in Del Mar because as a built out community, Del Mar’s infrastructure is,
likewise, built out and in place. Therefore, the high development costs often associated with
installing infrastructure systems in other communities are not found in Del Mar. Additionally, the
infrastructure that is in place provides capacities at rates that can accommodate the City’s
2013-2020 Cycle Regional Housing Needs Allocation of 61 units.
                                                                                   City of Del Mar
Page 62                                                                2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                204

The City of San Diego provides potable water to Del Mar and treats wastewater generated
within the City. Senate Bill 1087 (enacted 2006) requires that water and wastewater service
providers develop written policies that grant priority to proposed development that includes
housing affordable to lower-income households. The legislation also prohibits water and sewer
providers from denying or conditioning the approval of development that includes housing
affordable to lower-income households, unless specific written findings are made. Within 30
days of HCD certification, the City will provide a copy of the adopted Housing Element to the
City of San Diego. The City of Del Mar will also continue to coordinate with the City of San Diego
to ensure that affordable housing developments receive priority service for such utilities.
D. Environmental Constraints
Del Mar is almost completely surrounded by significant natural landforms and natural resources.
The Pacific Ocean lies to the west. The San Dieguito Lagoon and its associated floodplain and
upland hillside areas wrap around the City’s northern and eastern boundaries. The wetlands of
the Los Penasquitos Lagoon form much of the City’s southern border.         These natural features
can present environmental constraints to residential development through requirements for their
protection and due to the fact that they contain natural hazards that sometimes threaten the
public safety and welfare. To protect the public safety and welfare from hazards such as fire,
flooding, landslides, and erosion, the City regulates the amount and/or type of development
allowed within certain high risk areas. The City applies the following overlay zones to land within
the two floodplain areas in the City and on the hillsides, canyons, and bluffs located at various
locations throughout the community. These overlay zones also serve to protect these significant
natural features from environmental degradation, such as increased run off and sedimentation.
       Floodplain Overlay Zone: This overlay zone affects residential property located in the RM-
        East, RM-West, R1-10B, R1-5B, and a northern section of land designated for R1-14.
        Development in identified floodplain areas is regulated not only by city ordinances but
        by standards established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
        Development within the Floodplain Overlay Zone must be designed to be able to
        withstand a 100-year flood as defined by FEMA.
       Bluff, Slope, and Canyon Overlay Zone: This overlay zone affects most R1-40 properties
        and a few parcels designated as R1-14 and R1-10. Specific design criteria and site
        treatment is required for properties affected by the Bluff, Slope, and Canyon Overlay
        zone. The design criteria protect against inappropriate development in steep slope
        areas.
While new development is reviewed for compliance with the public health and safety land use
overlay zone standards noted above, that review has not had an impact on the affordability of
housing in Del Mar.

Housing Resources
This section of the Housing Element Update describes and assesses the resources available to the
City of Del Mar for the development, rehabilitation, and preservation of housing.
A. Regional Housing Needs Allocation
1. Future Housing Needs
A key component of the State Housing Element law is the demonstration of a jurisdiction’s ability
to accommodate new housing. Pursuant to State law, the State Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) provides a regional housing goal number to the San Diego
Association of Governments (SANDAG). SANDAG is then mandated to spread that housing goal
allocation amongst the city and county jurisdictions within the region. In making determinations
on the appropriate allocations to meet allocating the region’s future housing needs to
jurisdictions, SANDAG is required to take the following factors into consideration pursuant to
Section 65584 of the State Government Code:
         Market demand for housing;
         Employment opportunities;
         Availability of suitable sites and public facilities;
         Commuting patterns;
         Type and tenure of housing;
         Loss of units in assisted housing developments;
         Over-concentration of lower income households; and
         Geological and topographical constraints.
SANDAG adopted its Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) in October 2011. This RHNA
covers an 11-year planning period (January 2010 through December 2020) 8 and addresses
housing issues that are related to future growth in the region. The RHNA planning period is slightly
different than the Housing Element planning period, which covers from April 30, 2013 through
April 30, 2021. The RHNA allocates to each city and county a “fair share” of the region’s
projected housing needs by household income group. The major goal of the RHNA is to assure a
fair distribution of housing among cities and counties within the San Diego region, so that every
community provides opportunities for a mix of housing for all economic segments. The housing
allocation targets are not building requirements, but goals for each community to
accommodate housing opportunities through appropriate planning policies and land use
regulations. Allocation targets are intended to assure that adequate sites and zoning are made
available to address anticipated housing demand during the planning period.
8    The RHNA planning period is typically 2.5 years longer than the Housing Element planning period. Jurisdictions are
     allowed to credit units constructed, permitted, and approved during the gap period against the RHNA.
                                                                                                     City of Del Mar
Page 64                                                                               2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                          206

Del Mar’s share of regional future housing needs is 61 new units for the January 1, 2010 to
December 31, 2020 period. This allocation is distributed into various income categories, as shown
in Table 32. The RHNA includes a fair share adjustment which allocates future (construction)
need by each income category in a way that meets the State mandate to reduce the over-
concentration of lower income households in one community.

               Moderate (81% to 120%)                                                              15              24.6%

               Note 1: Pursuant to AB 2634, local jurisdictions are also required to project the housing needs of
               extremely low income households (0-30% AMI). In estimating the number of extremely low income
               households, a jurisdiction can use 50% of the very low income allocation or apportion the very low income
               figure based on Census data. As shown in Table 9, extremely low income households constitute 57% of
               the very low income group. Therefore, the City’s RHNA of 7 very low income units can be split between 4
               extremely low and 3 very low income units. .
               Source: Final Regional Housing Needs Allocation, SANDAG, 2011.
Credits toward the 2013-2020 RHNA
Since the RHNA uses January 1, 2010 as the baseline for growth projections for the RHNA
planning period of 2013-2020, jurisdictions may count toward the RHNA any new units built or
issued certificates of occupancy since January 1, 2010. From January to December 2011, 15
new housing units have been developed in Del Mar. All units were above moderate income
units.
2. RHNA Penalty from the Previous Planning Period
AB 1233 was signed into law on October 5, 2005 and applies to housing elements due on or after
January 1, 2006. Specifically, the law states that if a jurisdiction fails to provide adequate sites in
the prior planning period, within one year of the new cycle, the jurisdiction must rezone/upzone
adequate sites to accommodate the shortfall.                                        This requirement is in addition to
rezoning/upzoning that may be needed to address the RHNA for the new cycle.
This law affects the City of Del Mar’s 2013-2021 Housing Element, requiring the City to address its
deficit in sites for the previous housing element cycle (2005-2012, extended from 2010 by
legislation). The 2005-2012 Del Mar Housing Element was not “certified” by HCD as being in
compliance with State law. Specifically, HCD required the City to demonstrate the feasibility of
its sites inventory for facilitating the development of housing for lower income households.
In the previous planning period, the RHNA assigned to the City of Del Mar was 25 units (6 very
low income, 4 low income, 5 moderate income, and 10 above moderate income units). The
previous RHNA period covered from January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2012. The potential

AB 1233 penalty will be equal to the portion of RHNA not accommodated either through actual
housing production or land made available for residential development within each income
category. To determine any potential penalty, the analysis in this Housing Element uses the
following approach outlined by HCD:
       Step 1: Subtracting the number of housing units constructed, under construction,
        permitted, or approved since January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2012 by
        income/affordability level; and
       Step 2: Subtracting the number of units that could be accommodated on any
        appropriately zoned sites available in the City during the RHNA cycle.
Step 1
The RHNA period for the previous Housing Element covered from January 1, 2003 through
December 31, 2012 (extended from July 1, 2010 by legislation). During this period, 75 housing
units were constructed. All units were in the above moderate income level.
Step 2
The 2005-2010 Housing Element identifies a sites inventory that shows more than 22 acres of
vacant residential land (Table 33). However, none of the City’s vacant sites met the State
default density of 20 units per acre for facilitating lower income housing in small communities
(with population below 25,000). For this reason, HCD determined that the City did not have
adequate sites for its RHNA for lower income households.
The previous Housing Element did identify 29 vacant parcels in the R1 zones where one unit
could be constructed on each parcel. These 29 vacant parcels could accommodate the City’s
10-unit RHNA for above moderate income households. Therefore, the City has incurred a RHNA
penalty of 15 lower and moderate income units from the previous Housing Element period (as
summarized in Table 34).

B. Future Residential Development Potential (Sites Inventory)
1. Vacant Residential Sites
City staff completed a parcel-by-parcel review of properties in the City to identify vacant,
residentially-zoned building sites and to estimate the realistic dwelling unit potential of those
properties. As an older community, many all of Del Mar’s residential neighborhoods are built-
out. The vacant sites primarily consist of individual lots scattered in already developed areas.
None of the listed sites is so constrained by any environmental or other factors so as to prevent its
development.
Overall, the City’s vacant residential sites can accommodate 22 new units. These sites are
primarily zoned R-1. Some of these R-1 lots are large enough to be subdivided into two or more
lots, with a corresponding potential for additional dwelling units. However, that potential
increase has not been factored into the “Potential Number of Unit” figures cited herein.
Three of the vacant properties listed are in the R-2 Zone where, generally, two units are allowed
on sites 7,000 sq. ft. or larger. Given their substandard lot size, these three vacant lots can only
accommodate one unit per site. However, as indicated in the following section, based on their
lot size and the development standards of the R-2 Zone, many of the developed sites in the R-2
Zone hold the potential to accommodating additional residential units.
Given the City’s market conditions, the City’s vacant residential properties are credited against
the City’s RHNA for above moderate income units. Appendix B provides a parcel-specific list of
sites available.

2. Areas with Potential to Accommodate Additional Residential Units
HIGH DENSITY MIXED RESIDENTIAL (R-2) ZONE
As a small, largely built out community, Del Mar has few vacant parcels remaining for residential
development. Given the real estate values in Del Mar, a typical development trend in the
community is the construction of second units on sites in the R-2 Zone where two units are
allowed but where, in many cases, only one unit has been developed on the property.
City staff conducted an analysis of the R-2 Zone lots showing existing uses on the sites, lot sizes,
and the potential for additional units. Overall, 138 R-2 lots were identified as being developed
with only a portion of the residential uses allowed by zoning, with a potential capacity for 166
additional units (see Appendix B). Of these lots, eight are of adequate size to accommodate a
maximum of four additional units. These properties (with a total capacity of 36 additional units)
are capable of accommodating small multi-family developments, such as garden court
apartments and are, therefore, credited against the City’s moderate income RHNA. Based on
the R-2 Zone development standards, the remaining 130 lots could accommodate one
additional unit each. They are credited against the City’s RHNA figures for above moderate
income units. (Refer to Appendix B for a listing of R-2 properties with potential for additional
units.)
CENTRAL COMMERCIAL (CC) ZONE - EXISTING CONDITIONS AND CAPACITY FOR FUTURE
DEVELOPMENT
A limited portion of the future residential development in Del Mar may occur within the City’s
Central Commercial (CC) Zone which extends along Camino del Mar from 15th Street on the
north to 9th Street on the south. The current zoning standards for the Central Commercial Zone
(DMMC Chapter 30.22) encourage mixed-use development including, to a limited extent,
residential uses. The existing conditions of the Central Commercial Zone are described below
with a review of the existing development standards.
                                                                                       City of Del Mar
Page 68                                                                  2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                    210

There are 59 privately held properties in the Central Commercial Zone. The properties sizes vary
with an average size of roughly 8,000 sq. ft. Currently, the Central Commercial Zone provides
an allowable Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 0.45 for development of properties. The allowable
residential density is limited to one dwelling unit per parcel as an accessory to an allowed use on
the site. There are currently two residential units in the CC Zone. Based on a previous
assessment, eight parcels have low redevelopment potential due to their historical values and
existing conditions. Assuming just 10 percent of the remaining 51 parcels ultimately include a
residential unit, five additional units may be accommodated in the CC zone. Given the size of
the potential units, they could be affordable to moderate income households.
ASSIGNMENT OF NEW ZONING DESIGNATION FOR VACANT PROPERTIES IN THE NORTH
COMMERCIAL (NC) ZONE
The City’s North Commercial (NC) Zone allows a mixture of light commercial and light
manufacturing uses. Currently, the NC zoning allows residential development only as an
accessory use, at a density of one unit per parcel.
There are two, commonly owned adjoining vacant sites, in the NC Zone (also with a North
Commercial designation in the Community Plan) for which the owner has expressed an interest
in having a new land use designation applied to the property, one which would allow residential
development by right, at a density range of 20-25 du/ac. Combined, the properties are roughly
2.3 acres in size (APNs 299-10-47 and 48). Using projections for a development proposal with a
density of 18 units per acre, these 2.3 acres would accommodate 41 units. The properties are
shown in Appendix B
Pursuant to Government Code Sections 65583.2(h) and (i), at least 50 percent of the lower
income need must be accommodated on sites designated for residential us and for which
nonresidential uses or mixed use are not permitted. To accommodate the City’s RHNA for lower
income units (22 units – see Table 36), within 12 months of adoption of the 2013-2021 Cycle
Housing Element, the City will pursue a zone code amendment and associated actions to assign
a new land use designation for these two properties allowing residential development at a
density of 20 du/ac or greater. The parcels will be rezoned to permit owner-occupied and rental
multi-family residential use by right (without discretionary approval for the use and allowable
density). These new land use designation will allow a density of 20 du/ac or greater and will
accommodate at least 16 units per site.
The new land use classification will include an inclusionary housing requirement that a
percentage of the dwelling units developed on the properties be offered for sale or rental at
affordable rates. This potential rezone is listed as one of the Sites Inventory Housing Programs
contained in a subsequent section of this Housing Element.

                                                  211

MODIFICATION OF ZONING STANDARDS TO ALLOW INCREASED RESIDENTIAL DENSITY IN THE NORTH
COMMERCIAL (NC) ZONE
The City’s North Commercial (NC) Zone is located along Jimmy Durante Boulevard. Excluding
the two vacant properties noted in the section above, it consists of 13 parcels with a total land
area of 12.94 acres. Currently, the NC Zoning designation allows a mixture of uses, including, to
a limited extent, residential uses. A single dwelling is allowed per building site as an accessory to
another allowed use on the site. The NC Zone allows development at maximum Floor Area Ratio
(FAR) figure of 0.30. The properties in the NC Zone are shown in Appendix B.
Within 24 months of adoption of the 2013-2021 Cycle Housing Element, the City will pursue a
zone code amendment to the NC Zone’s development standards to increase the allowable
residential density to 20 du/ac. Not every parcel, if and when redeveloped, would include a
residential component. Assuming only 10 percent of the acreage would be redeveloped as
mixed use and assuming an average density of 15 units per acre, an estimated 19 units could be
expected to be built in mixed use projects in the NC zone. The zone code amendment will
include consideration for allowance of additional mixed use developments and activities such
as live work units of the type frequently found in artists’ colonies. This potential rezone is listed as
one of the Sites Inventory Housing Programs contained in a subsequent section of this Housing
Element.
MODIFICATION OF ZONING STANDARDS TO ALLOW INCREASED RESIDENTIAL DENSITY IN THE
PROFESSIONAL COMMERCIAL (PC) ZONE
The City’s Professional Commercial (PC) Zone is located along Camino del Mar and consists of
four parcels with a total land area of 1.28 acres. Currently, the PC Zoning designation allows a
mixture of office uses and, to a limited extent, residential uses. A single dwelling is allowed per
building site as an accessory to another allowed use on the site. The PC Zone allows
development at maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) figure of 0.60, the highest FAR of any of the
City’s zones. The properties in the PC Zone are shown in Appendix B.
Within 24 months of adoption of the 2013-2021 Cycle Housing Element, the City will pursue a
zone code amendment to the PC Zone’s development standards to increase the allowable
residential density to 20 du/ac. Assuming only 25 percent of the acreage will include a
residential component and using a conservative assumption of 15 units per acre as an average
density (75 percent of maximum), five units could be expected to be built in mixed projects the
PC zone. This potential rezone is listed as one of the Sites Inventory Housing Programs contained
in a subsequent section of this Housing Element.
MODIFICATION OF ZONING STANDARDS TO ALLOW RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE PUBLIC
FACILITIES (PF) ZONE
There are three properties owned by government entities in the Public Facilities (PF) Zone, two by
the City itself and one by the federal government. The combined area of the parcels is roughly
7.5 acres. Currently, the uses allowed under the PF Zoning designation are limited to public
                                                                                        City of Del Mar
Page 70                                                                    2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                 212

facilities such as post offices, public meeting venues and associated administrative offices.
Currently, the PF Zone does not list a maximum allowable Floor Area Ratio (FAR) figure.
Within 24 months of adoption of the 2013-2021 Cycle Housing Element, the City will prepare an
analysis of the PF Zone properties to determine if they are appropriate for inclusion of residential
uses. The analysis will include considerations such as potential impacts on significant public open
space and compatibility with uses on surrounding properties.
This potential amendment to the PF Zone standards is listed as one of the Sites Inventory Housing
Programs contained in a subsequent section of this Housing Element. However, no residential
capacity is assigned to the PF zone yet as the outcome of the analysis is unknown at this time.
3. Del Mar Fairgrounds Property
The 22nd District Agricultural Association (DAA) owns and operates the Del Mar Fairgrounds. In
2008, the DAA adopted a new Master Plan for the Fairgrounds. It includes the demolition of the
existing 48-room grooms’ dormitory and rebuilding the living quarters in the Backstretch Area.
The City is working with the 22nd DAA to ensure that these new living quarters will be designed as
dwelling units. These units will be available for Fairgrounds and race track workers, many of
whom tend to earn low wages (Program 2-G). On February 19, 2013, the Del Mar City Council
adopted a resolution to initiate a partnership between the City and the 22nd DAA to carry out
shared goals regarding housing at the Fairgrounds property. On March 12, 2013, the Board of
Directors of the 22nd DAA adopted a similar resolution.
4. Summary of Sites Inventory and RHNA Obligations
The City of Del Mar has the capacity to accommodate additional housing growth via new
construction on vacant residential sites, construction of additional units on High- Density
Residential sites, re-designation and subsequent development of vacant properties in the North
Commercial Zone, and, to a limited extent, development in the downtown area (Central
Commercial Zone). Additional housing opportunities will also be provided via modification of
the development standards of the Professional Commercial and North Commercial Zones to
allow residential development at a density of 20 du/ac development and via consideration of
modifying the provisions of the Public Facilities (PF) Zone to allow residential uses.
These activities provide a potential capacity of 258 units, including 65 units within the North
Commercial, Professional Commercial and Central Commercial Zone areas as being feasible to
facilitate and encourage the development of units at rates affordable to lower income
households.
The City has a remaining RHNA of 61 units, including 22 lower income units. Without rezoning, the
City’s sites inventory under existing land use policies could accommodate all of the moderate
and above moderate income RHNA units, with a remaining RHNA obligation of 22 lower income
units. Since rezoning is required to meet this lower income obligation, only half of this obligation
can be met with mixed use zoning, pursuant to State law. The referenced rezoning of vacant

2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                  Page 71
                                                  213

NC Zone sites to a new land use designation that allows residential uses at 20 to 25 units per acre
could fully address the City’s lower income RHNA of 22 units.

C. Financial Resources
The unique circumstances in Del Mar limit the range of financial resources available to the City.
As the smallest city in San Diego County, the City is not entitled to receive federal housing funds
directly from HUD. The extremely high property values in the City disqualify virtually all properties
from public and private mortgage assistance programs. This section discusses the two primary
resources currently available for the provision of affordable housing opportunities in Del Mar.
1. Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program
As a small city, Del Mar is not eligible to receive Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
funding directly from HUD. Instead, the City participates in the CDBG program through a
cooperation agreement with the County of San Diego Department of Housing and Community
Development. Based on its population, the City has been eligible to receive approximately
$17,000 annually from the County.
For a period of time, the allocated, CDBG funds were used to fund a portion of the City’s Rental
Subsidy Program. This program provides direct rental housing subsidies to eight very low income
individuals/households. The program is also partially funded through the City’s Housing
                                                                                          City of Del Mar
Page 72                                                                       2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                        214

Assistance Reserve. However, in 2009, HUD notified that the Housing Subsidy Program was no
longer an eligible project for the CDBG Program. The allocated CDBG funds have since been
used for other community projects.
2. Housing Assistance Reserve (Fund)
To ensure that housing is provided for all economic segments of the population, Del Mar
adopted the Affordable Housing Assistance Program as part of Del Mar’s Zoning Ordinance. The
program establishes affordable housing requirements that are applied to:
     1. The development of multi-family ownership housing;
     2. The conversion of certain existing units to a condominium form of ownership; and
     3. New subdivisions involving ten or more lots.
Under certain circumstances, the Ordinance allows developers to pay a mitigation fee in lieu of
actually setting aside and providing inclusionary affordable housing units otherwise required on
the project site itself. All in-lieu fees collected under the Affordable Housing Assistance program
are deposited into an interest-bearing Housing Reserve. The CDBG funds the City receives are
also deposited into this account. The Reserve currently has a balance of $720,270 and annually
earns approximately 0.6 percent in interest annually.
The monies in the Housing Assistance Fund are exclusively reserved for:
     1. The Rental Subsidy Program, through which low and moderate income household rental
         rates are subsidized;
     2. As projects become viable, the construction of affordable housing units by the City, a
         Community Based Development Organization (CBDO), or for-profit developers;
     3. The maintenance of such affordable units noted above, once constructed; and
     4. The costs of administering of housing programs such as the Rental Subsidy and Shared
         Housing Programs.
3. Infrastructure and Facilities
As a highly urbanized community, infrastructure facilities are available to serve development
throughout Del Mar. The majority of the land designated for residential use is adequately served
by sewer lines, water lines, storm drains, telephones, and electrical and gas lines. As example,
Del Mar currently uses an average of 1,350 acre feet of water per year yet has a capacity to
provide roughly 1,800 acre feet per year. Similarly, the City discharges 0.7 million gallons per day
through its sanitary sewer system but has the infrastructure capacity to discharge 0.877 million
gallons per day. The City’s existing infrastructure and utilities are more than adequate to serve
the 61 units identified in the RHNA. Additionally, with adequate systems in place to serve a
largely “built-out” community, the installation of major infrastructure improvements is generally
not required as a condition of new residential development. Therefore, such costs are not
passed along in increased prices to purchasers of those residences. As a result of these factors,
infrastructure is not seen as a barrier to the construction of new housing.

                                                    215

Safety Considerations for Development Near Railroad Tracks
The City has an active railroad track that carries Amtrak, light-rail commuter and freight trains.
In order to protect public safety, all future public and private development proposals adjacent
to or near the railroad right-of-way (ROW) will be planned and reviewed with the safety of the
rail corridor in mind. The review of new development proposals will take into consideration,
planning for grade separations for major thoroughfares and/or pedestrian accessways and
installation of fencing or other barriers, as appropriate, to limit/direct safe access across the
railroad track.
D. Energy Conservation
As residential energy costs rise, increasing utility costs reduce the affordability of housing,
although Del Mar’s mild climate helps keep energy consumption low for heating and cooling
systems. The City has many opportunities to directly affect energy use within its jurisdiction.
1. Title 24
Title 24 of the California Administrative Code sets forth mandatory energy standards for new
development, and requires adoption of an “energy budget.” The home building industry must
comply with these standards. Localities are responsible for enforcing the energy conservation
regulations. The City applies the standards of Title 24 through the issuance of building permits.
2. Sustainable Del Mar
The City of Del Mar recognizes the connection between its residents and the community. The
City’s vision is to implement enduring development and living practices that meet the needs of
the present while safeguarding and enhancing the future. These principles will guide the City’s
decisions to achieve a Sustainable Del Mar.
In 2006, the City established the Sustainability Advisory Board to assist the City Council in
promoting clean and reliable energy and in taking a leadership position in educating its
residents and businesses about energy savings programs. It works with other regional and
municipal groups to seek combined efforts in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources;
advises the Council on any bills before the California Legislature that the City should take a
position to support or oppose as they affect Del Mar and the San Diego region; and reviews the
Del Mar Municipal Code (DMMC) sections relevant to energy consumption and savings in the
City and works with the Planning Commission and Planning staff to propose revised DMMC
language as required. The City maintains a Sustainable Del Mar webpage on its website,
providing information and guidance on energy and resource conservation.

3. San Diego Gas & Electric Energy Savings Incentives
To promote energy conservation, the City website provides information on programs offered by
the SDG&E. Such programs include:
       SDG&E Home Energy Efficiency Survey: The survey provides a customized report with
        suggestions on ways to save energy.
       Summer Saver: This program rewards the homeowner for reducing electricity use during
        warmer months when demand is highest.
       Energy Upgrade™ California: This program offers incentives of up to $4,000 for qualified
        upgrades that improve a home’s energy efficiency and lowers the energy bills.

Housing Plan
This Section, the eight-year Housing Plan is the centerpiece of the 2013-2021 Housing Element for
Del Mar. It sets forth the City’s goals, policies, and programs to address Del Mar’s identified
housing needs. A number of the policies and programs identified in this Section have already
been adopted by the City and are being implemented. Others, as noted, are in the process of
being adopted by the City but are not yet in an implementation phase. Several other programs
are listed for consideration in the 2013-2021 Housing Element cycle.
Regional Housing Needs Assessment
The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) conducted a Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA) to determine the City’s share of the affordable housing needs for the San
Diego region. The RHNA also established figures for Del Mar’s share of affordable housing needs
for the region. The figure established for Del Mar is 61 additional units to be provided in new
construction in the period of 2013-2020. Since the beginning of the RHNA planning period, the
City has already constructed 15 above moderate income units, reducing the RHNA for this cycle
to 46 units. However, the City has also incurred a 15-unit penalty from the previous Housing
Element cycle. It is the City’s goal to accommodate construction of at least 61 units in that
period and also to provide within that 61-unit figure, opportunities for housing at a variety of
income levels based on the following distribution:
        13 units - Extremely low and Very low income (0-30% and 0-50% County MFI)
         9 units - Low income (51-80% of County MFI)
        20 units - Moderate income (81-120% of County MFI)
        19 units - Above moderate income (>120% of County MFI)
         61 units - Total
The following list of Housing Goals identifies the general methods the City will use to
accommodate its share of regional housing needs. The list is followed by a more detailed
description of the policies and specific methods for achieving the Housing Goals.
A. Housing Goals
The overall housing goals of the City of Del Mar are to:
        Conserve and improve the community’s existing affordable housing stock;
        Encourage and support the development of a wide range of housing opportunities for
         households with a variety of lower income levels; and
        Promote equal and fair housing opportunities.
The goals listed above are described below and on following pages with accompanying
policies.
                                                                                   City of Del Mar

1. Conserve and Improve the Community’s Existing Affordable
     Housing Stock
As part of its goal to preserve the existing community’s housing stock, it is the City’s intent to
avoid the degree of physical decline of residential structures that would require rehabilitation
efforts to restore their quality or value. As noted in previous sections of this Housing Element, Del
Mar is a community with very high land costs that, through market forces, also result in relatively
high housing costs. It is, therefore, necessary that the City continue to use the programs already
in place to conserve affordable housing opportunities and to implement additional programs to
provide opportunities for additional housing units to serve a variety of income levels.
Housing Goal 1: To conserve and improve the community’s existing affordable housing stock.
Policy 1.1: Continue to preserve any affordable housing units that exist within the City.
Policy 1.2: Continue to utilize the City’s code enforcement program to ensure that properties are
maintained in compliance with City codes, thereby avoiding the loss of housing units due to
degradation.
2. Encourage and Support the Development of a Wide Range of
     Housing Opportunities
The City has programs in place that encourage and support the construction of residential units
offering a wide range of housing opportunities. Implementation of this goal ensures the provision
of a balanced inventory of housing types, including single-family residences, townhomes,
condominiums, apartments, Second Dwelling Units and mixed residential/commercial projects.
The City is also in the process of adopting additional programs to further encourage and support
the construction of a variety of housing types.
The City also has programs in place to increase the affordability of existing and new units within
the community for individuals of varying income levels. This includes individuals who have lived
in the Del Mar for many years but have seen their income levels decline and desire to continue
living in the community.
Housing Goal 2: To encourage and support the provision of a wide range of housing
opportunities by location, type, and sales and rental rates in order to meet the existing and
future needs of Del Mar.
Policy 2.1: Provide a variety of residential development opportunities to fulfill the City’s share of
regional housing needs, including single-family residences, townhomes, condominiums,
apartments, mixed residential/commercial projects and second-dwelling units on properties
otherwise zoned for single-family use.
Policy 2.2: Encourage and support the construction of housing for all segments of the
community, including those with special needs.

                                                  219

Policy 2.3: Encourage and support the development of affordable housing by offering incentives
for housing projects that provide housing at established affordable sales and rental rates with
such incentives to include, but not be limited to: density and floor area ratio bonuses; reduced
processing fees; expedited permit processing and reduced parking requirements.
Policy 2.4: Continue to operate and support existing City programs such as the Rental Subsidy
and Shared Housing Programs that, while not involving the construction new residential units, do
offer alternative methods by which to provide affordable housing opportunities.
3. Promote Equal and Fair Housing Opportunities
In order to provide for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community, the City
must and will ensure that equal and fair housing opportunities are available to all persons.
Housing Goal 3: To promote equal opportunities for all residents to reside in the housing of their
choice and capabilities.
Policy 3.1: Prohibit discrimination in the sale or rental of housing with regard to race, color,
religion, national origin, sex, disability, familial status, sexual orientation, marital status, ancestry,
source of income, age or arbitrary discrimination.
Policy 3.2: Continue to implement fair housing choices by actively expanding City programs to
support a range of housing affordability and by removing impediments to the construction of
and access to fair housing.
Policy 3.3: Continue operating existing programs and add new programs that create incentives
for the development of housing in general, and for affordable housing in particular.
B. Housing Programs
The Housing Goals and Policies described above and in previous Sections of this 2013-2021
Housing Element identify Del Mar’s housing needs and generally address how they are to be
implemented through a series of housing programs. The housing programs define the specific
actions the City will take to achieve the housing goals identified for this 2013-2021 Housing
Element cycle. The housing programs set forth in this Section have been grouped based on the
six overall objectives listed below. Because some of the listed objectives address overlapping
topics, some of the corresponding housing programs used to achieve them are, likewise,
described or referenced in multiple locations here in this Section.
Overall Objectives:
     #1. Conserve and improve the City’s existing stock of housing units;
     #2. Provide adequate sites to achieve a variety and diversity of housing types;
     #3. Accommodate the development of new affordable housing opportunities;
     #4. Preserve and expand opportunities for use of existing affordable housing;
                                                                                           City of Del Mar
Page 78                                                                       2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                     220

    #5. Remove governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development
        of affordable housing; and
    #6. Promote equal and fair housing opportunities.
Housing Programs and their Implementation
The housing programs identified in this Section include some already in operation, along with
other programs proposed as additional means to fulfill the City’s unmet affordable housing
needs. It should be noted that some of the proposed programs are still under review by the Del
Mar Planning Commission and City Council and are, therefore, not yet in effect. However, this
Section does identify a schedule for completion of that review process, including the dates by
which the City is committed to adopt and implement the programs.
Summary of Housing Programs
The Housing Program Summary in Table #39 located at the end of this Section summarizes the
eight-year goals for implementation of each of the identified housing programs. Table 39 also
specifies funding sources and responsible agencies, along with the time-frames for
implementation of the programs.
Objective #1 - Conserve and improve the City’s existing stock of
housing units.
Given the high cost of land in Del Mar and the age of existing residential units, a set of
comprehensive programs is critical to preserve and improve existing residential units, particularly
affordable units that provide safe and affordable housing opportunities for all segments of the
community. The following programs (#s 1-3) address this objective.
Programs to Implement Objective #1
1. Program to Amend the City’s Condominium Conversion Ordinance: There is a limited supply
    of rental units in the City, particularly multi-family structures. Multi-family structures are defined
    in the Del Mar Zoning Ordinance as those structures containing four or more dwelling units.
    Studies show that, on average, rental units provide a more affordable rate for housing than
    do for-sale residences. Retention of the existing stock of multi-family rental units does help
    preserve housing opportunities for households with lower income levels.
    Many of the existing multi-family rental units in the community are potentially subject to
    conversion to a condominium form of ownership. If left unchecked, such conversions would
    deplete the City’s stock of multi-family rental housing. It is, therefore, necessary and
    appropriate to have programs in place to guard against the overall reduction of the City’s
    multi-family rental housing stock and thereby preserve access to those units for persons and
    families of lower incomes.
City of Del Mar
2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                         Page 79
                                                     221

   While there is a concern about the loss of multi-family housing stock, it is also recognized that
   condominiums generally offer greater opportunities for lower-priced home ownership than
   do detached single-family units. It is also recognized that due to Del Mar’s high desirability
   as an area in which to live, market forces have resulted in some of the highest rental rates in
   the region. As result, traditional efforts to preserve the stock of rental housing have not
   necessarily translated into opportunities for truly affordable housing. This factor requires the
   City to explore a number of alternative approaches for programs that result in truly
   affordable housing opportunities.
   The City’s existing Condominium Conversion Ordinance (DMMC Chapter 24.21 Dedication:
   Affordable Housing Assistance) is designed to allow the creation of affordable for-sale
   housing opportunities while also minimizing the loss of more affordable rental units. In
   recognition of the impact that condominium conversions have on housing affordability due
   to the loss of rental housing, the Ordinance requires mitigation to offset such impacts. The
   required mitigation comes in two forms, as described below.
   A. Affordable Unit “Set-aside” Mitigation Requirement. The Condominium Conversion
   Ordinance requires that conversions of apartment developments containing three or more
   rental units be conditioned such that two-thirds (67 percent) of the converted units be “set
   aside” and reserved as affordable housing units. The set-aside affordable units are reserved
   for a period of not less than 30 years at rental rates established by the Housing Authority of
   the County of San Diego County as being affordable to persons of extremely low, very low or
   low income levels.
   The two-thirds affordable unit set-aside requirement has served as a disincentive to
   condominium conversions. Over the past decade, there has been virtually no loss of multi-
   family rental housing due to condominium conversions. Property owners have cited the set-
   aside requirement as a factor that makes condominium conversion of multi-family structures
   financially infeasible. The Ordinance has thereby been effective in helping preserve the
   City’s stock of rental housing. However, the lack of proposals for condominium conversions
   has also had an undesired impact on affordable housing. Because there have been no
   conversion authorizations granted, there have been no corresponding mitigation
   requirements for affordable unit set-asides and no units reserved at long-term affordable
   rates.
   To address this issue, the City will amend the Condominium Conversion Ordinance to modify
   the required affordable unit set-aside percentage figure for affordable units from the existing
   2/3rds (67 percent) requirement for developments with three or more units to a set-aside
   figure of between 10 percent and 30 percent for developments with six or more units, with
   that specific percentage figure to be determined as part of the code amendment process.
   Under this provision, the requirement for an affordable unit set-aside of greater than one-half
   unit would be rounded up to the next whole number. Condominium conversions of 5 units or
   less would be exempt from the affordable housing set-aside mitigation requirement, but
   would be required to pay an In-lieu Housing Mitigation Fee (described below) for every
   rental unit converted to condominium ownership.
                                                                                      City of Del Mar
Page 80                                                                 2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                222

    The City will also amend the code to provide another mitigation measure as an alternative
    to the onsite set-aside requirement, that being the acquisition and donation to a non-profit
    agency of a like-sized dwelling unit(s) at another location in the community to be reserved
    for use as affordable housing. The code amendment referenced herein will also include
    establishment of new mitigation measures to assist the persons dwelling in the apartments to
    be converted find alternative housing.
    B. In-lieu Housing Mitigation Fees. The other form of mitigation used by the City to offset the
    impacts that development projects have on affordable housing is the payment of what are
    known as In-lieu Housing Mitigation Fees. The Municipal Code requires payment of such fees
    to offset the impact of the loss of rental housing stock in cases of condominium conversions
    of structures with less than three units. In these cases, payment of an In-lieu Housing
    Mitigation Fee is required for each of the units to be converted from rental to condominium
    status. As noted above, developments with more than two units are required to set aside a
    percentage of the units converted from rental to condominium ownership as previously
    described.
    The In-lieu Housing Mitigation Fees collected through this program are deposited into the
    City’s Housing Assistance Reserve Fund (see Chapter 24.21.050 of DMMC), a designated
    account which is used to fund the City’s Rental Subsidy Program. The Rental Subsidy
    Program provides subsidies to individuals and families in the extremely low, very low, and low
    income range, allowing them to reside in a community where market rates for rental of a
    residential unit would otherwise be prohibitive. The Rental Subsidy Program is described in
    greater detail in another part of this Housing Plan.
    The funds in the City’s Housing Assistance Reserve Fund are also available for other programs
    that provide affordable housing opportunities, such as the acquisition of land and
    construction of affordable units. However, to date, the accumulation of fees in the City’s
    Housing Assistance Reserve Fund has not grown to a level that would support the high cost
    of land acquisition or construction costs for affordable units in the 2013-2021 Housing Element
    cycle. The City will review the rate of the In-lieu Housing Mitigation Fee to determine its
    appropriateness in mitigating the impacts of condominium conversions.
    Eight-Year Objectives:
     1-A.   The City will continue to implement the Condominium Conversion Ordinance
            affordable unit set-aside and In-lieu Housing Mitigation Fee requirements in order to
            preserve the existing stock of apartment units and to accrue In-lieu Housing
            Mitigation funds where conversions do occur.
     1-B.   Within 12 months of City Council adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City
            will amend the Condominium Conversion Ordinance to modify the affordable unit
            set-aside requirement to a 10-percent, rather than a 67-percent figure with the 10-
            percent figure rounded to the next highest whole number.

    1-C.  Within 12 months of City Council adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City
          will also amend the Condominium Conversion Ordinance to allow a property owner
          to satisfy the affordable unit set-aside mitigation requirement by instead paying an In-
          lieu Housing Mitigation Fee for each apartment unit converted in condominium
          conversion proposals involving 2-5 apartments.
    1-D.  Within 12 months of City Council adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City
          will amend the Condominium Conversion Ordinance to allow a property owner to
          satisfy the affordable unit set-aside mitigation requirement by acquiring and
          donating to the City, or to a qualified housing advocacy organization, another
          dwelling unit in the City of a like size and condition to be reserved for use as
          affordable housing.
    1-E.  The City will continue to make the funds accrued in the City’s Housing Assistance
          Reserve available for implementation of existing affordable housing programs such
          as the Rental Subsidy Program. The funds will also be available for other programs
          such as the acquisition of land and construction of affordable units or acquisition of
          residential units to be made available for individuals or families of extremely low, very
          low or low income levels or for assistance for displaced individuals or families of
          extremely low, very low or low income.
    1-F.  Within 12 months of City Council adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City
          will review the existing rate of the In-lieu Housing Mitigation Fee to determine if a rate
          increase is appropriate and justifiable to mitigate the impact that condominium
          conversions have on affordable housing.
    1-G.  Although not strictly a condominium conversion issue, within 12 months of City council
          adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City will amend the Zoning
          Ordinance to require the payment of an In-lieu Housing Mitigation Fee in cases where
          other development proposals, in addition to condominium conversions, would have
          an adverse impact on the affordable housing opportunities. Specifically, the City will
          amend the Municipal Code to require payment of In-lieu Housing Mitigation Fee in
          cases where a proposed development project would result in a net loss in the
          number of residential units on a property.

2. Program for Preservation of Rental Housing Stock and Nonconforming Multi-family Densities:
   Most affordable housing opportunities in Del Mar are provided in multi-family structures.
   Many structures do not conform to current City codes regarding development standards,
   such as building height or setbacks; or allowed uses, such as maximum allowable residential
   density because many such structures where built either prior to the City’s incorporation or
   under prior development regulations.
                                                                                     City of Del Mar
Page 82                                                                  2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                 224

    In most cases, the Del Mar Municipal Code requires that buildings with structural or use
    nonconformities be abated when they undergo major modification, either by voluntary or
    involuntary actions. However, in order to preserve the City’s multi-family housing stock and
    the relatively affordable housing opportunities they represent, the Zoning Ordinance
    provides a specific allowance for such structures to be significantly remodeled or even
    rebuilt with their previous structural and density nonconformities. This allows for the
    reconstruction and/or alteration of nonconforming multi-family developments without the
    requirement for abatement of the nonconformities preserves housing stock that would
    otherwise be lost.
    The Municipal Code prohibits the conversion of multi-family residential developments from
    rentals to condominiums in cases where their density exceeds that allowable by the zoning
    district in which the development(s) is located. This prohibition on conversion of over-density
    developments has served to limit the loss of rental housing stock. However, it has not resulted
    in the preservation or creation of truly affordable housing because of the previously
    discussed high rental rates that exist in Del Mar. As a result, the opportunities to gain truly
    affordable housing through the affordable unit set-aside and In-lieu Housing Mitigation Fee
    requirements of the City’s Condominium Conversion Ordinance have not been realized.
    Based on these factors, the City will amend the Municipal Code to allow owners of
    properties that are nonconforming with respect to residential density to convert the rental
    units to a condominium form of ownership. While this allowance for condominium
    conversions for nonconforming residential densities would result in the conversion of existing
    apartment housing stock, the proposal is being pursued based on the following
    considerations:
         1) Although the prohibition on conversion of nonconforming residential densities does
              preserve the overall stock of rental housing, market forces in Del Mar result in rental
              fees that are far higher than recognized affordable housing rates.
         2) The suggested proposal to allow conversion of multi-family residential developments
              with nonconforming densities from rentals to condominiums would be accompanied
              by a requirement that such conversions be conditioned for the affordable unit set-
              aside requirement. Under that requirement, a percentage of the converted units (in
              the range of 10 to 30 percent) or two units, whichever figure is greater, would be set
              aside for rental at affordable rates for a period of at least 30 years. The specific
              percentage figure would be determined as part of the Municipal Code amendment
              process.
    The referenced code amendment will include provisions to limit the number of condominium
    conversions authorized in any 12-month period, along with the previously described
    mitigation measures to assist those persons who would be displaced by a condominium
    conversion find alternative housing. It should be noted that inasmuch as there are currently
    no designated affordable units in the community, there would be no conversion of such
    units.

   Eight-Year Objectives:
    1-H.  The City will continue to allow the retention of structural and residential density non-
          conformities for multi-family structures containing three or more units without a
          requirement for abatement of such nonconformities when the structure undergoes
          major renovation or replacement. To accommodate the “sprucing up” of older
          buildings, the City will also amend the Municipal Code to allow flexibility for a
          property owner to make structural modifications that improve the aesthetics of the
          nonconforming structure without a requirement for abatement of the nonconformity.
          Such allowance would retain the prohibition on expansion or exacerbation of a
          nonconformity.      The City will also establish an education/outreach program to
          apprise property owners of the opportunities for structural modifications available
          under the Municipal Code.
    1-I.  Within 36 months of City Council adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City
          will amend the Municipal Code to allow the owner of an existing multi-family
          apartment building(s) which is nonconforming with respect to residential density, to
          convert the building(s) to condominiums with the proviso that, as mitigation for the
          conversion, a portion of the converted units be set aside for affordable housing. The
          amended code section would establish requirements for the number of units to be
          set aside for affordable housing, with that figure to be in the range of 10 percent to
          30 percent of the converted units, and specifying that, as applicable, the set-aside
          percentage figure would be rounded to the next highest whole number.
          The amended code section would also establish a limit on the number of
          condominium conversions allowed in any 12-month period.
          As is required under the City’s Condominium Conversion Ordinance, the affordable
          set-aside units would be subject to recordation of a deed restriction setting forth the
          required affordable rental or sales rate for no less than the minimum duration
          required under state housing law.
    1-J   Within 12 months of City Council adoption of the Housing Element, the City will
          amend the provisions of the Condominium Conversion Ordinance to require, in
          addition to other applicable mitigation measures, requirements that authorizations for
          condominium conversions be conditioned to include: 1) a minimum waiting period
          following City authorization of the Condominium Conversion to allow dwellers of the
          apartments to be converted time to locate replacement housing; 2) funds to be
          provided to dwellers of the apartments to be converted to assist in the costs of
          securing and moving to replacement housing; 3) and the right of first refusal for
          purchase of the converted units by the dwellers of the apartments to be converted.

3. Program for Zoning Ordinance Enforcement/Building Code Compliance: Due to the high
    value of property in Del Mar, the loss of the community’s housing stock due to degradation
    has not been perceived as a major issue in the protection of affordable housing.
    Nevertheless, the City implements a code enforcement program to correct housing and
    building code violations as they occur. Del Mar has adopted the California Building Code
    (CBC) and contracts with the EsGil Corporation to enforce the provisions of the CBC and
    protect against affordable housing unit degradation.
    Enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance is performed by city staff. The City’s primary intent is
    to gain compliance. The City attempts to encourage the landowners to correct zoning
    violations voluntarily prior to using more formal code enforcement measures such citations or
    administrative hearings. However, when such attempts fail, the City uses other measures
    and legal actions, as necessary, to gain compliance.
    Eight-Year Objective:
    1-K.     The City will continue to guard against affordable housing unit degradation through
             enforcement of the City’s Zoning Ordinance and the California Building Code, either
             by City staff or by contract with the EsGil Corporation or other qualified service
             provider.

Objective #2 - Provide adequate sites to achieve a variety of
housing types.
A key element in satisfying the affordable housing needs of a particular city, and the larger
region, is ensuring that the community’s land use designations accommodate the construction
of a variety of housing types that serve the needs and financial capabilities of all individuals and
families in the community.
Programs to Implement Objective #2
4. Program for Implementing the Community Development Element and Zoning Ordinance: The
    land use designations contained in the Community Development Element of the Del Mar
    Community Plan identify land within the City for residential densities ranging from 1 dwelling
    unit per acre to 17.6 units per acre. For the RM-East, RM-West, RM-Central and RM-South
    Zones, the ability to develop at the maximum specified density is accompanied by a
    requirement for receipt of a discretionary authorization, a Conditional Use Permit (CUP)
    issued by the City’s Planning Commission.
    While much of Del Mar is built out, there are some neighborhoods where properties are
    typically developed at a lower density than is allowed pursuant to the development
City of Del Mar
2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                   Page 85
                                                  227

   standards specified for the zoning district. This is particularly true for the R-2 Zone where the
   majority of properties are between 7,000 and 8,000 sq. ft. in area. The allowed density of 12.5
   dwelling units per acre accommodates two dwelling units on lots larger than 7,000 sq. ft. A
   recent trend has resulted in the redevelopment of properties with two dwelling units rather
   than retaining the one existing dwelling unit. Over the past ten years, 10 of the 153
   properties in the R-2 Zone have been redeveloped in this fashion, resulting in a net increase
   of 10 dwelling units. Another 72 properties in the R-2 Zone hold the potential for a similar
   increase in development of residential units.
   The following features of the City’s existing Zoning Ordinance facilitate the development of
   properties in a manner that provides opportunities for affordable housing:
       1) Provisions for mixed-use developments, with residential units as an allowed project
            component, in the Residential-Commercial, Professional Commercial, North
            Commercial, and Central Commercial land use designations.
       2) Provisions to allow in-fill development in residential zones at the density assigned for
            such zones.
       3) Provisions and incentives for the construction of Affordable Second Dwelling units in
            zoning districts where development is otherwise limited to one single-family residence
            per parcel. The Second Dwelling Unit ordinance is described in detail in a separate
            segment of this Housing Plan.
   In addition to the measures described above for the City’s existing residential land use
   designations, the City’s will pursue amendments to its land use policies and regulations to
   accommodate affordable housing opportunities in the 2013-2021 Housing Element through
   the measures listed and described below.
   A. Land Use Re-designations and Modification of Zoning Standards to Accommodate
   Higher Density Residential Development.
   1. Within 12 months of adoption of the Housing Element, the City will apply a new land use
       designation to two vacant parcels roughly 2.3 acres in size and currently zoned as North
       Commercial Zone (APNs 299-10-47, 48) to allow residential development by right, at a
       density of 20-25 du/ac.
   2. In addition to the land use re-designation noted immediately above, the City will also,
       within 24 months of adoption of the Housing Element, pursue amendments to the City’s
       North Commercial (NC) and Professional Commercial (PC) Zones expanding the list of
       uses allowed by right in those zones to include residential uses at a density of 20 du/ac
       for projects that include an affordable housing component.
   3. Within two years of the Housing Element adoption, the City will establish appropriate
       development standards to facilitate high-density residential development in the NC and
       PC zones, allowing potential development to reach 20 units per acre as outlined above.
   4. In addition to the zoning modifications for the NC and PC Zones noted above, the City
       will also explore the potential modification of the development standards of other zones
                                                                                       City of Del Mar
Page 86                                                                   2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                228

         to also allow residential development at a density of 20 du/ac.                This land use
         modification/re-designation analysis process will include meetings with the community,
         members of the City’s Housing Corporation (a Community Based Development
         Organization) and with non-profit developers to determine if there are other properties
         for which such re-designation would be appropriate. Factors to be considered would
         include: compatibility with surrounding land uses, proximity to mass transit, and
         availability of infrastructure to serve residential development at a density of 20 du/ac.
    5. The City will also explore a modification of the zoning standards of the Public Facilities
         (PF) Zone to determine if any of the three government owned properties that have a PF
         Zone designation would be appropriate for siting of residential uses.
    B. Housing at the Del Mar Fairgrounds Property. The 22nd District Agricultural Association
    (22nd DAA) property, commonly known as the Del Mar Fairgrounds, occupies roughly 20% of
    the land area of the City of Del Mar. In 2012, the 22nd DAA adopted a Master Plan for the
    property. One of the components of the Master Plan is the construction of housing to be
    used, in part, by seasonal workers employed at the site. That component calls for the
    demolition of existing dormitory style housing and construction of 78 residential units. The City
    is working with the 22nd DAA to ensure that the new units will be designed and constructed in
    a manner to meet the definition of dwelling units under the California Building Code and the
    U.S. Census Bureau, thereby providing an additional 78 residential units that are typically
    available to employees with lower level incomes.
    Cumulative Ability of City Land Use Designations to Accommodate Housing Needs
    Based on the land use measures described above and summarized below, the City provides
    sufficient land to meet Del Mar’s remaining 61-unit share of regional housing growth needs
    for the 2013-2021 period.
         1) The allowable development capacity for residential units as designated for the City’s
             various land use districts and zones in the Community (General) Plan and Zoning
             Code/Map;
         2) The adoption of amendments to the zoning standards of the North Commercial (NC)
             and Professional Commercial (NC) Zones to include, among the list of uses allowed
             by right, residential development at a density of 20 du/ac;
         3) The assignment of a new land use designation for a set of vacant properties in the
             North Commercial Zone to allow residential development at a density of 20-25
             du/ac.
         4) Exploration of the assignment of modified land use designations to other properties in
             the community to accommodate residential development at a density of 20 du/ac.
         5) Inclusion of a housing component in the 22nd DAA Fairgrounds Master Plan at a
             residential density of not less than 20 dwelling units per acre.

   Eight-Year Objectives:
    2-A.  The City will continue to implement and augment the Community Development
          Element of the Community (General) Plan and the Zoning Ordinance. The objective
          is to provide opportunities and incentives for the construction of a minimum of 42
          residential units during the 2013-2021 period that are affordable for persons of
          extremely low, very low, low and moderate incomes.
    2-B.  Within 12 months of certification of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City will adopt
          an amendment to the Municipal Code that would remove the requirement for
          receipt of a Conditional Use Permit in order to develop at the maximum allowable
          density of 17.6 du/ac for properties in the RM-East, RM-West, RM-Central and RM-
          South Zones.
    2-C.  The City will maintain a record of sites suitable for residential development and
          provide that information to all interested developers, property owners and the public.
    2-D.  The City will hold workshops and prepare materials to apprise the public and both
          for- profit and non-profit developers of the opportunities for residential and mixed-use
          development throughout the City’s various zoning districts.
   2-E.   Within 24 months of City Council adoption of the Housing Element, the City will
          amend the provisions of the North Commercial (NC) zone to allow residential
          development at a density of 20 du/ac for projects that include an affordable housing
          component.
   2-F.   Within 24 months of City Council adoption of the Housing Element, the City will
          amend the provisions of the Professional Commercial (PC) zone to allow residential
          development at a density of 20 du/ac for projects that include an affordable housing
          component.
   2-G.   Pursuant to Government Code Sections 65583.2(h) an (i), within 12 month of City
          Council adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City will assign a new land
          use designation to two adjacent vacant parcels, roughly 2.3 acres in size in the NC
          Zone, to allow, by right, residential development of the properties at a density of 20-
          25 du/ac with such density allowance to include a requirement for a percentage of
          the residential units to be available, long-term, at affordable rates, either through
          dedication to a non-profit housing advocacy organization or through deed
          restrictions for no less than the minimum duration required under state housing law
          applicable to affordable dwelling units.
   2-H.   The City will conduct an analysis of governmental owned properties and consider
          modifying the provisions of the Public Facility (PF) zone to allow residential uses at
          appropriate locations but with a required affordable housing component for any
          residential proposal and with a prohibition on siting residential uses in parks or open
          space areas.
                                                                                     City of Del Mar

                                                230

    2-I.     Within 12 month of City Council adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City
             will complete a property record and conduct public workshops to identify other
             properties that would be appropriate for a land use re-designation to accommodate
             residential development at a density of 20 du/ac.
    2-J.     Within 24 months of City Council adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City
             will assign land use designations in the City’s Community (General) Plan, Local
             Coastal Program (LCP), and Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map that accommodate
             residential development at an allowable density of 20 dwelling units per acre (20
             du/ac) for that portion of the 22nd District Agricultural Association (22nd DAA)
             Fairgrounds property located in the City’s corporate boundaries. The assignment of
             this land use classification will accommodate construction of dwelling units on the
             Fairgrounds property in the manner identified in the 22nd DAA’s Master Plan for the
             Fairgrounds property.

5. Program to Provide Sites for Homeless Shelters/Transitional Housing: The City of Del Mar has
    an estimated homeless population of 11 persons, according to the Regional Task Force on
    the Homeless. The majority of these homeless persons are day laborers and seasonal farm
    workers. Currently, there are no permanent or year round homeless facilities located in the
    City. However, along with congregations in neighboring jurisdictions, St. Peter’s Church in Del
    Mar participates in the annual Interfaith Shelter Network Rotating Shelter. This program
    provides temporary housing for homeless persons from September to May. The shelter
    rotates from congregation to congregation, operating two weeks at a time per location. St.
    Peter’s participation in the Rotating Shelter Program provides homeless shelter opportunities
    within the City. Saint Peter’s Church, also operates a year-round program called Helping
    Hands that provides sack lunches, clothing and hygiene products to homeless persons. The
    program operates from 9:00am to 1:00 p.m. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday and
    serves between 10 and 15 persons each day.
    The 22nd DAA Fairgrounds property also contains housing units that are not utilized year
    round, but which hold the potential to provide emergency housing during the winter months.
    Pursuant to state law, proposals for development or use of a community care facility for six or
    fewer persons must be processed using the same regulations applicable to proposals for
    residential units in that zone. Under this provision of state law, a community care facility also
    includes any residential facility, residential care facility for the elderly, day care agencies,
    home-finding agencies, small group homes and foster family homes. Small group homes for
    six or fewer persons may also be located in any of the City’s residential districts by right.
    Under the City’s Zoning Ordinance, small community care facilities are allowed by right in
    the City’s RM-East, RM-west, RM- Central and RM-South Zones.

   Eight-Year Objectives:
   2-K.     Within 12 months of adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City will modify
            its zoning code to permit emergency shelters as a permitted use in the North
            Commercial Zone via a ministerial process without discretionary review. This zoning
            code amendment will establish appropriate performance standards for emergency
            shelters, including: number of beds; required parking; required on-site management;
            required security; hours of operation; noise regulations; and restrictions on loitering.
   2-L.     Within 12 months of adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City will modify
            its zoning code to include provisions for Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) units.
   2-M.     The City will continue to encourage local congregations to participate with the
            Interfaith Shelter Network Rotating Shelter and will also encourage St. Peter’s
            Episcopal Church to continue its Helping Hands program.
   2-N.     The City will actively work to encourage the 22nd DAA and Thoroughbred Club to
            utilize both its existing dormitory-style housing units and the proposed residential units
            described in Fairgrounds Master Plan to provide emergency housing during the
            winter months.
   2-O.     Within 12 months of adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the Zoning
            Ordinance will be amended to specifically define transitional/supportive housing.
            Transitional housing pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 50801(i) will be
            permitted in all zones where housing is permitted and subject to the same
            development standards for similar housing types in that zone. Supportive housing
            pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 50675.14(a)(B)(2) will be permitted in all
            zones where housing is permitted and subject to the same development standards as
            other housing in that zone.

6. Program to Provide Sites for Special Needs Housing: Pursuant to State housing laws, the City
   will address the provision of housing for persons with special needs, including persons with
   disabilities and extremely low incomes. The Housing Constraints section of this Housing
   Element provides detailed discussions on the City’s existing policies on the provision of
   various housing options. The City will facilitate a range of housing options during the 2013-
   2021 Housing Element period through the following actions.
   Eight-Year Objectives:
   2-P.     The City will continue to permit community care facilities through the same zoning
            provisions applicable to residential units in the zone in which they are proposed.
   2-Q.     Within 12 months of the adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City will
            amend the zoning code to reduce the 1,000-linear foot minimum spacing
                                                                                       City of Del Mar
Page 90                                                                    2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                    232

            requirement for community care facilities to 300-linear foot minimum spacing, and to
            expressly exclude community care facilities from the definition of lodging and
            boardinghouse.
    2-R.    Within 12 months of the adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City will
            amend the zoning code to permit manufactured homes meeting state and federal
            standards and installed on permanent foundation to qualify as a regular single-family
            use.
    2-S.    The zoning code currently defines a “family” as “an individual, or two or more persons
            related by blood, marriage, adoption, or guardianship, or a group of not more than
            five persons, excluding servants, who are not so related, living together in a single
            dwelling unit and maintaining a common household.” Within 12 months of the
            adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City will amend the zoning code to
            amend the definition of family as necessary and appropriate to ensure clarity and
            remove any potential constraints to housing for persons with disabilities and large
            households.

Objective #3 - Accommodate the development of new affordable
housing opportunities
New construction is a major source of housing for prospective homeowners and renters.
However, with the limited amount of undeveloped land available in Del Mar, and with the high
cost of the land that is available, other programs are also necessary to provide opportunities for
affordable housing.
Programs to Implement Objective #3
7. Rental Subsidy Program: The City’s Rental Subsidy Program currently provides rent subsidies to
    eight (8) very low income households, with incomes less than 50 percent of the Median
    Family Income for San Diego County.              This program recognizes the constraints on
    opportunities for affordable housing in Del Mar due to the extremely high cost of land that
    make the construction of new affordable housing units economically infeasible. The program
    instead offers affordable housing in existing structures.
    The Rental Subsidy Program is funded through the use of In-lieu Housing Mitigation Fees
    collected as conditions of approval for subdivisions of land of 10 parcels or more, and
    through conditions attached to condominium conversions. Based on providing subsidies for
    eight individuals and families, the draw-down on the City’s Housing Assistance Reserve Fund
    is roughly $72,000 annually. As of September 2012, there is approximately $727,270 in the
City of Del Mar
2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                 Page 91
                                                 233

   Housing Assistance Reserve account. The City’s Housing Assistance Reserve Fund account
   earns interest at roughly .06 percent annually.
   If the requirement for payment of In-lieu Housing Mitigation Fees were made applicable to
   other actions that have an impact on affordable housing, such as developments that result
   in a net loss of dwelling units, the funds in the City’s Housing Assistance Reserve Fund would
   be increased, thereby providing an opportunity to also increase the number of individuals
   and families served by the Rental Subsidy Program.
   Eight-Year Objectives:
    3-A. The City will continue to utilize Housing Assistance Reserve to fund rental subsidies to
            income qualified households. Within 24 months of City Council adoption of the 2013-
            2021 Housing Element, the City will consider the use of other potential funding sources
            to increase the number of individuals and families served by the program from eight
            to 16 individuals and families. Funding will be prioritized for extremely low income
            households, seniors, and persons with disabilities.
    3-B.    Within 12 months of City Council adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City
            will consider whether to increase the fee rate of the In-lieu Housing Mitigation Fee to
            more appropriately off-set the impacts that subdivisions, condominium conversions
            and other projects that result in a net loss of housing units have on affordable housing
            opportunities. The options for a fee increase include raising the level of the existing
            flat fee or establishing a fee based on a percentage of indexed market values of
            similar condominium units. As part of that evaluation, the City will also explore
            whether the set-aside requirement or In-lieu Housing Fee for affordable units currently
            applicable to subdivisions of 10 lots or more should also be applied as a condition of
            approval for subdivisions of less than ten lots. The City will also consider setting aside
            a portion of the In-Lieu Housing Fee to benefit extremely low income households.
    3-C.    Within 12 months of City Council adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City
            will consider adopting an ordinance requiring that payment of a Housing Mitigation
            Fee be applied as a condition of approval of those projects that result in a net
            reduction in the number of dwelling units on a property. This requirement shall not
            apply in cases where the net reduction in the number of dwelling units brings a
            nonconforming parcel into compliance with maximum residential density limitations
            applicable to the parcel’s current zoning designation. If adopted, the City will also
            consider setting aside a portion of the Housing Mitigation Fee to benefit extremely
            low income households.

8. Program for Second-Dwelling-Units: Second-Dwelling-Units, often termed granny flats or
   accessory apartments, provide an opportunity for the construction of affordable housing
   units in a community. By enacting an ordinance that accommodates the construction of
                                                                                      City of Del Mar
Page 92                                                                    2013-2021 Housing Element
                                                 234

    Second-Dwelling-Units, a city can address a rental housing deficit and also assist low and
    moderate income homeowners gain supplemental income from renting the affordable unit.
    Second-Dwelling-Units can also increase the City’s property tax base and thereby help the
    City accrue funds to be used for affordable housing programs.
    The State of California enacted Government Code Section 65852.2 (a.k.a. second-unit law)
    in 1982 and later amended it to encourage the creation of Second-Dwelling-Units. The
    legislation (Government Code 65800) allowed local jurisdictions to tailor their ordinances so
    as to address the unique circumstances and conditions of their communities. The applicable
    section of the State Law is Government Code Section 65852.150.
    The statute allows local jurisdictions the flexibility to set development standards for Second-
    Dwelling-Units, including limitations on unit sizes, heights, setbacks and minimum parking
    requirements. While a local jurisdiction may set development standards, the State Law does
    require that proposals for second-units be subject only to ministerial, rather than
    discretionary, approval. Second-Dwelling-Units approved in the required ministerial process
    are also statutorily exempt from CEQA.
    A local government may apply quantifiable, fixed and objective standards, such as height,
    setback, and lot coverage requirements so the Second-Dwelling-Units will be compatible
    with other structures in the neighborhood. The local ordinance may require the use of
    building materials for Second-Dwelling-Units that are compatible with the materials of
    existing structures on the property. A local government may designate areas appropriate for
    Second-Dwelling-Units based on criteria such as the adequacy of water and sewer services
    and the impact of Second-Dwelling-Units on traffic flow. At the same time, each local
    jurisdiction must adopt an ordinance with the intent of facilitating the development of
    Second-Dwelling-Units in appropriate residential zones and must allow for their development
    without arbitrary, excessive, or burdensome review and approval requirements.
    A local government may also establish flexible zoning requirements, development standards,
    expedited processing and fee waivers or reductions in order to create incentives for the
    construction of Second-Dwelling-Units. Such incentives may include reduced parking
    requirements or methodologies (such as allowing tandem parking), fee waivers or deferrals,
    reduced impact fees, reduced water and sewer connection fees, setback reductions, and
    streamlined design review.
    The City of Del Mar enacted a Second-Dwelling-Unit Ordinance in 1999 to allow the
    construction of Second-Dwelling-Units on properties otherwise zoned for single-family
    development.        Due to limited available land within the City, Second-Dwelling-Unit
    construction is a very important element to the City in its efforts to provide opportunities for
    affordable housing. The Ordinance applies to the Very Low Density (R1-40), Modified Low
    Density (R1-14), Low Density (R1-10), and Low Density-Beach (R1-10B) districts, each of which
    otherwise allows a single-family residence on each building site. In brief, the Ordinance
    allows units a Second-Dwelling-Unit to be constructed within these districts if all of the
    following parameters are met:
City of Del Mar
2013-2021 Housing Element                                                                   Page 93
                                                  235

        1) The parcel meets the minimum lot size specified for the underlying zone;
        2) The Second-Dwelling-Unit does not exceed 550 square feet in floor area;
        3) The rental fee charged for the second unit is affordable to individuals that qualify as
           low income;
        4) The Second-Dwelling-Unit is deed-restricted for rental to only low income individuals
           for at least 30 years;
        5) If in a detached structure, the Second-Dwelling-Unit does not exceed a building
           height of 14 feet and, if in a separate structure, is also located a minimum of six feet
           from any other structure;
        6) The property is not located within one of the City’s sensitive resource areas, namely
           the Bluff/Slope and Canyon, Open Space, Historic, Coastal Bluffs or Lagoon Overlay
           zones; and
        7) At least one off-street parking space (covered or uncovered) is provided.
   The existing Ordinance includes incentives for construction of Second-Dwelling-Units. These
   include: 1) a far more streamlined review process than is applicable to other building
   projects in the community; 2) a lower off-street parking requirement than is applicable to
   other residences (one rather than two spaces and elimination of the requirement for parking
   to be enclosed within a garage); and 3) a waiver of the requirement for receipt of a Design
   Review Permit.
   However, despite the allowances of the Second-Dwelling-Unit Ordinance and the incentives
   it provides, there have been no Second-Dwelling-Units proposed or implemented in the 13
   years that the Ordinance has been in place.
   There are a number of dwelling units within Del Mar that were constructed or converted
   without the benefit of required permits. In some cases, these dwelling units are not allowed
   uses and/or exceed the allowed residential density of the zoning for the property. Because
   many of these units are of a smaller size than other legally created rental units, they provide
   a relatively affordable rental opportunity.
   For this 2013-2021 Housing Element cycle, the City has included proposals for additional
   incentives in the Second-Dwelling-Unit Program as a means by which to increase the use of
   the Program. They include:
        1) Additional building floor area of up to 550 sq. ft. above the maximum allowable Floor
           Area Ratio (FAR) for the property. In a community where land costs are high and
           Floor Area Ratios are strictly regulated, the provision of this additional building floor
           area is a major incentive and, as such, is anticipated to generate requests for
           property owners to avail themselves of the opportunities to construct Second-
           Dwelling-Units;
        2) Allowances for rear yard setback encroachments; and
        3) An amnesty program to allow unpermitted dwelling units that qualify for Second-
           Dwelling-Unit status to gain legal status.
                                                                                     City of Del Mar

                                                 236

    Eight-Year Objectives:
     3-D.   The City will continue to accommodate and promote the construction of affordable
            Second-Dwelling-Units by increasing the public awareness of the Second-Dwelling-
            Unit program. The specific goal is to have 8 new Second-Dwelling-Units constructed
            during the 2013-2021 period.
     3-E.   Within 12 months of City Council adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City
            will consider the adoption of an amendment to the Zoning Code to provide
            additional incentives for property owners to pursue authorizations for and construct
            Second-Dwelling-Units. The incentives to be considered will include, but not be
            limited to, the following:
                 1) The granting of a maximum 550 sq. ft. Floor Area Ratio (FAR) exemption for a
                     Second Dwelling Unit that meets all of the parameters and requirements of
                     the Second Dwelling Unit Ordinance.
                 2) An allowance for encroachments into otherwise required rear-yard setbacks,
                     provided a minimum setback of ten (10) feet is provided adjacent to any
                     residentially zoned property.
            As part of this amendment to the Zoning Code, the City will also consider amending
            the provisions of the Second- Dwelling Unit Ordinance to remove the existing
            prohibition on locating Second-Dwelling Units (SDU) on sites located in special overlay
            zones, provided that the SDU structure complies with siting requirements of such
            special overlay zone with respect to protection of sensitive resources.
     3-F.   Within 24 months of City Council adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City
            will explore the enactment of an amnesty program under which property owners with
            illegal second units could apply for authorization to retain the illegal units provided
            they comply with both of the following parameters:
                 1) The structure in which the illegal unit is located complies with or is retrofitted to
                     comply with the applicable standards of the California Building Code,
                     including minimum dwelling-unit-size requirements; and
                 2) The second dwelling unit is reserved and deed restricted at rental rates for low
                     or very low income households.
            In order to minimize adverse impacts on established neighborhoods and to provide a
            transition period for installation of Second-Dwelling-Units in otherwise single-family
            residential neighborhoods, the City will monitor the effects that construction of
            Second-Dwelling Units have on the character of the surrounding neighborhood. If
            detrimental impacts are found to be occurring, the City may establish a caveat that
            not more than a specified number of Second-Dwelling-Units be authorized in any
            calendar year. The zoning amendments would also contain the caveat that the 550
            sq. ft. FAR exemption would not be offered for sites where the property’s structures
            already exceed the allowable FAR specified per the underlying zoning designation.

Objective #4 - Preserve and expand opportunities for use of existing
affordable housing.
In order to provide a wide range of housing options, the City relies on a number of programs
intended to increase access to affordable housing by lower income households.
Programs to Implement Objective #4
9. Program for Shared Housing: Since February 1995, Del Mar has had a program to provide
    shared housing opportunities within the City. The program is administered by a non-profit
    organization, Del Mar Community Connections. The Shared Housing Program provides free
    roommate referral service to help Del Mar residents find a person to share their home. The
    program also works with local senior citizens to locate a helper to live in their house and assist
    around the house in exchange for free rent. Between 1999 and 2012, 62 individuals were
    provided low cost housing through a wide segment of the Shared Housing Program. Other
    referral services provided by Del Mar Community Connections include: job counseling,
    emergency shelter, tenant-landlord legal advice, Meals on Wheels, mediations and senior
    care. Even though the implementation of these programs by Del Mar Community
    Connections will not result in the construction of new affordable housing units, Del Mar is
    committed to providing housing-related assistance in a manner that is responsive to the
    needs of a wide segment of the families in the City.
    Eight-Year Objectives:
     4-A.   The City will continue to offer shared housing services to residents of Del Mar to
            achieve at least five credits under the affordable housing goal.
     4-B.   The City will continue to work with Community Connections to keep records on the
            duration of each Shared Housing match. This will allow the City to track housing
            accomplishment(s) and to evaluate the program’s effectiveness.

10. Program for Housing Choice Vouchers: Since 1976, Del Mar has been a member of the San
    Diego County Housing Authority and its Section 8 Housing Assistance Program, now termed
    the Housing Choice Voucher Program. The Program extends rental assistance to very low

    monthly income and the actual rent. The Housing Voucher Program is separate and distinct
    from the City’s own Rental Subsidy Program.
    Eight-Year Objectives:
     4-C.   The City will continue to contract with the San Diego County Housing Authority to
            administer the Housing Voucher Program.
     4-D.   The City will continue to support the County Housing Authority’s applications for
            additional allocation or Housing Choice Voucher funds.
     4-E.   The City will continue to promote the Housing Choice Voucher Program to owners
            and residents of City-approved Second-Dwelling-Units.

11. Program for Residential Density Bonus: In 2003, the City of Del Mar adopted an updated
    ordinance to implement the State density bonus requirements in Government Code Section
    65915-65918. The State’s mandated density bonuses are implemented through Chapter
    30.90 of the Del Mar Municipal Code. Under that ordinance, a density bonus of up to 25
    percent is available for projects where the property owner allocates either a minimum of 10
    percent of the dwelling units for very low income households or 20 percent of the residential
    units to low income households. The density bonus is also available where 50 percent of the
    units are made available for “qualifying residents” (e.g. seniors). Under the ordinance, in
    addition to the density bonus, the City must grant one additional concession, such as
    reduced application processing fees or expedited project reviews, to accommodate the
    construction of the housing at a reduced cost to the developer. In order to receive the
    density bonus, the property owner must record a deed restriction committing that the
    designated units will be available for sales or rental rates at the assigned affordability ranges
    for a minimum of 30 years. The ordinance also requires that the City apply a monitoring
    program to ensure continued compliance with affordability commitment.
    However, the City’s density bonus provisions have not been updated to reflect current State
    Density Bonus Law. Current State law reduces the amount of units that a developer must
    provide in order to receive a density bonus by providing a sliding scale of required
    affordable units and incremental bonuses. State Density Bonus law also requires the City to
    provide up to three concessions, depending upon the percentage of affordable units that
    the developer provides. Developers can receive a density bonus of up to 35 percent,
    depending on the proportion of units set aside for lower or moderate income households. It
    also imposes a new land donation rule, and statewide parking standards.

                                                 239

    Eight-Year Objectives:
     4-F.   Within 12 months of the adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City will
            amend the zoning code to be consistent with the State Density Bonus Ordinance.
     4-G.   The City will continue to educate citizens and prospective applicants of the
            opportunities available under the City’s density bonus ordinance.

12. Program for Inclusionary Affordable Housing for Subdivisions: The City has adopted an
    Inclusionary subdivision ordinance for subdivisions as Chapter 24.21 of the Del Mar Municipal
    Code. The ordinance requires that a proposed subdivision of land resulting in 10 lots or more
    provide affordable housing opportunities by either; 1) reserving one of every 10 of those the
    homes ultimately constructed on the subdivided lots for rental at affordable rates for a
    period of not less than 30 years; or 2) paying an In-lieu Housing Mitigation Fee. As explained
    in a previous segment of this Housing Plan, the In-lieu Housing Mitigation Fees accrued by the
    City are used to support the City’s Rental Subsidy Program wherein rents are provided to
    individuals and families of very low income, thereby allowing them to reside in the
    community where market rental rates would otherwise be prohibitive. The accrued in-lieu
    funds may also be used to acquire land and construct housing to be made available for
    rental or sale at affordable rates.
    Eight-Year Objective:
     4-H.   The City will continue to enforce Chapter 24.21 of the Del Mar Municipal Code to
            proposed subdivisions. Within 12 months of adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing
            Element, the City will adopt an amendment to the Municipal Code to apply the set-
            aside/in-lieu fee requirement not only to subdivisions of 10 or more lots but also to
            subdivisions of six or more lots. The review process for this amendment will include
            consideration of the balance between the desirability of establishing a wider scope
            of mitigation for affordable housing against the perceived barrier that applying the
            affordable unit set-aside or In-lieu Housing Mitigation Fee on subdivisions of six or more
            lots would have on proposed housing subdivisions. That balance will include
            consideration of the concern that application of either of these mitigation
            requirements might dissuade property owners from pursuing subdivisions that would
            otherwise increase the number of properties available for new housing units in the
            community.

13. Program to Continue Coastal Zone Requirements: The entirety of the City is located within the
    coastal zone. Government Code Section 65588(d) requires that coastal zone cities such as
    Del Mar include within their Housing Elements all of the following:
          1) A review of the number of housing units approved for construction within the coastal
             zone after January 1, 1982;
          2) The number of housing units for persons and families of low or moderate income
             provided in new housing developments either within the coastal zone or within three
             miles of the coastal zone;
          3) The number of existing residential units occupied by persons and families of low or
             moderate income that have been authorized to be demolished or converted since
             January 1, 1982 in the coastal zone; and
          4) The number of residential units for persons and families of low or moderate income
             that have been required for replacement of residential units.
    Eight-Year Objective:
     4-I.    The City will continue to monitor and maintain records regarding the affordability of
             new construction, conversion, and demolition of residential units within the City limits
             in order to comply with Section 65588(d) of the Government Code.

14. Program to Provide City’s Housing Assistance Reserve Funding: The City provides funding for
    its Rental Subsidy Program through the use of in-lieu fees deposited into the City’s Housing
    Assistance Reserve account. The source of this funding is described in another part of this
    Section of the Housing Element - Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program for Subdivisions.
    However, the funding levels from these sources are limited. The State HCD also administers a
    wide variety of affordable housing programs, some of which may be available to the City, to
    help provide permanent or long-term affordable housing opportunities in Del Mar.
    Five-Year Objectives:
     4-J.    Note: Program deleted as it was repetitive of Program 3-C. Numbering of remaining
             programs retained for continuity.
     4-K.    The City will continue to monitor and evaluate available State funding programs for
             use in the provision of affordable housing programs.
     4-L.    The City will continue to work with local non-profit housing organizations to apply for
             available State funding to implement additional affordable housing programs.

      4-M.   The City will support qualified affordable housing developers in their applications for
             State and federal City’s Housing Assistance Reserve Funds, provided the proposed
             projects/programs are consistent with the goals and policies of the City.
      4-N.   The City will monitor the affordability covenants and restrictions of all future
             affordable housing created through City efforts to ensure compliance with the goals,
             objectives, and program guidelines for affordable housing funds.

15. Homeownership Assistance: The San Diego Regional Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC)
     Program allows qualified first-time homebuyers to reduce their federal income tax by up to
     20 percent of the annual interest paid on a mortgage loan. With less being paid in taxes, the
     homebuyer's net earnings and capital increase, enabling him/her to more easily qualify for a
     mortgage loan and to accumulate funds for a down payment. Currently the City of Del Mar
     is not enrolled in this program.
     4-O.    Within 12 months of City Council adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City
             will take the necessary steps to enroll in the Mortgage Credit Certificate Program and
             will distribute information about the availability and benefits of the Program.

Objective #5 - Remove governmental constraints to the
maintenance, improvement, and development of affordable
housing.
Under State law, the Del Mar’s land use regulations and a Housing Program in the Housing
Element must address and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental
constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of affordable housing. The
following programs are designed to remove or reduce governmental constraints to the
development of affordable housing.
Programs to Implement Objective #5
16. Program to Waive Fees for Affordable Housing: Waiving the project review application fees
     for affordable housing developments reduces the cost of construction and increases the
     affordability of the units for lower income households.         The City’s Schedule of Fees for
     Planning and Land Use Services, adopted by City Council ordinance in 2009, offers a
     reduction or waiver of Planning and Land Use application fees for those projects that include
     an affordable housing component.
                                                                                        City of Del Mar

                                                   242

    Eight-Year Objective:
     5-A.   The City will continue its application processing fee reduction/waiver program and
            related policies that remove or reduce governmental constraints for those projects
            that include an affordable housing component.
    Funding:                    General Fund
    Responsible Agency:         Planning and Community Development
17. Program to Streamline Development Processing: Streamlining the development review
    process for affordable housing development reduces the cost associated with financing
    land acquisition while the project’s discretionary reviews and ministerial approvals can be
    obtained.
    Eight-Year Objective:
     5-B.   The City will continue to implement the development processing streamlining
            program for affordable housing development proposals. Under this program,
            affordable housing developments are guaranteed priority processing.
    Funding:                    None required
    Responsible Agency:         Planning and Community Development
18. Program for Providing Housing for Persons with Disabilities: Streamlining the processing of
    permits required for modifications to housing necessary to make them suitable for a person
    with disabilities helps to remove constraints to construction or retrofitting housing units for
    those with special needs for such specially equipped housing.
    Eight-Year Objectives:
     5-C.   Within 12 months of the adoption of the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City will also
            adopt streamlined procedures for processing reasonable accommodation requests
            by persons with disabilities for flexibility in the implementation of land use and zoning
            regulations, in order to allow equal access to and enjoyment of housing.
     5-D.   The City will continue to provide information to the public in general and architects in
            particular about the benefits for adoption of universal design elements of the Uniform
            Building Code.
      5-E.  In the 2013-2021 Housing Element cycle, the City will consider an amendment to the
            Zoning Ordinance to provide a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) exemption to allow additional
            floor area for the retrofit of existing residences as necessary solely for providing
            improvements to increase accessibility for persons with disabilities and for
            encroachments into setbacks for exterior access ramps.

Objective #6 - Promote equal and fair housing opportunities.
In order to make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the
community, the City’s Housing Programs must include actions that promote equal housing
opportunities for all persons regardless of race, religion, sex, family size, marital status, ancestry,
national origin, color, age disability/medical conditions, sexual orientation or source of income.
Program to Implement Objective #6
19. Program for Fair Housing: Del Mar contracts with Del Mar Community Connections to
    promote and coordinate shared housing opportunities in the City (see #9. Shared Housing
    Program) and to provide mediation and legal assistance to residents, property owners and
    property managers in Del Mar.
    In 2010, the City, along with all other jurisdictions in San Diego County, participated in a
    regional Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice. The City will continue to implement
    the recommendations outlined in that Analysis.
    Eight-Year Objectives:
     6-A.   Del Mar will continue to contract with Del Mar Community Connections or similar
            agencies to assure unrestricted access to housing in the community.
     6-B.   The City will assist in program outreach through the support of Del Mar Community
            Connections to disperse information throughout the community regarding the shared
            housing and fair housing services provided by Del Mar Community Connections.
     6-C.   In the 2013 - 2020 Housing Element cycle, the City will continue to work with Del Mar
            Community Connections to provide services for the elderly and those with special
            needs.

C.       Summary of Quantified Objectives
Table 37 summarizes the anticipated affordable residential units to be created in the 2013-2021
Housing Element cycle through a combination of actions including: the construction of new
housing units, conservation of existing affordable housing units and the establishment of
additional affordable housing through implementation of the various Housing Programs
identified in this Section. The table includes a breakdown of anticipated units by income
category. These affordable housing units are expected to occur from implementation and
continuation of the actions listed below. The individual housing programs are described in
greater detail in previous parts of the section entitled Housing Element. A summary of the
programs is provided in Table 38.
    Programs:
         1. Development of vacant residential land, including projects with an affordable
            housing component;
         2. Construction of new Second-Dwelling-Units and/or conversion of existing non-
            permitted housing units to establish additional Second-Dwelling-Units;
         3. Land Use re-designation of two properties in the North Commercial Zone to a zoning
            classification that allows, by right, residential development at a density of 20 du/ac;
         4. Identification and designation of other appropriate locations for higher density
            residential development;
         5. Modification of the development standards of the North Commercial (NC) and
            Professional Commercial (PC) Zones to allow residential uses at a density of 20 du/ac;
            and
         6. Construction of dwelling units by the 22nd DAA on Fairgrounds property in the City of
            Del Mar to house lower income employees working at the property and to provide a
            potential source of emergency housing during the winter months.
In addition to the measures listed above, affordable housing opportunities will be continued and
expanded through the City’s Rental Subsidy and Shared Housing Programs.
Although there is the potential to provide additional affordable housing opportunities through
rehabilitation of degraded dwelling units, the potential is low due to the fact that the housing
stock in Del Mar has historically been well maintained.

New Construction
As shown in Table 37, the City of Del Mar has a remaining RHNA of 61 units for the 2013 - 2020
Housing Element period. Specifically, the City intends to encourage the development of second
units in the community. With the proposed changes to the second unit requirements, the City
anticipates construction of one Second Dwelling Unit per year.
Conservation of Existing Affordable Housing
Since there are currently no Housing Voucher (Section 8) assisted housing units or deed restricted
Second-Dwelling Units within the City, conservation of existing affordable units will come as a
result of legalizing existing illegal Second-Dwelling-Units and requiring affordability restrictions for
rental to very low and low income households. An estimated one unit per year will be
conserved. It is also assumed that 40 percent of these units will be rented to very low income
households and the remaining 60 percent to low income households.
Rent Subsidy
The City will continue to provide rental subsidies to eight households.
Rehabilitation
This City of Del Mar does not provide assistance for housing rehabilitation.
The following table, #38, contains list and brief description of each of the Housing Programs
previously described in greater detail in this Housing Plan Chapter. Table 38 also identifies a
timeframe for implementation, as applicable, for each of the Housing Programs along with an
identification of the agency responsible for implementation of the Program and the anticipated
funding source.

Jurisdictions may adopt local definitions for first-time home-buyer programs which differ from
non-federally funded programs.
Floor Area Ratio (FAR): The gross floor area of all buildings on a parcel divided by the net lot
area of the parcel. FAR is usually expressed as a numerical value (e.g., a building having 2,500
square feet of floor area located on a lot of 10,000 square feet in area has a floor area ratio
(FAR) of 25%. [Note see Del Mar Municipal Code for regulations and definitions relating to:
“Land Area Net” for purposes of calculating a property’s allowable floor area.]
Group Quarters: A facility that houses groups of unrelated persons not living in households (U.S.
Census definition). Examples of group quarters include institutions, dormitories, shelters, military
quarters, assisted living facilities and other quarters, including single-room occupancy (SRO)
housing, where 10 or more unrelated individuals are housed.
Growth Management: Techniques used by a government to regulate the rate, amount, location
and type of development.
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA): The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires larger
lending institutions making home mortgage loans to publicly disclose the location and
disposition of home purchase, refinance and improvement loans. Institutions subject to HMDA

HOME Program: The HOME Investment Partnership Act, Title II of the National Affordable Housing
Act of 1990. HOME is a Federal program administered by HUD which provides formula grants to
States and localities to fund activities that build, buy, and/or rehabilitate affordable housing for
rent or home ownership or provide direct rental assistance to low-income people.
Homeless: Unsheltered homeless are families and individuals whose primary nighttime residence
is a public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping
accommodation for human beings (e.g., the street, sidewalks, cars, vacant and abandoned
buildings). Sheltered homeless are families and persons whose primary nighttime residence is a
supervised publicly or privately operated shelter (e.g., emergency, transitional, battered women,
and homeless youth shelters; and commercial hotels and motels used to house the homeless).
Household: The U.S. Census Bureau defines a household as all persons living in a housing unit
whether or not they are related. A single person living in an apartment as well as family living in
a house is considered a household. Household does not include individuals living in dormitories,
prisons, convalescent homes, or other group quarters.
Household Income: The total income of all the persons living in a household. A household is
usually described as very low income, low income, moderate income, and upper income based
upon household size, and income, relative to the regional median income.
Housing Problems: The HUD definition of a household with a housing problem is one which: (1)
occupies a unit with physical defects (lacks complete kitchen or bathroom); 2) meets the
definition of being overcrowded; or (3) spends more than 30% of its income on housing costs.
Housing Subsidy: Housing subsidies refer to government assistance aimed at reducing housing
sales or rent prices to more affordable levels. Two general types of housing subsidy exist. Where
a housing subsidy is linked to a particular house or apartment, housing subsidy is “project” or
“unit” based. In Housing Choice Voucher (formerly Section 8) rental assistance programs, the
subsidy is linked to the recipient, who is free to use the voucher where there is a landlord willing
to accept the assistance. This type of subsidy is said to be “tenant based.”
Housing Unit: A room or group of rooms used by one or more individuals living separately from
others in the structure, with direct access to the outside or to a public hall and containing
separate toilet and kitchen facilities. Same as: Dwelling Unit.
Housing Choice Voucher Program: A tenant-based rental assistance program that subsidizes a
family’s rent in a privately owned house or apartment. The program is administered by local
public housing authorities. Assistance payments are based on 30 percent of household annual
income. Households with incomes of 50 percent or below the area median income are eligible
to participate in the program. This program was previously known as: Section 8 Rental Housing
or Section 8 Voucher/Certificate Program.
HUD: See “U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).”

Income Categories: Five categories are used to classify a household according to income
based on the median income for the County. Under State housing statutes, these categories
are defined as follows: Extremely Low (0-30 % of County median); Very Low (31-50% of County
median); Low (51-80% of County median); Moderate (81-120% of County median); and Upper
(over 120% of County median).
Large Household: A household with five or more members.
Manufactured Housing: Housing that is constructed of manufactured components, assembled
partly at the site as rather than being constructed entirely at the site. Also referred to as:
modular housing.
Market Rate Housing: Housing which is available on the open market without any subsidy. The
price for housing is determined by the market forces of supply and demand and varies by
location, type, and condition.
Median Income: The annual income for each household size within a region that is defined
annually by HUD. Half of the households in the region have incomes above the median and half
have incomes below the median.
Mobile Home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is at least eight feet in
width and 32 feet in length, is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a
dwelling unit, either with or without a permanent foundation, when connected to the required
utilities.
Mortgage Revenue Bond (MRB): A State, County, or City program providing financing for the
development of housing through the sale of tax-exempt bonds.
Overcrowding: As defined by the State Department of Housing and Community Development,
a household with greater than 1.0 person per room, excluding bathrooms, kitchens, hallways,
and porches, is considered overcrowded. Severe overcrowding is defined as households with
greater than 1.50 persons per room.
Overpayment (aka Cost Burden): The extent to which gross housing costs, including utility costs,
exceed 30 percent of gross household income, based on data published by the U.S. Census
Bureau. Severe overpayment, or cost burden, is where gross housing costs exceed 50 percent of
gross income.
Parcel: The basic unit of land. A designated area of land established by plat, subdivision, or
otherwise legally defined and permitted to be used, or built upon.
Physical Defects: A housing unit lacking complete kitchen or bathroom facilities (U.S. Census
definition). Jurisdictions may expand upon the Census definition in defining units with physical
defects.

upon moving from the project.
Public Housing: A project-based low-rent housing program operated by independent local
public housing authorities. Low-income families apply to the local public housing authority in the
area in which they want to live.
Regional Housing Needs Statement (RHNS): The Regional Housing Needs Statement represents
the regional housing plan for the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) region. The
RHNS is based on State of California projections of population growth and housing unit demand
and assigns a share of the region’s future housing need to each jurisdiction within the region.
These housing need numbers serve as the basis for the update of the local jurisdiction’s Housing
Element. Same as: Regional Housing Needs Assessment.
Rehabilitation: The upgrading of building previously in a dilapidated or substandard condition
for human habitation or use.
San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG): The San Diego Association of Governments is

needs such as transportation, personal care, housekeeping, counseling, meals, case
management, personal emergency response, and other services preventing premature
institutionalization and assisting individuals to continue living independently.
Single Room Occupancy Unit (SRO): Housing consisting of single room dwelling units that is the
primary residence of its occupant or occupants and which contains either food preparation or
sanitary facilities, or both. For acquisition or rehabilitation of an existing residential structure or
hotel, neither food preparation nor sanitary facilities are required to be in the unit to qualify as
an SRO, provided the building contains sanitary facilities that are shared by tenants.
Small Household: Pursuant to HUD definition, a small household is a household of two to four
non-elderly persons.
Special Needs Groups: Those segments of the population which have more difficult time finding
decent affordable housing due to special circumstances. Under California Housing Element
statutes, these special needs groups consist of the elderly, disabled, large households, female-
headed households, farm workers and the homeless. A jurisdiction may also choose to consider
additional special needs groups in the Housing Elements, such as students, military households,
other groups present in their community.
State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD): The State Department
responsible for housing policy and programs in California. HCD establishes the guidelines for
                                                                                       City of Del Mar

act (California Government Code Section 66410 et seq.).
Substandard Housing: Housing which does not meet the minimum standards contained in the
State Housing Code (i.e. dos not provide shelter, endangers the health, safety of well-being of
occupants). Jurisdictions may adopt more stringent local definitions of substandard housing.
Substandard, Suitable for Rehabilitation: Substandard units that are structurally sound and for
which the cost of rehabilitation is considered economically warranted.
Substandard, Needs Replacement: Substandard units which are structurally unsound and for
which the cost of rehabilitation is considered infeasible, such as instances where the majority of
a unit has been damaged by fire.
Supportive Housing: State law defines “supportive housing” as housing with no limit on length of
stay, that is occupied by low income adults with disabilities, and that is linked to on-site or off-site
services that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her
health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community
(California Health and Safety Code Section 50675.14).
Supportive Services: Services provided to residents of supportive housing for the purpose of
facilitating the independence of residents. Some examples are case management, medical or
psychological counseling and supervision, childcare, transportation, and job training.

movement of homeless individuals and families to permanent housing. California law defines
"transitional housing" and "transitional housing development" as buildings configured as rental
housing developments, but operated under program requirements that call for the termination
of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some
predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less than six months (Health and Safety
Code Section 50675.2).
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD): The Department of the Federal
Government responsible for housing, housing assistance, and urban development at the
national level. Housing programs administered through HUD include Community Development
